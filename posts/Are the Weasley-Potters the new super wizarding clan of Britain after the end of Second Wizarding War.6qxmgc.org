So I was going through what the characters did after the end of Harry Potter novels and honestly thought that the Weasley-Potters are super over powered. Hermione becomes the Minister of Magic, Harry Potter becomes the Auror Head. Ginny is a famous seeker while Percy is another huge guy in the Ministry. Ron and George are maintaining a huge successful business. My Question is isn't the family kinda ultra powerful and famous. Are there any Next Gen fics which nerfs the power of the Weasleys. Honestly having so many important positions in one family is weird and opens doors to nepotism


** Yes, and here are some of my assumptions:

- Our characters were NOT saints to begin with. Harry was quite proud crucioing Amycus Carrow near the end of DH. Hermione had a huge vindictive streak such as keeping a slanderer in a jar for several days and permanently scarring fellow students. Ginny's aggressive and mean streaks were well described in Book6. Ron was ready to kill Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe.
- Wars hardened and changed people, especially when you were tortured and saw your friends and families die. You wouldn't be lenient toward your enemies, who also turned out to be sadistic and genocidal maniacs.
- Politics are inherently dirty, more so if life and death struggles were involved. According to JKR, our heroes made it to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic within several years. You shouldn't expect them to be 'innocent' children anymore, but cunning and ruthless politicians.

Based on the above assumptions, here is what I think would happen after the War:

The Battle of Hogwarts created a huge power vacuum as a result. Not only did most Voldemort's Inner Circle and Death Eaters go down, even the Ministry's own forces had to be decimated since Minister Thickness himself was drafted to the frontline. This Battle had to be so bloody that JKR skimmed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/54c4y9/battle_of_hogwarts/d80mg1b/][those gory details]] mostly. By default, the DA and what remained of the Order became the only credible and organized military after the Battle.

Harry had to be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would get themselves organized and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. The Ministry would be in no shape to resist their wraths.

I think their entire generation was fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. Many more traumatized people of magical Britain would also demand massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major shortcoming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

After the First War, the public went easy on Voldemort's sympathizers, and watched where that led to. But as the phrase 'Fool Me Once, Shame on You; Fool Me Twice, Shame on Me!' goes, they would more likely to go overboard this time. Harry and his friends, in their zeal to prevent the rise of another Voldemort, might have created a much more controlling government as the result. Harry apparently was very successful in his job, since he became the youngest police chief ever in 2007. He seemed to often fight on the front lines himself, and would have earned the loyalty of his troops. It would not be too far fetched to consider Aurors to be his private army.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?

******* I've been outlining a story that actually has that as background information, somewhat.

My Harry Potter ends up as a professional criminal, taking down Dark Lords and corrupt governments by striking where it hurts the most: their bank accounts.

But since he's Harry "The-Boy-Who-Lived-Also-Vanquisher-of-You-Know-Who" Potter, and has the blind eye of the Minister, he gets away with it.

*** We can potentially see the making of a new Sacred Families group in future. Potter,Weasleys,Longbottom, Scamanders etc. Honestly the Next Gens fics are pretty bad. I can see Grandma Molly's dinners being the new power center in the Ministry. It's like Useless Weasley to mommy: Mum I want to be an Auror just like Harry

Mum: Ofcourse you can ask Uncle Harry, there is no one better suited to be an Auror than a Weasley/Gryffindor/Lion.

Uncle Harry: "Thumbs up". There's always space in the Ministry for another Weasley/Potter/Gryffindor.

Honestly If I was there I would like to see how many Slytherins made the Ministry after the war.

**** Divide them up, find common ground and come to terms with less resolute opponents, pit them against each other.

For those who would not come to terms, frame them, use sting operations, set your own crowd after them, and arrange 'accidents'.

A successful regime should always have an apparent moral high ground. Propaganda would be crucial. Emphasize concepts that appealed to the masses.

If you had the loyalty of the troops and control of the media, it would be very easy to achieve above goals.

However, ultimate legitimacy and loyalty still required that people's lives were better off than before. A regime built solely on fear and intimidation was not sustainable. Our history was full of such examples.

******* No. Hitler was a bad example. He was bent on genocide and world conquest right from the beginning. His "Mein Kampf", written in 1923, already said everything he had done later. Unfortunately, that book was not translated into English until 1937.

Also, Germany's recovery from the Great Depression was achieved through massive government deficit spending and one of the largest rearmament programs in history. Between 1933 and 1936, German Wehrmacht conscripted more than 3 million soldiers, enough to remove most unemployed. If Germany hadn't gone to war by 1939, it would have gone bankrupt in early 1940s.

******* Adolf Hitler is NOT a good example.\\
He ruined his country even before he started genociding and conquering around. The Anschluss allowed Germany to (barely) survive economically through Austrian gold, and the plundering of half of Europe allowed it to keep going.\\
A Hitler without the 'bad' elements (conquest and mass murder) would be remembered as Mugabe will, only not as long-lasting.
