I'm currently writing a fanfic where after Bellatrix escapes Azkaban, she tries to switch to the 'light side'. I still want to keep her in character, what with her ideals in using dark magic and so on, but how would she act? How would she treat Harry, Sirius and co. if she chooses self-preservation over being a follower of the Dark Lord? What things would change and what wouldn't please? How do I make this a great slowburn romance (which will progress through the years)?

Btw, set in the beginning of Harry's fifth year.

Thanksies!


** Ok, so, this is kind of a lot of big questions. I can't be too specific because I don't have your story in front of me, but here we go.

The way I see Bella, She was raised in an ultra conservative family where she was told, from day one, that she was special and better than everyone else and she believed it. She went to Hogwarts and wasn't treated like the superior being she believed herself to be. Then she met Lord Voldemort, who told her that she really was special, but no one could see it through all the mud in the blood around them. She latched onto him. She got her power and she liked it.

It's difficult to change your morals, that alone could take years. But through constant exposure to people from outside her ‘superior' social group and having someone she can ask about things without fear of judgment would help. I'd assign Molly to that roll. (There could be some good comedy in Molly explaining basic concepts, like sharing, to Bella, who's trying her best, but just doesn't get it.)

Honestly, I think she Would choose self preservation. People with power are terrified of losing it and will generally do anything to hold onto it. But if the options are death or living with your muggle-loving cousin until you can get back on your feet, very few people would actually choose death. Though, I don't think she wouldn't be quiet about her displeasure.

Have you ever seen American History X? That might be somewhere you can look for inspiration about ‘switching sides' from one extreme to another. Though it is about racism and being in prison. It's not a light and fluffy movie.

A starting point for her opening her mind a bit, could be one of the good guys going out of their way to save her, maybe getting injured in the process and her not really understanding why they didn't just let her die.

I find that trying to understand a character's motivation and beliefs are a good way to figure out what they would do differently in different situations. I can't help you with the slowburn romance, that's not really my jam

** Most people in my opinion have a hard time understanding why bellatrix is deranged in the books. The primary reason for it is cause of Azkaban, the only way to keep your mind with that much exposure to dementors is by obsessing over something she obsessed over Voldemort and the cause. The easiest way to begin changing her character is by changing the obsession to something like her loyalty to family. So really her character is dependent on if she went to Azkaban and if she did how long.

What if she started to break when Andromeda ran away?

What if Cygnus, Druella and Walburgha punished Bellatrix for Andromeda's wrongs?

What if Voldemort saved Bellatrix from her own family and that is why she sees him as a saviour as the man with the answer? The man who saved her from the hell that was her home?

Sirius made it clear that he was being beaten. What if Bellatrix was too for protecting her sisters?

Why didn't Narcissa join the cause if she believed in blood purity? Was it because she saw the way her oldest and dearest sister (Especially after Andromeda ran) was broken by that very same belief?

**** Then it simply comes down to how you want to write her character. I personally do t remember where it was implied or stated that Sirius was beaten outside of fanfiction. But like I said it comes down to how someone wants to write her character. Naricssa not joking the death eaters even when believing in blood purity purely means she's not a fanatic and realizes the muggle borns have their place. As for being broken in a abusive household given I honestly doubt that would have happened abused people don't typically become deranged killers. I also don't see why it makes any sense for bellatrix to be punished for andromeda's wrongs.

***** The running away while he was sixteen and the abusive language from Walburgha's painting and kreacher. The fact that a house-elf (Which should be loyal to it's master by magic) could participate in getting him killed.

Quite a few serial killers had abusive childhoods. Now that is not a casuistic connection but it lends to the narrative.

On the notion of why Bellatrix would be punished for Andromeda's wrongs? That is a typical pattern of most homes. The oldest shares some of the responsibility for the younger siblings.

That isn't fair necessarily but the combination of age (sometimes) equaling maturity makes it an opportunity for the oldest to learn some responsibility whether it is through playing with their younger siblings or looking after them while Mum or Dad is out of the house.

Of course this is purely taking that responsibility to the logical extreme and combining it with a supposed black school thought on punishment (The meaning might have gotten lost in cultural translation. A Black school is a translated name for a type of educational institution which was prevalent in my country during the 1900's where corporeal punishment was seen as the best way to raise children. I digress) in the Black home (Pun equally intended and unintended) would lead to Bellatrix taking a rather sinister punishment for not keeping Andromeda on the straight an narrow.

This is all conjecture from WAY too little evidence. We are given maybe 500 words worth of knowledge about the Black Family in the seventies and gaps are being filled by just that hypothetical information.

That is usually how you would work a case study in psychology. You would try to find the most plausible explanation based on whatever information you have got leading to asking the right question.

If I had Bellatrix (The canon version) in for a diagnostic interview. I would definitely start at her childhood home and then further moving on to Azkaban to try and find out some of the factors for her current condition.

Or it might all be nature and she was born to be mad and insane. Everything is genetics and no amount of social nurture had anything to do with her fanatical way of life.

Either way I don't know if there even are a "correct" answer. I have tried to explain my thought process and how I came to my conjecture by whatever limited information I had. All in all you are correct when you said "Then it simply comes down to how you want to write her character". However, I personally think that a good story doesn't break the base material (Canon, Wizarding World/Pottermore) and just write whatever we want. If that was the point then write your own character instead.

** The problem is, she doesn't have much characterization other than "pure blood fanatic", "obsessively loves Voldemort", and "sadistic"- none of which lend themselves to being on the good guys' side. Possibly some sort of psychiatric disorder relating to lack of emotional control/emotional volatility as well- I don't know the best diagnosis, and its debatable how much of her apparent instability is a product of her time in Azkaban. Its also possible, given that she supposedly taught Draco Occlumency*, that she has more emotional control when she needs to than is immediately apparent.

Its important to remember, though, not to make her just generically "crazy" (far too many female characters get shoved in that box), or stupid- she's evidently quite intelligent, given her magical ability and how she saw through Snape's duplicity well enough to force him into an unbreakable vow.

The easiest way to "redeem" her given the little we know about her known characterization that I can think of is to simply have her switch the subject of her obsessive love from Voldemort to someone on the good side, with her adopting her new crush's views on blood purity as well. But I worry that might be kind of sexist as a basis for her character arc. Unfortunately, as I said, Bella doesn't have much established character to work with.

Edit: A couple other things-

1. Bella seems to admire power. I may be reading too much into it, but if this is the case its possible that someone who rivals Voldemort's power might gain her respect or admiration.
2. Bella seems to have a strong sense of loyalty/duty in general- I base this on both her loyalty to Voldemort, and the fact that she went into a "good pure blood marriage" and stayed there, despite her seeming lack of interest in her husband (admittedly we don't see much of their interactions).
3. She's definitely not a coward- to the point of having a reckless disregard for her own safety, at times.

If she was motivated, either by love or respect for a great power, to transfer her loyal to someone on the other side, she'd be a potentially immensely valuable asset, given her magical prowess, intelligence, and wealth, as well as inside knowledge of the Death Eater. However, she'd also likely be difficult to control, especially if she retains her tendency toward sadism and emotional volatility. Its unlikely her usual tactics and spells would sit will with anyone in the Order- even those who occassionally use dark spells, like Snape and McGonnagle, don't seem to relish them the way Bellatrix does. Bellatrix doesn't seem to be terribly subtle in combat- she's not the person you use for covert ops, she's the person you use when you want someone to go on a murder spree to terrorize your enemies. And that's not really how the Order operates, nor am I convinced they would benefit from operating in that manner (it would cost them support of some of their members and antagonize the Ministry, while not really deterring the Death Eaters because they'd still be more scared of Voldie).

​

*While Snape IIRC suspects Bellatrix, I think it more likely that Narcissa was the one who taught Draco Occlumency, given their relationship and the fact that she was able to fool Voldemort about Harry being alive in Deathly Hallows.

**** Harry/Bellatrix is a very hard plot to make work, for two reasons.

First, of course, there's the age difference. That's not an issue (to me, anyway) as long they're both adults and capable of consent, but that means Bellatrix has to live a good deal longer than she does in the books.

Secondly, there's the history. If the point of divergence from canon comes after she goes to Azkaban, then she's already guilty of, at minimum, being a Death Eater, and participating in the torture of Neville's parents to insanity. Harry is canonically an immensely forgiving person, but there are limits. And even if he's prepared to forgive her, Neville probably isn't, and Harry values that friendship.

I could actually see Bellatrix becoming infatuated with Harry, with a little squinting and a few assumptions about her personality (underdeveloped as it is)- mostly because he's one of the few Wizards (the other being Dumbledore) who can compare to Voldie in power and status. And there's a certain symmetry in light side Bella being drawn to Voldie's light side foil. But realistically, it would probably be a one-way attraction (much like her attraction to Voldie, actually, Cursed Child aside- and even in Cursed Child, it comes off more as her being used to achieve an end rather than Voldemort actually having feelings for her).

I think its very, very important that her redemption should not be a result of Harry or anyone else falling in love with her- you can't change someone by loving them, sad to say. The redemption has to come first (preferably before she kills Sirius), then the romance, for it to work.

Its easier to do, frankly, if its before her involvement in the Longbottoms' torture as well. That's a hard crime to forgive. But if you're set on her changing only after she's been in Azkaban, then I think it would be a stronger story if you face that head-on. A lot of authors would try to let Bellatrix off the hook by minimizing her role in that crime, or trying to handwave it away by saying she was under the Imperius or something. But that's just evading the issue, and in a very obvious way. I think to make a Bellatrix redemption really work, you have to have her face up to her guilt in that atrocity, to own it, and to try in some way to atone for it (even though there is no way to really make up for something like that).
