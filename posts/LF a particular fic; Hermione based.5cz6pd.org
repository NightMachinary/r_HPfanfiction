I actually don't remember the pairing or even if the single scene I can think of is actually Hermione. (Though it's probably Hermione/Severus, due to the sheer number of fics of that pairing I've read.)

The scene has Hermione(?) returning to the Room of Requirement some time after the final battle being accompanied by Slughorn and someone else (Snape?) The fiendfyre has gone out and ashwinders have left eggs and they've gone in to both collect eggs and to gather the ashes/body of Crabbe. The characters end up finding Vincent Crabbe's ashes/charred body and the character has a panic attack.

Any help is appreciated.

*** The link was purple where I'd clicked and read it before. After a quick look through, it's definitely the one I was looking for.

Thanks!

  Hermione and Severus find themselves lost and struggling after the war, but in very different ways. Can the memories of a dead man bring Hermione clarity? Can the voice of a girl lead Severus to a decision? Or together can they hope for something more? COMPLETE
