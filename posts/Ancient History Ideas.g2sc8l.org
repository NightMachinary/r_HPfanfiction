I am looking for ideas for historical events that could be written as the result or one side of a magic-related catastrophe.

I am horrible at history. By far my worst subject. I am focused on the period from 900 BCE to 1500 CE, mostly in the Mediterranean region, but far east Asia and south america are fair game as well.

Current focus is Alexander the Great and the Library of Alexandria, but that is not very wide reaching.

Any ideas are welcome. Can be historic, pseudo historic, or fully mythological. I look forward to researching your favorite snippets of history even if I don't end up using them!


** The Roman empire was built over politics, military and logistics.... but what if the Senate was in fact the Roman Wizarding society? After All romans took magic and religion very seriously. Hundreds of years filled with pottential stories there, my favourite Two: the destruction of Cartaghe (another empire led by Wizards) and the Vesubius' eruption

**** Well you could say Plato was a wizard and work around his times, or using him to narrate the "history of the heroes", the classical greek Heroe's tales but intertwinned with the Potterverse.

** There is Mount Vesuvius' eruption in 79 CE which completely killed the population of Pompeii. The early days of the Bubonic Plague could have been has rough to the wizarding population as it was to the Muggles since I think it was the first plague introduced to Europe, but I'm really not sure. This isn't pre-Early Modern history, but we know there was an epidemic of Dragon Pox in wizarding Britain during the First Wizarding War which did kill Fleamont and Euphemia Potter. There was Atlantis and all that story, but I think it's way too old for what you're searching. The Mongols failed abyssally when they tried to conquer Japan with both time the elements battling them and two hurricanes destroying their fleet.

That's all I can think for now on the top of my head.

** Fucking goddammit I had a post written up with a bunch of good ideas and sync just decided to close randomly. Fuck this app.

The gist of it was this

- The bronze age collapse was caused by undiscovered goblins, whose species was born deep, deep underground and was unaware of the surface digging out all the copper from below, making the only available metal be bronze scraps, brittle tin or unworkable iron.

- Stars in many ways resemble life - they reproduce, they live, they have a metabolism, they grow and shrink, they evolve and die. Add magic, and they turn into titanic, living sources of not just radiation, but also arcane energy. One of them, the sun, pelted the earth with chaotic bursts of wild magic and caused life to form in the primal waters, and until the chaotic magic from the sun stopped lashing out at the solar system, no planet could develop its own magical presence

- Magic use in humans came from neanderthal DNA mixing with homo sapiens DNA, these magical humans then passed down the gift through their species and across the entire world

- Magic use as an expression of the mind and soul came to be because all matter, even that living creatures are made of, is essentially Stardust. Stars being the first magical entities in the universe, some fragment of their unfathomable power is still contained within this matter, allowing humans to manipulate and channel their inner energies and the unique magical presence of the planet and system they occupy.

- Astronomy is useful because the entire universe is comprised of a magical network based on symbolism, myth, legend, culture and ideology created by the sapient magic users of a myriad species all working to imbue dots of light in the night sky with meaning

- Other astronomical phenomena like pulsars and black holes have measurable magical effects, and are useful in this degree. By for example invoking a pulsar, you can create an enchantment that measures time by its interval.

- The Maya studied magical transportation and built an archway, as well as a controller device that would allow them to create a portal to elsewhere in the universe. They used it to flee from some unknown threat, and the arch was discovered by a group of magical conquistadores. Instead of preserving it, they fiddled with it and succeeded to open a portal, but destroyed the controller in the process, creating a connection that was only an entryway, with no exit anywhere. A paradoxical hollow tube that has only one hole at the top, and sort of just stops in midair. Only that midair is whatever place outside of existence the tube runs through. What appears as a veil over its surface is really distortions of the air as it comes into contact with the charged event horizon of the portal. The whispers are anyone's guess.

- They also stole the secrets that formed the foundation of european magical transportation. These secrets were so advanced and based on such complex arithmancy and astronomy that the people who derived floo travel and apparition from it were like children in the sand. Those two are basically hacked-together parts of like ten different distinct forms of travel, all of which would be comparable to phoenix travel.

** Slightly early but the great Bronze age collapse 1200-1150 BCE (?). Most of the major Bronze age civilizations ended in a few decades. Weirder still, a bunch of ones in the new world ended in the same period.

Vaguely remember one in Mexico that was pretty much the ashes of their cities being swept into the garbage, which also happened in at least one of the Med ones.

** Not sure if this is exactly what you want but there is an abandoned story ~61K words called Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDUCK that explains the end of the dinosaurs when the great Eagles carrying their dead liege the Elder Dragon into a Volcano in Mexico.

linkffa(834)

There's another story that I can't think of the title that had Harry discovering (what was already known to the aurors) that the fidelis charm/ward had caused several airplane crashes. Often enough that the aurors had a short hand notation to designate the "magic" cause of the crash. With this info Harry devises a way to find fidelis protected homes and actually get around the protection.

When i get back i'll take a look to see if I can find it.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations

**** Well I found it. Harry discovers a secret of the Obliviators concerning magic and muggle airplane crashes. Due to this he figures out a flaw in the Fidelius charm. As it's name suggests it's a variation of a tome travel story. It's recently been completed ~95K words and is called Dapne's Letter from the Future by TomHRichardson

  AU. Two days after returning home from fifth-year classes and O.W.L. exams, Daphne Greengrass finds on her pillow, a letter from her much-older self. Included in this letter is a Muggle envelope addressed to Harry Potter from his much-older self.Daphne's letter reveals that elderly Daphne and elderly Harry, after each had outlived a spouse, got married. Marrying Harry Potter, elderly Daphne assures young Daphne, was the best thing to ever happen to elderly Daphne in her long life.Elderly Daphne also tells her teenaged self---Sirius Black's just-read will emancipates almost-sixteen-year-old Harry Potter and grants him the Lordship of the House of Black. In turn, emancipating the Potter Heir turns him into Lord Potter. Harry Potter gaining two Lordships means he'll need two wives. Young Daphne, why wait till you need a cane before you become betrothed to the best man in Wizarding Britain?This is an alt-universe GreenPot Harmony (H/Hr and HP/DG) story that bashes Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley.

I am currently re-reading one of my favorite stories, so I will check this out next!
