- Harry is sent to live with the dursley's while younger twin or brother stays with James and Lily (he might be called Mitchell or Charles)
- Lily is the muggle studies proffesor, and James may or may not teach duelling
- Harry is in slytherin with Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott
- Mitchell/Charles is in gryffindor with Ron and Hermione
- Somehow the black family/ malfoy's get Sirius out of Azkaban and he adopts harry becoming Hadrian Black or something
- Harry gets on the quiddich team and during one match Mitchell/Charles (the gryffindor seeker) pushes Harry (now Hadrian) off his broom and he falls like 50 feet (think the Hufflepuff match)
- Dumbledore dissmisses it as an accident and Mitchell/Charles and Ron spread rumors about how he can't even stay on his broom
- Draco and Marcus Flint arrange this thing where Slytherin House comes into the great hall in formation (snape is good in this one as well and he seems very proud of them)
- When dumbledore announces it was just an accident the slytherin's hiss and then marcus stands and says that they have attacked one of their own and Gryffindor should expect retalliation
- I dont know what year this happens in but i think the stone is involved

**** Did a quick search, the author of this doc is Jessiikaa15. Looks like the twins are Harry and Rosina. Not sure if this is the correct one you're looking for, but it popped up in my search...

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
