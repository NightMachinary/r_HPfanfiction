For example something like Voldemort slapping a spell away with his hand, a Stupefy or even something more powerful.

Dumbledore being able to wandlessly become invisible.

Voldemort apparating silently.

Things like this.


** I picture Godric Gryffindor deflecting spells like a Jedi. Maybe absorbing the spells and unleashing them on command.

Merlin was a (the?) master of time magic. The various Merlin's throughout history are actually the same person dicking around in the time stream.

Also, I don't think I've ever seen anyone use a simple portal ala Dr Strange.

** It's been done before. The ability nto sense the magicka of things and beings. Also the ability to even hide ones magicka from others. I imagine people like Dumbledore would find it amusing to and convenient sometimes but Voldemort would never do it.

** I'd imagine the greatest of wizards would be someone like Stephen Strange, able to manipulate magics most people have never seen or could imagine.

** I would imagine that they have vast reserves of magic and can defeat normal wizards wandlessly, and usually utilize incredible feats of transfiguration and charms rather than simple spells.

** I don't think people have more or less magic than others so I think it would be about affinity. Like Newt has an affinity with creatures, and Neville has an affinity with plants- maybe he could talk to them and they would do what he asked. Wizards can practice until they're so in tune with the magic that they don't need words or even gestures. Elemental magic skills would work well with this.
