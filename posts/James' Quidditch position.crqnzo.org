Where did the idea that James was a chaser come from? There doesn't appear to be a source for it in the wiki.

I could swear that in the books it said that he played Seeker. There was a scene where Harry and Ron found a photograph in (I believe) the Trophy Room of an old Gryffindor team and Ron saying that James' position in the picture meant he was the Seeker, but I'll be damned if I can find it again.


** So basically the books never say what position... a lot of people me included kinda think he's seeker especially since he is playing with a snitch his fifth year, but in that memory he said he nicked it so he doesn't say he's seeker. as a person above stated J.K. came out and said he played chaser, in an interview

And you are most likely thinking of a movie scene, because it is changed so that he is a Seeker in the movies (edit: you could also be thinking of a fanfiction)

*** With a bit further reading, I'm apparently mixing up two things.

The scene I'm thinking of is actually about Regulus (and takes place in Grimmauld place) - and then I somehow combined it with the movies where James was a seeker.

You're correct though: James playing with the snitch - which apparently happened more than once, otherwise why would Lupin even ask? - is also a factor.

  “He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice.

  Sirius and Lupin laughed.

  “I'd forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.

  “Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.

  “Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently.

** In an interview in the early 2000's someone asked JKR, and she confirmed he was a chaser.

** I think there's a scene in the first movie that shows his position on a plaque

*** that's it exactly and is where the confusion comes from. JKR saying outright that he played Chaser, but in the 1st movie, it's the scene right after Harry catches the remembrall and gets placed on the Quidditch team, Hermione says something about "it's in your blood" and hauls him and Ron up to the trophy room, and very clearly in the movie it shows James Potter on the plaque listed as the seeker for the team. Combine that with the scene showing James playing with the snitch reinforces that idea... I'm not 100% sure, but I'm reasonably sure that nowhere in the books does it ever mention James' position on the team. So technically the only canon reference to his position is the plaque in the trophy room in the 1st movie, but JKR has in fact stated explicitly that his position was chaser despite that.
