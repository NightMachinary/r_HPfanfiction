Hello

I'm looking for a fanfic I read that I never finished about Snape. It happened during the first Wizarding World War and I think it seemed to follow canon (not really sure though). I don't think it was on ao3 or ffn (at least I remember not reading it on these websites but maybe it was).

I can remember some scenes though such as one where James and Snape encounter each other in a lift in the ministry, or one in which Snape had to register the counter spell of the Sectumsempra. There was also a scene in which Voldemort and Lucius are discussing and V asks questions to Lucius about Snape ; Lucius answers an answer like "weird kid a bit recluse blabla I'm sure you know these types of kids" and Voldemort answers "Yes considering I was one too". I have no idea why I remember this conversation but it's just one of the vague memories I have about this fic.

I know I didn't give much details but thanks in advance
