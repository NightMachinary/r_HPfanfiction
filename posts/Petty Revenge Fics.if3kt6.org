Does anybody have any petty revenge fic recommendations? I'm open to anything ¯_(ツ)_/¯. I'd prefer a completed fic but that doesn't really matter. Thanks :)


** Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard by MazzyStarShip: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13065793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Bodacious-Bodyguard]])

It's definitely on the crackier side of revenge, but it is pretty petty. Tonks is temporarily demoted from auror work and poses as Harry's bodyguard for his fifth year. There isn't a chapter in this fic where I didn't laugh. The trio plus Tonks terrorize Umbridge, Draco, and Snape---it's incredibly well done, anything I say can't do it justice. The romance hasn't come into play where the story is at the moment, so it's no trouble if you're not a fan of Harry/Tonks.

  When Tonks is forced to go undercover as Harry's bodyguard at Hogwarts, chaos ensues. Who ever said that fighting Dark Lords couldn't be fun? Slow-building Harry/Tonks. Fifth year. Rated M for crude humor and a few adult situations.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.
