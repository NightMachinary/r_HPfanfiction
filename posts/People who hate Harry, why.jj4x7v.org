Not people who have different favorites, or make funny jokes about him. I'm talking about the people who legitimately hate on him because "he was too whiney", or "he was an idiot."

Like are you serious?

First of all, Harry Potter grew up in an emotionally abusive environment and carried that trauma for the rest of his life. He was then involved in many life threatening and dangerous situations in his early teen years, all of which he triumphed over.

They specifically mention the 5th book as "evidence" of him being whiney, y'know, the year where Voldemort was mindfucking him, had an asshole teacher mind raping him (from his perspective), was literally ostracized by the world he called home, and was being tortured by a fucking pink bitch. All while having to teach a bunch of kids, and eventually try to stop Voldemort /by himself/ because Dumbledore decided they shouldn't communicate.

His circumstances sucked, that was a big part of why the book series was so cool. He never gave up.

And as for being an idiot, there is something called perspective bias.

If you've read the books, you know how they end and hindsight is 2020. You already have the information, Harry didn't. He was doing the best he could do, you know, because he was /a child./ Some of these mysteries were practically impossible to figure out for him! How was Harry supposed to know the evil looking professor wasn't the bad guy at 11? How was he supposed to know Ron's weird (at the time) little sister had a possessed diary? How was he supposed to know that Sirius was innocent? How was he supposed to know the most /paranoid/ auror ever born (that he never met) was an imposter? And how was he supposed to know that Sirius wasn't in trouble? He never opened the mirror because he didn't want to get his godfather caught with Umbridge around, and once again, Dumbledore was not communicating.

All I'm saying, is don't call a teenager with ptsd whiney. We all make mistakes, and yes he made a few. For how it ended up, Harry did pretty fucking good.


** Honestly, it'd be incredibly concerning if Harry wasn't 'whiny'. Like, the guy had a metric fucktonne of trauma and shitty life circumstances - if he wasn't complaining about them, that'd be a reaction to be concerned about.

The idiot thing I can kind of see the point of, though. More in the case of poor decision making than not being omniscient, I'd say, but it's really just a relic of Rowling's slavish devotion to her plot above all other concerns. Lotsa characters dropped the idiot ball, really, due to her setting up stuff and not maintaining any continuity. I mean, they just found out that Pettigrew was a rat and could turn into one just fine (and Remus and Sirius had known that he could do this for years) but they all thought "Let's chain up the dude who can shrink at will" instead of doing something sensible like stunning him. And the Seven Potters plan was a fuck up on all counts since they seemingly forgot 'apparition' existed, or House Elves popping, etc. I think it kinda makes sense in Harry's case though - he's just a random jock in the wrong prophecy at the wrong time. He's not supposed to be a mental giant or a supersleuth or whatever, he's just a guy who wants to play quidditch and making him make stupid decisions is part of that archetype and, to a point, makes him a little more relatable.

*** Yup. Multiple Stunners, Petrificus Totalis, a Sticking Charm to mount Peters pasty ass to the wall of the Shrieking Shack and Bob's your uncle. Even better if they follow it up by taking his wand.

**** Indeed. Even better if they simply didn't chain him at all. Whoever it was they chained him to (Ron or Remus, I think?) can't remove the chains easily or shrink at will, so they're more of an obstacle to the other person than they are to Peter himself.

*** I disagree with the Seven Potters being stupid. The first chapter shows Voldemort discussing the fact that they need for Harry to come in the open while he's being moved. Moody then later says that it's an inprisonable offense to use magical means of transportation at 4 Privet Drive. They worked with what they had considering that there were dark wizards at the edge of the wards waiting for them. It's just that they did not expect as many.

Edit: before you jump the downvote bandwagon I suggest you read the books. OP clearly either forgot or he/she hasn't read the books because it's clearly stated why the whole seven potters had to happen, especially since the initial plan was for Moody to take Harry by side-along-apparition.

**** I don't disagree with your observations, just your conclusion (I also upvoted you from zero, 'cause you bring some good points despite my disagreement).

Firstly, the illegality of magical transportation. I mean, they're vigilantes who share confidential data from their government jobs with other people they probably shouldn't and actively operate as a vigilante group attacking and killing people (they're killing terrorists, sure, but the Order was definitely still not-of-fully-authorised-legality) who basically controlled significant portions of the government and media at that point (many of whom also did so in the previous war, where they didn't seem to follow the Death Eater practice of wearing masks). So, chances are, most of what they were doing was illegal and disapproved of by the Voldemort-directed administration already. Peter Pettigrew probably knew who most of them were, so it's not like there's much hiding in anonymity. Yeah, they wanna avoid painting a target on their back, but it's pretty much solidly there already.

Second, they could've moved earlier (yes, the wards wouldn't have gotten their full use, but a stronghold you're trapped in is no stronghold at all - sieges are a thing we avoid for a reason, so sticking in a well-defended place until your back is against the wall isn't overly strategically sound), or done literally anything other than make a poorly armoured cavalry charge with no support. Could've used the seven-potters team to draw out the watchers and distract them, then have reinforcements on hand to surprise the watchers once they'd given chase - pull the full Helm's Deep.

Hell, could've gotten that expanded trunk Moody was hidden in and buried Harry a hundred feet below the property, then let the wards drop and the Death Eaters burn the place down, then come get him back up once they left.

Or, y'know, just cause a big distraction to get the watchers paying attention to something else, then have Harry walk out of the place under his invisibility cloak.

There's just a lot of other things they could've done than something so unsubtle.

You are right that I've forgotten anything specific though - the last time I read the books was just when the Deathly Hallows book came out. Like, for example, do we have confirmation they could actually detect an apparition? I wouldn't think they could, given how many times he'd have been pulled up for Apparating without a license if they could (eg. getting Dumbledore back from the Cave, basically half of the camping trip, etc).

***** OK... first of all, you're reading too much in what is supposed to be a children's book. Secondly, JK is guilty of many plotholes but the seven Potters thing was really well thought out. There could have been other options sure but they had to think really quickly since the moving date was changed at least less than a fortnight... and Voldemort was not supposed to know that Harry was being moved then.

****** Oh, definitely, big time overanalysing here. But that's part of the fun! I enjoy that kind of deconstruction and dissection immensely. Plus, I'm a D&D DM and a Psychologist, I can't really help it. :)

That is a very fair point on the time pressure - kinda hard to be creative on a deadline, I agree - but even if Voldemort wasn't supposed to know, you still have to think about and prepare for the possibility he would. That's real basic tactics.

I think the time pressure thing is a good explanation though and definitely renders the Seven Potters plan more understandable to me. Still doesn't make their plan an intelligent one - in my opinion, at least - but it gives them a good foundation for taking a bad plan. Needs must when Chronos drives, to paraphrase an old idiom.

******** You don't need a lot of people to pull a flanking manoeuvre. They just need a good position and a good aim.

Though I do kind of like the mental image of a squadron of Weasleys on brooms flying in like a wing of fighters in Star Wars. :D

** I agree. Lots of OOTP Harry haters have no idea about PTSD, or how they would behave under similar stress themselves. But they usually come around once these issues are pointed out. True empathy-less asshole psychopaths are rare.

Ron or Hermione haters are similar. They hang up on some character flaws and mistakes and ignore the rest

*** I'm just here to counter balance the way this was received in this thread. It's completely cool. People have their own tastes. If you like edgy Harry, that's fine. If you like canon Harry, that's cool too. I love both. I like canon Harry. I can understand and empathise with him. At the same time, while I don't prefer edgy Harry fictions, if I find a well written one, I'm more than happy to read it. It's fanfiction, we don't need to adhere to what's there. We're there to explore possibilities and further our own imagination.

** I don't know for others, but as much as I acknowledge how hard his life could have been if this wasn't a fiction, he still has a character where he dodges serious discussions and refuse to talk about his feelings. This might have to do with his life's issues, but this is something repelling in itself. All these times where Hermione is quite right about stuff but he says nothing because he doesn't want to get involved/doesn't know what to say annoys me a bit. I know men like that and they also annoy me. It is only about his personality, it is a trait that many people have in real life, but still annoying. Concerning everything you mention I agree that he did quite well for such a shitty life.

** What is it with this sub and making posts to shit on other people's opinions? If you have something to say about someone's opinion, make a comment on their post.

It's very easy to argue your point when you make your own post so the people you're arguing against aren't around to comment. Much easier when you don't have to point to any specific person, and can instead just collate all the worst parts of the opinion you're ranting against, and imply that you're actually talking about a real person rather than a strawman.
