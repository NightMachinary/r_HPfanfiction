I'm happy to say that while the HPfandom has slowed slightly, it hasn't really had any effect on fic-prodution. This also means that many good new fics are overlooked. I'd like to know the best ones published in the last six months, or even the most promising ones. Thank you!


** Surprise it hasn't been mentionned, but I'm following linkffn(12278649) very closely.

It's a sequel of Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux, which is definitely one of the must-read fiction.

I don't know, Accidental Horcrux just isn't for me. Like linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) just isn't that great for others, but I love it.

*** This is possibly the only well-written fic recommended here (possible exception for Accidental Animagus) and you're at -1 points?

Admittedly, it's getting a bit of a stretch to call Accidental Animagus 'up and coming', but it's still one of the best fics out there. I vigorously second this rec.

** Last 6 months are IMO the best period or HP fanfics, here are some new WIPs I'm following closely:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][The Accidental Animagus]]. That story is getting better and better, combined with humor and suspense. Draco's character development is one of the best I've seen among HP fanfics. The bad guys are scary and yet their interactions are hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is a super hilarious variation of the 'Read the Books' trope, and its own plot is picking up steam.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is a pretty good 'Ginny in the world of Fire and Ice' fic. Generally speaking, HP magic was overpowered for that world, but it's fun to read curb-stomps from time to time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425), is explained [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5w7uze/promotionbecause_you_asked_for_it_i_wrote_a/][here.]] I hope the author continues.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684), has canon Ron reborn in a different universe. He faced great challenges because almost all key female characters were taking on very different, if not inverted, roles. I'm feeling really sorry for this Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], a Star Wars crossover. This story is a SG1 crossover and features heavily on the theme of civilization/empire building. Seeing Hermione and Luna wielding light-sabers and throwing Sith-lightening is quite fun. [[/spoiler][The author has decided to make Daniel Jackson a Force sensitive in recent chapters]]

--------------

I expect following great WIPs to be finished this year:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), is very close to conclusion. It seems Harry has to resolve one more pesky social problem before this story arc will be wrapped up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is already in [[/spoiler][post Voldemort era]], but the power struggle continues, and the plot remains compelling. The author updates every week.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is also on home stretch. The author is now updating one chapter per month.

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** Here are the most popular 4 from the list of the most promising fics that I've collected in the past year.

- *linkffn(11898648)* is probably the best Runes based story out there, and while it has a large number of tropes in it, they are almost always done in the right way. One criticism I have is that the writing is so very cheesy at times that I have to put the story down and take a small walk to drive away the cringe from my brain before I continue reading.

- *linkffn(12058516)* probably has the longest chapters in all of fanfiction, which is why its a bit intimidating to read at first. But once you ease into it, it works out to be a very decent and very ambitious story with great stuff about politics in it. Its not perfect though. Its slow, sometimes painfully so.The first day of Hogwarts come to an end at around 100k words after all.

- *linkffn(11950816)* has the strange concept of a character's life turning into a game. The quality is bad at start but it improves exponentially pretty soon, and this story's Dumbledore is one of the best cases of GreaterGood Dumbledore I've ever seen. Not even I as the reader know what to think of him, which is a great compliment in my books.

- *linkffn(11825585)* is one I have polarising feelings about. On one hand its one of the most epic fics I have ever read with very well constructed ideas, some nice trope subversions, and padded out characters. On the other hand, I genuinely don't know where its going and I suspect the author has written him/herself into a corner.
