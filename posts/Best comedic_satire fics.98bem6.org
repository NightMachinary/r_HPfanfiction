** Well, I have a lot of fics for such occasions.

I can't recommend Slytherin Harry enough -

Linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry do? by Big D on a Diet)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do]]

This one is a really humorous series. It has gems like - " Snape, it can safely be assumed, despised children. Most teachers do, but Snape had elevated it to a state well beyond normal boundaries. With his rather /unique/ training in certain areas of magic and absolutely nil instruction in the area of teaching, Snape was to education what Voldemort was to life insurance. It had been eight years since the last official complaint against him, which said much for his campaign of intimidation."

Linkffn(Mistaken Identity by Silver Pard; A Mistaken Sorting by Silver Pard)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2861750/1/Mistaken-Identity]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2870906/1/A-Mistaken-Sorting]]

Some really cool and humorous oneshots -

Linkffn(Voldemort's Secret Weapon by Senyor Fier Mensheir; To Enrage a Teacher by Padawan Jess Kenobi; And Bits of Fluff by Teufel1987; Not as Advertised by sasahara17; The Marauder's Howler by Brain Fluff; Revenge is Sweet by Janara; You're A Wizard, Little Us by slayst; Community Service by Balthanon; The Easy Way by Kolarthecool; Misundertood by Madrigal-in-training; Harry Chooses Stonewall by HarnGin; Ruthless Revenge by Yunaine; That Potter Boy by BadgerInMySoup; Functional Blood Protection by Right What is Wrong; Helpful Hints for First Years by BajaB; Skewing the Odds by Ruskbyte; The Wendell that wasn't by opalish; What if Harry had said by dbzdragonlanceman; I'm His Favorite! Me! by Madrigal-in-training; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard by HalfASlug; Albus Dumbledore, Accelerationist by Right What is Wrong)
