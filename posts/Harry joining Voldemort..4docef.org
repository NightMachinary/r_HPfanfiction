** Are you planning to keep Harry and Voldemort the same as canon?

I ask this because I find it hard to believe Harry would join Voldemort without some sort of change from canon. That said, I've read some fics in which Voldemort is portrayed as sane and fighting a political battle to keep the wizarding world a secret from the muggles. Usual issues that cause Harry to support Voldemort center around protection of muggleborn children and removal from abusive homes. This is a topic important to Voldemort and Harry due to their pasts. Dumbledore is known to disagree and believe that family is important and to leave children in abusive homes. This could be the disagreement that separates Harry and Dumbledore, without Dumbledore being manipulative.

*** Sorry, I should have specified this in the post. Voldemort won't be the insane mass-murdering psychopath he tends to be portrayed as. My original thought was more along the lines of what should be done to him, or what elements of him or other characters that would make Harry joining Voldemort make sense, and not be totally random.

Some examples might be, say, if Hermione, Ron, and Ginny abandoned him, or something like that, would he turn dark? Or would it require something more like a traumatic character-changing event (maybe something like the Dementor in The Lie I've Lived except bringing the Horcrux out to play and change harry instead of James.

Another example may be that in The Graveyard, Wormtail is punished by Voldemort for treating Harry cruelly and instead of torturing, and attempting to kill Harry, Voldemort attempts to win him over.

**** I've seen examples where Harry is betrayed and sent to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. Personally, I'm not a big fan of that storyline, but it does work as Azkaban will change Harry's character. Your horcrux example could work too. Either Voldemort realizes Harry is his horcrux and seeks to protect and work with him, or the horcrux exerts an influence on Harry's personality.

My ideal storyline for this is to change Voldemort's character. To go into detail about the motives behind his war, to turn it into more of a political battle than killing muggleborn, etc. Then it is reasonable for Harry to support his politics naturally. This could come out in a graveyard scene if Harry realizes that Voldemort is not how he has been told by the light side. I can picture Voldemort explaining his politics and goals to Harry. And the Death Eaters in the Wizengamot being used to further his goals through legislation. Harry has always blindly accepted the light side's statements as fact, without knowing anything about the wizarding world beforehand to make his own opinions.

Anyways, hope that helps!

He is disillusioned, confused. Voldemort reveals more secrets. Harry becomes more and more disillusioned with his side and understands the 'truth' about the world he lives in and joins Voldemort.

**** I like the graveyard idea. You could also play up the Weasleys' casual racist/intolerant of muggleborns and halfbloods angle, especially when its just them and Harry. I can see them saying things casually that Harry would take as offensive towards Hermione and his mother, forgetting because Harry is a hero that he isn't a pureblood himself.

I'm fairly certain that all the 'muggleborn champions' in canon - the Weasleys, Dumbledore etc. are all actually purebloods themselves.

Canon Voldemort always seemed to me like someone who assimilated into a culture that he wasn't born into but which was still his by birthright - but also someone with a terrible youth in the muggle world. We don't see much of him portrayed neutrally, but we do know that he went back to the orphanage in his school holidays - you could make the argument that he was an extremely gifted wizard who nevertheless lived in both the magical and muggle worlds. Consider Hermione as a counterpoint to that - she seems to leave the muggle world behind in favour of the magical one entirely, and in the epilogue of DH, all the characters seem to be living in the magical world with magical jobs. Another weakness of canon is that we have no positive muggle characters at all. So you could argue that what seems to be Voldemort's ideology is in fact mis-represented to Harry by Dumbledore and perhaps by the Malfoys, who might be on the more extreme end of it, and to whom Harry and Ron take a personal dislike which will colour their perspective.

For example, maybe Ron and or Hermione catch Harry practicing dark/illegal/dangerous magic and report it to a teacher. The teacher asks them to stay after, Harry casts some sort of magic to allow him to eavesdrop and hears something like "keep up the good work we cant have Harry falling to the dark" which he interprets as them having been spying on him for a long time.

** linkffn(Hit the Ground Running) does this very realistically with only one small change, which is that the Dursleys are slightly more cruel than in canon. After Harry frees the snake at the zoo with his accidental magic, his aunt and uncle keep him in his cupboard for a few days longer than they do in canon, with no meals. Starvation causes Harry to retreat into his own head, where he encounters the Horcrux, which is then able to follow him back into consciousness and start talking to him.

They have a falling-out when it's revealed Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but since he's stuck in Harry's head there's pretty much no choice but to find a way to get along. Voldemort is also Harry's only source of comfort at the Dursleys', he'll at least talk to Harry and answer his questions. He explains the murder by saying they were on opposite sides of a war and people die in wartime. He explains his political ideology to Harry as "wizards should be separate from muggles" and when he points out how the Dursleys treat Harry because he's different, ten-year-old Harry agrees with him. When the birthday letter comes, Voldemort tells Harry to hide it quickly and then they sneak away to London, so there's never any Hagrid meeting or anyone explaining how things work except Voldemort. Things spiral from there.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort won't be the insane mass-murdering psychopath he tends to be portrayed as.
#+end_quote

You want to stick as close to canon characterizations as possible, but that's a pretty big change. Fortunately, there is a canon way around it: instead of having Harry absorb his horcrux, get Voldemort to do it.

Premise: Riddle wanted to change the magical world (more equality? more advanced? better protections from muggles? some combination), but was smart enough to recognize that it would take a lot of time to shift long-entrenched interests and customs. So he needed more time to live and see the changes through. Sadly, he chose to use horcruxes, which drove him insane. He always knew that his agenda might have to turn revolutionary and somewhat violent, but as he went insane, the violence became the goal, not the reluctantly used tool.

Story:

1. Graveyard happens as normal, but Voldemort gets the horcrux back - plausible, if it was an accidental horcrux stuck to a vessel that wasn't properly prepared. The soul piece may have been just itching to get reattached. Doing it when the wands connect seems like a good time, and if it's distressing enough, Voldemort is put out of action long enough for Harry to escape.

2. Voldemort may not have been sane enough to notice getting worse as he made more horcruxes, but the sudden and even violent reattachment of the soul piece is noticed. Despite still being rather insane, he's still smart enough to realize that he's in a bad situation. He feels enough improvement to recognize that he really, really needs the rest of his soul. It will be painful and require remorse, but he's a Dark Lord, dammit, he can do it!

3. Lots of changes ensue, the most immediate of which is what to do with his minions. Most joined Insane Voldemort, but More Sane Voldemort doesn't actually want genocidal thugs representing his revolutionary movement. Getting rid of Malfoy is easy, but what about the rest?

Problem:

It's been noted that Harry is unlikely to just accept rational arguments to join Voldemort, even if he is more Riddle now. A slower progression makes more sense, but the above would make that harder. But you have a great shortcut: Hermione! After all, any good, rational arguments would appeal to /her/ even more than to Harry - and she might listen, too. Prepare the way by shifting her to being more questioning of authority generally and "The Light" specifically. During 4th year, she can discover that house elves have been cursed to be slaves, something that "The Light" accepts without question. They can't be easily freed, but perhaps the curse can be countered (you'll need to explain Dobby, though). It's also easy to depict her as angry that Harry was put through the tournament.

All of this can create a foundation where she'd at least consider the possibility that Riddle isn't a genocidal maniac, or at least not anymore. He might learn about her and her relationship to Harry from Draco. He could send her some anonymous books over the summer. During 5th year, Harry becomes even more estranged from the Ministry and Dumbledore. At some point, Hermione learns that the stuff she's been reading were Riddle's original manifestos for change, written before he went completely bonkers. She doesn't agree with all of it (heck, even Riddle might not anymore - some of it was written when he was still at Hogwarts), but she doesn't find it distasteful, either. At some point she learns the true origins of the material. She doesn't immediately join him or anything, but he points her to independent resources where she can research his claims and ideas. Maybe that happens during the summer after 5th year?

I could see the Ministry battle still happening - after all, wouldn't Riddle still want the prophecy? And it's a way of getting rid of some of his less savory thugs, too. How to do it without alienating Harry may be tricky.

During 6th year Dumbledore reveals information about Riddle/Voldemort, but what if Harry knows enough now to realize that Dumbledore is being very selective in what he's saying - half-truths, which is par for the course with him. Canon Dumbledore is manipulative, there's no two ways about it. He has to be - he's a politician and a general during wartime. But if you make him sincere in his belief that Voldemort can't be saved and that his agenda is simply horrible, then he's not an evilly manipulative Dumbledore.

Well, that's as far as I can get off the top of my head...

**** The title doesn't ring any bells, but the author's name is familiar. I may have read it at some point and some of it stuck with me.

*** This would make an amazing Hermione centric story as well tbh, the only problem I am finding is how to convert Hermione reading his stuff to that stuff influencing Harry. Maybe have Harry talk to her conflicted about whats going on and her offer perspective?

** You really have to give us more details. Do you intend to keep the canon early years and have Harry join him later? because that's kind of hard to see. But if you make it an AU - where Harry was sorted into a different house, or where he has much more resentment of the way he was treated during childhood (which he can blame Dumbledore for) - it would be much easier and believable.

Sadly, I don't know any /good/ fic that has done this.

*** I would like to keep it canon, or mostly so, up to Dumbledore's death. Unfortunately, it seems that may be either impossible or nearly so while still making it believable.
