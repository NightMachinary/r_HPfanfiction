** Where Hermione is a massive Mary Sue who's amazing at everything with no flaws and is basically the god of magic and exposition because she read some book about that once in between her correcting that red headed death eater guy that nobody really cares that much about because he's probably fucking his sister to love potion Harry who is even better at magicalness and politics than "Mione" because he's serious and powerful and being a pure blood gives him unfathomable wealth and power but for some reason it doesn't happen to other puree bloods because he's the descendent of Ghengis Khan and Charliemenge's incestuous daughters cousin who killed Merlin or something but nobody else knows this because Dumbledore (Bumbleydoor) and his insert poorly thought out nickname for the order here have conspired to hide it from him except for tonks because shapeshifting chicks are hot and the author really wishes he could bang mystique transformed into an anime character but he can't because he's trapped inside real life and hasn't figured a way to enter my little pony legally in his state but back to potter who might as well be a eugenics test to assure neonazis of the superiority of the Aryan race at this point also has anger issues and overreacts with powerful accidental magical killing intent whenever someone says something bad about his harem usually in the great Hall so that there's an awesome in spired scene and a Dumbledore is useless part and Harry is usually some sort of anti sex guy or something even though he's 17 or something and wants to wait for marriage like the author says he is but it's really because he hasn't had a date in years and hasn't kissed a girl since his mother passed which isn't the case for Harry because his harem makes sure to be as helpless as possible whenever on screen but very powerful off screen which has always weirded me out and made me assume that the author is actually just repressing his furry fetish and secretly lusting after Squirrel Girl because he likes being dominated in the dark.

** Heram! Oh dear god, just... Harry could like that sort of thing, but due to how society is in those days and even now, it is not something that EVERYONE would like.

Independent Harry! Oh, yes, an eleven-year-old child who has lived in a cupboard will be able to make money making changes to his finances and be go around finding extremely powerful magical items such as a house in a chest or some magical familiar. NO, HE IS ELEVEN OR FIFTEEN, HE IS NOT DOING THAT!

Sympathetic Slytherin house! Salazar can be sympathetic and mostly did the Purist things to protect the wizards from prosecution and have the basilisk there to protect the school... BUT Slytherins, the main group of Slytherins from Hogwarts, are not nice.

Harry is heir to ...! Okay, Harry in canon is heir/descended to The Potters, The Youngest of the Brothers, and the Blacks. No one else. The only way he is Heir to someone else is if they add that in their inheritance. You can have a creative way of doing that like Harry becomes the Heir to Arthur if he draws the sword from the stone, or if something else like that happens, but not having him be heir to every famous being because of reasons.

Other countries are superior! Yes, another country could be a bit more progressive with their policies or something like that, but THEY WILL NOT BE SOME ADVANCED CULTURE THAT LEAVES THE UK IN THE DIRT! No super advanced America that can fix eyesight and kill Horcruxes or so progressive they have Magi-tech, IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY!

I have more but these are the ones that stand out the most.

** I hate abused blubbering mess Harry. I'm fine with kicking the crap out of Harry if it makes him snap and kill people or go dark or even run away or whatever, but when the author writes an abused teenager acting like a five year old, complete with cuddles and teddy bears, I get a bit offended.

Whiny Draco. Yes, Draco was a spoiled prat with mummy and daddy issues. He was not five.

Ok, I just realized that everything else I was going to say could be summed up very easily. I hate reading about children acting below their age. I have an 11 year old brother. I'm a stomp team coach at a middle school. I know how 11-17 year olds act, and if the author makes them act too young, childish, etc, it bothers me.

**** I'll be honest, I am a huge Snarry reader. Hell, I /write/ Snarry. So I think part of my issue is that you have to have a mature Harry if you're going to pair him with an older character. Having abuse that causes mental age regression, and then having any interaction with a character that I usually (personally) view as a partner, it wigs me out. Also, I am and I know enough abuse victims. While I know that there are cases where an abuse victim suffers so much abuse that they revert to a younger "safer" age, I've never met anyone that that has happened to. I can't relate to it at all, and I highly doubt that the author can either.

On the flip side of that, I have read a few fics that portray abused or after-war Harry as having obvious PTSD. Most of these read very accurately, and are very relatable to me.

** Well, to be fair, the Founders were probably as important for magical progress as Guttenberg was for literacy. So its kinda understandable that people would make them out to be (inter-)national paragons.

Personally, I loathe bashing. Especially overly stupid bashing of Ron or the Weasleys in general and most of all the manipulative Dumbledore who for some reason has everybody fooled /but/ a 14 year old "Lord" Potter. I mean, if you want tot write these people as the villains, go ahead. That is what fanfiction is for. But if I read Dumbledore musing about how he "needs to bring Harry back to the light, for the greater good" and then proceeding to do everything to alienate Harry, I'll drop the fic and block it in my browser to remind me what a shitfest it is.

Another little pet peeve of me: Muscles gained from Quidditch. While I can subscribe to the notion that flying a broom requires some good core muscles and probably also some strength in the arm, its not exactly a full-body-workout. If you want your Harry to be athletic, with a sixbag that makes any hetero woman drool, then choose some other reason than "he flew a lot on his broom".

Last one: Magical Cores. I can see why people want to restrain the HP magic system in some of their fics. But I find the Magical Core to be a lazy and uninspired solution. It gets especially stupid when it goes into Anime-esque areas of powerlevels and Shonen-like level-ups.

#+begin_quote
  Merlin was some guy who made magic available to anyone who could use it
#+end_quote

I directly quote the wiki here:

#+begin_quote
  Merlin was born sometime during the medieval era. During his formative years, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,...
#+end_quote

So we can deduce that Merlin wasn't the first magic user and he also didn't bring it to the "lowborn wizard". That was the Founders doing. Those 4 bound together to build a school, and here one has to remember what that actually meant. A school in the middle ages was a huge deal. Monasteries and Clerical Colleges were basically all there was next to individual education through mentors and tutors. Building a school in that time meant also building the intellectual hotspot of an entire culture, maybe even for a continent since it would take around 200 years until Durmstrang was founded and another 100 years until France got Beauxbatons going. To put that into perspective, about the same amount of time was necessary to make Bagdad and the entire Euphrat and Tigris region such a intellectual powerhouse that disciplines such as Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics,... directly trace back much of their fundamentals to that era. Its reasonable to say that Hogwarts was to the magical world what the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom]["House of Wisdom"]] of Bagdad was for the medieval world.

So, for all intents and purposes, the Founders were as big a deal as Merlin in the HP lore.

I agree to the rest. Although bashing sometimes makes me laugh.

Magical cores are just stupid. There's no better way to remove 'magic' from HP's magic. I'm willing to put up with it if the rest of the fic is good (and if there's not too much of the part about the power levels), but it is always cringeworthy. There's better ways to show that your character is more powerful than usual, I reckon.

Have a list of people other than Lavender, including Hermione btw., giggling from canon then:

--------------

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harrys amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.

--------------

I dont mind them dead, said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. I just dont like the way they move.

Hermione giggled.

--------------

The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.

--------------

What do we want to be prefects for? said George, looking revolted at the very idea. Itd take all the fun out of life.

Ginny giggled.

--------------

Oh, what rubbish, said Hermione impatiently. Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else dyou think

That cats got it in for Scabbers! said Ron, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle. And Scabbers was here first, and hes ill!

--------------

Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.

What? said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.

Hes that tall, good-looking one, isnt he? said Angelina.

Strong and silent, said Katie, and they started to giggle again.

--------------

And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it. It didnt help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.

--------------

Im not putting them on, said old Archie in indignation. I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thanks.

Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.

--------------

He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snapes back.

--------------

Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.

--------------

The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.

Lairy fights, thats the one! she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.

--------------

Myrtle! Harry tried to shout but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.

--------------

There they are, there they are! she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.

--------------

Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. Scarlet woman? she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.

--------------

He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled.

--------------

Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.

--------------

Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.

Oooh, who tried to get upstairs? they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.

--------------

Dont ask, Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled.

--------------

Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles. No because well it sounds like grunting a lot of the time.

--------------

Assuming they can understand you, of course, said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.

--------------

Potter and Chang! screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. Urgh, Chang, I dont think much of your taste. At least Diggory was good-looking!

--------------

And what about Ron? said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harrys robes.

--------------

Oh yes didnt you know? said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.

--------------

She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice.

--------------

Yeah, Im really going to tell you, because its your business, Potter, sneered Malfoy. Youd better hurry up, theyll be waiting for the Chosen Captain the Boy Who Scored whatever they call you these days.

One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle.

--------------

Id be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me, said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.

--------------

Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling,

--------------

A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.

--------------

Hes not long for this world anyway, if you ask me! said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sisters wheezing giggles. Look at him whats happened to you, then, Dumby?

--------------

Shes not that bad, said Harry. Ugly, though, he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.

--------------

The Orders got one thing right, then, eh? said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.

--------------

Excuse me? said Hermione, giggling. What was that last one?

--------------

Not so fast, Your Holeyness, said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, Here permettez-moi to assister vous, to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside.

--------------

Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons.

--------------

Hermione, we havent got anything to change into, Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.

--------------

But Im fine, said Lily, still giggling. Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.

--------------

Does he? said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. And are you tempted to join him?

** Murder-Hobo Harry, I deal with this enough in D&D I don't need Harry thinking that snuffing out a life is the best solution to everything.

  I'd have to go for the one where Harry goes to meet the founders (which are inexplicably as respected as Merlin for some reason) and gets awesome powers, owns Hogwarts (who is naturally a lady) and then gets like ten girls to go in his harem. I mean, they're POPULAR but I despise them. Anyone else?
#+end_quote

It was very nicely done in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]]), not the harem part, though. Completely subverted too.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** Character bashing. Dursleys, Dumbledore, Ginny, whatever, I find myself dropping fanfics in the blink of an eye if there's character bashing that turns them into one-dimensional screeching banshees and bumbling idiots.

I used to like them, but then as I grew up I realized that part of Harry Potter's appeal as an adult is that everyone and everything is so morally /complex/. I just can't bring myself to hate any character!

(Also, you know those dark!Harry fanfiction where it turns out that muggles and muggleborns are, in fact, wiping out the wizarding population with their dirty blood, and Voldemort is totally in the right? That too. Lil' bit off-putting.)
