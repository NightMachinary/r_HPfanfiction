Like a reverse self insert. It'd be funny if he goes out and finds platform 9 and 3/4 and it's got that fake luggage stuck in it and the Harry Potter store next to it.


** *Harry laughs mischievously.

"I'm so going to write a Snape/Vernon one."

** He's not going to be happy, losing all his friends and family.

Without a wand, his magic, if he still has it, will lose most of its potency. That's going to be super hard on a wizard.

He has little education and few skills to excel in this world. He might seek out JKR for help, but if she doesn't believe him, he will probably get arrested as a lunatic/stalker.

*** Tho, one does not actually need to write it about that, and leave it as a One-shot of Harry going 'wtf!', maybe transition into a 'Reading the Books' story (just keep the book text out of it)... and have him reacting to Fanfic Tropes/arguments... JKR tweet-retcons, Movie-Actors being much hotter than the "real" characters, Movie-Ron character assassination.

I would have him be older/adult, but not have him focus on 'woe is me, I lost everybody I love' angsting.

*** Were the combination of "wand", "potency" and "super hard on" in the same paragraph intentional?

** Harry Potter and the [Redacted].

Draco Malfoy and the Ferret Fetish (a fic which turns out to be entirely crack and no smut).

Maybe he only reads the first book and reckons he can write the fanfic without going through the other seven. He gets slammed by reviewers who insist that everyone is OOC and the plot is AU without anything changing.
