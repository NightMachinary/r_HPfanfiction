In many Six Year stories, Harry gets a waiver to learn apparition early for the security reasons. In this story he would get one also for his girlfriend (because obviously she is in danger as well). However, teenage romances don't last, so in two weeks Harry runs to the Headmaster for a waiver for another girl. And another one ...


** And Ron is like “Why in the world all girls in our year can apparate, and blokes couldn't?”

** Wouldn't the Ministry deal with such matters? They enforce the underage magic ban after all.

Which makes it even more hilarious since Harry would have to deal with a Ministry department, which is notoriously slow.
