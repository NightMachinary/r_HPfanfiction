/time stops/

"Now, you might be wondering how I ended up in this situation. Well, I should start at the beginning."

/A scene of Hogwarts pops up/

"A long time ago there was a very nice redhead named Lily and a not so nice -- but he gets better -- brunette named James. Anyways, they happened to fall in love. And when a mommy witch loves a daddy wizard very much... Ok wait. This might be /too/ far back. Let me start again."

/scene fast forwards/

/vcr fast forwarding noises/

/scene stops on 11 year old Harry walking through gringotts/

"Ah, there, that's better. Ok now, you see, everything goes back to this one moment when I said something incredibly stupid."

/Harry looks at Griphook, smiles, and says "Thanks for your help."/

"Yeah, that? You see that? That was stupid. O' course, I didn't know it at the time, but no wizard had thanked a goblin in 200 years. Things... Things quickly spiralled. And now I'm accidentally waging the second goblin war. Which, funnily enough, isn't actually the reason the ministry is chasing me. It's actually because we've been dressing veelas in skimpy outfits and having them sing as show girls to boost troop moral. The British are just angry they can't watch."

** "Well we should probably start at the beginning."

An image pops up of a redhead bent over a kitchen counter.

"TO FAR!"

The image fast forwards to a 16 year old strutting through diagon ally. A shit eating grin plastered over his face.

"See that handsome little shit? Yeah, thats me. 16 years old and already the most powerful asshat at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Or at least I thought I was. Oh, I should probably explain that. I'm a wizard, you see. Yeah like with magic and junk. The whole things over rated of you ask me but, hey, ladies love a little wand action from time to time." He snickered at his own bad joke.

The boy was unceremoniously knocked into by a burly wizard who rushed past him. The blow forcing him to stumble and fall. The image froze just as he was about to plow into a short blond girl who had just exited the book shop.

"You see that girl I'm about to crash into? Short, blonde, legs for days and as beautiful as the morning sun? That's Daphne Greengrass. I didn't know it then but I was about to meet the love of my life. I also didn't know i was about to meet the most obstinate, hard headed, self absorbed five foot three inches OF PAIN IN MY ASS that I would ever know! But that's not important. Our meeting? That was just a coincidence. What, you thought this was a love story? No my friend, This the story about how I became the leader of the world's largest magical drug cartel, sold millions of gallions of counterfeit art to the goblins and started a goblin war, and finally defrauded the largest bank in Paris. In just fifteen short minutes I will be running from Gringots BLEEDING FROM THE FACE and straight into the arms of the one woman who stood beside me through it all."

My name is Harry James Potter. So strap in fuck-nuts, because this shit is about to get weird.

** I'm a registered seer. I woke up in this body five years ago. Since then, I have been... informing (read as trolling) the magical world by sending pensieve memories of the future via the movies to the British DMLE, the ICW, and the Daily Prophet.

Voldemort may be gone right now, but boredom struck. Last week I had the whole Magical World grieving after I showed Dumbledore's death. Then, a riot broke out in Diagon Alley when Dumbledore showed up to buy his Sherbet Lemons. Apparently people thought he was a necromantic construct.

Last night? I sent out enough memories of Fudge to cause the "election board" to show up.

The joke is on them though, this is a muggle diner and next to me is an ICW inspector.

** Harry Potter turned on the spot, peering at the entire contingent of British Aurors that were all pointing their wands at him. Time stops. "Now, you might be wondering how I ended up in this situation," says Harry to the reader.

"Wel... It all started with a niffler..."

X amount of time earlier... What? This author is lazy and can't think of timey wimy stuff ok! Good. As I was saying, x amount of time earlier...

See Harry Potter, a little short, skinny teen of around 15, look at him, look at his messy hair, his glasses, no not Eye glasses as those Silly Americans call them but propper British glasses, anyway, his glasses, his eyes, green as... Green things... And his small hands.

Said small hands are about to rob a Niffler from the pet shop, pealing letters over the door say, 'The pet shop, because we couldn't be bothered with a fancy name...'

The story continues from there but I can't think of any way to string the events together.

They go a little something like this: As harry is running out of the shop with the Niffler, the woman, womaning the counter, yells after him, "It's not worth it you know. Little fucker tried to bite my finger off and all because of my ring!"

Harry finds ron and Hermione, Ron thinks it's Bloody brilliant Harry got the niffler, after all, the amount of gold and shiny things the little creature would steal would be huge, hermione... Well, she's just standing there smoking, cause she's going to fucking smoke and no one can stop her! Apart from her parents but they're not here now are they, muahahahahhaha /coughs/ ahahahaha!

So the niffler robs the ministry and people realise their stuff is missing, the niffler gets caught and Harry somehow is surrounded by aurors.
