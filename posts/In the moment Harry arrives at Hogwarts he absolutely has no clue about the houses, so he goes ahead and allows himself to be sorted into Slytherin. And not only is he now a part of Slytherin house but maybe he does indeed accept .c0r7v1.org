Of course we should have fun with this but it would be awesome if we could make this as realistic as possible. What would have happened if Harry had gone into Slytherin? And if Draco was his friend, would Draco have become a better person? Or would Harry have become a worse person?


** Harry getting sorted into Slytherin is one of the most popular story archetypes in the fandom.

I'm not sure if this prompt is entirely necessary.

*** the story archetype is either

1. badly written "manipulative" and "cunning" harry potter because he got abused at the dursleys
2. badly written harry gets raised by death eaters or voldemort or whatever dark wizard or witch and is dark himself and ofc AlL sLyThErInS aRe DaRk so he gets sorted into slythering
3. the occasional good fic that uses this archetype

​

this one actually has a good premise for harry to go into slythering and would turn out great imo. harry is raised by dark ppl , therefore dark , and all slythering are dark thefore harry gets into slytherin , or harry is raised by dursleys or abusive guardians therefore is manipulative and cunning arent decent tropes , they could be at best slightly decent if written well but at this point they're so cliche all the stories that use them are kinda meh.

**** I hate these fics where everything changed yet it's still the same. Like a Slytherin Harry where he is manipulative but : ○ He doesnt have good grades (in fact he is better than Hermione but he is hiding it because reasons ) ○ He still live in a cupboard and suffer the often worse than canon Dursleys' abuses (he is biding his time before finally showing them their place at his feet ) ○ Once at Hogwarts, he goes to Slytherin and befriends all the baby Death Eaters, but still saves Hermione at Halloween and become his best friend (because reason I guess ? )

Seriously, if you change a character, change the world around him accordingly. I want to read a Manipulative Harry where he is really a mini Riddle. Living in his own room before getting his Letter and his relatives being really afraid or wary of his "freakiness ".

****** Sadly, if such a fic exist, I don't know of it. Maybe "Harry Potter and the accidental Horcruxe ", which fit at least partly (finished, sequel in production ) but I cant think of others. In fact, because I cant find a fic like it, I thought about writing one, but while "maping " the ideas is easy , it should be finished around 2050 if I keep this rythme of writing.

** Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them)

Harry gets dropped off in a forest by the Dursleys and grows up in nature, talking to snakes and figuring out magic on his own. When he arrives at Hogwarts he's completely clueless, ends up in Slytherin with Draco but he prefers sleeping in a tree in the forbidden forest. Draco has to explain literally everything to him.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** My main problem with Slytherin!Harry is how rare it is for authors to actually diverge from canon in any way besides superficial (everything that happens in canon inevitably happens in Slytherin!Harry fics as well -- while understandable for the Tri-Wizard Tournament to remain which was probably years in preparation and completely unrelated to Harry, almost nothing else has reason to stay the same).

**** When someone write a Slytherin Harry (or honnestly any Harry that is different from canon), he should make a list of the events, and every time see if Harry directly influence this event or not, most (if not all) of the evenements influenced by Harry should change if he is himself different.

For example, no matter how Harry is, Mr Weasley would win some draw at the end of CoS, but if Ginny doesn't survive CoS, it is unlikely the family goes to Egypt, and so Sirius has no reason to escape Azkaban.

But, a Slytherin Harry has less reasons to go into the Chamber to save Ginny, since he should not ba as close to Ron than in canon. His relation of hermione should be different, meaning he may not know about the basilisk (in fact, Hermione would not even be friend with him, since his lack of presence in Gryffidor would mean that Ron either didn't insult her that day, or nobody saved her from the troll).

It's really easy (and annoying) to fall into Canon rehash with a different Harry.
