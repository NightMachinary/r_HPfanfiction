** H/hr is my favorite ship and pretty much the only fanfiction I'll read. I just like how their love is rooted in deep friendship and trust. They seem to flow together so naturally and seamlessly that it seems they were made for each other.

**** My absolute favorite is Harry Potter and the Fifth Element by bexis. It's huge in scope and length and amazing, but there are plenty of others out there that are good and fun as well. Coming Back late by Paracelsus and The Duelist by Hawkins are a couple examples of other quality fics.

** Hermione/Snape - so many ways to twist this into new shapes.

It comes preset with tension, societal pressures, a past that is open to interpretation... even without Voldermort in the sidelines there is already plenty to makes stories out of.

There is also often the shared attraction to the intellectual/complex characters of the setting. Writers who are into this pairing tend to be more mature and it shows in higher percentage of stories with good spelling and plausible plots. I only read other pairings by recommendation because compared to this one, they are a horror to sift through.

*** I like Hermione/Snape too, but I often dislike the way authors soften Snape's character. I honestly can't see Snape being very openly affectionate, and I absolutely cannot see him being a good father--not many fics I've read have them get married and have kids, but an alarming amount do.

**** Have same issues with most stories - Snape becoming soft gets boring to read fast. I prefer ones where he is self-controlled/cold/calculating almost all the time. Yes the canon doesn't really show Snape as that in any of the important scenes but I like to believe that he must have had it in him considering his position. Else, how is he alive?

Pregnancy for me is such a major turn off that anything more then a few paragraphs devoted to that topic is a show-stopper. Fantasy reading = escapism and the only people I can imagine wanting to escape into a pregnancy situation are ones who both haven't had to participate in one and are unable to adequately imagine everything one entails. (for anyone who doesn't know, they entail enormous amounts of liquid smelly shit mixed in with spontaneous urine and random spots of vomit all delivered randomly yet frequently 24/7 for months on end).

***** Along the same vein, Mpreg fics. No no no no no. Makes me ditch the fic almost immediately. And a soft and open Snape is one of my pet peeves.... if Snape had soft moments, they were extremely infrequent and only minor, split-second breaks in his facade, IMO.

***** Sure! I've not read a lot of SS/HG, and it has been a while, so I don't have many recs to offer, unfortunately.

I'm currently reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]] by Caeria, and so far I like her Severus (a warning, the fic is a WIP).

I'm also halfway through [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] by Loten (I can't help myself; I read multiple stories at one time!). This one is good so far, although her Snape is more damaged than cold (this may mean he'll soften towards the end, but I've heard this one at least avoids any children).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] by Kayly Silverstorm is a phenomenal read. It's incredibly long and intricate, but IMO very much worth a read (and maybe a reread).

I hope this was of some help--since SS/HG is not the ship I normally read, I feel less confident in my ability to rec the best stories out there. Best of luck! :)

I like to sub Lucius as well for a little touch of evil sometimes.

** These are my (somewhat long winded) explanations for the ships I enjoy:

My favorite canon ships are James/Lily and Lupin/Tonks. I love Marauder era fics, and I've always liked the hate turned love story that LxJ embodies. I enjoy any stories with Lupin, and I love how Tonks' youth and enthusiasm brought a little light into his life. Their love in my eyes is bubbly and sweet and stable, in stark contrast with several of my other favorites, and spawns stories that turn angst into in-character fluff.

My favorite noncanon ships are Draco/Hermione and Draco/Harry. Since Half Blood Prince, Draco has been one of my favorite characters, so I naturally enjoy ships featuring him more. Both of these ships have an enemy-turned-lover element, which I find lends itself to passionate love stories (my favorite kind!). Hermione is the contradiction to Draco's bigotry, and Draco is a person who, IMO, could nearly or even completely match her on an intellectual level (much more so than Ron at least). I find their relationship is one of facing prejudice and resolving conflicts. Draco and Harry's love story is one of overcoming their mutual hatred and opposite extremism. Neither are purely good or evil, and together I'd like to believe they could realize that.

***** Now that I think about it, I think I have found D/Hs that I like in the humorous pieces I read. They're more of guilty pleasures that I have to be in the mood for and sometimes I'm cringing at forced banter (and often, at the author's shrill characterization of Hermione), but I pretty much just enjoy a banter between them, as friends/people who have to put up with each other. I don't think I'd like them as lovers. It might also be because I stay away from fics with the main trio; I've read too much about them in canon, and any slight deviation is really noticeable, even in growth.

I too only considered that pairing as crack only but than I read God of the Lost and sort of started getting it a bit. Than Parade cinched it for me as viable. Though honestly, I haven't found much else that's good with that pairing.

** Hmm. Well, here goes..

Cedric Diggory/Daphne Greengrass.

Yep, she only has 1 line in the whole series, but I like the idea behind DG- she's a Slytherin but not really prominent within the circle of Slytherins that we encounter in the series. I like the idea of her being friends with Tracey Davis, a half-blood, and being sorta detached, somewhat aloof from the politics of blood relations, and more concerned with her own personal issues and ambition. Bounce that off of Cedric and you get something interesting.

** Harry/Hermione - Because H/G makes no sense to me. The way Harry is, it is very difficult to see him being able to pair romantically outside his close group of friends anyway, but Hermione seems so much better a match, and so less forced than H/G.

Harry/Ron/Hermione - The Golden Trio. Because why not have your cake and eat it? This is probably my favourite non-canon "pairing" but it's extremely difficult to find non-PWP examples.

Harry/Luna - Inspired by the way Luna comforts Harry. They are really well-balanced against each other, and seem to understand each other in a way that others don't get.

Neville/Luna - It's a bit [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares][pair the spares]], but I think it works.

Remus/Sirius - About as close to a canon slash pairing as you can get.

** Canon:

- Fleur/Bill - a part-Veela Triwizard Tournament contestant (so one of the most powerful, intelligent and beautiful people in the Wizarding world, basically) with the wizard equivalent of Indiana Jones. I don't understand how this isn't more people's OTP.
- Lily/James - for the same reasons that almost everyone likes them.
- Albus/Gellert - it's such a grand story, it spans decades (centuries, even) and it ends tragically. Twice.

I'll also occasionally seek out Romione, Tedromeda and Drastoria.

Non-canon:

- Remus/Sirius - possibly the most versatile ship I've ever come across, and to be honest last time I read the books they were more convincing than Ginny/Harry.
- Bellatrix/Voldemort - well it's sort of canon, but anyway. It's just a hell of a lot of dark fun.
- Luna/Harry - this is my fluff ship.
- Ginny/Pansy - I like dark!fic and lesbians.

I'm also up for non-PWP HRHr, Lily/Regulus, and a whole bunch of other ones I can't remember off the top of my head.

** I'm fond of Draco ships, particularly Draco/Luna and Draco/Astoria. For someone who grew up likely highly mistrustful of most people, I'm interested in what kind of relationships he'd pursue post-war. I like Luna because of the dichotomy, as they're both pretty set in their views of the world, but I think they would get along somewhat on an intellectual level, given the chance outside of their social spheres. She is just strange enough to get along with him.

Astoria is a blank slate but I like seeing what people do with her, since she /is/ who he eventually marries. Though for her, I'll probably always prefer my own headcanon, which is a pretty specific one of her being his psychiatrist. I like the idea that she's someone who facilitates much of Draco's growth but nothing that takes away his deep-set flaws, and she's enigmatic in her own right, which is my way of fighting the trope that Draco is the attractive one - I don't think that'd be true at all outside of Hogwarts.

** Canon: Ron/Hermione - Anything from Hermione's POV is usually comes from a more intelligent and mature perspective that avoids angsty emotional freak-out stuff and has a clear focus and narrative. Then you get the bottomless well of Potterdom that is the Weasley family, win/win.

Non-canon: Draco/Ginny - These are just fun to read as both characters are natural smartasses who constantly pick on each other. On top of that, you have the whole Weasley & Malfoy feud to play with. You simply cannot write this one without a tidal wave of drama from everyone on both sides.
