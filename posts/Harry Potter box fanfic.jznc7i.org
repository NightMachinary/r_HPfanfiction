:END:
My old phone broke and I had a HP fanfic that I really wanted to read on there but I forgot the name of it so if anyone knows it please tell me. It plays around the time of when James, Sirius and Lupin went to school and I think Sirius and Lupin get together in the process. Also it has something with a box in the title, and the fanfic has a whole website dedicated to it so I think it's pretty popular.

*** What a stupid website. Absolutely nothing on there tells me what project IS, so that I can decide if I want to read it. That makes the decision easy: no.

Yes, I followed the link that said "About Shoebox". It only told me who "specializes" in which character (whatever that means), and who did the handwriting samples.
