...and like an idiot I didn't save it or bookmark it. I need help finding it. I'm not sure if meta is the correct flair for these types of post but it made the most sense to me.

Anyway, the post goes like this: In the climax of the Order of the Phoenix, Harry chases Bellatrix to fight her after she ends up killing Sirius and Hermione follows him. Then Voldemort arrives and Obliviates Hermione saying she stole the magic she has and then Dumbledore arrives and the fight continues as it did in canon.

Please link it if you read the post and saved it unlike me.


** Wasn't this a YouTube video on how to make Voldemort as hated as Umbridge?

*** I believe the title of the video is “I made Voldemort as hate able as Umbridge” or something along those lines
