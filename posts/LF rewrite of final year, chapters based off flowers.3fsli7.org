I know this sounds really vague and generic, but there was a particular fanfic I read a few years back that was Harry/Draco, and each chapter was named after a different flower, and it was because each flower meant a different thing that was relevant to the chapter. It was veela!Draco, and it was basically a rewrite of their final year. I remember it being scarily well-written, but I want to see if my memory of it holds up to the truth. If anyone has any idea what I'm talking about, I'd love for some help in finding this particular fanfic again. I wish I knew more about it to find myself to be honest.


** I'd read that too!

** I definitely haven't read it, but you could try searching Harry Draco (random uncommon flower name) on google and see what comes up.
