What stories have you read or written which feature unusual characters as their antagonists? (Preferably /main/ antagonist, but I'm fine with a Voldemort still extant in the background as long as the new character is prominent.) This means both:

- Original characters, like Lady Pantera in linkffn(Animagus at War)

- Not-so-evil-in-canon characters who become true villains --- like some of those fics where Grindelwald isn't quite so repentant... Also, /if/ they are pulled off well, stories where /good/ characters become villains. /IF DONE WELL./ Keep your evil!Dumbledores to yourselves.

- Secondary canon villains promoted to major antagonists --- like my use of Barty Crouch Jr. in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor).


** Black Luminary features Professor Prewett who Harry loathes, and for very good reason. This isn't front and center, but he is still prominent. Although not a character, the "Pillars" (collection of Light pureblood families) are the main antagonists in this fic, which we still have a lot to learn about this AU.

The Mind Arts features in recent chapters an OC who Harry manages to piss off by speaking aloud a way to fool the Goblet of Fire. Her daughter overhears him and tries the method lobotomizing herself. Naturally she isn't too pleased. Grindelwald also is present in this fic but we aren't yet sure of his motives. Neither of these is too fleshed out (yet) as the fic is currently updating.

It has been a long time since I've read it but Renegade Cause has some interesting villains, albeit minor John Dawlish and Antonin Dolohov. Also the accompanying one shot /Speak Softly, Love/ is in my opinion the greatest one shot in the fandom, giving Dolohov incredible depth in a mere 25k words.

Firebird Trilogy and covens, although I'm sure you've already read that.

Hallows and Pathos has Hermione as the villain, no bashing.

You've probably seen them all before but they all fit and maybe someone else can benefit from them.

I'd link them but the bot is out to lunch and I'm on mobile.

Edit: Assuming no crossovers and must be HP fandom, else I'd recommend you the (Grand Admiral) Thrawn Trilogy beginning with Heir to the Empire.

**** Agreed.

I think what made him so likable as he really wasn't evil. Furthermore he didn't use fear (like every other baddie), instead gaining the trust and loyalty of his men.

I love the interactions between him and Captain Pellaon, he always treated him with the utmost respect, even when he asked questions that were elementary to him. Thrawn valued his subordinates, not throwing away their lives needlessly and made sure his punishments were just.

I really thought the way he died in /The Last Command/ it was a very fitting and perfect, believable way for him to die.

I'm not sure how you feel about the Thrawn in SW Rebels; personally I pretend it doesn't exist as I don't think it does Thrawn justice. Extended Universe will always be canon in my mind, Disney threw away a lot of good material.

In Summary: Thrawn was not 'eviiiiiil', he inspired loyalty without using fear, and was defeated in a non contrived way.

***** Well to be fair, Thrawn did use fear when he felt he needed to. The obvious example of the ensign in Heir to the Empire comes to mind. Or, for that matter, the clever ruse with the asteroids in Last Command.

The difference, I think, is Thrawn had a better understanding of when to inspire fear, and when to inspire loyalty. Unlike everyone else, by his very birth he had to work for his status (the empire's whole humanocentric viewpoint). This meant he required their loyalty, not that it was simply a nice thing to have as well.

**** Book Thrawn, not Rebels Thrawn.

Classic case of a character that was less amazing when someone tried to adapt them to a different genre.

**** Good catch, after a thousand fics one begins to forget these things.

I'm glad that you enjoyed it as well, it does show its age but I honestly really liked Renegade Cause; Nathan Cassane is a badass. It doesn't get much love around here for how good it is in my opinion.

**** Harry goes back in time to kill Tom Riddle. However things don't go as planned and Dumbledore is there to prevent him from killing Tom. Tom is then taken on as Dumbledore's apprentice in order to protect him from Harry killing him. Tom and Dumbledore's relationship is worth reading the fic for alone.

** ...Again I have to mention Sacrifices Arc (starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving_Connor][Saving Connor]]) ^^; I haven't read it in a while so my memory is a bit spotty, but aside from the usual Voldemort, there is Lily Potter (in cahoots with Dumbledore), Dumbledore's mentor Falco Parkinson, Evan Rosier, Indigena Yaxley, the Department of Mysteries, and others I'm forgetting. I guess Voldemort is the only one who's just evil, Rosier is more chaotic than plain evil, Dumbledore, Falco, and Lily are all trying to do good but with seriously, seriously questionable methods. Indigena is just honor-bound -- but no less spectacular. The Department of Mysteries just has its own agenda.

There are also various minor/situational antagonists like Lucius, Remus, Sirius IIRC -- and the whole wizarding world, sort of ^^;

***** There is this thing in the Sacrifices Arc called the phoenix web, which is a thing in the mind which controls your actions and thoughts. The distinguishing factor is that the phoenix web can only be put in /willingly./

Peter Pettigrew and Harry both have this in their minds. Pettigrew goes to Azkaban for rather compelling reasons and only manages to escape due to him finally breaking through the phoenix web in place. However the web is trying to reassert itself and before it does he manages to tell Harry a few things, revealing him as more than just a traitor.

If you haven't read the Sacrifices Arc I really can't recommend it enough. It is one of the best works in the fandom and is well worth the time investment.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569/chapters/12150143][Seven Names]] is a fic where Hermione is exiled for her crime (Contempt of Court/refusing to testify) and deals with the aftermath. The "antagonist" is the UAC, a panel of citizens tasked with judging and sentencing participants in the war after the Battle of Hogwarts. The trouble begins with that not only the bad guys did bad things, the "good" guys did terrible things as well.>! When Hermione is called to testify, she refuses in order to protect her friends, preventing them from facing justice, and is exiled as a result of this. Her return brings the original decision into question.!<The exchange between Hermione and the ministries decision is rather interesting and I thought rather well done.

There are quite a few valid criticisms for this fic, many of which have been discussed before but the writing quality isn't bad and if you haven't read it, it is worth a read.
