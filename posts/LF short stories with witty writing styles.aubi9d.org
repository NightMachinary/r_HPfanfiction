Not just sarcasm, I'm asking for intelligence and humour.

Witty banters between characters are preferable as long as it's not too OOC.

Are there any authors in this fandom with this specific style of writing? I would love to sample any of their short stories before I invest in long ones.


** Definitely give some of Jeconais short stories a read.He is on [[https://Fanficauthors.net][Fanficauthors.net]]

Also Blue Steel and White Knight, Grey Queen are very good.

** linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) is fun. I thought it went overboard with the writing, but it's short enough to be worth a shot.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  It was funny to call it normal, but life can be funny sometimes: that was what Lavender had said, and Dudley, who knew he wasn't very clever, was bound to agree with her.
