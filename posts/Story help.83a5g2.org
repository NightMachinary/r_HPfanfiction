I'm debating about doing a love triangle between Squib! Neville and my muggle OC Maia's best friend Xavier Coté(her older brother's best friend's little brother) who is also a muggle.

How do you write a believable love triangle? If I decided to go that way.


** Oh, this is in my wheelhouse.

Love triangles are very two-faced: they are compelling when written well, and the bane of many readers' existence when written poorly.

But most of the ones that I see are usually bad, or just plain boring. There are multiple reasons for this.

--------------

/The Don'ts/

*#1*

One love interest is markedly better than the other one is.

Picture it. Our heroine has two gentlemen in her life. One is a handsome billionaire with a Byronically tragic background; the other is her long-abiding best friend, whose most remarkable trait is his lack of mental instability.

(Gee, I wonder who she'll choose?)

*#2*

One love interest is markedly crappier than the other one is.

Similar to the first example, you have Generic Handsome McRich Guy on the one hand, then you have our heroine's boyfriend: a boorish cheater who disrespects her to the point that you wonder what's wrong with her for dating him in the first place.

*#3*

Another problem often encountered in love triangles is that both love interests are equally boring. They're just so cookie-cutter that readers cannot bring themselves to be interested.

*#4*

The love interests are great, but your heroine is a bland, helpless doormat with a sense of preservation on par with a wet kitchen sponge, and it makes no sense for anyone to want to be with her, ever.

*#5*

It's obvious which pairing the creator prefers.

Be it through short-changing the character development of one of the love interests, giving one guy all the coolest lines and scenes, or having the heroine automatically favor one over the other, pampering one love interest makes it immediately clear how the story is going to end.

--------------

Right, so that's the bad, but how do you write the good?

Well ...

/The Do's/

- Introduce suspense by making both love interests viable choices.
- Give both love interests good points and bad flaws.
- The heroine/hero should be genuinely suspended between two choices.
- Make the choice /hard/ -- picking one love interest shouldn't be easy.
- When the choice is made, it should /hurt/ in a bittersweet way -- the main character is happily in love, but another life has been closed off to them forever.

--------------

Now, I actually lied. Sorry.

The "Do's" are just guidelines.

You *can* go against them and use stuff from the "Don't's" list, but it's best to have written a few "Do"-style love triangles before attempting the trickier versions ...

... Like triangles where one love interest is chosen for good character, and the other has proven to be an awful person. These particular triangles work well when the main character first decides on one love interest, then switches affections later to the person who has more integrity. Example: /Pride and Prejudice/.

*** I feel the possible love triangle I might write has the same dynamic as the one in The Hunger Games

Meaning:

The best friend who grew up with the heroine (Xavier)

vs

A nice enough guy that is new (Neville)

**** Yeah, I think you'll be pretty safe since Neville doesn't fit the typical "new, intriguing, brooding rich guy" mold.

But there's another sort of pitfall you might face, a pitfall that's unique to fics: having an OC for a love interest. Readers might end up siding with Neville purely out of familiarity, or because it seems like he'll be chosen due to being a canon character.

***** Yeah, I can see that. Though, Xavier wasn't going to exist originally but I feel like I needed her to have a best friend since she won't reconnect with Neville until they are almost 14.

***** Love triangles are where two people like the same person and the third person has to choose. A TRIAD is a polygamous relationship. So not similar I'd say

*** That might be a bit OOC for Neville. He doesn't seem like the jealous type. Of course, this is an AU where Neville is a squib so maybe his personality is a bit different.

***** Yeah, that's true. Though, I think Xavier will be more jealous since he's closer with Maia (the main OC). She only met Neville once when she was eight. Though, he becomes her grandfather's (Marius Black) mentee. Maia and her family move back to the UK after her mum dies in 1994.

**** A triad can go two ways: one, the three members love and care for each other, so there's no jealousy, or two, they love and care for each other, but experience bouts of favoritism and greater understanding that imbalance the triad and require them to work through differences.

The first is good for when a romance is not the main aspect of a story, as you don't need to get any conflict from it. The romance provides support and stability to the main character(s) and has the people who always believe in each other.

The second is useful for more drama or when developing maturity in many ways. You can really give a fic complex themes by having characters discuss feelings and emotions and dealing with the struggles that can invoke.

A usual “love triangle” either ends in heartbreak/betrayal (for the member with unrequited love) or it destroys itself by introducing outside characters/influences completely to make the triangle irrelevant.

I have more experience writing triads than triangles. Feel free to PM me if you'd like more insight.
