Once again, he didn't sign up for this.


** Dude. This is a solid idea.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sat at the judges table, chin rested on his palm and his eyelids drooping dangerously as he drifted cozy and warm in the warmth of his warming charm. This was going to be a long day.

  He glanced at the wall of trees that at the border the Forbidden Forest--yes, Dumstrang also had a Forbidden Forrest.

  Once again an unlucky group of under-prepared teens had been sent in on a meaningless Task, and once again the contest itself was designed in a such a way that the "spectators" couldn't actually spectate the Task itself, but instead were huddled in seats watching the trees grow, while the contestants ran around in the woods, desperately searching for someone or something...

  Harry awoke sometime later to a sharp jab in the ribs and stern look by Headmistess McGonagall. He glanced, bleary eyed, to his right to see the other three judges were all holding up numbers: seven, seven, and eight.

  He sighed and calculated the contestant's score. The media had been fawning over him for giving the most fair, diligent, and precise scores, clearly never favoring any school over the others.

  With a quick bit of mental +math+ maths, he added up the scores, divided by three, and then held up a seven and one third.

  Everybody cheered.

** He just gives everyone 5's for everything in protest of being forced into this farce. in fact by the third task he doesn't even show up to judge, he just puts a bit of card with the number 5 on it on a stick and leans it against his seat while he goes off down the hogs head for some peace, quiet and a bottle of firewhisky.

  We all have skeletons, when the Triwizard Tournament is hosted at Hogwarts to 'boost moral' and 'remember Cedric Diggory' all of Harry's secrets start to come out as he struggles with running the school and the tournament, working with his ex, facing a life changing injury and falling for his best friend! AU AFTER DH. Harmony. M for language and sexual themes!

  One shot, AU of GOF. Here's the story I wish I had found when I read GoF or GoF fanfiction. New, harder tasks. Observant!Smart!Harry. On the outs with Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts in general. No pairings.
