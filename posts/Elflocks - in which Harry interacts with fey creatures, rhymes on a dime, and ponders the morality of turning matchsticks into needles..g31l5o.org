#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has non-human blood. In childhood, he is contacted by his kin and given support and instruction. How will these changes affect his Hogwarts career? He is not the bold Gryffindor saviour people were expecting. He is ready to love the wizarding world, but will it love him back?I expect there to be pairings in later stories, and for the rating to rise.
