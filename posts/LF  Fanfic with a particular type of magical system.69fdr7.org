Hello everyone !

I'm looking for a fanfic where magic would work like a muscle, thus the more you use magic, the more your power and control increase. Everybody would be born more or less magically equal. I've been looking for something like this for a while now but I just can't find any, and I'm tired of "magical cores" with Harry getting one ultra freaking huge because he is the Lord of god knows how many families. The books never imply magical power being inborn, but more a result of intelligence, experience, knowledge, and practice. Hence why muggleborns are not inferior to purebloods. I want to find this in a fic.

Thank you :)

  Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

** Maybe "muscle" was not the best term.

Let's say magic is a guitar, and wizards and witches are wannabe guitar players. Everybody would have the SAME guitar. Some people would be better playing rock, some others would be better playing classic. There would be a few geniuses who can play litteraly anything with very little practice (like Dumbledore or Riddle) but ANYONE could achieve an excellent level of mastery with enough practice. But of course, learning how to play requires determination, motivation and hard work, something that a lot of people lack. Most would be content playing just a few songs with the same chords every time.

In fact, this comparison works well with how magic works in canon. Harry is not what we could call hard working, however he practices the patronus/solo again and again, a spell/solo that a lot of wizards/guitar players cant do, and ends up pushing back a hundred dementors/ playing it perfectly. Then in fifth year, most of the DA achieve mastery of this spell/solo through relentless practice.

Hermione is a powerful witch/good guitar player because she study and practice a lot, she knows a lot of spells/musics by heart. But she doesnt create spells/compose music because it requires a deeper understanding of magic/music that she doesnt posess, but someone like Snape can.

** If magic worked like a muscle, shouldn't muggleborns be inferior to purebloods? I mean, for example, what if we ask one pureblood and one muggleborn/-raised to serve a glass of water. The muggleborn/-raised (or most of them at least) would go find a glass, then fill it with water. While the pureblood (or halfblood, or anyone who was raised in the magical world), would conjure a glass and then water.

Another point is genetic. An athletic, good looking couple would most certainly give birth to an athletic good looking child. My theory is that it's the same with magic, hence why pureblood are more powerfull, they have better genetics. Of course they are exceptions like Voldemort who is the child of a squib and a muggle.

Hope I didn't bore you with my little theory :p

Edit: Sorry I don't have any fics like that by the way ^{^{'}}

*** With your theory, how do you explain Hermione being better in school than Draco Malfoy? Or Neville Longbottom? Or Harry and Ron, where Harry is slightly better in school (if I remember correctly) even though Ron is the pureblood? Then there is Snape, a powerful wizard and halfblood, Lily Potter, a muggleborn who Slughorn invited to his Slug Club meetings... Is there anything in canon that supports your theory that purebloods are more powerful than muggleborns due to genetics? Or how did you arrive at that conclusion?

**** Hermione being better than most doesn't mean that she is more powerfull. It's like school, the kid getting the best grades isn't always the most clever. I highly doubt that Hermione would win a duel against Harry or Neville (Neville after he got his own wand of course.) If I remember correctly, Lily Potter was invited to the Slug Club because of her talent in Potion (Besides she could be one of those exceptions like Tom Riddle). And Ron is the most lazy character in the whole book but he still managed to create his own spell "Eat Slugs", thing that Hermione never managed.

On the other hand, you are right, nothing in the canon supports my theory, but nothing supports that muggleborn are equal to pureblood. It's just my little theory that I like using in my fics :3

***** I think there are a lot of things suggesting that they are equal. Voldemort deciding to attack Harry, not Neville (suggesting even he didn't believe in pure-blood superiority), the many powerful half-blood wizards JKR presents us with (Dumbledore, Riddle, Harry, Snape...), the emphasis on how our choices determine who we become, and of course the fact that the 'good guys' JKR tells us are right, are the ones believing in equality, and the bad guys, who lose in the end, the ones believing in pureblood supremacy.

JKR made it pretty clear, in her books, in her interviews, in her writings on Pottermore, that in the world she created pure-blood superiority is a misguided believe that doesn't reflect reality. Which is not to say that there is anything wrong with making up differing theories, after all exploring different possibilities is what makes writing fanfics so much fun. Want to link one of your stories, maybe?

#+end_quote

The implication in the book is that Ron doesn't create his own spell but uses a fairly common spell.

#+begin_quote
  'That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand...'
#+end_quote

If Hermione can recognise the spell I would assume that it's not invented.

#+begin_quote
  Lily Potter was invited to the Slug Club because of her talent in Potion (Besides she could be one of those exceptions like Tom Riddle).
#+end_quote

Lily Potter was said to be talented at Potions but she was also said to be talented at Charms.

Tom Riddle isn't an exception he's an example of the wider problem in the wizarding world, Purebloods have been inbreeding for so long that they are actually magically weaker than their counterparts. Dumbledore is also a Halfblood (his mother was Muggleborn) and he is the most powerful character in the series. Snape and McGonagall are both Halfbloods and after Dumbledore, Voldemort and maybe Bellatrix are the most powerful characters in the series.

I understand that people can have different theories/opinions, but isn't it fundamentally against the point of the series to say that Purebloods are better than Muggleborns/Halfbloods?

****** I dont' remember Hermione recognising the spell? Are we talking about "Eat Slugs?" And I also don't remember that it's a fairly common spell.

Also, my point isn't that pureblood are born better but more that they are raised in the magical word, making them more powerfull. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense but in this case you can understand why Dumbledore, being a Halfblood, is the most powerfull wizard of his generation.

Sorry I wasn't very clear.

Hermione says in response to the spell:

#+begin_quote
  'That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand...'
#+end_quote

The implication in such a statement is that she knows exactly what spell he's cast. She doesn't for example say that casting /a/ curse is difficult at the best of times but /that/ curse in particular is difficult to cast.

I then went further and assumed it's common enough that Hermione can recognise it.

So Ron didn't invent a spell, but cast an ordinary one-that /is/ difficult to cast and potentially non-verbal:

#+begin_quote
  Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling 'You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!' and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoy's face.
#+end_quote

He doesn't seem to say anthing in the books.

In any case isn't what Harry did to Marge technically creating a spell?

****** Not to break up the fascinating conversation, but I refuse to believe that DNA has any bearing whatsoever on the Magical World, Rowlings inconsistencies be damned. Blast Ended Skrewts are the result of breeding a magical lion and a magical crab. A feline mammal, and a crustacean. I am immensely skeptical of any genetic arguments regarding Harry Potter, since you can more or less extrapolate that Harry could fuck a dragon, and have humanoid dragon people as children. Whining about incest and inbreeding seems trivial, since at least it is the same species.
