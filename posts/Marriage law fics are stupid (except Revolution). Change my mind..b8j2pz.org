Marriage laws are stupid plot devices to force characters into unrealistic pairings like Dramione. They show that the author is too lazy to write a proper realistic stories. They are completely unrealistic because no population would ever accept the government mandating marriage, especially not the muggleborns and especially not Hermione. She's often seen as rule abiding but she's really only against breaking rules for silly reasons like pranks, if there's a serious issue she has no problem setting a teacher on fire, smuggling a dragon, brewing illegal polyjuice or creating a resistance movement. There's no way she'd accept a marriage law and happily marry Draco and somehow fall in love even though it's basically rape what happens. No bloody way.


** Marriage laws are only the tip of the iceberg of relationship plot devices.

Once you get into Soul Bonding, Alpha-Omega (A/B/O) dynamics, and Alien Sex Pollen, that's when you lose all sense of conscious agency and relationship realism. That kind of relationship stops being a matter of law, but a matter of soul magic or biology; it becomes a plot device that can't be overturned with a referendum or revolution, and one where a person's own body turns them into a thirsty predator or assbaby incubator.

If you think think marriage laws are the stupidest fanon creation, you have not truly gazed into the abyss.

*** One of my showerthoughts about soul-bonds and their mechanics was that it would reduce the pair into such a state of cohesion that they'd lose all their individualism and character, and start becoming one entity rather than two. Sort of like a hive mind with 2 members.

It'd be nice to encounter something like that in a fic. Not as the main focus, obviously, but as an aside.

**** I've seen that used in Horcrux fics, where Voldemort and Harry have merged consciousnesses through the Horcrux link, or where the Horcrux fragment inside Harry begins to meld with the host soul. Technically Voldie and Harry /do/ have a soul bond, but it's not romantic.

In the soul bounds used in shipfics, it's purely a tool of convenience to set two random characters together, when they wouldn't have had anything to do with each other on a regular day. The focus of the fic is on the characters getting together, not how they got together in the first place. It has a lot in common with HP crossover fics where Harry jumps through The Veil and gets tossed into another franchise's universe. The mechanics of /how/ is irrelevant to the plot.

It also prevents the author from having to actually think about the mechanics of the relationship itself. Had a fight? Oh, well, it doesn't matter because we're soul bound/our magic/instincts and so we know each other so well that we've just made up without acknowledging the underlying issues. Assuming we had a fight in the first place, because arguing totally isn't part of a healthy relationship.

Every piece of the “relationship” is solely there to promote the idea that they have a parasitic relationship, and their love is beautiful and wonderful and pure.... without the author having to convince you that it in any way resembles a relationship between two normal, well-adjusted human beings.

*** My thoughts on all of those devices, as a writer, is how they all depend on how they are written. When you take a look at Dark!Harry fanfictions, for example, you are going to find a mix of good and bad stories. There are good stories where it is used as a device to get him and Voldemort together (if you like that sort of thing) or him and Draco (again, if you like that sort of thing). There are also terrible ones that don't weave it into the story in a subtle way, but just slams it right in your face. The problem with examples you've given (that I have seen) are that they're hard to put off as a side plot when they are part of or are the basis of the entire story. Take Veela!Draco or Veela!Harry, which are often used to get Draco and Harry together as well. I like the concept, but the execution is often terrible. Large plot devices like that need to be woven into the story, not slammed into the reader's face in every chapter.

​

Example: Soul Bond stories should have the relationship behind it be the focus, not the actual soul bond itself. The relationship should be the reason for the soul bond, not the other way around. Same goes for most of the other devices.

​

Overall, I don't think the problem is the concept. It's the execution. Unfortunately, people are going to write what they want to where fanfiction is concerned.

Yep. A trope used poorly in a poorly written story is going to result in a poorly written story. But you can use the same trope to great effect in a well-written story.

Soul bonds can be done well, even if that's rarely the case. /Error of Soul/ was mentioned as an example elsewhere in this thread. I'm going to mention /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione as an example of a story that uses the soul bond well, ie, as an expression of the relationship between Harry and Hermione and not as a cheap means to get them together.

Then HBP comes out and uh... Yeah. The concept doesn't work anymore because oh, hey, Snape's not actually a pure-blood.

** They're a really great concept when used to explore how a character might fight back against such a law, and iirc that was sort of the point of the original challenge because the most recent book that had come out was the one where one of the sub plots is Hermione deciding to liberate the house elves, hell no she wasn't going to let something like the marriage law happen without a fight, and use it as a way to form a common ground between two characters that don't exactly like each other, but are both forced into this ridiculous situation when neither of them want to be. The fics that originally came out of the challenge were as a whole pretty decent. (If you ship it to start with.)

Now, though, 15 years later as it's own subgenre its kinda lost a lot of it's appeal because it no longer has the tight parameters that were put on it when it was a challenge and instead is just a convenient macguffin, mostly because the original premise got Jossed, /hard/. The original run of fics were mostly great cause of the whole challenge thing and that it's really interesting to see how different people approach the exact same idea with the exact same guidelines. It produced some of my favorite fics, and some of the best HG/SS in general. But the thing is once it became a trope instead of a challenge, it lost the appeal of it being different takes on the same idea since the idea is so broad and yeah, everything that's come out since, say, 2006-ish and uses the marriage law as a plot point is not that great, outside of rare exceptions.

I do however have two fics other than Revolution that I thought the fighting back was interesting.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]] is interesting because it has a realistic reaction to the law, Horribly unjust law past just to subjugate you? Flee the country. Also I can't see Hermione "free the elfs" Granger being ok with being forcibly married to someone.

  A marriage law has been passed, Hermione has to choose between Snape and Draco. She takes the third option and nopes out of the country with Harry.

The only other fic that I find interesting with a marriage law in it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]] It explores the fact that these things are supposed to be happening in 90s UK not 1790s uk

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

** If they really get that desperate about repopulating the country, they should create harems from Muggle women. Canon seems to suggest that children born form wizard-Muggle couples have a higher than 50% chance of being magical. If that's the case, this scheme will quickly lead to a population boom.

Alternatively or in addition, they can ‘infect' Muggle sperm banks.

Finally, they may develop magical-technological solutions such as artificial wombs. Adding artificial dissemination and genetic screening to the play, even a total population below 1000 will recover without running into genetic bottlenecks.

A marriage law is a worst form of tyranny that will lead to either more emigrations or civil wars. At least Harry and his friends will react very very violently to this kind of shit.

How will such scheme impact the Muggle world? Let's assume Wizarding Britain started out with a population of 10000 before the War and suffered 50% total loss (very very big already). Of the surviving 2500 Wizards, half (many were married and couldn't get their witches's approval, or they were beyond child producing age) took up the offer of creating harems of Muggle women. Assuming an average harem size of 20 (very big already), only 25000 Muggle women were needed, a minuscule number considering the overall size of the Muggle population pool. They are not restricted to Britain either, and I guarantee you that there will be enough Muggle women who agree to this kind of deal especially if the wizards can offer:

- Free magical medical and dental care
- Limited house chore assistance through House-Elves for hire
- Free housing
- Free magical transportation
- Free education, especially English as Second Language

My point is, people need to be vetted. The government has an obligation to do so if they are to uphold their part of the social contract between citizen and government.

Okay. Your opinion as stated is incorrect because /Escape/, linkffn(11916243), is not only also not stupid, but is /better/ than /Revolution/. /Escape/ has a better way of getting the law passed. It is passed with the backing of Voldemort's supporters for nefarious purposes rather than by the post-war Wizengamot, where the Death Eaters' power should be broken, and they could realistically come up with other solutions if repopulation were an issue.

The reaction to the law in /Escape/ is more realistic, too, because Harry and Hermione do the sensible thing and leave Britain. In /Revolution/, the law is undoubtedly egregious, but I don't think Harry and Hermione would go full-on French Revolution once they had the upper hand. Frankly, /Revolution/ also left a sour taste in my mouth when they had to turn right around and fight a literally genocidal ICW who didn't like their new regime. (The ICW had committed genocide against the African wizards for threatening the Statute of Secrecy.) I believe /Escape/ cleaves closer to canon worldbuilding about those sorts of things, which is another reason I think it is better-written.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting.

They stop cleaning Gryffindor tower after Hermione tries to free them, even though she doesn't have the authority to do so in the first place.

You need to convince wizards to free people who don't want to be freed at great personal cost, that it's better that they do. When some of those wizards' neighbors were working for a government that considered them animals, and are currently walking free.

And plenty of them are probably still terrified of Voldemort because... well, he was dead before, wasn't he? Maybe we should slow down on repealing all those laws. You know... just in case.

No, it's not. Actually, the opposite is true - if you do not repeal all laws passed after a coup, you set a dangerous precedent.

And yes, as I said: The wizards are totally fine with keeping slaves. That's fucked up.

And all you really need to do to free the elves is to give them permission to pick their own master - anytime they want. and you enforce that by having all owners swear an Unbreakable Vow to let the elves do this. No Vow? No elf for you.

From a Watsonian perspective, we have to accept that there's a good enough explanation. Honestly, the fact that they ask for it and don't ever - until Dobby, who was more than a little crazy from start to finish - actually want freedom would probably do it for most. From a Doylist perspective, that's fucked up, but a willing slave race is the first concept wannabe edgy xenofiction writers go for. Check out Gor. "Oh, but that's what they were made for, it's better for everyone that way, see! So edgy and rebellious, your social norms are not for me!"

It's fucked up by every metric we have in this universe, but in that one, it's apparently fine, until Hermione presumably starts a social revolution among the House Elves, at which point they actually want freedom/pay/rights/wands/whatever they actually end up settling on. Then the wizards pass it.

Wrong. Kreacher was forced to serve Sirius and then Harry against his will. He couldn't pick his owner. And Dumbledore told Harry about the magical enslavement, treating this as normal.

************ 1. I think Hermione's influence on the government is highly overrated. People don't pass laws just because she says so. In cannon the vast majority of characters doesn't understand her problem with house elves at all. It's a wonder the law got passed that quickly. The reason:
2. Neither legally nor mentally is the wizarding world anywhere near the end of the 20th century. The muggleborns are, but they are not in the government.
3. Look at post WW II Germany. If they had executed every state servant, there wouldn't have been anyone left to run things. In reality, many people remained in their position or got off very lightly. Similarly in the HP verse. After the war they took over the ministry. They arrested people who did the really bad stuff but everyone else got off lightly. Besides, they won the war against Voldemort, not against the ministry (which was merely compromised). The people who took over the running of the ministry were mostly pure bloods who had worked there before.

So, as for it taking several years to change house elf laws: It took us (Germans) 4 years just for our constitution to come into effect after WW II.

As for Genocide and bigots: As a matter of fact, humans are bigots. You severly underestimate just how much. The average population pre WW II Germany was no more bigoted than that in other European countries, or, I my opinion the average 21th century US citizen. (Let's not get started with countries outside of the 'western world'). For Genocide you need a government/dictator willing to commit it, a small number of extremist willing to execute it and a vast majority in the population willing to look away. The reasons we don't have more Genocide or other tyrannical acts is that there are few governments willing to commit it. You will always find extremists to execute it and many populations are willing to look away as long as things don't get too bad or don't affect them personally.

Does the law:

- mandate that owners immediately free house elves; or
- mandate that owners give the option of freedom to their house elves and let the elves decide?

Does the law:

- mandate minimum pay for house elves;
- mandate sick days, days off, etc.?

If the law mandates minimum pay, are there exemptions for large employers like Hogwarts or (guessing) St. Mungo's and the Ministry? Does the law provide for subsidies for these organizations to pay their house elves? One imagines that the budgets for these institutions are fairly fixed.

If there is a Hogwarts Subsidy, where does the perpetual funding come from? Is a new tax levied or are services eliminated and employees fired to accommodate the Subsidy?

If a new tax is required, should it be issued during the recovery from Voldemort's war when things are already bad enough and Diagon Alley isn't back to full merchant occupancy yet? Will that retard the economic recovery? Does that mean that the Hogwarts Subsidy Tax has to be even bigger to offset the economic slump? Will the Tax be revised downwards as the economy recovers? Is that downward revision tied to a schedule that is included in the House Elf Freedom legislation? What if the schedule automatically lowers the Tax before the economic slump recovers, thus leading to an insufficient Subsidy? Does that mean that the Wizengamot has to pass yet /another/ tax to patch over the scheduled reduction?

What are the penalties if one refuses to free one's house elves? How do you prove that a family has house elves and didn't free them? Who investigates these things? Is a current department re-tasked to deal with them? Is there a new department? If it's a new department, how is it funded? If it's a current department, is there non-House Elf work set aside for however long the House Elf Freedom question takes to be settled?

Are there penalties for the employer if an employer frees their house elves but the house elves refuse to leave? What if they refuse to take their wages or other benefits?

There will be issues that require testimony and debate. There will be serious questions that require serious answers and just repeating, "House Elf slavery is wrong and must be abolished!" isn't good enough.

I wouldn't care one bit if poor Pansy Parkinson had to wash her own dirty underwear. I would care if I were a shop owner who had to go into hiding during Voldemort's campaign of terror. Now that it's over, I can come back and see if my shop is still there. I can begin to rebuild. Except now it's harder because the government forced me to give up my House Elf and I can't afford to pay them, because my business hasn't recovered yet. And now there's some Elf Tax because now that elves are free, Hogwarts, the Ministry, and St. Mungo's can't cope with the added bulk in their budgets without making me pay for their elves. That means that my supplies are more expensive and customers are reluctant to buy my products because they're more expensive than they were previously, on top of the fact that they're not in the best financial situation right now, either, since they've also spent the last year in hiding and not making any money.

At least someone's making money. Too bad all they buy is yarn.

*********** The law mandates that House-elves can choose a new master any time they want. That frees them, without messing up their fucked up traditions right away. It's enforced by having the owner swear a magical oath to allow this - and ask regularly to ensure the elf is willingly working for them.

Anything else can come later. But this simple, easy change means elves can leave and find a new master if they are abused. Elves are, effectively, free.

** I'll admit that Marriage Law stories are sometimes a guilty pleasure for me. But I really dislike the naming of it. In most stories I read where Marriage Laws were prevalent, the main point the author tries to convey is to repopulate the magical community. But you don't need to marry a partner to repopulate any country/community. In fact, many countries are now facing decreasing marriages yet high birthrates due to people coupling outside of tying the knot and popping several kids into existence. It would be more apt to call these "Marriage Laws" "Family Planning Initiatives" (or something similar) instead. But I do agree with your point in that Hermione would never stand for such laws to pass. In the past, I've read many Charlie/Hermione stories where the Marriage Law is conducted just to put them together (such a trashy way to do it, honestly) and in a majority of the stories, she's completely fine with it. (/Well, it could've been worse, in that the Ministry could've paired me with Ron. Now I get his delicious, hot, sexy brother who has burn marks all over his body, dragon tattoos that move when I touch them, and of course, Christian-Grey-style sex in his bedroom at the Burrow, where we'll put up Silencing Charms so the rest of his family can't hear us as they eat breakfast!/).

I certainly don't care what other people read, but for some pairings, unless you put some real effort into finding ways where two characters with free will choose to spend time together, it's very hard to write them. Also, I mean, pick on this trope if you feel the need (and I don't really have any skin in this game, but I read primarily romance), but there are FAR more unrealistic and horrible tropes in this fandom.

  Marriage laws are stupid plot devices to force characters into unrealistic pairings like Dramione
#+end_quote

Not exactly. There are plenty of "unrealistic", or simply unusual pairing stories that exist outside the bounds of marriage law fics (or even bond/contract ones). And there are plenty of marriage law fics that have typical or realistic pairings. So I wouldn't say they are plot devices just for such a thing.

#+begin_quote
  They show that the author is too lazy to write a proper realistic stories.
#+end_quote

That is a silly point of view. Such styles of fics can be poorly or well written. That's on the author and the fact its a marriage law fic really has nothing to do with laziness. Describing it as "properly realistic" is idiotic in the context of fan fiction. And your examples of no population accepting it being mandated by a government seems to completely ignore real human history, nor understand that witches and wizards are not muggles and you are looking at it from a muggle point of view.

#+begin_quote
  There's no way she'd accept a marriage law and happily marry Draco and somehow fall in love...
#+end_quote

Your final mention of Hermione, who she is or isn't, and what she would or would not accept seems to imply that you are specifically angry at 1 particular pairing in a marriage law fic. A Dramonie to be exact, as you mentioned earlier. And yet, you again completely ignore the concept behind fan fiction. A Hermione in fan fiction does NOT need to be exactly what you may want or expect.

What about a Dark!Hermione who joins the Dark Lord and accepts a marriage to Draco to further the Dark Lords cause? What about a Blood Adoption Hermione who "becomes" a pureblood in some way. What about a Draco who is not like his father and actually supports Hermione? What about a Draco who offers a deal to Hermione to help her further her causes she wishes to champion, in an effort to "obtain" the "brightest witch of her age" thinking she could help him obtain prominence and power via advice and smarts?

This is fan fiction. It is not going to be always what you like, or even what you expect. But the point is that you are taking a VERY narrowminded view on things as it pertains to arguing against marriage law fics.

And I want to just add as a caveat, that I am no major marriage law fic fan. But I do think that fan fiction is very open-ended and its silly to be narrow-minded.

But that's not what usual marriage law fics are about. Authors of those fics specifically want to force pairings together that they can't do with plausible character and plot developments. Hence this plot device and the soul bond. But unlike the soul bond which only affects the few people involved, a marriage law is a tyranny that affects thousands, and an atrocity not even the Nazis dare to push.

Hell even the OP, despite saying in the title "Marriage Law Fics are Stupid" then tacks on "except Revolution", showing that even they seem to like one.

I don't go around condemning heavily cannon compliant fics because they don't invent enough "new and creative stuff". I could call them "lazy writing" because they are recycling so much of the original material with very minor tweaking.

** I (of course) like my own take on this. The marriage law in my own story ordered purebloods to marry non-purebloods, but it wasn't meant to actually create any couples. It was just a roundabout way of pushing the extreme blood-purists out of the country by imposing an intolerable law on them. Any pureblood with connections (like Percy) got advance warning so they could avoid it by marrying their fellow purebloods before the deadline. Widower Lucius was one of the few purebloods caught up in this, because no other country allowed him to immigrate in order to escape it.

It's a stupid thing that nobody with common sense and morals would allow, accept, or even tolerate.

A fair number on the Governmental bodies (that we've seen) are rather weak on morals.

And a lot of them are lacking in common sense, an issue that plagues Wizarding Britain throughout the series.

Put them both together, and you get a lot of the crap leading up to the main books.

Still hate em though. Only one I liked was Jamie Evan's and Fate's Fool...

Which had the Titular character break into the wizengamot, THREATEN THE ENTIRE GOVERNING BODY, and burn a hideout of blood supremacists that had kidnapped her daughter to the GROUND.

Oh, and she cast a powerful blood-boiling curse in front of the Wizengamot, killing one of the orchestrators of the attack and stopping the proposed law in it's damn tracks.

It featured the MoM making their own pairings, and the reactions of those people to their alotted spouse. I want to say the Weasley twins got paired with the Patil twins, Luna was put with Crabbe or Goyle (I forget which), an I think Ron was put with either Pansy Parkinson or Millicent Bullstrode.

** Draco/Hermione by itself is quite a far-fetched ship, but the whole marriage law thing isn't that far-fetched.

When the population of a country or a people dip so far down that they are in danger of extinction by sheer virtue of TFR not being able to recover the lost population, it isn't exactly outlandish for the state to offer incentives for citizens to boost that population back up. Don't get me wrong, this is not something that would happen in a regular war-torn society - it is something that might be considered where a community or a nation has lost 30+% of it's population. It's generally agreed that losses on such an enormous level are impossible to recover from. It's usually the youth population of a nation that are the first to be hit when it comes to war - the same youth that are supposed to give birth to a new generation of citizens. When that youth is hit hard, the nation will crumble.

In such a catastrophic scenario, something like it might work. It's a very, very slim chance, but there is a chance - if the state manages to even survive at all.

Something I didn't mention is that at such a point, all forms of governmental organisation and structure will most likely collapse, leaving the country perilously close to complete lawlessness and anarchy or fragmentation into numerous smaller societies.

But, IMO, if a country has lost over a third of its population, it's going to get destroyed no matter what happens. For a real life comparison, France lost just under 5% of her population in WW1, including a whopping 25% of her male youth. And 20 years later, they folded to the Germans - and this huge loss was a big factor. A lot of people like to meme France for surrendering so quickly, but the fact is that there's pretty much nothing you can do when so much manpower (and potential manpower) is buried under the ground.

****** Look, I don't know if you're taking the mickey, but no country has ever lost that many people in one go, ever. The closest was the USSR at the end of WW2, but even their losses were under 12 percent of their population.

A thirty percent drop is nothing short of apocalyptic. It has never happened before, and if it does happen in the future, that nation will collapse, no matter how powerful they are - and yes, that includes the USA. The current American population is around 330 million. Imagine a scenario where 110 million just drop dead - with most of them being in the 16-35 age group. Really, really think if the US can ever recover from something like that.

******** Paraguay (which used the be the most powerful state of the region) took decades to recover, and even nowadays it is not a great place to be, compared to it's neighbours. It's a bit of a far stretch to say the state survived. The point here is not whether a country constitutionally exists afterwards but whether they have a functioning government of their own. The post war government of Paraguay was installed by Brazil, pretty much. 50% of their territory was lost. Hard though it sounds, the extensive mass rapes that did happen at the end of and after the war did play a part in repopulating the country. Bad example this one...

** The idea of the marriage law is not much different than the idea of arranged marriages/betrothal contacts, just on a larger scale. I have read fics where they have marriage incentive laws, so that basically everyone chooses their own partner but they have like 5 years to do it and would be able to have kids. They also has provisions for same sex couples. As many have said, there are interesting ways to use the marriage law trope that is not just some lazy way of getting two characters together or giving a female character a harem.

** I don't understand it. Marriage Law is just a plot device and the biggest complain about such stories is that they dismiss proper relationships and feelings (as soul bonds).

But let's be honest: very few fanfiction stories properly represent relationships. In most cases it's just an author's wish fulfillment without any proper foundation.

** As somebody pointed out- linkffn(11916243) Was a great one. Basically Hermione takes the logical route of leaving the castle and country. Her and Harry were in a secret relationship, Remus, McGonagall, Snape, and the twins have a secret order within the order, and it follows those guys and others in their POVs after their "escape".

There was a very nice chapters with Percy and the Twins, along with chapters that made me feel a bit bad for two characters who were painted in a very very bad light. It is honestly worth a read, but one that has to be done in one sitting imo.

And where can I find revolution?
