It was a time travel one where Harry goes back to when his parents and the marauders were all at Hogwarts in the body of his child self and tells James and Lily about Peter, and causes a few other problems. I don't think it was ever finished, but I think it was called "in a new light" or something. Does anyone know the name?


** Unfortunately, no - though there is a similar story where Hermione pretty much does exactly the same thing.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
