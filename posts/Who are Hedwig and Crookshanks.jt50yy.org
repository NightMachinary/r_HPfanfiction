Just a random shower thought that popped into my head.

Those two pets both seem to be depicted as really Intelligent and loyal as well as helpful to Harry and co. so I started thinking Lily and James said that they were with Harry always so what if Lily is/was Crookshanks and James was Hedwig. It would explain why Hedwig suicided in front of a Killing curse and Crookshanks seemed so focused on Scabbers/Pettigrew. If you're wondering why James (as Hedwig) didn't go after Pettigrew first he would want his best mate Sirius out of prison a dead Rat wouldn't help with that and second, perhaps he was hoping that Pettigrew would turncoat (again) and help Harry they were friends in school after all. Lily would just want to protect her son consequences be dammed.


** Interesting theory. I heard before the one with Crookshanks being Lily's reincarnation but I would have not thought about James being Hedwig (that's quite a sex reversal there). JK was saying that owls are really intelligent and make good familiars. And in a way it makes sense because owls tend to be associated with wisdom despite being some of the dumbest birds. But what if Pig was Regulus? Or what if Dobby was actually James?

*** James being dobby... James doesn't seem the groveling type and about the gender reversal thing with Hedwig, I think he would not really care about it after a while.

I imagined it happened like this:

Ghost James: 'Ok today Harry gets his familiar this is my chance to close to my son thank god that Lily agreed to this but it was rather sudden. Ooh, Hagrid picked a beautiful Owl, sorry little one but I need to protect my son.'

Ghost James posses Owl and gets information on the Owl he took over.

Owl James: 'Thank goodness I get all the Owl info it would be hard to adjust otherwise... WAIT I'm a female!'

Ghost Lili chuckles in the background: 'Got him!'

** There have been a few fics where crookshanks is regulus black. Another where regulus is buck beak. I don't think I've seen Hedwig being an animagus. I've seen her as a Phoenix hiding in owl form though

Your theory is fun, but I think I like the idea of sentient or near sentient animals too much to entertain it. And while both crooks and hedwig are very loyal, they don't really act like parents would, I don't think

And then there is the creepiness of an adult being in a kids' dorm. It's not my favourite

(Though honestly if it's written well it's a totally viable theory. We've all seen way more dubious ones!)
