The general gist was that magical marriages increase the groom's magical power, so Dumbledore decided to quadruple-dip. The girls were Susan Bones, Romilda Vane, Marietta Edgecombe, and Millicent Bulstrode, to have one girl from each House. Harry is then accused of Romilda's (faked) murder in a dark ritual, which Dumbledore uses to paint him as a burgeoning dark wizard. Dumbledore plans on using Harry as an existential threat to keep his power over Wizarding Britain, which is what he did previously with Tom Riddle.

Any help?

** I don't know this story, but I like the idea of that type of plan. It vaguely reminds me of a "I was the great evil that united the world for peace."

**** It's a tenuous connection, but I still made it. Dumbledore creating a dark lord to unite the population under him.
