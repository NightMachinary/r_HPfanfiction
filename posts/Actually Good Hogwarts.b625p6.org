I'm wondering if y'all know of any fics where Hogwarts is actually a good school? Like more teachers, more classes, better classes, maybe Dumbledore not completely fucking over at least 4 subjects (DADA, HoM, Potions and Muggle Studies) by having incompetent teachers. Yes, I know the curse on DADA and all that crap, but surely something can be done for that? Maybe even just changing the title of the job role so it's not technically Defence Against the Dark Arts, even if that's what they're learning. Binn's is inexcusable. Muggle Studies is 50 years out of date and Snape is shit. Even if he's kept on for older years, he can't teach children. I just feel like Hogwarts and everything about it needs to be redone. For it apparently being the best Wizarding school, it seems really mediocre. Why aren't first years given maps? Why is the rivalry between Slytherin and like, everyone, not discouraged? House points are meaningless and there's no set of rules or guidelines to them. Teachers give and take random points for random things. What one teacher will give you 10 points for, another will give you 3. What one teacher will take 5 for, another with take 15. It's stupid. It creates rifts within your own house and creates unnecessary competition between other houses. I have a lot of thoughts about this haha

Anyway, is there anything written with a better Hogwarts? And I don't mean Harry going and fixing it and the stories over. I want Harry like, actually attending this apparent best Wizarding school in the world and it actually be the best. Not on the level of a lacking, underfunded public boarding (lol) school that couldn't give a shit about its students education.

Thanks!

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Untitled-Tome][/Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/]] Hogwarts comes off as a posh private school. There are departments for each subject with multiple professors within each department, the inter-house rivalry is way less severe than in canon and the classes offered are also distinct from what we usually see in fanfiction. linkffn(10210053)

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** Something to keep in mind, there's basically a genre of British children's literature that revolves around stories set in eccentric or somewhat special boarding schools. The St Trinians movies in the mid 2000s are some of the latest cinematic adaptations of this genre that J K Rowling no doubt had read and internalized during her formative years (Malory Towers, St Trinians, etc).

I think a mistake in Rowling's worldbuilding was to label Hogwarts as the ONLY school in Great Britain. So many things could be explained away if there were other schools in the same country.

*** Just did some looking, according to Rowling, there's approximately 1000 students at Hogwarts, she was later asked again and she settled on 600, that's been pretty consistent regarding the movies and everything she's said after. So assuming there is 600 students at Hogwarts, but only technically 11 actual teachers, 12 at one point but I don't think Firenze really counts in that aspect, the student to teacher ratio is absolutely shocking. You have 6 teachers teaching 600 students from ages 11 - 15+ depending on their OWL's, and 5 teachers teaching across a range of 600 students from 13+ depending on their electives. It's horribly thought out. For her having set 6 books in this school, she hasn't put much thought into how it's run.

**** 1st : Who says Hogwart is the best magical school in canon? I can only remember Hagrid (ex student, member of the staff and almost worship the Headmaster) and maybe some student. None of them having any objectivity on the subject.\\
2nd : It is said that Hogwart is the only magical school in Britain, the other option being homeschooled (as said in book 7), but we have to remember that magical Britain fonctions more like a little town than an actual country. Hogwart's is more like a town school,t aking every students than an elite school on this point, students don't even have to pay tuitions.

3rd: Most of the "problems" you said are exagerated. Harry Potter is a story told by the eyes of one student, Harry. So for example, Binns may be boring, but it is just a boring old teacher who happened to continue after death, interested student (ex Hermione or probably some Ravenclaw) can and do listen during his lessons. Snape may be a discutable teacher, but we do know he was mosly here as a future and actual spy than a teacher, and even there, we know he does hate Harry as a personal level. Without being a perfect teacher for others, he most likely cause less problems. And for the "intense bullying". . . which one? With the exception of some name calling and petty hexes, I don't remember being that unsafe. The only grave situations that come to mind are either extremely rare (like Snape and Lupin) or due to the war and still safer than the outside world (Draco murder tentatives). And for finish Muggle study, how do you know it's out of date? We never saw any lessons of this, we just know Hermione took it and found it extremely easy because she is Muggle raised.

I think most problems you said are either due to "cultural differences" (magical brittain is not Brittain and some things as a ghost teacher is normal for them) or too much fanon reading.

I think that was a holdover from fanon before the character of Charity Burbage was introduced (and summarily executed for her pro-Muggleborn views) in the first chapter of Deathly Hallows.

******** True, but things like this don't exist with out some kind of basis. For the entirety of the Wizarding community to be shown as primarily ignorant of the muggle community, or those not so ignorant thinking it's basically the 1800's out of Diagon Alley, it's easy to assume they were taught that.

In my opinion, muggle studies should replace astronomy as a core subject. Or even become one. They only have 6 core subjects, it's not hard to make that 7. You can easily fit 7 subjects into their schedule. Feel like it couldn't even just be the first two years, and it becomes an elective after that, so at least they all have some form of understanding 🙄🙄

That's not exactly true. I imagine Muggle Studies is like French/Spanish class but without language and more culture. How many people do you think is fluent with those languages by only taking classes at highschool? Some of my friends that are fluent is only because they have an additional interest in the language/culture, have a family member that is fluent, or just a nerd.

Even more so that Muggle Studies is an additional subject. Those that taken it will be viewed mostly as 'the weird kid that took Muggle Studies because they're a Muggle nerd' or 'the kid that took Muggle Studies because it's easier than Runes/Arithmancy'.

***** First of all, it's definitely implied more than once, and regardless of best or not, if it is the only one, which according to Pottermore it is, it's shit. It's absolutely garbage. It's honestly a horrible school. If you stop focusing on the fact that it teaches magic, it's a bad school. She taken no thought into how children learn, apparently hasn't looked at how schools run and yes I understand it's a story, but it's a story set mainly in a school, so therefore, the school should run like a proper school.

Binns is more than boring. Hermione is Hermione and we see how she is all throughout the books. If a teacher is so boring that entire classes can not pay attention, then you need to get a different teacher. Children are there to learn, as a teacher you need to be able to properly engage your students. We see McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout do excellent with this. They know how to interact with their students, they know how to engage with them, they know how to keep their students interested in what they're learning. Honestly, we don't have many other examples. Snape is a terrible teacher and should never have been put in charge of 11 year olds, even up to the age of 14 I don't think he should be teaching. I don't think he should teach at all, but he is a very good potions master and knows what he's talking about, he just doesn't know how to teach that to children. After understanding the basics and learning how to actually make potions, I'm sure he wouldn't have such an issue with older students and they will mainly just be able to brew.

Any bullying is bullying and we see a lot of it in the books. Name calling is bullying. Attempting to harm others with spells is bullying. Being blatantly racist or the magical equivalent of that is bullying. There is nothing done to stop any of this. Luna is harassed for years by people in her house and from the rest of the school because she says odd things. Neville is bullied for years for no reason. Hermione is bullied for being a know it all and for being muggle born. These are just examples that Harry sees. These people aren't stopped or reprimanded. There is definitely more bullying going on than this. You see on more than one occasion how quick the school turns on Harry in GoF, that's not a normal thing. They all bully him, they're all hostile. When Hermione, Neville and Harry lose all those points in PS, practically the whole house turns on them, 3 eleven year olds. CoS, basically the whole school turns on Harry and then just as easily forgets the whole thing. It's a very prevalent thing that is never stopped. I know at any school I went to if people started wearing badges insulting another student, regardless of why, they'd have been confiscated and whoever was wearing them, making them and distributing them would have been punished.

I assume there's something wrong with it based on the rest of the Wizarding World, perhaps Charity Burbage actually does a good job of the class for the few years she's there, but considering the likes of Arthur Weasley who you can easily assume took the class, he knows next to nothing about muggles.

And I don't think it has anything to do with cultural differences but rather a lack of effort on Rowling's part.

****** Dude, I hate to disappoint you but... sometimes teachers are just shitty 🤷🏻‍♀️ it happens, have you been to school ever? Schools should be how you say but really, having some shitty teachers is part of the average school experience as far as every single person I know is concerned. Should it be fixed? Yes! Absolutely! Is it unrealistic that the school has shitty teachers? No. Additionally you mention the bullying. That's common too. Some have it better than others, but school, especially in the 80s/90s when the story is happening was super shitty for you if you were a weird kid. You mentioned how having the whole school turn against a kid is nuts and I agree, but you are forgetting Harry is first and foremost a mega celebrity in the wizarding world. Every aspect of his life is under heavy public scrutiny and so reactions to it are far more extreme. At the end of the day, you talk about things about hogwarts that are bad, but not unrealistic. I do agree with you that there's some shoddy world building involved when you think of the math of the whole thing. I also agree that having the slytherin house be the “evil” and consequentially hated house is dumb and lazy. Like if everyone evil comes from slytherin as is implied, you would think the kids there would get some idk extra screening or counseling, or they'd get rid of the house all together but nope! This is just where the evil kids go!

******* There's a difference between having some shitty teachers and a quarter of the teachers being shitty. There's only 11 classes, 3 of those classes shouldn't have a shitty teacher. Also the bullying that happens in the book would be dramatically reduced if the teachers actually did anything about it.

It's rather they aren't ‘evil' when they get there, but after 7 years of ridicule and being told you're an evil, horrible person for putting a talking hat on your head differently to 3/4 of the school, there's obviously going to be a lot of resentment and this happening year after year, generation after generation, it builds a festering hatred that continuously grows. It doesn't make people like LV, he was already like that, he was already developing to be the man he was, but it definitely helped him. There's people like Malfoy who joined because of his views, but I'd be willing to bet that there was people who joined purely because it felt like it was them against the rest of the world.

Imagine how much better it would be without houses. Obviously you need them for group sports etc etc. but other than that, completely useless and entirely inserted to the extent she did to further the Slytherin vs Gryffindor plot. Obviously there's multiple other ways this could be achieved, but it's a children's book so that would be easiest. “Slytherins are evil, you should hate them.” “Gryffindors are stupid, you should hate them.” 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ Literally the stupid points at the end of PS shows this. Dumbledore literally let the Slytherins think that they'd won, these are children. He then awards a bunch of points just enough to tip the scales, Gryffindor wins, everyone cheers that the evil Slytherins didn't win and the first years are left wondering why the whole school hates them so much considering they are 11 years old and haven't done anything except go to school. Lol.

** Sry I don't have any recommendations but a quick thought: Hogwarts having bad teachers is rly realistic. Thing about it. Did you ever encounter a school with fair AND competent teachers? Even schools with a good reputation usually have at least one bad teacher. At least that's what we have to deal with in Germany. Credit is never given fairly, Marks are given rly subjectively and bullying is often overlooked by the overworked teachers.

So what you are looking for is a unrealistic utopian fix it au- with all the usual tropes this genre entails (e.g. Annoyingly snarky/smart harry and lots of dumbles bashing)

*** I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you probably never went to a school that was widely considered one of the best in world. It's perfectly realistic for a school to have the problems Hogwarts does, yes, but it's perfectly /unrealistic/ for it to maintain a sterling reputation despite that. Its students' grades on standardised texts, ie OWLs and NEWTs, would have to be consistently excellent compared to, say, Durmstrang's students'. There's no indication that this is the case, and there's no way that it could be when three of the required subjects for the first five years have woefully incompetent teachers.

You could argue that Hogwarts' reputation is unearned in universe, but that's really neither here nor there, given the op's actual point.

** I've been to a few as my family moved around a bit and in the 7 schools I've been in, 3 primary (grades 1-7) and 4 high schools (grades 8-12), I've only encountered a handful of bad teachers, although never were they both incompetent and mean. I've had two mean competent teachers, and a few incompetent teachers at no fault of the curriculum. I mean, I guess Australia has higher standards for education, but every school I went to whether public or private were all better than Hogwarts. There was always ample support from staff. The majority of teachers were helpful. There wasn't a massive divide between students. There wasn't intense bullying. I never had to independently study whole subjects because my teacher couldn't teach. When I got into senior years and could pick electives there were always many choices, rather than 5 other options. Tradesmanships are available in school, rather than additional subjects you could choose to do work experience. There are so many options to help you once you're out of school, options that help you start building foundations in what you want to do, whether it's to do further study, start working, or go into a trade. I just feel like Hogwarts doesn't do shit. You do your OWL's, you do your NEWT's, that's it. Two exams. At one point there's a “what do you want to do and here's what you need for it”, there's no guidance. Hogwarts only offers 11 subjects. It's not some utopian school, it's just a proper school with proper classes and qualified teachers.

** I think that the HP fandom has been so over-saturated with fanon related to either 'improving' Hogwarts, or circle-jerking over a non-Hogwarts wizarding school (typically Beauxbatons or Durmstrang). I think people have so strongly adopted their headcanon of this utopian, wizarding school that they forget what Hogwarts was canonically like and more impressively, they forget what Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were shown like in GoF.

I'd argue that, yes, Hogwarts truly is the greatest wizarding school in the world. Not just a statement Hagrid made or some other biases, but that it is actually the best wizarding school in canon - objectively so. Think about it like this regarding the Triwizard Tournament in book 4:

- *Cedric was a sixth-year student, whereas Fleur and Krum were seventh-years in their respective schools.* Meaning that Fleur and Krum were a year-older than Cedric, and that makes a big difference. Compare HBP Harry to DH Harry, for example. Hell, compare how much more capable OotP Harry was compared to GoF Harry in just one year.

- Cedric received zero help from Dumbledore or other Hogwarts professors, whereas Fleur and Krum got more direct help from their respective headmasters. Let that sink in: Fleur and Krum, the best their school had to offer, were both believed by their own headmasters too incapable of getting past a dragon for the first task. Granted, Harry told Cedric about the dragons and Crouch Jr was helping Harry the entire tournament, but that simply evened the playing field for everyone. *With the advantage gained from Karkaroff's and Maxime's hints gone, Harry tied with Krum for first place despite Karkaroff being an incredibly biased judge in-universe against Harry. Cedric came in second place, meaning that he outperformed Fleur despite being her getting more help and being a year older than him.*

- *Fleur performed pretty terribly on the second task, failing to overcome a Grindylow... something that Harry was taught in his THIRD YEAR by Lupin.* If Hogwarts had a decent DADA professor for Harry first or second year, Grindylows likely would have been taught in first or second year. I know Crouch Jr massively helped Harry, but he wasn't helping Cedric nor Krum. If Hogwarts' DADA curriculum is really that bad compared to other wizarding schools, then why did Fleur, a seventh-year, do so poorly? *Meaning that Fleur, in her final year at Beauxbatons, can't handle third-year creatures like Grindylows when she's meant to be the best in her school. Let me remind you guys that Fleur came in last-place in both the first and second tasks, even though Cedric, the Hogwarts champion, was a full year younger than her and had zero help from his headmaster.*

- Speaking of headmasters, just look at Karkaroff and Maxime compared to Dumbledore. I'm not saying those two should have been on Dumbledore's level, but you'd think that the headmaster of Durmstrang would be much more talented than McGonagall or Snape. *Karkaroff, as talented a Death Eater as he is implied to be, despite being the headmaster of a prestigious wizarding school, probably wasn't as magically talented all-around as Snape, let alone McGonagall.* The fact that Karkaroff was not killed by Voldemort at all suggests that whatever his ability, Karkaroff was a very low priority for Voldemort. Given that Voldemort personally killed Amelia Bones, but left a lesser Death Eater or two (i.e. Yaxley, Rowle, Carrow siblings, etc) to kill Karkaroff, implies that Karkaroff wasn't that much better than most Death Eaters. The fact neither Bellatrix nor Snape were ordered to kill Karkaroff just strengthens my view on this.

- Its also rather telling that the only possible foreign Death Eaters that Voldemort actually recruited were Antonin Dolohov and Igor Karkaroff. Given that Voldemort travelled the world for many years, its strange that only two non-British wizards would be deemed worthy of joining him, let alone want to willingly join Voldemort. Even then, Dolohov's background was unknown and Karkaroff is somewhat implied to be a Hogwarts alumni (based on his 'dear old Hogwarts' comment, lack of an notable accent like the foreign students and Maxime, and his familiarity with Snape). So its very likely that Karkaroff was a Hogwarts alumni; Dolohov could go either way, really.

- Karkaroff, while implied to be one of the more talented Death Eaters by hype, was significantly beneath Snape (and by extension, Bellatrix). As for Dolohov, he is easily Voldemort's third-best Death Eater after Snape and Bellatrix, but in the end, he was struggling against Dean and Parvati despite having both Travers and a third Death Eater backing him up. After that, he lost a separate duel to Flitwick who, while skilled, was a /retired/ duelling champion. He was not an active duelling champion, or even someone who would have duelled often like Dolohov, but a rusty wizard who would have been not as good as he was in his prime. Dolohov's best accomplishments in-canon were beating Moody, but Moody was rusty and far past his prime (and it was never even said that Dolohov beat Moody 1v1), and beating Moody (which Pottermore stated that Lupin was a bit rusty, possibly implying that Dolohov might not have won otherwise).

*TL;DR: In canon, Hogwarts really is shown to be the greatest wizarding school. Whatever you think of Hogwarts, its still a better school that the others by miles if Fleur and Krum are deemed equal or slightly worse than Cedric, a Hogwarts student who is an entire year younger than either of them, and had less support in the tournament. The fact that Harry, regardless of what help he got, could even remotely equal or surpass Fleur and Krum despite them being 3-4 years older than Harry and despite getting help from their headmasters (who really should have, by hype alone, outclassed even Moody or Crouch Jr).*

*** I'm not even thinking of the other schools, I'm thinking about how mediocre Hogwarts is. If the other schools are worse, well then I guess that's all just saying something about the education in the Wizarding community.

Maybe the don't even change the teachers or whatever, but like, why can't it actually be run like a school? You have the bare minimum traces of any kind of school. Forget the magic part, make the magic into science and English and stuff, muggle school subjects, now think about how the school works, how the teachers work, how the students work, it's just so poorly done. As soon as you add magic it's like none of that matters. Why don't they have sports or any kind of physical education? Like, why don't they have any kind of science based classes? Potions doesn't count and astronomy only says so much about Earth. We don't know much about what's being taught in HoM, but you can look up what Harry actually mentions, there's no modern history, in fact, from what we know the most recent history they learn was from 1911. Do they learn about other magical communities? I would think not since Harry didn't even know there were other schools.

Anyway lost of train of thought lol

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

****** That's par for the course for fictional schools though. Looking at the number of teachers VS the number of students, it's USUAL for fictional schools to seem like they have too few teachers because when it comes to fictional stories you HAVE to limit how many characters are there. Better to have fewer characters and actually give them some personality, than to have ten times as many characters that are just a list of names.

The entire thing is also pretty vague because in the HP stories characters who aren't directly involved in the story tend to be treated as if they aren't there... and if the story doesn't need them they tend to vanish until it does. We know thanks to interviews and everything that there are FIVE Gryffindor girls in Harry's year, and yet we only ever see three of them -- Hermione, Lavender and Parvati.

Which is why it's perfectly possible there are more than thirteen teachers at Hogwarts, it's just that the other teachers aren't mentioned because they don't play any role in the story and aren't important to any scenes. After all, we generally don't hear about a teacher unless s/he is directly involved in the story. We didn't even know there was a Professor Trelawney or Professor Kettleburn until third book, and we didn't know about Charity Burbage until the seventh book.

******* We didn't know about Kettleburn or Trelawney because Harry wasn't taking any electives until that year. We don't hear Charity Burbage's name until DH, but we know the class exists and therefore must have a teacher, as with Runes and Arithmancy, the classes exist so a teacher exists. Hooch does flying lessons, what, once a year? How long for I'm not sure, but it's not long enough to receive more mention from Harry other than one lesson even though it's something he enjoys. She referees games but you don't hear from her otherwise. Filch is a caretaker, Pomfrey is the school nurse. There's more adults at the school, but there's only 11 subjects, and eventually 12 mostly full time teachers. I do not believe there is other classes available than those mentioned.

We only hear about those three yes. Rowling has said herself how she never mentioned them in canon. I don't take this to mean that there is mysteriously more teachers than accounted for and random classes that we never hear of. Even in slight conversations, perhaps an encounter here or there with a random professor to give the impression of a bigger, more active school, instead it's always the same professors we end up interacting with. She had no problem chucking in Charity in DH, yes it's a class we know exists, but how hard is it to add casual dialogue to give us more of a world view? I'll stay with my point that there's few teachers, as that's all she's said ever.

******** Yes, for story purposes these are the only people and subjects mentioned. In some extra materials like the movies and video games, other subjects and teachers and even students DO appear, though they're not canon to the books.

You sort of have to make some allowances for a story-driven narrative. Some details DO need to be either fudged, ignored or glossed over, or you end up not with a story, but with a long list of details that aren't important and that nobody cares about.

There's no definite answers here, partly because you only get the story from Harry's limited POV and partly because you have to limit characters and subjects unless the story drowns in a lot of extra details.
