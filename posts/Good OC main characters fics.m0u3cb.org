** Off the top of my head,

linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House by Belial666) replaces Hermione with an OC who is about as clever but (even) more ruthless.

In most WBWL and Fem!Harry fics, Harry is effectively an OC, so if you can just run a search-and-replace to give the character an original name.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  The year before she began Hogwarts, when her mother died and the Malfoys took her in, Ariadne Black thought that things couldn't get much worse. She was wrong. Now one friend hates her because of her house, another is missing at all hours of the night, and her father's a murderer. But at least she has the chance to get some answers, right? Now in Year 3.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

** Oh boy, I'd have a great list for you if it wasn't too much. Not sure why, but I've been stuck in an OC loop for years, so almost everything I've favourited is an OC fic.

Top of my head (everything is on FFN) WastelandRose has a ton, there's a series by EmeraldStorm7.

Sorry, I'm new and don't know how to link a bunch of stuff yet, but 99% of my favorites (SparksAdrift) are OC, usually with Marauders or trio.
