Also, since the Order was going into the Department of Mysteries, Mad-eye, Kingsley and Tonks would warn the others what dangers they may have to handle or avoid.

** I'd like to think that it is established that Remus was an accomplished and capable wizard with a lot of experience. Iâ€˜m sure that someone like Dumbledore would have recogniced the Veil for what it is without knowing it beforehand in seconds. Not to compare Lupin with Dumbledore of cause, but I think that other wizards would be capable of deducing the nature of the Veil through their experience with magic in general as well, although only to a lesser degree, meaning in more time and less precise. They would have made an educated guess where Dumbledore would know what it is and already have multiple theories of its origin and whatnot.\\
One of the clues that mght have lead to Remus seeing the Veil for what it is would have been the whispering voices that people who lost someone can hear near the Veil (Luna, Harry). Now it is of cause just as probable that he knew about the Veil from order members who work in the Ministry or maybe Dumbledore who would have known quiet a lot of the secrets of the DoM and Ministry as a whole since this obscure branch of magic is exactly the kind of magic that he would want to know all about.

** He knows his Dark Arts shit. The theory behind that veil is probably pretty borderline as far as "acceptable magic" goes, and only falls on the good side of that line because it's under government control and the Ministry think they're responsible.

Plus, he's got friendly Ministry employees on hand to fill in the gaps in his understanding.

** Wasn't it used for executions? Or is that fanon? It has been so long that sometimes canon and fanon bleed together for me.

Also, it might not necesarily be a huge secret. I am sure he could have read about it in obscure books or even have been briefed on it before going to the DoM.

**** Still, it is kind of sitting in the middle of a big room. The hall of prophecies looked more secret.

I am just saying that there is no evidence that the existence of the Veil is some guarded, national-level secret. And Lupin would have had access to some... interesting books, through his relationship with the Potters, Sirius and his time as professor.

****** I mean, yeah, they don't know for a fact, but nothing that went in ever came out of it, so that alone is good enough reason to hold Harry back. The risk is just too big.

It does make me wonder if J. K. Rowling had another plan for Sirius, for him to come back somehow but gave up on it later, because it is such a stupid and pointless death.

******* At the end of OotP, when Luna mentions seeing Sirius again by "looking behind the Veil," or "pulling back the Veil," I think that was foreshadowing the Resurrection Stone. Considering the fact that it allows Harry to speak with Sirius again, and her father is a seeker of the Deathly Hallows, it seems likely, or it's another coincidence that lines up perfectly in HP.

It's my headcanon that the Deathly Hallows were made by studying the Veil, and perhaps using pieces of it in the creation of each Hallow. Like, the Stone could be made from a piece of stone from the archway, the Wand might be made from an elder tree that was near the Veil in it's original location (with the hair of a Thestral as it's core, which share many similarities to the Veil themselves- maybe they come from it), and perhaps the Cloak is made of a piece of the Veil itself.

** Is it fanon that it used to be used as death penalty? Because if canon that would make it guillotine tier knowledge.

Otherwise, well the ministry is only a couple centuries old. The veil has to be far older than that to be considered "mysterious", and there could reasonably have been folklore about it circulating in wizarding society.
