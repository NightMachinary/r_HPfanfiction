** As much as I want to read something like this, I can imagine it would be the biggest angst fest for the first few chapters.

** None that I know of, but it sounds like a neat point of divergence, even if Ron gets bashed so much in fic that I would reflexively recoil from the premise. (Also, there's a good chance that it would just be an excuse for Harry to go all Independent and Gray and Edgy.) So, I'd only read it on personal recommendation and thus could have easily missed some examples.

IMO, someone writing such a fic would need to remember that Ron is important to many people, including Hermione and his family.
