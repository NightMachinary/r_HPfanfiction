** People tend to get into books that let them emphasize with characters in particular situations. So not ironic at all. Plus if you are into Dramoine - might have something to do with the pairing being very OOC and that gets more believable in settings shifted away from canon Hogwarts/wizarding Britain.

** Not at all. Rowling's world, charming as it is, is remarkably small, naive, ignorant, and self centered. The wizards for all their feudal arrogance are parasitical pond scum on the face of humanity, so ignorant that they don't even know that the reins of history have long since slipped their grasp. They are all boring, Rowling's characters. None of them, even Voldemort, possessed true strength or imagination.
