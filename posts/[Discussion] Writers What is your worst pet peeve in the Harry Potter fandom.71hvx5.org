So, writers, what are things that really grind your gears?

Something your readers do, something the sites you post to do? Does it really piss you off when every single word processor refuses to believe that half of the names in Harry Potter are incorrectly spelled, let alone the nouns?


** People that don't understand that this is a hobby for me are pretty annoying. I do this for free in my spare time when I feel like it. I recently received a pm demanding to know why I have abandoned my latest work. When I explained that I haven't abandoned it, I am just not up to writing right now, they said that I was letting down my readers. It's just rude.

And while yes we do this for free, we create worlds for free, which is a concept that astounds me occasionally even now, we still do it.

**** No. There is no good way to prod.

Your best bet is to write a detailed review as a pm discussing plot points you like and why you like them then at the end saying something like "hope the next chapter is going well" and the author might respond with how the next chapter is going and not find you an annoying pissant.

Most people who send messages wanting updates do so in an annoyingly demanding fashion. And make no effort to engage the author. Personally, I like to talk about my stories. I am also very uninterested in providing someone who has never left a review with a timetable of future updates.

Also if you frequently review you are more likely to get a positive response. Authors recognize tags they see a lot.

And If I'm any indication; I respond to pretty much every PM I get, because I feel like if someone took the time to write something they deserve a response. It's not always super prompt but usually by the end of the week if I'm going to respond. If I respond with one sentence, I was probably annoyed by the message; if I respond with paragraphs, I probably wasn't.

**** My two cents as a writer who updates sporadically due to time constraints: the quickest way to usually prod me into action is someone simply telling me how they're enjoying my fic and how they hope I update soon.

Not 'you need/should/have to update' or any other variation of a demand. Just someone saying something that either reminds me and/or reenforces the fact that what I'm writing is being enjoyed by someone so I should get back to working on it.

YMMV of course since every writer or reason for an writer not updating is different but positive or encouraging feedback is rarely a bad thing.

*** That's absolutely rude of them. I will say a minor pet peeve of mine is when an author doesn't finish a story but then I see them posting new stories frequently. This is especially frustrating when they are stories in a long series like Northumbrian and little0bird write.

That said, I'd never feel so entitled as to chide the author or demand anything from them. After all, I knew when I started reading that the story was incomplete. I think it's fair to be upset that a story is unfinished while also accepting that the author owes the reader nothing and is under no obligation to complete.

** For me, it's when people read an AU plotted fic and must be following the plot and the foreshadowing, but rather than ask about what's been clued to them in the fic, they ask a question about something that advanced the plot in the canon instead, and hasn't been mentioned at all.

For example, having someone ask, "When will Harry find out about Snape's Patronus?" when the Patronus identities have been completely ignored and irrelevant throughout the fic. It's just like someone telling you, "Yeah, I'm reading it, but I haven't been paying attention."

That said, let's get serious for a moment. I do believe that the people who claim it to be the least likeable pairing aren't looking at pairings in general but merely at the possibilities of how (and with whom) they could pair the main character. Since in a lot of those situations the proposed contender is compared with the status quo (meaning Ginny) when it comes to how they are better, it leads to a situation where it's easy to declare that she is a wrong partner for him in every single way despite it not being true.

So ... yeah, it's not really a hatred of the pairing as much as it is a vehement dislike of someone who mostly just bloody isn't there for the plot, and I feel that those who actually try to enjoy stories for what they are instead of for whether or not it follows their own image of how everything is are capable of separating the symbol that Ginny was in that pairing with Ginny herself.

I was thinking of using those symbol separators, but I didn't feel like typing them out every time, and I didn't want to copy it to put it in my clipboard because I already had the dash "---" symbol there, and I use that far more often.

* also for ffnet, the entire 'upload a full replacement in order to edit a chapter' design\\
* ficwad's tendency to assume that single letters have simply gotten lost and must be reunited with their consonant-safety-buddy (ex.: A friend becomes afriend) Ficwad's editor has many flaws, but this is the most unpredictable one, and requires re-editing a chapter after it's been posted in order to correct it\\
* several editors tendency to concatenate several repeating characters into one; it cramps my style in dialogue

It's worth noting that these complaints have nothing to do with the fandom. I'm actually rather pleased with the scope and diversity of stories that are permitted and enjoyed by so many.

** Oh, look, another pet peeves thread. Well, might as well contribute.

First is and always will be people misspelling stuff from canon as well as general lack of punctuation and grammar/spelling checks in their work. There are like a bazillion different tools you can use to check what you write, and it's pretty inexcusable to misspell stuff from canon (looking at /you/, Dolores Umbridge).

Second would be people recycling tropes from other stories pretty much in their entirety and adding literally nothing new. At the present a lot of that is centred around A) Daphne Greengrass, B) The Delacours being for some unknown reason really fucking important to France, C) The Wizengamot being the Wizarding government/House of Lords and everyone having "seats", "votes", "lordship rings", "family magic", "alliances between houses like Potter and Longbottom", etc.

Third would be bashing. It's dumb to write a dumbed-down version of a character from canon to illustrate how dumb they are /in canon/. Ron, Ginny, Mrs. Weasley and Dumbledore get the worst of it by far, just because some people can't understand that friends aren't supposed to be 100% sounding boards that back everything you do always and never call you out on your bullshit or, I dunno, have an independent thought once in a while. Manipulative!Dumbledore gets on my nerves here too, but usually because his motivations make literally /no/ sense, and he can only ever act with the skills of a brain-damaged raccoon so that Harry can power-up and beat him down with no challenge for the author's power-wank fantasy. An /actually manipulative/ Dumbledore's machinations would be impossible to detect, and he'd probably end up winning and running off with Harry's money or whatever freely and Harry would be Obliviated, Imperiused, and Love Potioned to the gills. He'd have contingency plans after contingency plans for if shit went wrong and would never be caught with his pants down like in all these stories that feature ol' Manipulative!Dumbles.

Fourth would be people trying to tie actual politics to the Death Eaters, you know, Wizard Nazis. This tends to apply more to American writers as many of them don't look up what being a "Conservative" politician in the UK means before they dub the Death Eaters conservatives, and it just really irritates me because it ends up a whole bunch of weird political grandstanding by people who clearly aren't that interested or informed about actual politics.

Fifth would be the tried-and-tested-and-failed Independent!Harry stories. You know the drill. Sirius has died, leaving all of the main character development already done beforehand, Harry is going through his emo-goth phase when he decides /enough is enough/, and works out, or does martial arts (bonus points if the extent of the author's knowledge of martial arts is a few Jackie Chan movies), goes to Gringotts and is polite to a Goblin and becomes honorary king or whatever and they fall over each other to suck his dick, goes to Diagon Alley and buys a wand with 23 cores, stupid Assassin's Creed wand-wrist-holsters, and a magical trunk that he could live in that is just the most MacGuffin of MacGuffins. Extra bonus points if he is a twat to Ron because reasons, calls Malfoy a ferret, bones Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, Tracey Davis, both Patil Twins because they're obviously into incest because twins (this is offensive to me because I /am/ a twin) and Fleur. Extra-extra bonus points if there's a whole load of BS politics in it, taking us right back to point number 2, stupid Wizengamot BS.

Huh, just realised it was for writers. Well, I suppose I don't like reviewers asking stupid questions, or wanting stories to follow their whims, or object to the pairing and make a point of telling you, or just review "moar plox". Those are all pretty unhelpful.

*** OP was asking for the pet peeves of writers. Not like the other pet peeves threads.

The misspelling of names drives me fucking crazy. Especially Lilly.

It's also annoying when Harry doesn't use any of the things he learns. I've read plenty of fics where he learns martial arts, but none of them have him /ever/ use them.

I don't mind wand holsters though. I feel like they'd be something canon would have, and would explain why Dumbledore can have his wand out in a split second. Though, I find the mental image of Dumbledore with a wand holster kinda odd.

I'd end up missing my catch if I ever had one though. I'd flick my wrist or whatever and the damn thing would probably poke someone's eye out.

Wand holsters actually do appear in Deathly Hallows Part 1, but as a waist-holster thing which one of the Death Eaters wears when they're searching the Hogwarts Express for Harry. I get why wrist holsters would be handy, but I think at this point I'm just sick of seeing them regardless because they're one of the most-used equipment tropes in HP fanfics.

ao3 seems better there, though I haven't tested.
