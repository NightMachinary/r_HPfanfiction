Has a Harry Potter wake up in a field by Hogwarts. He finds a girl version of himself shortly before the First Challenge in the triwizard tournament. She's upset about Ron,especially because she has a crush on him. They talk about it, she feels better and beats the first task. She mends relations with Ron, considers kissing him, but decides against it when she see's Hermione who also helped her during the Task. I think it might have been a less bashy version of SilverAegis's HP and the girl who lived fic. Might have been found either on ff.net, darklordpotter, or archiveofourown. Any chance someone spotted it?


** Just did a quick Google search and came up with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3kp5g8/best_harry_potter_and_the_new_life/][this thread]] that has a lot of these, but most are crap.

That being said, I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet) is the one you're looking for. Unfortunately, it sets up a sequel that was never and probably never will be written.

*** Anyone who cares about quality at all should skip this one. It's barely legible. If you like the premise, "I'm Still Here" is a better written fic based on the same concept.

** It does sound like one of the endless reworks of Silveraegis's fic. Trying to find that specific one might be impossible.
