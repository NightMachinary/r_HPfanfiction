A Harry that was injured somehow before he got his Hogwarts letter. A car accident that maybe that left his spine damaged or something like that. He resigned himself to his fate until his Hogwarts letter came.

After Hagrid or McGonagall come to talk to him and find out about his injuries they take him to St. Mungos or Madame Pomphrey who gives him several potions and cast a few spells and within a week he's already started to make a full recovery.

This not only got him interested in learning more about magic but leads him down the path of a healer. Maybe he takes it a step further and wants to cure everybody he can... like werewolves and the Longbottoms.


** linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) is not about Harry, but it starts in rather similar way. Dudley's daughter is seemingly dying, so he asks Harry for help as his last hope.
