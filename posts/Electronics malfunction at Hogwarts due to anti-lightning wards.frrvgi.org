After all, lightning is a form of electrical discharge, and it seems like the kind of thing that comprehensive magical protections would block. The disruption of electronics would be a side-effect of how exactly the ward functions.

** This makes perfect sense. This is kinda similar to my headcannon why most forms of guns don't work in significantly magical spaces, due to wards against Muggle explosives, from grindwalrds war. Bombing was an real threat, and anyone who was anyone got awarded against most muggle explosives, to the point where it's in the wizarding of the industry standard for warding. No explosions, nothing to propel the bullet out of the chamber. A pneumatic gun (ie. Potato cannon) might still work, but you would need to compress the air beforehand.

**** The sad thing is that there are a number of things that can be used in place of those delicious spuds. Since they use compressed gas there are all kinds of make shift weapons that they can make.

Just replace the spuds with rocks or ball bearings, can't help but think of the metro game series rn..., and you've got dead wizards. Until they cast a shield or transfigure one..

*** There is nothing in canon about guns not working in magical areas. All Hermione says is electronics like radar won't work in overly magical places like Hogwarts. Guns don't use electronics typically, because they're too fragile.

** If those wards are set to be sensitive enough to disrupt extremely delicate electronics like transistors (which can only handle miniscule amounts of energy, really), then they would also inhibit human brain and nervous activity.

In other words, everyone walking into them would instantly die.

**** It really just sounds like an urban legend that's accepted as true despite not actually being so, and those who discover it's bullshit usually keep it secret because they don't want their stuff to be taken away.

Though the "magic in the air" likely does interfere with radio waves, so you're not gonna have any internet or connection, and there's no outlets anywhere so your stuff's useless anyway.

***** I mean, I don't know why you'd say that. Hermione is rarely used like that as a character, she doesn't really know wizarding urban legends and actually holds them to a very low opinion. Heck, why would Hermione know about this and not Ron, if it we're an urban legend? Ron wanted Harry to Summon a rebreather for the 2nd Triwizard Task, but Hermione states it as a fact that too much magic will stop electronics. Not that it overloads circuits because it's too much energy. Electronics just won't work there unless wizards tamper with it to "run on magic"

The whole "electronics don't work near Hogwarts" is just a play on the prior "Wizards are bad at logic" or common sense, that even Muggle tech is foiled by the wizarding substitute. That's really all their is to it. You could say it's like an EMP in effect, but it's not literally a perpetual EMP.

******* She did a ton of extra reading to know about the wizarding world, and early on she had that issue of believing anything if she saw it in a book. I don't doubt that she read enough references to "he-who-must-not-be-named" and his various terrifying (especially to an eleven-year-old) crimes that I could absolutely see her believe that he indeed must not be named. And a lot of her "everybody knows that stuff" really was stuff that you would learn within days of coming in contact with the wizarding world, IIRC.

***** I agree. If I could go to Hogwarts today; purchase 2 Ankers and an owl, and alternate sending them home every week to be charged at home. Cell service may not work but music saved to phones, old iPods, whatever to still have music is good enough for me. I'd even be satisfied with the old janky walkmans/disc mans and an obscene amount of double As. Lol, walk into charms with an old '80s boombox!

**** If I were to give a plausible explanation why electronics don't work, I'd put it down to the unpredictability and non-physics observing part of magic. Circuit boards are precise bits of kit which might not fit well with magic. I could easily imagine the sort of weirdness magic would work on it if it's a mysterious energy which does its own thing based on the thoughts of those around it.

Consider something simple like a battery powered torch/flashlight just suddenly bursting because the filament got a bit too excited, or the batteries just suddenly running out of charge for no apparent reason. That would be enough to discourage using technology. It just wouldn't be very consistent.

*** Unless the wards work based on symbolism. Because it's magic, the existence of which undermines much of our understanding of physics.

Hello Future Me has a video about bending in the Avatar universe called, 'Is Fleshbending Possible?'

Basically it's not, because the magic system is symbolic.

***** Maybe it only works on visible electrical discharge? So people intuitively understand that it's electrical discharge, which they wouldn't for brain function.

Course, I'm sure you could design wards that do that. Or hack them, so they become death traps.

** "Harry is dragon and that's ok" makes a nice explanation of this - basically Hogwarts got awarded against lighting many years before, and then when some old, lamp based electronics made their way there they didn't work, so everyone thinks electronics don't work there at all - but it turns out only free-range lightning/electrical discharge is prohibited, so more modern stuff can work perfectly as all the electricity is contained - same as with human nervous system
