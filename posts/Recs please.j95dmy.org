Any fics like *A Marauder's Plan* , Ellory's fics or There be dragons, harry by scioneeris which have concepts like pureblood culture or family magic or huge world building.

Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(The Prince of Slytherin) has some pretty hardcore world building.

** I've written "Patron", an AU with a very distinct pureblood culture - not just "Old England with some magic", but a culture that split from the muggle world in 1692 and developed differently - in parts much more progressive than the muggle, in parts much more archaic (although, as in reality, old laws aren't enforced equally, and custom and peer pressure limit their application as well.) It's far more magical, though - people use magic all the time, for everything. At meals, dishes are floating around, people summon drinks during breaks, the more spells are on your robes, the more magical they look, the better, and so on. Further, France, Bulgaria, Jamaica, the Balkans, Turkey and Scandinavia all have their own magical culture (and get visited during the story).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
