Looking for a link for the James Potter series please! I have not read any but I know there are several out there. Edit- I guess I should specify that I mean the James Sirius Potter next generation series. Thanks!


** Are you only looking for James Potter next gen? There's also some pretty good Albus Potter next gen out there

This one is ok: Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7090918/1/01-Albus-Potter-and-the-Forgotten-Memory]])

And this one isn't strictly Albus centric: Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers]])

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

*** Ooh, this is excellent! And it's even in other languages. This kind of thing is what I'm looking for when I want to read fanfiction. That said, I think the recommendations in the beginning go a bit too far...But then again, it is said by fans of the fanfiction, so it isn't too pretentious. ...after having starting reading it I can attest that, indeed, according to me at least it deserves the praise, so far I'm loving it. I have only read a fanfiction with original chapter art once before. I even find the American feel of it sort of charming, although it does become a little annoying at times

*** That's the one; writing style is very canon, I like the plot and reads much better than that new fan fiction that Rowling calls canon.
