The two i know of is FFN and AO3. Which one has more fics and/or which site do you prefer for fanfiction. If you use any other site, which one ?

Pls : i am kind of a newbie to Fanfiction, and i want to read about a varied variety of HP fanfics.


** I prefer AO3 because it's a lot easier to filter out what I don't want to read, however there are good quality fics on both AO3 and ffn and there isn't really a reason not to read on both.

** I prefer ffnet for personal reasons.

I am the first to admit that it is not that great in many areas, but it fits my needs and desires perfectly.

like the following:\\
The tags never blatantly lie about what the fic is about, and users can't abuse the tags to be an attention-whore. If the tag is there in ffnet, you are 100 % certain to get it in the fic.\\
On a03 it is a gamble whether or not the author is blatantly lying with their choice of tags.

No smut. God it is satisfying to go through a page of fanfics and not have it filled with 90 % "HURR DURR! THESE TWO CHARACTERS JUST FUCK!". And before anyone says anything about filters, go back to my earlier point. Tags can and do lie frequently, so I can't trust them any more than Harry can trust Umbridge to do what is right.

I personally like the focus on descriptions and summaries over tags. I like to go into fanfic to be surprised and explore the unknown. I understand why some people don't, but I disagree personally. I never liked how tags on Ao3 seem to spoil the entire story and leave nothing to the reader, and as someone who likes surprises, it basically just removes any reason for me to read the story. I already know what is gonna happen after all.\\
Plus it takes more effort to write a good summary over clicking on tags, so if a summary is good, there is a decent chance the fanfic is of equal quality.\\
Anyone can pick tags, not everyone can write an engaging summary.

Also as someone who likes crossovers, the crossover search for fanfics on Ao3 is horrible beyond belief. It is literally just an afterthought with no rhyme or reason put into how it works. It is SO MUCH easier to search for a crossover on ffnet. Plus on ffnet, you don't get those '1000 fandoms in one story' unless you search for them and go out of your way to find them.

but these are personal reasons. Do whatever fits you the best.

*** About the tags personally I hate when the author puts in unnecessary tags or spoils too much of the story as well but overall I think the more robust searching system is better than the bare bones system that ffn uses, the summary thing isn't convincing either and I can't even tell you how many awesome summaries I've read only for the story to turn out being absolute trash. About the smut, are we talking about the same site here? I literally got into fanfiction by reading MHA smut on ffn back when I was a high school freshman and I didn't branch out to non-smut until after a few months of reading smut. Also I hate trying to search for good, well written, non abandoned crossovers on ffn, you have to go way out of your way sometimes to find certain fics especially ones in Marvel or DC since they have different sections for so many different shows, movies, etc and they don't have any crossover with each other unlike in Ao3 where you can have more than 2 fandoms tagged.

**** You make a lot of good points here (like the more powerful searching and the crossovers thing!), but for a point of clarity: the content policies of FFN have restricted smut since 2002. There's a troubling lack of moderation at FFN considering their strict content policies, but we should assume that any explicit sex scenes posted to FFN will risk a reader's report and a moderated takedown. Due to the stricter content policies, I prefer AO3 where takedowns happen only for plagiarism and authors engaging in profit-seeking.

** A /very/ important part of this conversation is the ownership of these two sites and their philosophies and mission.

FFN is a profit-driven company. That's why they have ads and strict content policies. They are beholden to their advertisers, and they need to prioritize their bottom line as a business. I remember the First Great Purge of 2002-2003, and how SO MANY fics were lost due to the new content policies. When FFN receives a cease and desist or a DMCA takedown request, they comply, because they are more liable for damages from copyright infringement due to making money off the ads.

AO3 is run by a non-profit whose mission is to support "transformative" works. Everything from the extensible software system to the content archived is approached in the "free as in freedom" spirit of openness. Just about the only things you cannot do on AO3 are straight-up plagiarism and profit-seeking. When they receive a DMCA takedown request, their abuse team makes sure it's legit, and they also have political lobbyists to protect creators of transformative works. There's a /process/ to it, and they respect the rights of both original creators /and/ fanworks creators.

Due to this philosophy and mission, I publish exclusively at AO3, and when someone rec's a fic at FFN, I check to see if I can read it at AO3 instead.

I also have some archives I like because they cater to my preferred ships, but those aren't necessarily what you are looking for if you are seeking variety.

Welcome to the glorious world of fanfiction :)

*** I actually prefer the FF.Net philosophy and mission. I find AO3 is a bit too kind on plagiarism whereas FF.Net is more focused on the rights of authors, even fan authors. On FF.Net, if someone takes your work, there's a good chance you can get it taken down - though it might take them a while to get around to it. In contrast, on AO3, probably someone taking your fic and writing a continuation of it - for decades considered absolutely no-go in fanfic communities - is going to be protected by AO3, not punished.

**** If someone is "taking your work" then you should submit an abuse report. Straight-up plagiarism can and will be removed at AO3.

Continuations of other fanworks is trickier. It would be inconsistent to call that plagiarism while supporting general fanworks, and I personally don't think it should be "punished" at all, but supported in a way that gives everyone credit. I do see your point, and how historically there's an etiquette to acquiring permission to continue abandoned fics or borrow ideas from other fanworks creators. AO3 has a mechanism for linking "Related Works" that /should/ provide a nice compromise, but that would mean actually /using/ it.

That's probably the biggest issue with AO3 -- educating users on the etiquette of fandom communities, and how the features of AO3 can help you give credit where credit is due. It's a similar issue with the tagging system, too, where tags are incomplete or misleading because the users either don't know or deliberately exploit the feature. FFN is older and more established with these things, and once upon a time they had sufficient moderation to enforce it. The fanfiction world is exploding right now (record traffic to FFN and AO3 over the last year), so instead of relying on moderation, we may need to figure out a more holistic approach to maintaining etiquette in fandom spaces.

I don't really have a good answer to that.

You provided good food for thought, thanks, and I'm just throwing out related ideas :)

To everyone else: save your downvotes for anyone clearly making shit up on cut-and-dried topics. This one is thinking hard about nuanced IP issues, and that is important stuff. I know my own opinion is biased, and think we are /lucky/ to have options like FFN v AO3 to compare these kinds of issues.

****** Thanks for that link! Good considerations, especially for incomplete works. In general, I absolutely agree with your A-through-E approach.

Not that I'm arguing, but just a way to think about 1st and 2nd order derivatives... AO3 is built on software that uses in "copyleft" licensing -- in short, derivative works are allowed as long you continue to allow derivative works. It's a very common approach to software development, and it has many benefits to building open communities.

My preferences as a software developer may be spilling over into my preferences for intellectual property rights around fics. Will have to think more on it. Thanks again!

I mean, if fanfic authors can do it to published works, why can't fanfic authors do it to other fanfictions?

Edit: I just read your linked piece in another comment. I hadn't considered the “usurpation” and “moral right to be recognized as the creator of a work” angle which is a problem for fanfic writers but not for famous writers of published work. I understand where you're coming from.

Edit: You can downvote me all you want because you don't like what I say, but that doesn't make me any less right. I have never seen a report come back in less than four months, even when a story blatantly admits to being plagiarized in its description. And the ToS FAQ says

#+begin_quote
  What's the difference between "teen and up" and "mature"? Likewise, this is almost entirely up to the creator's judgment. In response to valid complaints about highly explicit content, the abuse team may redesignate a fanwork marked "general" or "teen and up" to "not rated," as explained in the abuse policy, but our policy is generally to defer to the creator's decision.

AO3 cares far more about about giving authors the ability to do whatever they want than it does anything else, including giving readers a reasonable experience. You can report stories all you want, but it won't accomplish anything.

** There is no better website in my opinion, it really depends on authors and most of the time you'll find that authors post on multiple websites.

I think there is more choice on ffnet (+800 000 fanfictions). I prefer to read ln there because I like the app. You can also find really old fanfics, from 2004 etc..

If you want more specific tags I suggest Ao3, it would make it easier to look for fanfics. It also has more mature fanfictions in my opinion, so if you're not looking for graphic content pay attention to the tags.

I tend to avoid wattpad to be honest because 1) some people steal content and repost it on there without the author's consent and 2) The quality of the fics isn't that good in my opinion. That beeing said, you cans till find some good ones and I've read on there sometimes.

Those are the only websites I know. I went on potions and snitches some months ago when i was looking for Snape mentors Harry fanfics, and it also has some good fics and one shots.

** Welcome to the fandom! :)

FFN has more fics, but AO3 is very large too. I first started reading fanfic on FFN, but nowadays I strongly prefer AO3 and almost always skip fic recommendations that aren't crossposted on AO3. That being said, I think a lot of people use both regularly! You'll get recommendations for fics on both websites here (skewed toward FFN) and on [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] (skewed toward AO3).

I prefer AO3's mission (described in someone else's comment) and personally just find the interface on FFN really ugly. I also tend to search by trope, so I appreciate being able to search by tags like "time travel" on AO3. It's not hard to put in a couple of exclusionary filters for things you don't want to read (e.g. "dubious consent") when you run a search if you see those results popping up a lot, or to filter your search by the tag "POV Harry Potter," for example, if that's all you want. I hated searching on FFN when I used that site more regularly because I felt like it took me forever to find what I wanted to read. Some people prefer searching by summaries and others prefer searching by tags, and that may end up being a deciding factor for you once you've tried both. Clearly, I'm a tag person.

I might get downvoted for this, but I think this sub's hostility to slash and other non-standard (e.g. Snape/Hermione) fics is bleeding into the comments here somewhat because those fics are more often posted on AO3. AO3 also has different content rules than FFN because of its differing mission. I personally have negative interest in reading a lot of things that are posted on AO3 (e.g. incest). However, like I said above, I just don't see it as that big of an inconvenience to filter those things out if I notice they're repeatedly popping up in my results, and I appreciate having the heads-up that difficult content is in my future if I decide to read a fic that has a warning for non-consensual sex or major character death. If someone on this sub doesn't want to read any slash or sexual content whatsoever, all it takes is checking four "exclude" boxes in the filters tab: mature, explicit, m/m, and f/f. I don't think I've ever come across a situation where the author lied with their tags, and I'm sorry that the other commenter did. (Edit: I guess I can remember one time that something I thought should have been tagged wasn't, but it was warned for in the author's note before the story.) It's not a common problem as far as I'm aware. Some authors do put annoying jokey commentary in their tags but I'd say that's the exception not the rule, especially for the highest quality fics. (I highly recommend sorting your search results by kudos or bookmarks!) Those tags aren't searchable, so really the only issue is that they take up more space on the page than is necessary when you're scrolling through results. Again, for me, that's not something that bothers me that much. My ability to quickly filter to the exact types of fics I'm looking for (e.g. "time travel," "POV Harry Potter," and "First War with Voldemort") is worth sometimes having to go back and put in a few exclusionary filters. YMMV!

** ao3 is good, if you don't mind scrolling down for hundreds of hours because writers absolutely NEEDS to tell you that =their precious cinnamon rolls are absolutely not going to die= =yes don't worry I'm gonna make it all good != =Bad feelings are better left on the doorstep != =Seriously I don't understand why Draco isn't more liked he's such a cinnamon golden boy= =It's not bashing I'm writing them as they were written in canon= =Snape deserved better=

I may or may not have forgotten a hundreds tags, the extensive characters list (on one hand, FFN and its 4 main characters only, a little limited - on the other, AO3 and its thousands of characters whose only relevance to the plot is that they applaud during Harry's performance in fourth year), the thousand of fics with a hundreds fandoms crossovered just because they can, and all of that just for one measly chapter. They put more effort into the cover than in the story itself.

Don't get me wrong, there's good stuff on AO3, sometimes, but most of the times it's... Meh.

** Ok, first, welcome. This is a fun and long lived fandom, so you are spoiled for choice.

[[https://youtu.be/ZfSgd3RXqEg]] 《-- this is a good primer on how to navigate AO3, FFN, and Wattpad. Coley is a cheerful resource for fanfic reading. I also recommend her videos on fanfic terms.

Now, I started reading fic on FFN in 1998/2000 (not sure which, as i was in DBZ at that time and lived in webrings too), and it has not changed that much in all the time. As such you will find a lot of older and forgotten works there. A lot of it will be from before Order of the Phoenix, or before the Half Blood Prince. There are good things to be found here, but some maybe cringy now.

AO3 is my preferred haunt now, but a lot of that is due to me paying (crowdfunded before there was a Kickstarter) into the creation of it back when LiveJournal was purging fandom creations, especially smut, and following my faves over to it. AO3 does allow for overtagging, but it also allows for you to exclude in searches, which is amazing. Also, a lot of old archives are now hosted on AO3. I recommend searching Ink-Stained Fingers if you want some good old slash. HPFandom is another archive they saved and I loved.

If you need recommendations, just lurk here. There's always something interesting popping up.

** FFnet is still much bigger, I believe, and still much more popular, so you can get more viewers. But that's it: AO3 web design is much more readable (I don't use an app for any of these), it has much better tools for search, and especially, it allows threaded comments, so true discussion may happen. Moreover, FFnet seems to be struggling financially so sometime they are having nervous fits when they are making life more difficult both for readers and publishers.

** FFn because of the amount of fics on there (which makes it a pain to actually find decent fics); AO3 has a few exclusive fics worth tracking, but the tag system is, frankly, a fucking mess. Sometimes, one story has an entire fucking quarter of a web-page dedicated to one story's tags!

However, that being said, the tag system, while a nightmare to search with, is great for weeding out fics you aren't interested in reading on a personal level, such as "yaoi" or "Harry/Draco".

If FFn implemented a filter system for characters, though, it'd improve the site overnight.

Heck, for example, having an option that excludes certain pairings (such as [Harry P./Draco M.] and [Severus S./Harry P]) on the main HP FFn listing would make it far, far easier to help someone narrow down fics you'd be interested in, other than sifting through crap for that one potential gem out of a million shit-fics.

Heck, being able to exclude fandoms in the crossover category (such as Naruto or other anime) would be great.

Alas, FFn looks like they'll never implement such a desperately needed feature or two.
