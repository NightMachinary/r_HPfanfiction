I was never a fan of the whole "Moste Ancient and Moste Noble House of Potter" thing. Just gonna say that outright. But bear with me, because it's not just shitting on Lordship fics.

FIrst, that is what the Black family called itself.

Second, it was very clearly antiquated from Sirius' comments.

Obviously, it is way for "old families" to seem more important. However, most of these "old families" choose a side in Magic, which they are traditionally aligned with, and which's opposite they despise and oppose. So why would a house like Potter (or whatever), which was traditionally Light, have the same descriptor as the Black family, which is traditionally Dark?

It would be much more interesting if all the families had their own weird little titles, decided somewhere in the past when such things were important enough to be squabbled over. So the list of houses would look like this:

- The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black

- The Radiant and Righteous House of Potter

- The Wise and Mighty House Longbottom

- The Venerable House of Bones

- The Purest House of Gaunt

- The Most Glorious and Exhalted House of Slytherin

And so on and so forth. It seems much more likely to me that someone (maybe the Black family) started this whole trend by calling themselves some big and pompous adjective, and that all the other busybodies scrambled to make up their own titles.

So it went something like this:

"I, Reginald Urkard, of the Moste Supreme House of Urkard..."

And then it descended into chaos as all the members of the Wizengamot or whatever pureblood party they were at began making up titles to flex on the rest of them.

*Plus, this sort of thing fosters originality. I'm getting very tired of reading the same story over and over and over again.

**Plus Plus, you can call a House "awesome", because that was just a normal word at one point (meaning what "awe-inspiring" means today). So you could for example write "The Most Awesome House of Lockhart" and it would be glorious as well as historically accurate.


** The only person who calls himself a Lord in canon is Voldemort. It seems he picked a title that wasn't well-known to wizards to make himself sound more mysterious.

JKR posted extra info on the Malfoys saying they actually are descendants of people who had muggle titles, and they could use a muggle nobility title if they wanted to. They don't in canon because they would not want to be associated with muggles.

Sirius uses the phrase "most ancient and noble" as a sarcastic joke, doesn't he? His parents thought very highly of themselves and he liked to make fun of them for it. The family motto toujours pur is canon, and it's possible other old families had similar mottos.

The sacred twenty eight list was written anonymously and doesn't seem to be widely respected or even widely known of in canon. Anyone becomes a pureblood if all four grandparents are magical in canon.

Fanon can of course do what it wants with lordships, but the point for it in canon is that Voldemort is the only one with that title. Wizards make up their own titles, like supreme mugwump and the like.

** I always assumed only Noble and Most Ancient were used for pure-blood families because they referenced their statuses pre-Statute of Secrecy. A family that was made Noble, say, in the fifteenth-century or before, would be called 'Noble and Most Ancient House of X' but if the family was ennobled after that set date they would only be called 'Noble House of X'. That way, you can distinguish the aristocracy from the rabbles and even in the aristocracy, you can distinguish the more senior and affluent families from the junior ones.

Most, if not all fanfics using this trope, will use only one title, and that is Lord/Lady. There is no Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron hierarchy, so people use that distinction. As I said before, these descriptives wouldn't be used to describe the people who make the Houses themselves, but the Houses' status in the wizarding world.

Although, I think you're hitting something with 'The Venerable House of Bones'. It's not that exactly, but the lower Lords of the House of Lords are called the Honourable X and I think it would be great to add 'The Honourable House of X' to the wizarding aristocracy of Great Britain. Noble and Most Ancient would equivalate to Dukes and Marquesses, so like Black, Malfoy, Greengrass, Longbottom; Noble would be Earls and Viscounts, so Nott, Smith, Fawley, Selwyn, Potter (if you want to make them nobles), Lestrange; Honourable would be Barons and lower so Bones, Abbott, Parkinson, etc.

In the end, I think your idea is good in its essence, but the varying descriptives seems more Medieval than Early Modern, which is when, IMO, these kinds of things and the general fleshing out of 'pure-blood culture' would have happened.

** The moniker is canon, via pottermore. It was started by a Nott and had the families that followed the doctrine of blood purity. The Potters were excluded because of their "Blood traitor activities."

If it seems dumb to you don't include it in your stories, I really like your take tho, and look forward to seeing it action.

*** I don't see the phrase “noble and most ancient” on that page (which might just mean my phone isn't showing me the whole page, so please correct me if I'm wrong.) The “Sacred 28” are all “purebloods” but the Black family's particular set of pompous adjectives seems uniquely theirs.

**** That's correct. No one else in the Sacred 28 is canonically described that way. Most of them aren't even described as a "house" in any canon source, even major ones like the Malfoys. In canon, they're always just a "family"

**** It's fortunate that in fanfiction, you're free to ignore what JKR says about the series, otherwise we'd be stuck with wizards just shitting themselves. As far as I'm concerned only things explicitly said in the 7 books are canon, the movies are their own separate canon and the things JKR says on twitter, in interviews, or pottermore are her headcanon.

**** JKR's magic system is extremely soft, and her worldbuilding is very contained around Harry and his perspective. The first part is what makes it such a wonder inspiring series to read as a kid and the 2nd part helps you see from Harry's eyes, since you learn about things like penseives and Floo travel when he does. But once you're older and expose yourself to series with incredible, detailed worldbuilding and intricate magic systems the WW comes across as very shallow.

***** I think it's more that all her "reveals" are negative statements. So you ask something, and she says "no". At least metaphorically.

So instead of broadening her world, like making an open-ended mockup of a herbology book with "might not contain all species" at the start, she decides to go the opposite route and "clarify" that things are more umbrella-like than people had assumed.

- Instead of wizards being inspired by roman architecture, they canonically shit themselves.

- Instead of there being whacky names for all the families, they all use a dumb, standardized, boring moniker.

It goes on like this. She "clarifies" things, and instead of writing new material to fill the hole of potential she just erased, she does nothing, chipping away at the things canon implied bit by bit by bit.

**** The less revealed it is, the more you fill in the gaps with your own thoughts. Obviously the more that gets set into canon, that'll fit less well with how you imagine it and it's disappointing.

Harry Potter never had /great/ worldbuilding - the main thing it did very well was create a world very similar to ours but with some twists that made the reader interested/find it a strange/charming, but recognizable, world.

*** It has something to do with how long they have being active right? With Most being added after a time.

I always found the concept of them naming themselves Sacred Among themselves hilarious, I am pretty sure families "excluded" by it but old or powerful enough that they should have been included would just laugh.

** I think there's an appeal to having them all standardized - that is, the same way noble titles were somewhat standardized IRL, it would make some sense for all of them to use similar addresses (eg: 'Most Ancient and Noble' vs 'Ancient and Noble' vs 'Noble' would make sense at keeping it all in the same style). The address used by the Black family is also applicable to both light and dark houses - so it strikes me more as something that anyone would be able to use instead of just the dark magic houses.

Your method would work, for sure - but speaking personally, I think I'd struggle to take it all too seriously if every house pops in with some new - and increasingly contrived - moniker. I think I'd find it more fitting for them to vary their house mottos, instead, to show off their peculiarities.

** I really like the idea, but my brain cannot take the word righteous seriously since Ferris Bueller's day off. For some reason, I'm picturing James' father as Jeff Bridges (of The Dude era of Bridges) and introducing the family as the Radiant and Righteous House of Potter and it's making me giggle like a small child. :D
