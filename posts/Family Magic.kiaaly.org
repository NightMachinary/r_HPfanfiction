There are so many fics where there is a family magic present for the ancient families such as the Ancient and most Noble House of Potter, Black and so on. There is also a family totem shaped like an animal that represents the family magic.

My question is how does family magic exist. How is this family magic formed. When the families are very long and there are many witches and wizards over time does a small part of their magic keep culminating together to form the family magic?


** usually when i find mentions of "family magic" it's that a family creates spells and only shares them with their descendants, like a spellbook that will get updated and added to but only given to their children and not every random witch/wizard

*** That's how it is in my fic. Spells passed down throughout the centuries that aren't shared outside specific family members. That and with a particularly old family, they have resources to super old Druid magic that nobody cares to learn anymore.

** My fic has two different approaches to 'family magic.' First with the Blacks, a Black back in the Roman Empire got desperate, and created a physical object that collected small amounts of magic from family members while they slept, storing it for when it was needed. (On AO3, my fic has the 'The Black Family has an I.W.I.N. Button' and 'But the batteries ran out' tags.)

On the other hand, the Potters settled in a magically strong location and built their home, and over time living there and casting spells left an 'impression' of sorts. Basically, the normal magic that exists in the air/earth at their home has been colored by the people living there over the centuries. When Harry decided to cast a Fidelius Charm over the whole property (basically fields and the ruins of the ancestral house) the residual magic came to his aid and helped him cast a spell beyond his power to cast. Also, let him use magic that would otherwise have killed him in the newest chapter.

** Depends on the story. The author could make it so that there's actual family magic that's passed through the blood.

But I am actually a fan of the other 'family magic'

The one that since there's been a bunch of wizards on this family, they have made a lot of spells that only get written and taught to family members and that's family magic.

It makes a lot more sense than having a weird totem that beams knoledge to your head

** I'm not really a fan of the concept, but how I see it; we know magic is somewhat hereditary, we've seen this in abilities like parseltongue and metamorphmagic. Magic isn't inherently sentient. It's simply interlocked with the users, which leaves traces of the personality and skills on the magic it carries over into the next generation. When this happens often enough the magic forms it's own minor sentience; a reflection of the past generation.

This magic is mostly neutral. Ancestor A might have been very good at defence, but ancestor B was very bad at it, so it evens out, which means new muggleborn are just as talented as every other magical family. Some are slightly better than average at a single magical field, but they have an equal chance of being slightly worse than average in another field.

There are extremely few exceptions, where a single person was powerful enough to leave a bigger mark on the magic than normal. In the case of the Black family this was a mentally unstable person that excelled at the dark arts. The wielders leave a mark on the magic, this however also means that the magic leaves a equally minor mark on the wielders. Which is the origin of the 'Black Madness'.

The family magic has a minor sentience, so it can be called upon to act. It's personality and morals echoes the previous holders in these cases.

** My belief is that when Magic first appeared in the world, the different users, or first of the family, had abilities geared towards certain aspects. As time went on, these skills would adapt to current events. If any families intermarried, the magic would fuse into a combination.

Ex. Potter's have Pottery related skills and marry into the Black's with Dark Magic Skills. The combination produces strong defensive curse building skills.

*** If any families intermarried-

You know that they practice that and everybody is everybody's cousin? How would that then work? Everybody can use everything then?

** hmm i thought of it as a secret rite to protect the lines -- distilled from whatever ancient sources they had. for instance- - quite a few families are descendants of the peverells - including the Gaunts and Potters, right? Makes sense that their family magic would be specified through some death defying ways..

i really like the way magic from families was explained in ffnet's Stepping Back by TheBlacks'sResurgence

** In my fanfic it was Merlin's magic that he gifted to families he trusted to work together to protect the wizarding community after he was gone. (Unfortunately, not all those families did their duty) It adds a boast of power to the Head and Heir of the family.
