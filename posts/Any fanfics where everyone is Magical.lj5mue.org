I've seen lots of fanfics where everyone is a Muggle, but haven't seen one's where everyone is Magical, this would include the Dursleys Hermione's parents etc.

** I actually saw a fic like that today. But I didn't read it so I don't if it's well written or anything. Let me find it.

I can't find it but I know they exist.
