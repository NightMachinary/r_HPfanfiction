Basically the fic is like this; Harry's parents on the run are attacked by the authorities of wizarding England and two-year-old Harry, caught in the crossfire, is kidnapped and handed over to the newly created orphanage for magical children. He grew up there, befriends Hermione and Neville. They're basically a bit of outcasts, but no one bullies them or anything. When they turn eleven, they go to Hogwarts and are like other teenagers. Harry doesn't have to overcome such obstacles as in the canon, his only problems are Quidditch, the school enemy and infatuation. In addition, many people notice how quickly he develops and helps him polish his skills to perfection. However, they do not report it to the Dark Lord, knowing that if they become interested in the boy, it could end badly for their protégé.

In Harry's sixth year, a lot happens. The qualifying competition for the Triwizard Tournament is approaching. The Order of the Phoenix, considered by the public to be a terrorist gang, resumes its attacks after many years of silence and kills innocent victims, or so the public says. Potter's friend mysteriously disappears, Hermione is adopted by the Lestranges, and Tom Riddle becomes more interested in Hogwarts. The hero in the middle of this madness has to come to terms with his feelings and beliefs, and what's worse, the Duel Contest date is approaching!

What's next? I don't know yet. But I'm going to be writing this book soon, and hopefully it'll be good. What do you think about the sketch?


** Well, this would need to be a very different Voldemort. First thing after taking over Britain/Europe and securing his sovereignity would be to kill all his followers and institute a dictatorship with less radical people from the new government. His old followers are too extremist to actually govern anything - they'd fall into the same loop all fascist governments fall into (creating ever-tighter margins of purity until they divide and collapse), so they gotta go.

Then, Voldemort would need to gain legitimacy before the ICW and prove he's not actually about to bring the SoS crashing down, an act that would require changing his original tactics and motivations to fundamentally oppose interacting with the muggle world. Instead of building on supremacy, he'd need to build on isolationism, a stance that would serve to strengthen his position on the ICW and not bring the might of all wizards on the planet down on his head when he starts getting somewhere.

With this new regime, he could become a sort of shadow emperor that took over the country in a bloody war, killing thousands, and then receded to leave a puppet government in charge of the country in his name. He prevents the new government from radicalizing overly much, but is absent otherwise. This new government would likely continue down the road of isolationism, creating laws and legislation restricting contact between the muggle and magical worlds until muggleborns are kidnapped and replaced with squibs, all economic contact is severed and the magical world recedes behind unbreakable barriers. A generation after this war, the muggle world would be a distant memory at best.

I have... issues with any fic that tries to portray Voldemort's original movement as capable of actually running a government.

*** Honestly, I didn't think of it that way. But thank you, it made me think and changed the plot a bit.

** Why would Hermione go to a magical orphanage ?

Sounds interesting otherwise. Do you have solid decisions made on pairings or bashing ?

*** When I first started making this up, Hermione was supposed to live in the Order forever. Why? In my first project, Voldemort was a bit more like a canon. I changed that later because his personality is the key point in this book. But I am departing from the topic. Hermione is in an orphanage because she and most Muggle-borns have been kidnapped from their homes. Mainly because Tom wants to completely isolate wizards from Muggles and try to develop absolutely all magicians so that they know the traditions, basic rituals and other such that he and some others have been denied and bring the wizarding world into the Golden Age.

Her parents don't remember her, so even if she wanted to come back, and you have to point out that if Hermione was raised as a sorceress, there's no reason to do so, she really wouldn't have anything to do with it. Her family's memories of her were permanently erased, and violations of the Charter of Secrets were punished by Azkaban.

Overall, thanks for the opinion. It means a lot :)
