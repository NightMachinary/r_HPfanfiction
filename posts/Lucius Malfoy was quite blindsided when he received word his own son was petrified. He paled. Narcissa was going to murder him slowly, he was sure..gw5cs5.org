** No matter who you asked, they would all tell you, that Lucius Malfoy was a proud man. His money, connections, and pedigree ensured that when he entered a room, his very stance declared that none present were his equal. That quality seemed entirely absent in the wretched creature, trying to find shelter, in its own home.

At present, the Lord of Malfoy was cowering behind a large armchair, while desperately trying to pretend that wasn't the case. He'd come to find it gave no protection against the beast now stalking him.

"Would you care to explain how our /son/ came to be petrified, husband?"

His wife - his beautiful, /furious/ wife - slowly advanced on him, with a look in her eyes, that could curdle milk, and her wand pointed at the ground.

"Narcissa, /please/! This doesn't have to end in death!"

Her laughter, as if she was truly amused by the whole thing, did nothing but fill him with more dread.

"Don't be so dramatic, Lucius. Death, after all, is a perfectly natural part of life" she said lightly "... and there's nothing /natural/ about what I'm going to do to you."

** “Would you be so kind, honey, and explain me how extremely Dark object, which was threatening whole school /including our son in it/ appeared there?”

Her words were sweet and kind but the curses flying around him and destroying everything in the room were not. Only in the noise of his own house being destroyed Lucius reminded himself, that his so proper and polite wife was a sister of Bellatrix Lestrange. He didn't need to pull out his wand for curses flowing from his mouth. He didnt't dare to even think about it.

** Narcissa quietly sipped her tea, a cold look in her eye as she glared at Lucius.\\
"I can't slowly and excruciatingly torture you to death, /darling/, as much as I'd like to," she quietly said, "'Mr. Malfoy vanishes after son is petrified' might send the wrong message."\\
Lucius just sat frozen, not daring to move from his seat as his wife monologued.\\
"At least, I can't slowly kill you the medieval way," Narcissa muttered as she took another sip, "Keeping up appearances requires a...more refined, shall we say, method."

Lucius's eyeballs bulged as Narcissa listed off, one after the other, the kind of people he absolutely /didn't/ want to keep company with. Both for personal reasons and for reputational reasons.\\
"Oh yes, I've scheduled tea and biscuits with the Finch-Fletchleys first, quite high class for muggles," Narcissa gloated as she continued to sip at her teacup, "You'll be here, of course, because we need to grieve together after all...and because if you take so much as one step outside the front gate you'll find out what a Leashing Curse does first-hand."

*** To his immense cognitive dissonance Lucius and Mr Finch-Fletchley get on like a house hit with Fiendfyre, bonding over their shared snobbery, dry wit and love of cognac. Hector turns out to be the refined gentleman conversationalist Lucius had search for in vain in the Dark Lord's circle, an honest to Merlin *friend* he had always secretly longed for.

Two and a half years later Narcissa and he are attending the Finch-Fletchley's garden party, happily mingling with Eaton graduates and landed gentry, when Lucius suddenly finds himself knocked on his arse, the mark on his arm burning like a branding iron.

That goes over like a lead ballon.

He'd never in all his years seen himself talking to Albus Dumbledore with anything but disdain, nevermind offering his services as a spy.

But Slytherins are nothing but fiercely protective of those they consider family and Lucius will not stand by idly twirling his wand as his 'Lord' murders the man he now thinks of as a brother.

** Lucius Malfoy had briefly known what he was getting into when he had married Narcissa Black. The Black's were wealthy and powerful, so his and Narcissa's union would be a fitting one.

Narcissa had been the perfect choice for a wife. She wasn't wild and insane like Bellatrix, nor was she rebellious and defiant like Andromeda. She was polite, elegant, beautiful, patient and well-mannered.

Maybe that was the reason that he momentarily forgot that his darling wife /was/ a daughter of the Ancient and Noble House of Black- the very feared house of Black had been reputed for their very /creative/ spell-work and familiarity with Dark Magic.

Lucius would never forget that little detail ever again.

“Narcissa -Cissa- please be reasonable!” He +pleaded+ asked, as a severing charm was thrown his way.

“Reasonable?” Narcissa asked lightly, her eyebrows raised. Even while throwing not-so-legal curses at him, her voice never rose and she could still be mistaken for the personification of grace. “And please tell me, my dear husband, how I am supposed to act to find out my only son has been petrified by a monster that /you/ released into a school full of children?” She asked softly.

“It wasn't supposed to happen this way!” He said, dodging a purple beam of light that he had no intention of finding out what it did.

“Tell that to my son.” Narcissa replied sweetly.

A column of fire erupted from her wand. Lucius ducked just in time to save his head, but his hair wasn't so lucky. He mentally mourned for the strands that had been singed.

“Narcissa, the mandrake potions are being prepared.” Lucius said hurriedly in the middle of dodging what he was 99% sure was the castration charm. “Don't you think we should discuss this calmly?” The 'Preferably not while killing your husband' part, Lucius decided was better left unsaid.

Narcissa pursed her lips and stopped her assault of spells.

Lucius almost fell down on his knees in relief. Thank Merlin her anger hadn't blinded her to seeing reason.

Narcissa seemed to have read his mind in that moment. “Oh my silence doesn't mean I agree with you.” She said, casually twirling her wand. “It means that your level of stupidity has just rendered me speechless for a moment there. Well, guess what?” Her eyes glinted. “Moments over.” She said cooly.

A body binding spell was flung at him simultaneously with a gold coloured spell that he was confident was the organ liquifying curse. He had to choose which to deflect. In the end, he decided he liked having his organs intact more than he preferred to not be body-bound. His wand flew from his hand as he fell to the ground.

Narcissa walked slowly to him and kicked his wand further away from him with her expensive heels. She flashed him a smile so beautiful that it would make angels blush with envy. “Don't worry Lucius. I have no intentions of becoming a widow at this moment and Draco is quite fond of you. Boys have to have a father to look up to in this age, after all.” She said softly. “Besides, people will talk if Mr Malfoy goes /missing/ a few days after his son gets petrified... But darling, there are so many ways to hurt somebody without it showing up physically.” She continued casually, making Lucius pale. Her smile grew wider. “And you, my darling husband, will have the pleasure of experiencing each and every one of them until /my/ son is awake, happy and healthy once more.”

Lucius's eyes widened.

Narcissa's icy blue eyes became frosty, and her smile turned into one of a more sadistic nature. “You should have never done anything to hurt my son, darling.”
