[ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling][J. K. Rowling]] (= “JKR”) is sitting among children, adults, and muppets, telling a new story. ]

*JKR:* Today I'm going to tell you a new story about Harry Potter and Hermione, which happens sometimes at present. Hope you enjoy it.

[ The crowd says “Yay!”. ]

*JKR:* Harry and Herminoe were having a friendly dinner in a restaurant...

[ Cut to the restaurant with Harry and Hermione (played by their original actors) sitting and chatting.

A waitress arrives with their order. ]

*Waitress:* [To Hermione] Here is your tea and crumpets, madame.

*Hermione:* Thank you! [Puts sugar in her tea , and drops her spoon to the floor.]

*Hermione:* Oh, never mind, I can use my wand. [Uses the wand to physically stir the tea.]

*Waitress:* And here is your Sushi, sir.

*Harry:* Many thanks. I never like the chopsticks that the restaurant provides so I think I'll take my wand and the matching one I got from Voldermort and... [Eats the Sushi with the two wands as chopsticks.]

*JKR's voice:* and shortly after that, Harry and Hermione saw someone very much like the late [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore][Dumbledore]].

[ Dumbledore Two who looks like Cookie Monster with a Dumbledore-like hat appears. ]

[ Harry and Hermione look at him with amazement. ]

*Harry & Hermione:* Dumbledore?

*Dumbledore Two:* No, me is his successor: Dumbledore Two.

[ He takes a 2-like number from behind his back. After a short while he eats it. ]

*Dumbledore Two:* num num num... delicious!

*Dumbledore Two:* In any case, Harry, Hermione, it is your mission to fight “He who must not be named Two”.

*Harry:* Really, who is he?

*Dumbledore Two:* His name is [[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amazing_Mumford][The Amazing Mumford]] and he is an evil dark arts' wizard, whose magic is so awful that people are annoyed and wish to die. You must seek and destroy him.

*Hermione:* I see. But why did you spell out his name if he must not be named?

*Dumbledore Two:* me didn't say who must not name him.

*Dumbledore Two:* Farewell, and good luck.

[ Dumbledore Two disappears in a puff of smoke. ]
