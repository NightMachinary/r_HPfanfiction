** There's a super old set of stories called Switchverse, [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/tag/switchverse]], which wasn't completed but is fun nonetheless. The basic plot line is that Fred and George spill some sort of confusion potion on the sorting hat before Harry's year starts, so everyone in the class ends up in the wrong house (Harry and Draco are Hufflepuffs, Ron and Pansy Ravenclaws, etc). I remember it being a very fun read.

#+begin_quote
  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Do you want Harry + other characters in a different house or just other characters in a different house? I think there are more of the latter than the former. I could suggest a few for Hermione, Ginny, and Draco!
