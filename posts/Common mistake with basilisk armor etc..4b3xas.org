When reading fanfics where harry doesn't kill the basilisk but still uses the shed skin to make armor. However, shed skin could not do this, it is not nearly tough enough. Only the whole skin could be used for this purpose to create leather. Just a small thing that grinds my gears.


** 1. I have never heard of a fic where the shed skin is used. Its always taken from the body.

2. The physical durability of basilisk hide is never explored.

3. The magical resistance of the hide is likely on par with dragons, giving the armor a degree of protection against things which aren't physical violence. Both are class XXXXX creatures.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** I hate basilisk hide armour in stories. It's not a flying animal so it wouldn't need to evolve thin skin. So for me, it's incredibly thick to both protect and insulate a burrowing creature.

Actually, I hate dragon leather armor too because it's always so OP.

Now characters rediscovering the properties of armour could be an interesting story. I'm basicallly doing that in my Darkness!Harry story.

** It's things like this that make me realize how much fanfiction there is with this series. I've been reading HP fanfics for almost a year now, and I have never come across a story where he makes basilisk armor, but apparently this is a thing. Guess I have a long way to go!
