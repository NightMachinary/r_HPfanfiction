Hey all!

It turns out an old favorite author of mine has long since been removed off the internet!

Did anyone save any of the fics by the author: someoneotme ??

The original fics were on aff.net.

The only title I remember off the top of my head is Bruised, a story of a nonsexual D/S relationship between Harry and Snape after Snape finds our that Harry is in an abusive relationship with Marcus Flint.

The other stories I remember by this author is a D/S relationship between Harry and Lucius, where Harry used to be Snape's sub but Snape died in the war and asked Harry to go to Lucius in his will.

Any help would be appreciated!!!

*** I have, I can't seem to find it on a single other site. The only site I'd ever found it on was adultfanfiction.net. The author's profile is still up, but the stories are gone.
