Ok guys I know this is a long shot but I'm going to try anyways. It's a time travel fic with Blaise, Hermione, Luna, and Draco. Harry failed in the original task and committed suicide. Luna is Draco's cousin and set the trio back as a sacrifice she lost her eyesight. They go back to before first year and then the story continues. Harry is in Slytherin. I loved the idea of the story. I'm just trying to refind it. My fanfiction.net account didn't save it.


** Do you remember what the word count was around and who was tagged in the description?

*** I don't remember the word count, but I do know Draco and Hermione were tagged, and that's it.

**** I asked my sister to help out. She's in a group specifically made to find fanfictions that someone wants to read but can't find. I'll let you know if they find it.
