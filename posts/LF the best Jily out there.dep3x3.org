So, I have just discovered Jily, and the Marauders Era. I'm going a bit mad looking through terrible stuff, but have found a few gems that make it worth it. Please help, fanfic reader in need! SOS, Jily readers.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

** linkao3(sunshine in my eyes by monroeslittle) and linkffn(and all the wolves cry by monroeslittle) are both fantastic and made me absolutely love James/Lily. Everything that author writes (on both sites) is so heartfelt and wonderful. Her hunger games fics are great too if you're into that fandom as well!

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.
