Easily one of the best fan fictions I've ever read, by Jbern.

Does anyone know if the author is planning a sequel? The ending left so much potential to the story.

I'd also appreciate it if anyone could recommend something similar (powerful Harry, lots of humor etc.)

Thanks anyway, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already read it.

Here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]


** There was a sequel planned... but then the Author suffered a bout of recognition, and got published in his own right.

He has a website with his books listed. [[http://www.jimbernheimer.com/]]

I imagine one or more of his series might carry a similar tone.

--------------

As to fics I can think of that have the similarities you requested:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The havoc side of the Force]] has post-war Harry galumphing around the Old Republic. Bonus points similarity wise because the Sorting Hat of TLIL is reprised by the psychotic assassin droid HK-47, so Harry has a comparable (tho somewhat less vulgar) source of banter. Sadly it also shares ending abruptly, but it's only been 6 months so the author may have merely suffered a mild case of life-itus.

** Can you tell something about Severus in this fic? Is he even fleshed out?

*** I don't recall Severus being a major character... he's there, but given the nature of the fic obviously he and HJ don't really get along/interact much beyond sniping at each other and HJ trying to get him fired. Not the best setup for character development/fleshing out.

**** Ohh that won't do, I'm spoiled so bad with Snape's character development in FF :( I can't go back to canon at this point.

***** I don't know if I'd rule out stories just on the basis of the main character having legitimate reasons for disliking Snape... but if you want a story with Snape not being Harry's enemy you could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] it's currently up to year 3, and has a Peggy-Sue Harry sorted into Slytherin (against his will IIRC.) It's not a comedy, but it has a variety of funny moments so it might qualify under what OP's looking for as well.

Speaking of Peggy-Sue fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God, Not Again]] is hilarious and like any Peggy Sue fic, Harry is more powerful due to being mentally older than in canon. But... unlike in The Lie I've Lived, Harry is /not/ taking life seriously... at all.

****** Travel Secrets is an interesting premise so far, but the high incidence of spelling errors is distracting.

I'm sorry he, Dumbledore and Ron are three of the only characters who show any kind of growth or depth in the series, what is wrong with canon Snape?

*** Unfortunately not. He's a very minor character and even goes against canon in his motivations/actions.

This is a gorgeous fic about Snape. It goes from the moment he is born until he dies, and I honestly consider it to be a part of the original books. The character is incredibly fleshed out.

Enjoy if you haven't read it already!
