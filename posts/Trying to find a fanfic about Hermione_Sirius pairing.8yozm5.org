Hello everyone, I'm trying to find a fan fiction about Sirius/Hermione, it's not a time-travel one.

Of what I remember it happens after the war, Tonks and Remus are alive and the same is for Sirius (if it's back from the Veil or not I don't remember).

Harry, Ginny and Ron don't care about Hermione and left her behind to start exploring the word, while Hermione get a promotion or an offer to work for the Italian Ministry of Magic; she's really depressed and has this distorted vision of herself caused by a potion put in her food while in Hogwarts by a jealous Ginny (helped by Ron). Sirius discovers this and tries to help Hermione, he chastises Harry for abandoning his friend and I don't know because I didn't end to read the fic. I know it's really long (or at least the chapters were so), but I don't know if it's completed or not.

Please help me!


** Is it "If You Could See What I See"?
