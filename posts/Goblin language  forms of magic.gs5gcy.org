Hello all, How are you all? I am interested in HP fanfiction that explore how Goblin language is used for magic & if they teach this to non-Goblins such as Harry. Do they use Runes/language for spells?


** My idea for Goblin Magic is to have it based on riches, gold/silversmithing and haggling.

Goblin Language is just legal jargon that most wizards, not from Slytherin or a law background, wouldn't know.

** Since the book of common spells is translated into Goblin, they presumably can do anything wizards can.

*** I see, personally I have thought of Goblins to use either Runes + hand gestures to cast magic. ü§î
