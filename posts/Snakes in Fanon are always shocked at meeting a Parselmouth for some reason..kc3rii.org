In book 1 the only snake we meet seems to sense that Harry has the gift, be it magic generally or the ability to speak Parseltongue, without Harry taking any action.

/Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself/*...*

*...*/The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's./

/It winked./

/Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too./

Neither Nagini or the Basalisk seems to care that Harry is a Parselmouth either. The only title Harry is ever bestowed by a snake is "Amigo."

*** "Avada Kedev-AAAHHH!!!" Random Death Eater No. 3 screamed, the horrible incantation being lost to an agonized scream as a snake latched on to his leg. For one very strange moment, Harry half-thought that Nagini had turned traitor, but then the confusion of battle cleared for a moment. The snake was, impossibly, a bit bigger than Nagini, and it's scales were different... but still very familiar. Harry stunned the struggling Death Eater as he approached. "~Are you... Are you the snake from the zoo?~" Harry hissed. "~Ah! You remember me! It is good to see you again, amigo. Eh... you may want to tell your amiga to calm down.~" the anaconda said, looking past Harry to a very freaked out Hermione.

"Hermione, it's ok! He's a friend. Remember back in second year, when I told you about the snake at the zoo that I accidentally set free?" Harry reminded her. They were forced to stop as several Death Eaters entered the corridor. For a few more minutes, it was chaos as spells flew; Harry's "Amigo" made himself useful, tripping and biting Death Eaters, allowing them to be Stunned as they fell. In return, Harry shielded him and took down Death Eaters who tried to curse him from the sides. Finally, the corridor was cleared, and silence once more descended.

Hermione got her bearings first. "You were saying, Harry?" she asked, brushing hair out of her face. "Yeah. This is the snake from the zoo. Although, I don't know what he's doing here. ~I thought you were going back to Brazil, amigo?~" Harry said, switching his attention to the snake. "~Can't go back to a place you've never been, amigo. Believe me. I spent a few years in a glade in the South of France, instead. I eavesdropped on a few hikers that turned out to be wizards running from all this. When I put the picture together, I figured I'd try to make my way back up here and help you out.~" Amigo explained. Harry translated.

Ron shook his head. "Only you, Harry." Ron said before turning to the snake "My name's Ron Wesley. I'm Harry's best mate.". Amigo made a strange motion that roughly translated to a nod. "~Delighted. Any amigo of Senor Harry's is an amigo of mine.~" the snake said, Harry once more translating. "I'm Hermione. Thank you for coming to help." Hermione said. "~Of course, Senorita. It is a pleasure to meet you. It seems Harry has good taste in friends, no?" Amigo said, flicking his tongue over her hand. Hermione blushed.

"Alright, enough introductions. Let's get back to business." Harry said.

** A bit tangential, but one of my big pet peeves is how snakes appear in the HP universe.

First: Snakes don't have eyelids! They have clear scales covering their eyes to protect them, but they cannot open or close their eyes. (This is an easy way to tell legless lizards apart from snakes.)

Two: All snakes are evolved to eat their food whole. That's why they can unhinge their jaw and all of that. Their teeth are not capable to doing tearing damage, so Snape's neck nor anyone else's bites would not be torn out or anything like that. I see a lot of descriptions of bites from Nagini that are essentially described like a shark bite. Even a bite from a larger snake will present with bruising in the area and puncture wounds from the teeth, but no tearing damage.

Sorry, I'll get back off my soap box now.

*** Actually, snake bites can cut you up quite a bit, and their teeth are damn sharp. I've found the wounds bled more than you expect and won't stop. They bleed more from a glancing blow where they don't latch, or if you startle and jerk away and tear yourself on the teeth. Never been bitten by a truly large snake, but even a tiny little noodle about the size of a pencil drew a lot more blood than I was expecting. Still, would not expect the kind of damage that was described on Arthur or Snape.

**** I've been bitten by quite a few species, and you do bring up a good point about the tearing if you pull away. It also depends heavily on where you're bitten. That being said, if you get a glancing bite where there's a lot of bleeding, there's a very low chance of envenomation compared to a bite where they were able to grab and hold on. A bite where envenomation would be possible generally doesn't bleed very much.

I don't really expect YA fiction writers to get all the details correct, I'm mostly grumpy about Nagini apparently being part shark, lol.

***** I had another random idea. Not all snakes constrict, some even bite in a rather slashing way. My ex wife once had a Cribo, I think she called it a yellow tail, which would make it Drymarchon corais, closely related to the Eastern Indigo. Anyways it arrived in shipping in a tied shut fabric bag, like a pillow case, and it was /pissed/. Bit the crap out of her, mostly not latching, just ripping and tearing. The bag was totally covered in blood and her hands and arms were ripped up, and it wasn't that big of a snake. Maybe 3-4 feet.

Drymarchon do not envenomate or constrict while killing, they bite aggressively and sometimes latch and smash their prey on rocks and stuff (need to be careful feeding them, they are supposedly prone to braining themselves on the tank wall). Even after killing, in my experience they push the prey against an object to shove it in their mouths. As a consequence they need smaller prey compared to body size than most snakes.

Anyways, I think that, with some magically added venom and enhanced size, could produce the sort of results that were described from Nagini's attack on Arthur and Snape.

*** Actually, I used to run a snake rescue and have some gnarly scars from python bites. They have these razor teeth that hook backward. If it latches on and you remain perfectly calm and motionless it's totally possible to get away with only punctures, as the snake itself doesn't tear.

However if you reflexively grab at the snake's head to pull it off, or pull away while it's striking/after it has bitten on, they will absolutely tear the crap out of you. It only happened twice for me to learn to just be really calm and still while I carried the animal to a sink and splashed cold water on its face.

I also sliced my finger open pretty badly giving wormer to some wild caught royal pythons that came to us in really bad shape. It wasn't a bite and they are a very docile species, but those teeth are serious.

Totally agree with you on the eyelid thing though. I've always wondered how much they actually hear in the way of sound too, since they don't have external ears and go by vibrations picked up by their jaw bones.

**** I'm a professional wildlife biologist with a focus on reptiles. I also happen to have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, so I am very intimately familiar with the workings of joints, lol. Snakes absolutely do “unhinge” their jaws, it's what they're designed to do.

I don't mean to be argumentative or rude, it's just that the info you have is essentially a simplified version like you might find in a book for kids. Calling their anatomy a myth is incorrect though. (There's plenty of other myths about snakes, we don't need to add more!) I'll give you the way I normally teach it, if that's ok.

In humans, when a joint comes apart it is called a *“dislocation”*, and it is unnatural. Generally after the bones are popped back in place there will be soft tissue damage to the ligaments and other surrounding tissues because the bones were never meant to separate outside of their normal motion. Ligaments are what hold the bones together in joints; the bones in your knee for example aren't actually meant to come into direct contact and hold on to each other, it's the ligaments that hold them together while allowing flexion.

In snakes, they have the ability to *”disarticulate”* their jaw, which is an intentional separation of the bones in the jaw. You're correct that their ligaments have the ability to stretch farther than most, which allows them to pop their jaw apart and then back together with no damage. (I always enjoy watching them get things back into place after eating, it's weirdly cute.). This is still a separation of the joint, it's just designed differently to what we're used to. The bones in a snake's jaw are just as connected as ours, but their anatomy allows them to “unhinge” their jaw. (I'm not sure I explained that well, I apologize if it's unclear.)

There is a big divide between scientific use and common use of many animal related terms, notably the difference between poisonous and venomous. There are also sometimes differences in regional use. What we call the separation of the jaws of a snake falls into this divide as well. To some extent this can be blamed on how things are simplified, because we often simplify things to teach the basics, but may not do a good job of explaining the whole picture as it becomes age/education level appropriate.

I apologize for the novel, I typed all of this while waiting for my migraine meds to kick in, so please forgive the tangents and holler if I left anything unexplained.

**** Nah, the zoo boa probably is just used to seeing lots of strange humans pass by every day.

**** Bold of you to assume that was the first parselmouth the snake had met.

** My theory is they're redneck draconic.

Like it's supposed to be the language of ancient dragons but it is spoken like a backwoods bumpkin while draconic is kings English.

The basilisk (my headcannon is Salazar named her Petunia) was raised by a parcelmouth so thats not impressive. Voldemort Snake is raised by one. We never see Harry interaction with other snakes.

** I've always been sad JKR didn't do more with parseltongue in general. One of my favorite fics, Turn, has Harry with snake friends who are his pets and confidantes. If you could talk to animals, wouldn't you want to take advantage?! Interesting as all hell.

*** I love /Turn/. The snakes in that fic are clearly animals, not humans in disguise, but they're still good companions.

*** And why just parseltongue? I'd throw in a few other somethingtongues, at least as a background mention.

** Why would they even know about parselmouths though?

Wizards are very rare, within the wizard population parselmluths are very rare.

So parselmouths make up an incredibly small part of the population.

So almost all snakes would not have run into them or even heard of them.

** One of the Harry-raised-by-goblins stories explores the idea that snakes are only sentient when in the presence of a parselmouth, it being part of the magic of parseltongue (which, as a magical language, can't be learned or taught).
