I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] and liked it. Are there any other good crossovers?


** Quick question. Is Harry the Avatar in this?

Because I read the summary and the first few chapters and am not really sure now.

I read the first few chapters and this Harry frustrates me more than any other Harry in a well written fic. Mostly because we get told so little. Or at least thats the feeling I get. This anxiety ridden, passive Harry... I need some explanation quick, or I'll quit.

Since its the first Avatar/Harry crossover thats readable I give it a lot of leeway. But yea. Is he the Avatar?

EDIT: I just realized there are just 15 chapters. What a waste of time this was.

** I've not read any others but if you look just above the title of the fic you'll see a link for all fics that fall under that crossover.
