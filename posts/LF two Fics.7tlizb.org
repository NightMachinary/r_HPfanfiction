I don't know why both of these popped into my head today but of course it was only snippets and for some reason I don't have them saved as favorites.

1. Harry arrives at Hermione's home after being chased by a couple of members of OotP. They figure out the blood wards are actually attached to him and remove them using his blood and a gold platter. Yeah I know not much to go on and hope somebody can figure it out.

2. Harry goes dark and takes over not only the magical world but Muggle world as well. His children are kidnapped by Ron and Hermione once they are caught they run off leaving behind Rose.
