Hi everyone! Is anyone else having trouble accessing the Sycophant Hex site? It was working fine this morning and then a few hours ago, it just stopped loading :( I initially thought it was just Ashwinder but it appears to be the whole server, I suppose. After it was down for what seems like forever, this worries me, ugh. Any news?


** Never mind, it's back up! Jumped the gun a little!! :)
