It turns out guns are useless and muggle martial arts are easily countered with spells.

Post your ideas.


** There's one I read where the wizards/witches all have super strength speed etc just by existing iirc it opens with harry failing to kill Dumbledore with a shotgun and there's some section where Ginny picks up a motorcycle. Leaving this comment to remind me to find it later

** Muggles armed with bows and arrows, swords, and possible unarmed managed to capture wizards and witched to burn them at the stake. Why would muggles armed with guns suddenly be less of a threat?

Edit: OP let me know that they only engaged me in discussion in hopes that I might try to fill the prompt. So I did. My fill falls below the 'continue this thread' line so I'm reposting here at the top of our conversation for people to actually see.

Lucius dropped to the ground beside him and a second later a crack rent the air. The pavement beneath the Death Eaters' feet exploded as though hit ba a blasting charm cast by Merlin himself. In spite of, or perhaps because of, the flashbacks of the blitz Voldemort disapparated before the debris hit the ground. He knew how dangerous muggle bombs were after all.

He popped back into existence behind where he thought the shot had originated from. Avada Kadavera on lips before he was fully aware of his new surroundings. The two armed gunmen preparing to leave the sniper's nest did not stand a chance as he cast at the second before his spell had even struck the first. He disapparated again as their bodies began to fall.

From his rooftop vantage, he could see that a second team of snipers had taken out Bellatrix but the muggle ground troops were not fairing well against even the weakest of his followers. Where bullets needed to hit heads, major arteries or organs to be fatal the killing curse need only strike you.

Another shoot ended Greybake's life but revealed his target's location. A repeat of the last engagement yielded the same results. Voldemort called his remaining followers to him when the enemy retreated. Many of them were injured, but as long as the dug the bullets out first it was just a wound.

See my problem is that you want wizard wank trash, not a genuine bit of muggle tech vs. magic. You did not disprove that swords and bows were effective against wizards. You proved that Binns is racist against muggles that were killed in the witch hunts. You proved that when on guard for an attack they 100% know is coming, a wizard is not defenseless.

But I'll fulfill the 'prompt':
