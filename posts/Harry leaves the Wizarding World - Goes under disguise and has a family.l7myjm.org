As vague as the title was, I remember him becoming a doctor (I think?). His daughter was accepted to hogwarts and he wasn't happy and since he was disguised as a muggle people thought he wasn't accepting of magic. Dumbledore was the only one who found out who he was and Harry put him under an oath that almost killed him towards the end until he was released from the oath. His wife died on the moving staircase when she had gone to school for a presentation that their daughter was putting on. The daughter was put in court for the presentation because she ended up revealing things to the public that the MoM didn't want them to know (about Draco)
