As the title states I'm looking for some Veela stories (at least 80k words). Not into Fleur/Harry or Draco/Harry pairing unless it's well written. Can be complete or WIP but PLEASE no abandoned. The Veela can be any character except cannon Veelas. Appreciate any and all recommendations, thanks. Ps. I'm a hugggggge sucker for Dramione so Thise would be lovely as well.

I go back to this fic every once in a while (when I'm craving a Dramione fic with Veela elements. In this one, Hermione catches a virus from a male Veela (sti style) that turns her into a different type of veela. It has a side of Harry x Pansy (Pansy also caught the Veela-virus from the same dude).

It has slow burn, and angst (which I don't usually go for) but it's a good fic IMO.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.
