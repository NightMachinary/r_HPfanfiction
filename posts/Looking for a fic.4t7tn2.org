4th year. TWT. Harry got shunned/bullied and after Hermione shattered his wand, he started living in the Chamber of Secrets and learned from a portrait of Slytherin. He then got a snazzy new wand from Ollivanders.


** Is it maybe:

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

(The only Slytherin Portrait/Chamber of Secrets/Triwzard fic I can recall)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** It is. Ron and Harry are coming to blows and Hermione tries to defuse the situation by banishing Harry's holly wand into the wall. Which of course Harry never forgives.

Anyway, that story really goes to shit in the last 15 chapters. I try to pretend it ended on a Hail Odysseus note, with Harry and Fleur telling LV that they don't care and Britain is his.

It really does, which is a shame.

**** Banishing somebody's wand into a wall is overkill, if it breaking in the story is any indication. You just have to disarm.

I remember reading this a few weeks ago before forgetting about it. I got to around November or December.

*** I actually quite liked most of this story and read it all the way through, but my least favourite part of the story was the use of the typical get-Hermione-out-of-the-way trope.
