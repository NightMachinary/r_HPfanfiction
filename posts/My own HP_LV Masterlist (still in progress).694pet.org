[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzSyIRlXGa1_rtjjhxOVogz_l_-5ZuhMFvbBYwdlDeM/edit?usp=sharing][The List]]

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJXGJohlpfJJ6w16zd2Z-sMad5ddIYN1jXc7feEMBak/edit?usp=sharing][The To-Read List]]

Take notice that the To-read list has not been proofread or anything. I picked the link and title, added it and that's about it. I may, eventually, make a quick sift through to eliminate the abandonned/uncomplete/terrible ones, but for now every fics are a surprise. Feel free to take a quick peak if you feel like the spreadsheet is lackluster (Fictions added to the masterlist are eliminated from the google doc, so there is no duplicates).

I started this project a few months back, trying to find once again (and regroup) all of my HP/LV stories that I had let float into thin air.

Some I reread, others I remembered and just jotted down somewhere in a document. I, then, decided to slowly make a spreadsheet of the stories, with as much concise details as possible.

The Spreadsheet basically regroup all manner of HP/LV. Friends, allies, mentor, sexual relationship, soulmate, soulbond, time travel, father.

The stories were initially long, but I am starting to incorporate shorter ones too. I am usually seeking and keeping the well-written or, at the very least, interesting ones.

The most important point was that they were either complete or updated fairly recently (the latest has not been updated in a year if I am right).

The second most important point, which ties fairly intricately with the first, is the quality of the fic. Sometimes the writing skill itself will be kind of iffy, but I deemed the idea interesting enough to still make it through. Plot, pacing, characterization, tropes used, twists, amount of sex were all taken into account. Compromises were made. Weak characterization could be tolerated if the plot and pacing were tolerable. Tropes such as light/dark, bashings and the likes were tolerated if the characterization was properly done, etc. I went with my own personal judgment, and you may disagree with it. It's fine too.

In this spreadsheet you will find the author, genre, rate, length, summary, last update date and checklists for explicit sex, platonic pairing (non amorous or romantic LV/HP), my personal favorite and whether or not the fiction is complete.

There will also be Special warnings: Things that I find important to highlight that may deter individuals from the story (bad OoC, Sequels abandonned, underage sex, incests, lowering quality as it progresses, abuse, poor writing skills, etc.)

There is currently 31 stories listed, from varying size, but I still have 60 others to sift through which are not yet put in the masterlist, as I have no idea what they look like. I can link the google doc if people wants it, however.

Keep in mind that this list will not have ALL LV/HP.

Some were abandonned, not updated in too long, far too short or simply dreadful to read. I probably don't have all interesting and worthwhile stories yet, so if you have others to suggest, feel more than free to do so.

Also... reading takes a very long time. When I find monsters like Verdict of Their Vagaries, or Death of Today, it can take month to read properly and thoroughly. Usually I can read two, three stories at the same time, but the fact still stand that this list is FAR from complete, as I have 60 other fanfiction in another "in-progress" list of tentative and possible fiction to add.

Some are quick to forget, but they will never be placed in the spreadsheet and that sifting is invisible to you, others take a long time to settle on, either because I will read to the end and enjoy the story, or I take my time to decide whether or not it's worth dropping or finishing.

I can waste a lot of time on a fic I will ultimately not finish for various reasons.

In any case, just keep in mind that this masterlist, while short for now, is far from finished and more will be added.

I hope you enjoy

Also as promised (even if delayed): [[/u/viktuuri_on_ice]], [[/u/ologylife492]], [[/u/jfinner1]]

--------------

EDIT: Also, as I am human, I may have tagged improperly. I tried my best, but some things may have escaped my attention, things you find important, or jarring that I did not. We, ultimately, all have different tastes. If you do find such mistakes, I would highly appreciate if you could communicate with me so that I can rectify anything.

EDIT 2: Grammar, addition, etc.

EDIT 3: Added one of the two "The Ouroboros" that was in my list (the ao3 fic and not the ffn.com), made the correction for Fate's Favourite author and added the necessary fanfiction to my to-read list.

EDIT 4: Added the To-Read list in the Goggle Doc format on top of the post.

EDIT 5: Added "het pairing" checklist, also started Data tables filtering the fictions based on: Explicit Sex, Platonic Pairing and Het pairing(not done yet). See additional sheet at the bottom of the page.

EDIT 6: Added "No Glory" to the list, as well as a sheet for updates notes where I will write the date and what changed in the spreadsheet, so that people can keep up and see if something was added/changed since their last visit.

**** Plenty of typos. The author constantly mixes up affect/effect. Filler. Some characters that I think could've been cut. Then there's Voldemort. He's awesome, but it takes a while before he shows up. There aren't any kids at Hogwarts, just seasoned politicians. But there's plenty of interesting worldbuilding, especially with werewolves. Harry, Snape and Voldemort really shine in this fic. Read the first year, it's about as long as the first HP book. If it doesn't hook you, then you probably won't like the rest.

If I may make a recommendation to your to-read list. Linkao3(Charity, Thou Art a Lie) is a fem!Harry/LV, underage, very dark, non-con and all the things that are hated here, but, in my personal opinion, a very realistic take on hp/lv relationship(obsessive Voldemort and harry who doesn't forget who actually made her an orphan). Has two sequels, last one's still updating.

So... How do I tell which a story is? I'm guessing if it's marked as Platonic it's going to be safe? Wait, why is Xerosis marked as platonic (ish) but right in the description says it's slash?

#+begin_quote
  At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things. Wherein Harry---now Hadrian---raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Marvolo Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world. I've moved to a new and improved account: http://archiveofourown.org/users/skylarjaye/. I'm currently editing up and rewriting this story--hopefully in such a way that I can actually find a clear ending unlike the mess of a plot this one became. Once the new and improved story is finished, I will be posting it on my new account a chapter a week. Thank you all for your patience with me and this story. I hope to be able to give back to you all with a finished tale within the year.
