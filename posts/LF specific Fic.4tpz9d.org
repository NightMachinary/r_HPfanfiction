I read this fic a while back, thought I'd saved it, and now I can't find it for the life of me. It's basically a crack fic. The main character is an OC who knows that HP is fictional. He "falls asleep" and when he wakes up he's a baby, twin brother to Harry. He grows up with him, sorts himself into Slytherin, and basically spends him time messing with everyone. The story is incomplete, abandoned. By the point that it was abandoned, there are two tom riddles (adult and teenaged) and the OC is playing three different ages at the same time using a time turner and aging potions, he's convinced Voldemort that he is one of his horcruxes, is working with both toms to take over the Wizarding world. Oh, and he eventually figures out that he's actually trapped in a video game, because some girls shows up playing as Luna Lovegood and the OC was part of a virtual reality game tester for some HP game and it went bad and he is actually dead but his brain is stuck in the game. Yeah, total crack doc, but it was hilarious... Can anyone help me out?
