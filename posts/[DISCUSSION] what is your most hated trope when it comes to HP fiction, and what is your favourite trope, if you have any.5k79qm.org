** Is MPREG a trope? Then it's MPREG. Slash? No problem. Unless it's badly written by a clueless female teenager, which is 99% of the time.

Anyway, one of my most hated tropes is the forced stations of canon rails, especially Hedwig.

No matter how different the circumstances are, or how extremely alternative the universe is, there she is.

The snowy owl.

Hedwig.

Bonus hate: They're soul bonded. She, the bitchiest owl in the store, flies to Harry and nibbles his ear lovingly. Nibble, nibble, nibble. Every scene with Hedwig. Nibble, nibble, nibble. And then she telepathically tells him in no uncertain terms that her name is Hedwig. Nibble, nibble, nibble. It's a wonder Harry has any ears left. It's mentioned 3 times in the books, plus one bonus nibble from Pig.

It's sort of anticlimactic when later in the story she's killed and turns into a pure white phoenix. Merlin's phoenix. Or Merlin /as/ a phoenix.

Stop nibbling on young boys, Merlin. Perv.
