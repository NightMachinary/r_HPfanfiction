***** It's takes a strong force of will to keep standing even when seemingly everyone in your family is looking down on you.

And Ron strikes me as an Orange Lantern, maybe a yellow lantern.

And Luna would definitely be a Blue Lantern.

** I'm playing with one where rather than Kyle Raynor getting the final ring from Ganthet after the whole 'Hal Jordan destroys the Central Power Battery' storyline, he gives it to Luna Lovegood... who promptly decides that she wants to form her own corps with a ring from each of the corps for the Ministry 6.

She has green

Hermione gets Indigo for Compassion

Neville gets the Red for Rage (because you know, that kid has a whole lot of stored up rage.)

Ginny gets Yellow for Fear (after what Tom in the Diary did to her, she understands fear)

Harry gets Violet for Love... For the uniform, if no other reason

And Ron gets Orange for Avarice. Ron understands avarice.

Here's Luna's exchange with Larfleeze when she is trying to get an Orange ring:

​

"NO!" I screamed. After most of a day spent trying and failing to kill the intruder, I was becoming most shrill.

"Please?" the female asked, cloaked in its vile green light.

"NO!" I reiterate safely within MY own orange glow. "It is MINE! All of it is MINE! Not yours, MINE!"

The female extended its lower lip in a manner that my ring says suggests disappointment. "But I need it. Pretty please?"

"You have a ring," I snarled. A nasty */green/* ring. "You can't have one of MINE."

"It's not for me," it lied. Like anyone wouldn't want one of MY wonderful rings. "It's for a friend, one who understands avarice. Having one of your rings would allow him to use his understanding to find his true strength."

"The Guardians are using liars now?" I demanded.

"There are no Guardians any longer," it explained. "Well, there was one, a small blue fellow who gave me my ring, but he's gone away." It gestured toward its neck where the evil green stone of willpower rested. "It used to be a ring, but I decided that rings were so last year, so I improved it. What do you think?"

I turned away from the annoying alien. If I couldn't kill it, I would ignore it. The female started orbiting me slowly. "Please? I'll be your best friend!"

"NO!" I paused. "What do you mean there are no Guardians any longer?"

"They're gone," it said simply, before pausing, and gesturing again to its throat, "or they're sick or something. The blue fellow said that he was the only one and that this was the only remaining ring."

"The Green Lanterns are gone?" I asked in wonder.

"Well, no," it interrupted. "After all, I'm still here. Can I please have one of your rings? I'll make sure my friend takes good care of it."

"No! MINE!" I screamed. Why was this entity so hard to convince? For that matter, why was it so hard to kill?

"Ah," it whined, "please?"

"NO!"

"Well, can I borrow it?" it asked, fluttering its eyelids at me. What was that even supposed to mean?

"Borrow?" I responded. "What does 'borrow' mean?"

"It means you let me take the ring, and when I'm done with it, I bring it back."

"Let you take one of MY rings? Have you not been listening to me? MINE!"

"Well, what if I rent one from you?"

"Rent?"

"You let me take a ring, and I pay you a tribute for each time-period I keep it."

That was a concept I'd never encountered before. This odd entity had set up a conflict in MY system of avarice. The Ring was MINE, but I wanted the tribute. And I would get the ring back.

But it was MINE.

But the tribute would be new possessions that I didn't already have. It would become MINE.

"What would the tribute be?" I asked slyly.

"On my way here, I discovered many planets with gemstones and rare metals for the taking," it responded. "Might I offer a cubic meter of treasure for each orbit of your world around its star?"

There was a slight pause while MY ring translated the female's barbaric units of measure into something real.

I will simply send MY Lanterns out to harvest the gems and metals for me!"

"If you trust them..." the female moved her shoulders upward in what my ring informed me to be a culturally significant gesture.

But it was correct. I couldn't trust MY construct Lanterns. New plan. "I will go and gather the treasure Myself," I announced. That was a foolproof plan.

"And leave all of your current treasures unguarded?" It asked.

"MY Construct Corps will protect it!"

"They will?" the female asked. "They couldn't even keep me out."

It was right. All that treasure, beyond MY reach. I couldn't rely on the constructs to gather it; I couldn't rely on them to protect MY treasure so that I could leave. This was agony.

The hunger burned in me. I wanted; I needed the treasure.

"I agree to your rental," I ground out through clenched teeth. "But the tribute will be TWO cubic meters of treasure per orbit."

"Agreed," the female said, showing her teeth. From her subspace storage, she produced four cubic meters of gems and metals. "Two orbits, in advance."

So much treasure and it was MINE! And now the entity would be gone.

"Now, I understand this ring will require a personal power battery..."

I felt as if I would pull my fur from my body as she began her negotiations.

*** *The real problem with the story will be coming up with a threat, because Tom and his boys won't be one.*

*And Tom won't be getting a ring. He's going to be a target when the new Ring bearers go out adventuring the very first time.*

*I'm picturing something like this:*

​

"What are you wearing, Potter?"

"It's the uniform of my Corps, Tom." A green/Sapphire/Indigo shield forms between Harry, Luna and Hermione and Tom's troops. "You don't need to worry about me, I'm just here to tell you that I forgive you."

In the distance, a low drone can be heard. mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine.

"You forgive me, Potter?" Voldemort sneered. "Do you actually think your forgiveness will save you and your little friends?"

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine. The drone was getting more distinct and closer.

"Don't flatter yourself, Tom, any of us could destroy you all."

"I wouldn't destroy him, Harry," Hermione disagreed. "I'd recruit him into the Indigo tribe."

"I wouldn't mind destroying all the Death Eaters," Luna disagreed. "Their actions have severely cut into the Quibbler's subscriber base."

"That may well be, but you both know that we can't,": Harry said gently. "The others called 'dibs'."

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine. the drone seemed to be almost on top of them. Several Death Eaters were looking around for the source.

"Dibs?" Voldemort asked. "What do you mean by that?"

"Well, you and your friends have made some people very angry," Harry explained. "Even some who don't need the anger, but they have it anyway."

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine.

"People fear me, Potter, I don't make them angry."

"You'd be surprised. Goodbye Tom."

"MINE!" Ron Weasley screamed as he and his orange shield landed on top of Voldemort at the speed of sound, ending the Dark Lord quite convincingly. "For my father!"

An incoherent scream of rage pulled the Death Eater's attention away from the Red-Head sheathed in orange light to a young man covered in red flame as he thrashed his way through the crowd on his unstoppable drive to the Lestrange family.

The surviving Death Eaters fled the scene lead by the Malfoys. The crowd ran full-on into the yellow wall that suddenly appeared in front of them.

"Oh, hello Lucius," Ginny Weasley said with an evil grin. "I've never had the chance to thank you for the diary you gifted to me."

**** Oh shit, Ron's gonna steak all their bones!

And I take it you'll be playing Neville like that time supergirl got a red ring? Instead of the usual towering bonfire of bloodrage it'll be a tranquil fury? I hope Luna managed to get rid of the red ring's whole “replace the wearer's blood with its energy” shtick.

I hope you bring in the best member of the various lantern corps; Hope Corgi! He's a British bread after all.

And with an OP character/group, a good antagonist should be something that can't just be beaten into submission physically. Maybe have them root out all the scum and villainy of the wizarding world, clean up centuries of biased laws, maybe even reunite the magical world with the real world. If this is a universe with just the Lantern corps and nothing else from DC that could require some interesting setup, but if the rest of DC exists you could lean more on showing that the magicals aren't so unique and overpowered anymore, and if the aliens and metahumans and everyone else can get along with baseline humanity, the magicals can do so again.

And while they're doing that, the ministry six use their alignments to help fix things, and fight off anyone who would stand in the way of equality and unity, both wizarding and DC.

(Maybe they can use their rings to hone in on people who strongly represent those emotions, like Harry finding and (re)uniting people who do or will share a strong bond of love, Neville finds those who are easily angered and ensuring they get the help they need to keep it from ruling or ruining their lives, Ron sniffs out the greediest among them (Fudge) and makes sure put into situations where their greed won't harm innocents.

*** TL;DNR: The Star Sapphires are a group of people who derive *PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER* from ^{itty-bitty violet rings.}

You know the Green Lanterns? From DC Comics? Well they draw their strength from willpower, and there's a lot more colors and emotions in the spectrum. The Star Sapphires are essentially the Violet Lantern Corps, and they're powered by Love. There's also the Blue Lanterns powered by Hope, The Red's powered by Rage, The Orange with his Greed, Yellow/Sinestro with their Fear, and there's also the Ultraviolet Lantern Corps powered by hidden flaws like envy and wrath and are enslaved to the creator of their Corps. There's also a few others and the Green Lanterns have a few divisions/splinter cells but that's the gist of it.

Though, if memory serves, the Star Sapphires are villains or anti heroes comprised of jilted lovers with a real toxic view of love. But that's all from a few half-remembered comics and cartoon episodes.
