I think by now most people here is familiar with "Adorable Violence" but, but are there any fics where Hermione isn't as "over the top" as in that one while still being the driving plot behind the story?

Please either no pairing, Harry/Hermione or femslash.

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

**** As of right now, nothing. There were some very minor inclinations towards Nott, but nothing overt. Actually, I don't even know why Malfoy or Snape are listed. They have tiny roles.

I'm a little disappointed at how the author treats Draco, but given your stance on his character, I think you'll find it enjoyable.

That sounds much better than the description and tags would suggest, thanks for the info. Does Harry play any role in that story?

****** No, Hermione willingly distances herself from him and her...other self. There's a good enough reason for it, and it's addressed in the very first few chapters, although I could never shake the feeling she should be lonelier than she was.

Essentially, the author creates her own story that runs parallel to canon.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
