Just curious who everyone likes to see shipped with harry in fanfiction.

Personally, I think my favorite ship is with daphne greengrass. I also like to read him shipped with hermione but daphne is my favorite.

I also wish there were some novel length Katie bell ships, but there's like none so..sucks lol


** I don't like poly that much but because of one fic I have kind of a soft spot for Harry/Hermione/Ron. The only other girls I maybe ship him with are Luna or Ginny. I can see why you would like Tonks, it's just not the kind of fantasy I can relate to. And when it comes to dudes something healthy like Ron or maybe Neville but I only like those as fluff.

** I almost never search for fics because of their ships beyond banning the ships I despise (harry/voldemort, etc) - the romance is usually secondary to the rest of the story in my searches. I'm generally cool with the canon ships as long as they're well written. But there are a few other ships I've specifically searched for:

- Sirius/Remus\\
- Harry/Ron\\
- Harry/Ron/Hermione\\
- Harry/Luna

For Harry, non-controversial answer: Luna.

The funniest part about this, is that, if you told me you thought a pairing I liked was weird, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't get butthurt, and I wouldn't call you a twat for it, because I /understand/ that people have different tastes than me, and /their/ tastes have no effect on my life, just like their /opinions/ have no effect on my life, just like /my/ tastes and opinions have no effects on theirs.

** I have written stories my entire life, and it has always been the plot and the world building which have intrigued me the most. That's why it was a surprise and a shock to me to realise that in fan fiction stories relationships between certain characters are what many if not most people are the most interested in. I couldn't be less interested. And it doesn't help that fan fiction writers don't seem to be good at writing an interesting romance. It's usually characters rushing into an extremely lovely honeymoon, and it's boring. Every story and every story element needs tension and drama to be exciting.

That's why I like stories with no romance, preferably not even as a side plot.

Also that's one of the reason why daphne is such an awesome ship, the writers can explore so much outside of linear canon with that relationship. Hermione feels stuck to more "normal" stories and I've never enjoyed Ginny as a pairing, for a lot of reasons

****** Im not overly fond of slash pairings either I dunno... There's something about the dynamic of Sirius's dramatic tortured backstory of being kicked out of an aristocratic family, and poor, struggling Remus having his secret side to him that just makes it so fun and interesting? There's so many different ways to take it. Then the drama of Sirius assuming Remus is the traitor and Remus losing everyone for years and them being reunited for such a short time before both dying? It's so tragic I love it üòÇ

I like Marauder stories because the characters aren't in the books. So authors can do whatever they like with them and not worry too much about trying to keep in character. I've read a lot of stories with a variety of pairings but Wolfstar ones are the ones I believe the most? I don't like romance so it takes a lot for me to get invested in it and I think the amount of backstory you can give Sirius and Remus balances out the romancey aspect of it. I really enjoy it.

** Is it really possible to prefer a ship with Daphne? Since she has no exposure in canon, it's essentially shipping Harry with an OC. Which is perfectly fine, but since everyone will have a different interpretation and version of her, it's not fair to say they're the same character.

As far as Ginny, I can't stand the fangirl best friends sister being his soulmate schtick. This is prob because in canon, there was literally zero reason to ship harry with Ginny, it made no sense, and it's likely a belief that became core to me and carried over to fanfiction

#+end_quote

This is wrong. I can understand if you prefer other ships, but you can find a foundation for a relationship between Harry and basically anyone in the series, and Ginny's is more stable than most.

They have a similar sense of humour, there are multiple instances of them sharing glances and laughing during the books.

Ginny doesn't cry, if she's upset she's much more likely to shout. Some people may find this a negative, but Harry's date with Cho shows he has absolutely no idea what to do with a crying woman.

Harry find Ginny attractive, this isn't the be all end all of relationships, but it certainly helps. Compare more or less any description of Ginny to one of Hermione, even as far back as Book 2 or 3. Hermione is always described in a way that isn't rude, but isn't exactly flattering, meanwhile Ginny is frequently described with much more colourful language.

I could go on, but I'll leave it here for now.

#+begin_quote
  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

****** Spoilering just in case:

They don't properly get together until the epilogue, and Harry spends a lot of the story in a "will they or won't they" triangle with her and Tonks, but I think his relationship with Tracey is actually paced out pretty well. Most of its groundwork is laid out in the first half, and the second kinda puts the relationship on hold while everybody deals with the whole war thing. Definitely not for everyone, and I wouldn't really recommend reading it /for/ the romance, but it's a pretty good story, overall.

** Daphne ftw. I'm fine with H/Hr, and I've read a ton of them. The problem is that H/Hr is so close to canon that it only needs a few tweaks, and you only get a bit of unexplored territory. Whereas the Daphne stories get into a whole new area. With either a dark or gray family, plus Daphne has a sister, plus she's a Slytherin with Slytherin friends...

My ship list in somewhat order of preference would be:

- Daphne
- Hermione
- Fleur
- Tonks
- Ginny

Plus or minus a whole lot of mixing the above in multi/harem/coven type stories. I don't mind OC ships, though you don't see them as often. I do NOT like Luna ships, or Luna at all for that matter. The less Luna the better.

As someone already mentioned, Daphne might as well be OC, since she's essentially not in cannon. If you use any of the cannon girls for your ship you have to make a bunch of changes, and some of those wont sit will with the reader. But if they tell me Daphne loves to, I don't know... collect flobberworms I'm like "okay then."

It's a grey harry (good and bad harry) that's sorted into slytherin instead of gryf. Snape is a mentor to harry (snape and lily repaired their friendship before her death due to voldemort hunting them). Harry is raised by sirius instead of dursleys. It will have a good dumbledore but a dumbledore with a superiority complex (not as bad as manipulative dumbles, but it won't be hero dumbles either) pairing will be daphne but I'm still working out how I want to get them together (no marriage contracts and even though harry will be slytherin, she will not like him at first. In a way it will kinda be the 2nd coming of james/lily except same house and different circumstances) no horcrux hunt but voldemort will be back (using an alternate method of him coming back as I really don't enjoy the whole horcrux hunt thing)
