In my early days of Harry Potter (I'd say around 2007-2008), there was a glorious fic I came across. It was a translation which I lost since the website no longer exists, so now I'm looking for the original.

It's about Marauders getting their hands on the first Harry Potter book and reading it - now, I've found a few but none was THE ONE. What I'm looking for starts with Sirius, Remus and Peter reading; James is not there because he's home, sick. Later on, he shows up as well, finally healthy enough to join.

Can anyone point me in the right direction? +please, I NEED it+


** I'd like to read this as well.

** I've looked so hard and I have no idea what else to do :( I pretty much think that it was deleted at some point, so the only hope is that someone has it saved... I had the whole fic printed out... sadly, I lost the whole thing during moving a couple times :((
