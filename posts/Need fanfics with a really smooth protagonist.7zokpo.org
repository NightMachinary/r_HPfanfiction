The Red Knight is a do-over story with a different protagonist - Ron. And he is smooth as hell. Would like a similar fanfic.


** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) has a protagonist that acts older than she is and has a smooth persona when things are under her control.

*** Now I'm wondering if you're just being cautious in general what with the amount of harem fics floating around, or if something in the summary gave you a sense of foreboding?

**** I am cautious in general, but I also heard about how this fic had a female Harry and a bit too much females (including Bella apparently) following Ron. I may have misunderstood but it doesn't bode well for me.

***** It's not a Harem at all like in the slightest. It's pretty clear that the developed relationship is between Ron and another girl, and there is a bunch of convoluted stuff about the Fem Harry and Hermione that would honestly make it a bit ridiculous if Ron ended up with one of them especially since the girl that the relationship is being developed with has the whole "easily jealous" thing going on.

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.
