There was a deleted thread earlier deriding Harry/Hermione and Harry/Daphne.

I agree those ships tend to be boring because of how the female tends to be a Mary-Sue (Sturgeon's law!).

What are your biggest peeves about a pairing?


** Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny.

The first usually makes the story about the romance when it wasn't about that initially. Good example: A Marauder's Plan. I take umbrage with a lot in that story, but the worst thing is how it went from a Harry/Sirius story to Harry worrying about Hermione and her feelings for chapters on end.

H/Hr stories typically dumb him down significantly and turn him into a bitch. Suddenly Hermione can beat him in a duel, play Quidditch, produce a patronus, becomes an overall likable character. Harry's talents are lessened. He's losing duels and can't hold onto his wand. She huffs and he folds.

I enjoy that little bit of Harry/Ginny in the books (I'm not big on romance), but the sole purpose of her character was to be a perfect mate for Harry, so this doesn't translate well to fanfics that have her as a central character. In the books, she accepts and understands everything about him and that makes for a boring romance fic. They also tend to be written as perfect.

******** As far as I remember in The Changeling most of the Slytherin students where still pricks with the only ones being different the ones that Ginny regularly interacted with. I think this would be similar to canon just in the opposite. Harry doesn't interact with that many people at all in the books and the only Slytherins that he spends any time with are Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. The only Slytherins that get any time spent on them apart from that are generally Death Eaters. This is such a small fraction of the total Slytherin population. I believe that all of the others are basically normal people who aren't going to go out of there way to fight Harry or otherwise be a dickhead.

Not one Slytherin student asked to stay and fight. No one objected to being thrown out. Not a single one. That says a lot about that house. We also have no Slytherin stand up for a non-Death Eater at any point in the series. No one calls out Malfoy on his actions. No one goes to talk to Harry.

Also, Umbridge, arguably the evilest character in the series (as she is the one who does Voldemort's mass deportations WITH GLEE), was sorted there and she was not a Death Eater.

But the point stands, not one Slytherin did anything ever, not when Malfoy called for racial purges at 12, not when he was a bastard about buckbeak or during GoF. No one stood up.

  If everyone treats the character as if they are perfect, that's a Sue. Failure or success has little to do with it as long as the character makes some (somewhat) impactful mistakes (Harry with Sirius, Hermione with Malfoy).
#+end_quote

Even if everyone treats the Sue prospect as perfect, if she's up against tall odds, she's not a Mary Sue. If she's struggling, she's not a Sue. Plenty of characters are universally beloved in-universe, but the struggle they undergo to accomplish their goals separate them from Suedom.

The Mary/Gary Sue feeling comes from the idea that your Main Characters defining ability that makes them not the average chump can be replicated or worst your Main Characters defining ability is All of the Abilities. Fanon Hermione leans into this with her not only being better than Harry in everything but also doing his Homework and Writing his Essays and Harry is really a 4th year in 7th year classes who can barely keep up with his class.

** Harry/Hermione. Like another person said, it always seems to hijack the plot and make it all about their relationship. And I find romance stories boring. And on top of that, they always butcher Hermione's character into this flat idea of a person. She's all smarts, morals, and pushiness (written as love or something), with little else to make her actually likeable.

I've run into way too many fics that had interesting premises but then forgot about them in favour of the H/Hr ship. No wonder I've grown to like Hermione less and less as I've read more fanfiction.

** Harry/Ginny rarely comes without Ron/Hermione and the Big Weasley family. I have honestly given up on the pairing due to the common ways it is written.

I came looking for HP fanfics because I wanted a better/more in-depth version of Harry/Ginny. And I am still looking because I find R/Hr as convincing as two children atop each other in a long coat and find the behaviour of Mrs Weasley absolutely appealing (to Sirius in OotP, to Hermione in GoF, the lack of action against the Dursleys despite claiming she was worried in CoS and knowing that he got no food later on).

I have yet to read a single H/G fic which has no big Weasley family, no Ron/Hermione, no Lupin/Tonks and no Death Eater revisionism, and I have been looking for years. The best I have found was H/G/Hr smut, and that doesn't really fit the bill. Gimme that postwar ass-kicking power-couple without anything else weighing them down. Or them being a force to be reckoned with in book five and beyond.
