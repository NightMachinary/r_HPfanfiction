A lot of people recently have pointed out that Ron was under-utilized in canon and that he should have been written in a different way. As someone who always liked Ron, I don't think I really agree with this sentiment. I don't think canon!Ron was that badly written. I think that the problem is that his achievements in canon are underappreciated. For that reason I feel that I should defend canon Ron.

*The purpose of Ron and why he was important for Harry's development*

Some people think that Ron was a negative for Harry because he supposedly made him more lazy and less interested in intellectual pursuits. According to these people, Harry is more intelligent and powerful than we see him in canon, but he was dragged down somehow by Ron. I don't think there is enough evidence to support this, but for the sake of the argument, lets assume that it's true. Lets assume that Ron dragged Harry down academically.

What people who make these arguments miss is the message of the series. Harry was never meant to defeat Voldemort by being too powerful. The fantasy of Harry being a scholar who trains endlessly in order to match Voldemort's strength is fanfiction. Harry was meant to defeat Voldemort /with his ability to love/, not with his knowledge and combat skills. That is literally the whole point of Harry's character, his true strengths were his moral code and his ability to be a loving person.

The reason the Weasleys as a whole are important is exactly because they were able to provide a loving environment for Harry and helped him develop strong bonds with them that later on aided him in his quest. Say what you want about the Weasleys , but they treated Harry like a member of their own family and that was exactly what Harry needed. He needed the experience of a real family. Independent!Harry is good for fanfiction but misses the point of what his true character wanted. Harry didn't want to be "independent", his greatest desire was to have his parents back as we saw in the Mirror of Erised. He wanted a family.

Ron is important specifically because he was a good friend for Harry and offered him a loving family. Ron was also the one who brought the trio together and we saw that both Harry and Hermione were unhappy without him.

*Was Ron really a bad friend?*

Was Ron really a bad friend because he showed some moments of weakness? I don't think so. Ron was overall a loyal friend who risked his life for his friends even at the age of 11. He continually followed Harry around in dangerous missions while they often didn't even have a real plan or any real guidance. At the mere age of 13, he was ready to get killed by Sirius Black for Harry's sake. He asked to be tortured by Bellatrix in Hermione's place. That is more than what most people in real life can ask of their own friends. People who say that Harry should have abandoned Ron after their fight in GoF miss that those two people were not just friends. At this point , they were more like family and they had risked their lives for one another. I don't know about you, but I think it's pretty cruel to ask someone to disown their teenage brother for making a mistake like this.

*Was Ron weak and useless?*

I don't think Ron was weak and I think he proved his strength many times. He defeated McGonagall's chess game at the age of 11. He was involved in many battles with trained adults and came out without crippling injuries. His skill was praised by Tonks who was an auror. For all the talk about how Harry and Ron were weak as wizards, they actually have some impressive feats for their age. However, like I said earlier, the fight against Voldemort was never about combat strength in the first place.

*Why is Ron hated so much?*

Ron is hated for various reasons. First, lets get the obvious out of the way and say that some people just don't like his character. That's their prerogative. Then lets focus on other factors that make the anti-Ron crowd even bigger than it probably should be:

/Movies/: Harry, Ron and Hermione are all a bit different in the movies than they're in the books. Movie!Harry is more passive than in the books. In the movies he couldn't even assert himself as a Quidditch team captain during the trials. (he managed just fine in the books) Movie!Hermione is more "perfect" than book!Hermione to the point where she's even given some of Harry's and Ron's good moments from the books. (for example the scene with the dragon in the DHs, or the scene with Sirius in the Shrieking Shack) In the books, she's competent and smart but also shows moments of weakness that are largely absent in the movies. Movie!Ron doesn't have a lot going for him because a lot of his good moments from the books are absent. I think that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2wpx2o/book_ron_vs_movie_ron/][this post]] does a good job of showing the various ways that Ron was undermined in the movies.

/Fanfiction/: I think that fanfiction has actually brainwashed some people into thinking that Ron was worse than he truly was. For example, the "slimy Slytherins" thing where Ron is supposedly some huge anti-Slytherin bigot is largely based on fanfiction yet I have seen some people argue about it like it is canon. The truth is that Ron of course has a negative opinion of Slytherin, but no more than other characters, like even Harry himself. However, is having a negative view of Slytherin really that bad considering the overall political climate in the series? You can blame Rowling herself if you want, but Slytherin IS the house that actively promotes bigotry. Saying that Ron was an anti-Slytherin bigot is like saying that he was an anti-bigotry bigot. That being said, Ron never goes out of his way to mock and bully Slytherins like some people portray him to. Ron is /indifferent/ towards Slytherins except for Malfoy and his gang who are bullies.

/Shipping wars/: I don't think it needs much of an explanation, but the shipping wars have damaged a lot of characters. People don't like that Ron ended up with Hermione and that's fine, however they also sometimes go out of their way to interpret his actions in the most uncharitable way possible in order to support their narrative.

I didn't write this post in order to change the minds of Ron haters. Rather, I wrote this post for the Ron fans who think that Ron was under-utilized in the series and should have been written differently. I believe that canon!Ron deserves more appreciation because he really is a good character.


** Ron's place in the trio is as an emotional fulcrum. There are people who will see the value in this and those who won't. Even something small like this.

#+begin_quote
  “She'll (Skeeter) twist everything he says,” Harry said under his breath.

  “Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or any- thing,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another --- it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.

  “Hagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.”

  Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch. (Book 4, Ch. 21)
#+end_quote

Or this.

#+begin_quote
  “What'll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all right?”

  “You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It's us we need to worry about.”

  “What do you mean?”

  “Well, I don't know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”

  All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.

  (Book 7, Ch. 27)

Ron never lets them get too wrapped up in things.

Agreed. It comes to a point in book seven where the trio taking out death eaters is just mentioned in passing. They have no real trouble with them outside of the truly experienced ones (Bellatrix, Dolohov, etc.)

** Ron is hated for the greatest sin of all, being an average teenager. I agree that he wasn't under-utilized at all, but even people who like Ron often wish that he was written exceptional in some way, like making him super strategist because he is good at chess, which I think it would be defeating his purpose as a character.

*** This. Hermione is a nerd with a smug streak whose bossy attitude caused her to irritate people around her. She'd rather read a book than live her life. Writers who think of going to school as 'min-maxing' love her, because they don't remember what school is like when you're 12, so the character who is content to learn new spells all day suits their preferences.

Harry is a broody, headstrong loner. He's quick to judge, initially quite unconnected to the magical world (without Ron's experience or Hermione's booksmarts), and for all that fanon loves to make him a hard working domestic polymath from his childhood with the Dursleys, there's little in canon to support that that continued in any way while he was at Hogwarts.

Ron's superpower is being able to form a social network of friends who he is on relatively equal footing with. He doesn't piss anyone off besides Malfoy, who hated him before they met because of their fathers. He's casual, more devoted to having a fun school experience than learning every obscure fact he possibly can or getting to the bottom of Malfoy's latest scheme, and while he has big dreams and a fear of being overlooked, he's hardly defined by that.

In the trio of two dorks, the sociable man is king.

#+begin_quote
  “Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.

  Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, *but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach*

Or when she bullied an orphan and a poor kid into donating to a cause they never believed in. Harry and Ron respectively. Ron's family savings amounted to a single Galleon. So, Ron might have given her all the pocket money he ever had so she would fuck off. That and her SPEW campaign alienated her from her house. Probably because she tried bullying people into donating as well.

**** But if you want to understand why people dislike Ron, you need to understand how he relates to the biggest gripes the fandom has with the series and how marginalizing him helps to solve many of these issues. No Ron means no power of love, no OBHWF, no shipping wars, etc. with no downsides whatsoever plot-wise. I mean you can like Ron all you want, but unless you're just rethreading canon while keeping all the themes untouched, Ron is basically deadweight. Most of the best Ron fics have him become a much better character (or at the very least /effective/ comic relief) than he is in canon exactly for this reason.

The HP series is a symbolic battle between love and evil and it was that way ever since the first book. Marginalizing the Weasleys is okay for fanfiction. Fanfiction authors can do whatever they want. However, trying to paint the canon!Weasleys as useless is like missing the whole point of canon!Harry's character.

I think the main issue here is that important and well-written/well-used aren't the same thing. Ron brought plot resoluting elements to the series for sure, but the way he brought them, and the baggage he brought with them are what people complain about. Just because an element is key to the plot it doesn't mean it's not criticizable.

I also agree with the other user mentioning how Ron's importance basically ends in year 3. He already brought everything to the table by that point, and after that he's basically Neville tier: good fighter, gryffindor brave, puts life on the line when required, that's it.

** I think Ron plays a major role in Harry's development and as a part of the trio til the end of the third year. He has major contributions in important parts of the story (for example Troll, Trials at the end of the first year, CoS, Whomping Willow). However, starting with Hermione and Harry using the time-turner to free Sirius he rarely has a large contribution anymore compared to Harry and Hermione.

In year four Ron has a largely negative role with the falling out and Yule Ball. In year five and six Ron doesn't have much of a positive influence and in year seven he abandons his friends on the hunt.

I think you are correct in saying that his influence as someone that offered Harry the chance at a family shouldn't be understated, but in my opinion, that influence was already established by third year (probably earlier). Meaning that after that point he has such a marginal role in the successes of the trio. If you compare it to the utilisation of both Harry and Hermione they are much more important and above all constant through seven books. So I'd say that Ron is underappreciated for what he did bring, but also got shafted after third year.

** I love Ron. I think he was great when the series was a children's story, and not so much when the series became YA. I have to confess that I like the later books less. JKR is just not very good at writing romance, and she insisted on pairing everyone. Neither the Ron/Hermione nor the Harry/Ginny relationship are developed very well in the books, IMO. I think a lot of readers who are into romance wanted Harry/Hermione, and thus the hate for Ron. In the movies, of course, with their obsession to make Hermione the Mary Sue of the series, they did that at Ron's expense.

Also, I was never convinced by Ron the great chess player. That came out of nowhere. He just did not have any of the characteristics of chess players.

** I think Ron's problem in fandom is pretty much the same as it is in-universe: He's constantly overshadowed. He does accomplish a number of things, but his successes tend to be either off-screen, or immediately overshadowed by Harry (and sometimes Hermione) having bigger successes or bigger, more plot-relevant problems. Add to it that Ron's FAILURES get a whole lot more attention, and are usually played for laughs, while his positive influences are sort of brushed aside, it becomes easier for some readers to just dismiss him as worthless.

Twice in the series JKR tries to show Ron's value in the trio by showing what it's like when he isn't there -- and it's extremely obvious that Harry's MISERABLE without Ron, and also that Harry and Hermione don't really work that well together without Ron as the link between them. Problem is, both these times Ron is gone thanks to a fight he's had with Harry... and so the same readers also get the "Ron isn't only worthless, he's a bad friend who betrays Harry once per book!" (Which just goes to show that they don't know the meaning of the word "betrayal," and that they can't be very good at counting... but I digress.)

And in that sense, I think Ron WAS underutilized. Unlike Harry and Hermione, he never really got a moment when he was the hero of the day. Whenever his successes were on-screen they were always counteracted by him being punished or made fun of in other ways, and whenever he actually got praise and acknowledgment for anything the actual success was always off-screen, and was almost immediately overshadowed anyway.

I think what Ron NEEDED, both as a character and as a person, was a few moments where he clearly got to shine as HIMSELF, not just as Harry's supporting player. Maybe even a book where it was Ron and not Harry who saved the day in the end. (I still think the fourth book would have been the ideal place for that.)

Besides, this could also be a new learning experience for Harry, who might for once experience what it's like to NOT be the hero, the important one. Because... looking at Harry, I don't think he'd handle that very well at all. Sure, he'll claim he's just Harry, that he doesn't want the fame, that there's nothing special about him... but check his reaction when Ron and Hermione are made Prefects and he isn't. He does NOT take it well. He gets upset and jealous, he feels left out, he starts wondering why RON became Prefect when HE wasn't... Of course the meeting with the Boggart, when he for a moment thinks Ron has died, shakes him up enough that he gets a bit of perspective, but this really does make one thing clear (at least to me): Harry doesn't know how to handle it when he ISN'T the center of things.

In fact, Harry kind of tends to take Ron and Hermione's support for granted, while not really realizing that he doesn't actually extend the same kind of support back to them... or that they repeatedly put their own lives aside to be there for him, while he doesn't do the same for them.

It could have been a good lesson for him to learn. Both Ron and Harry might get a glimpse into how the other lived, and get a new appreciation for what the other goes through... and then continued their friendship as true equals.

** Well; said, well said.

The really bad stories I've read, Ron was just friends with Harry in order to get money and fame from him. Maybe in the beginning, Ron became friends with Harry, because he was curious about him, but I doubt it was to get money and fame, especially given the amount of times he and his family often got hurt in the process of helping Harry.

There are even super bad stories out there that I've read, where Ron is the one to treat Muggleborns as; inferior, and call Hermione a Mudblood; even though that's something he's never done, it was always Draco.

Just makes me drop the story super quick, in those cases.

I do wish he was utilized a little bit more than he was in canon; I mean he was super smart when he came to Chess, he could have used that to his advantage and come up for ideas to help Harry out with stuff. But that's more of a nitpick with stuff.

And yeah, MovieHermione is something I just don't like, she seems way too perfect, to the point where it's eye rolling.

As you said it was Ron who played the giant chess piece in first year, Ron who joined Harry in the Forbidden Forest, to look for the spiders (which Ron's afraid of, by the way). Ron who was often with Harry, for Harry. Sure he would fight with Harry, and even leave; but he always came back.

Life isn't just about defeating Voldemort. You are doing exactly what most people (including Ron) do to Harry. Reducing him to his identity and disregarding him as a person.

The end of DH is tragic for Harry as a person, because he developed very little as a person and goes into a career just because fighting bad guys it's a thing that he is used to. What's worse is that he's stuck with Ron as a friend, because he met them first and Ginny as a wife because she was willing.

These supposed "strong bonds" are vastly overstated by Weasley fanboys & -girls. There's very little actual help coming from the Weasleys and in many ways they can be blamed for further isolating and restricting Harry by encouraging him to define himself through others. The Weasleys are more like a less fancy summer retreat for Harry.

Absolutely not. There's many instances where Molly clearly treats Harry as a guest and very differently from her actual children. This is complete fanon. Harry has very little contact to the other Weasley children besides Ron, saying that they are like siblings to him is absurd.

  his greatest desire was to have his parents back as we saw in the Mirror of Erised. He wanted a family.

Yeah and to me (and others who are critical of the Weasley connection) the Weasleys represent a kind-of fake family for Harry. I have very few structural problems with the Ginny/Harry realtionship (more in execution), but one of the few that I see is that with Molly's domineering personality Harry will have a hard time growing into his own person and having his *own* family, and not an alien family on permanent loan.

#+begin_quote
  Ron is important specifically because he was a good friend for Harry and offered him a loving family
#+end_quote

You are just arguing that it's good to have friends. Almost any other character could have fulfilled that role (if they have a family). Also it's not really Ron's accomplishment that the Weasleys are so welcoming to the boy-who-lived. That's on Harry, their society and in the nature of the Weasleys.

Right, it's very typical and normal for kids that age to stop going on adventures and say: "No, you don't even have a plan. I will stop being your friend now because I only am friends with people who have rational plans and guidance." /s

Is there some kind of point hidden there that I'm not seeing?

What's worse is that is exactly what Ron did when he was all grown up and got more cognizant of their situation in DH.

I agree that it's bad to mistake fanon for canon, but I wouldn't dismiss fanfiction as a "bad" influence entirely. Many "thought experiments" and essay-like plot developments take place in fanfiction and allow us to investigate characters and their motivation in a different light.

It certainly helped me to see characters like Dumbledore or Ron in a more analytical and discerning light and for those two it has almost never been in a positive way. The more you divorce them from the axiomatic / word-of-god analysis the more problems appear.

#+begin_quote
  Shipping wars
#+end_quote

Sure, I bet that matters a lot. I've always been more anti-Romione than pro any particular pairing. I don't think it's wrong to be protective of a fictional character and not want to see them end up in a miserable relationship with a total git. Obviously that sometimes makes me hyper-focused on Ron's flaws, I won't deny that. Nevertheless these things are canon (like Ron comparing girls with visual flaws to trolls and dismissing their character right into Hermione's face).

Edit: IMHO your post misses something quite important. Ron is just an uninteresting character to me. My dislike for Snape, Draco or Dumbledore is much stronger than my dislike for Ron, but they are all interesting characters in their own right that can have intriguing plot-lines in fanfiction. Ron is just casually unlikeable and boring to me and I want him to go away as much as possible.

I'm not defending a powerful!independent!Harry by complaining that Ron is holding him back.

I agree with Rowling that Harry shouldn't have won through his great magical prowess.

#+begin_quote
  How did they "isolate" him? You're offering 0 examples. The Weasleys helped him in any way they could.
#+end_quote

They didn't even introduce him to their neighbours?!?!

#+begin_quote
  Really? I don't think many people would abandon school to go on a suicide mission without even having a real plan or a strategy or anything.
#+end_quote

Yeah Ron is a real go-getter at school and wouldn't jump at the oppportunity to go on an adventure, because he's not at all a typical Gryffindor *rolls eyes*.

Edit: I have to ask myself if Ron would accompany Harry into the US to study arithmancy if the solution to the Voldemort problem lay in solving mathematic equations and studying history, with zero chance of encountering any kind of exciting adventures.

#+begin_quote
  I would argue that Harry was actually more into Quidditch than even Ron himself. It was Harry who first became the star athlete after all , not Ron.
#+end_quote

Harry likes to fly. He doesn't show anywhere close the amount of enthusiasm to the sport itself or other athletes (like Krum) that Ron does.

But... he wouldn't. He's reluctant to go after the spiders in CoS, and needs to be convinced by Harry. He's reluctant to check out the Mirror of Erised in PS. He doesn't want to consider the possibility that someone is intentionally setting Harry up to die in GoF.

He /comes around/ in all those cases, but it takes convincing by Harry in each one.

He spends the majority of PS helping Harry try to find Nicholas Flamel by reading library books.

He's certainly not as attached to pro teams as Ron, but that's because he doesn't have one that he's loyal to. If I (an American) moved to Europe, I probably wouldn't have much of a stake in the local football/soccer scene. He's not familiar with other pro athletes (though I think he recognizes Gwenog Jones when Slughorn namedrops her?), but he knows each Quidditch player in Hogwarts by name and skill level. Consider all the horrible training Wood puts Harry through, and he barely complains and never considers quitting, even when he's got LOTS of other stuff occupying his attention.

By contrast, Ron doesn't even try out for several years when he's eligible.

  “You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.

  “You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.”

  “I'd like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.

  “And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.”

Ron is upset that he was left out.

Hmm, I wonder why Ron wouldn't want to revisit a Magical Mirror that confronts him with his own insecurities? It's pretty interesting how Ron flees from his Heart's Desire while others waste away in front of the Mirror.

He doesn't flee. He and Harry have a brief scuffle over who gets to keep looking into it. He clearly enjoyed seeing himself in the Mirror. Weird how your 'fact-checking' isn't actually holding up to the facts, huh?

*********** Seriously? You're completely missing the point to make it seem like you have one. He came, he enjoyed seeing himself, he didn't want to go back, because they almost got caught and he doesn't like adventure for adventure's sake.

There, point laid out. Feel free to address it if you actually have something to argue, or to go back to the other post which had several other objectively true points that you conveniently ignored to try to throw yourself at a brick wall.

***** the weasley's live in the country, the nearest neighbour (lovegood or diggory) probably live a kilometer away, also the weasley's don't really seem to have guests over often or even at all. why would they go out of there way to introduce harry to their neighbors which they don't seem to talk to or even interact with. Mr.Weasley knows Amos from work but that's about it. luna and ginny are friends but we never see them interact until book 5, so they probably don't hang out during the summer probably because most of the weasleys boys come back from hogwarts. Harry usually only stays there for a month until hogwarts starts up again and summer passes quite quickly when you're young, doubly so if you spend half of that with one of your closest friends and their family. so there is no reason nor the time to introduce harry to their nieghbours.

****** There's also the fact that the Lovegoods are kinda crazy and that Amos Diggory can't resist bragging and putting Harry down when they meet in GoF.

Remember that most or all of wizardom either hates or worships Harry for most of the series. Anyone outside of the Order that the Weasleys introduced Harry to would either be bowing and scraping or asking uncomfortable questions.

Obviously they wouldn't because Harry is just a guest. I'm arguing against people who firmly believe that Harry is part of the family. I assume people who are part of the family get introduced to neighbours.

Right, I agree. Harry is not as close to the Weasleys as you might think. Obviously he's not close to many people at all, so he gotta take what he can get.

Um... why would you assume that? If you got a new family member, why would you go around to all your neigbours and introduce them? Especially if you weren't all that close to your neighbours, physically OR emotionally? And why would Harry even be interested?

******* If Harry had /any/ family at all, it was definitely the Weasleys. It's obvious that he was welcome in the Weasley household whenever he wanted and Mrs Weasley said that she thinks of Harry as her own son. Also, they did introduce Harry to the Diggory's, didn't they?
