That gives me an idea.

What if, since Tonks can shapeshift, she uses a very small and precise vocabulary as her signature? If she can't guarantee people will recognize her the next time she sees them (especially if it's in a muggle area where she can't change), by /always/ saying "Wotcher" when she greets someone, she's actually saying, "Hello. I'm Tonks, remember?"

In the Delenda Est, Bellatrix is basically an OC.

Why I never published something I literally have 60K words on and am roughly 2/3 the way along on. I've worked on it sporadically when inspiration hits and/or I'm not overwhelmed with real life over the past 3 years. And I spend hours editing and rewriting instead of finishing the story (that no one's read).

If I were publishing anyone who read it would be frustrated as heck and either cursing me for not finishing or bailing on it and forgetting it exists.

I'm not dedicated enough to make "deadlines". It'd be different if I got paid for it, but as a side hobby I go through sometimes multiple months without touching it.

When/if I finish it'll be 100Kish words, and I'll be closing in on one of the others listed above:

#+begin_quote
  500K words and still on year 2
#+end_quote

So no one reads what I write.... but at least I don't fit any of the other criteria. /shrugs/
