Basically as the title says. I'm looking for any fics where characters (be it Harry, Voldemort, or even dumbledore and other supporting characters) become insanely powerful


** linkffn(Core Threads) and linkffn(Blindness) might be enjoyable for you.

In a way, linkffn(A long journey home) works as well.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Honor Thy Blood:

Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

** Ruskbyte's "Order of the Phoenix" [[https://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Order_of_the_Phoenix/index/]] Harry returns to Hogwarts following the rebirth of Voldemort at the end of the Triwizard Tournament, having been inducted into the mysterious Order of the Phoenix during the summer. Which is kind of strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry!

And the squeal "The Well of Shadows" [[https://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Well_of_Shadows/index/]] Sequel to The Order of the Phoenix. Harry and his frineds finds themselves pitted against a force of such ancient and malignant evil that even Voldemort is leery of using it. Add a pair of wacky DADA professors and you can rest assured that all Hell's about to break loose.
