** Making money off of an IP that isn't yours can leave a bad taste in many people's mouths (myself included) at best, and is illegal at its worst.

That being said, from what little I know about [[http://www.patreon.com][Patreon]], patrons donate to their favourite creators directly, rather than for a specific piece of work. Should you provide rewards for donations, however, those can only be original works. I suppose this is less objectionable, as a lot of people post fan art there with little to no problems.

** Yeah, IP laws and such, you won't make any friends trying to do this (see The Author Who Shall Not Be NamedÂ®), and if you don't tread carefully, you'll risk lawsuits.

Honestly, the best way to make money off fanfiction is not to sell it, but rather to use it to polish your writing chops, then sell original fiction stories. I've managed to take in a good amount of pocket cash over the years this way. And I'm small potatoes compared with some: Joe Ducie (joe6991) is now a full-time writer after penning his million-plus words of fanfiction; Jim Bernheimer (jbern) pulls in a healthy amount through his various publishing ventures (his own stories and the small-label publishing business he started).

** Gaining any sort of monetary gain off fanfiction is illegal without written consent of the original creator. It's copyright infringement unless all characters used are in the public domain. Don't toy with this kind of stuff.

**** If you knew you would have also known there was no reason to ask.

Seriously, change it enough to make it a stand-alone story and sell that, if you want income. It takes less effort than you think, you just have to actually do it and have any idea what you are trying to do.

***** Not making money off of fanfiction just wondered about alternatives and I've gotten some good response like publishing original works :) I know selling fan fiction is illegal and I'd never do that.

****** Bad phrasing of the question, then. But it doesn't really matter anymore since you got the answers you wanted.

** 20-30 bucks/month should easily be doable through donations/patreon if you have anything resembling a fanbase. You just have to make sure you're not explicitly being paid for a service.

** [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001197421][Amazon Kindle Worlds]] - As long as you are writing for one of their contracted properties, you can publish through them. I've never used the service, but I assume you then are selling the E-Book through their Kindle store, for whatever price you want.

e: >Amazon Publishing will set the price for Kindle Worlds stories. Most are priced from $0.99 through $3.99.
