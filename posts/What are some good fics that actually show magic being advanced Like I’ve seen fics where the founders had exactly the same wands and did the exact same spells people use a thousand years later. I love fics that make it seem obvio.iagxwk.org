#+TITLE: What are some good fics that actually show magic being advanced? Like I’ve seen fics where the founders had exactly the same wands and did the exact same spells people use a thousand years later. I love fics that make it seem obvious that spell/potion development is a thing.

** linkffn(house of potter rebuilt) mentions it in the last 3 chapters I think. How you need to create a new spell to get a charms mastery, and harry himself makes some ‘developments' in runes.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione as a maths prodigy who takes this into Arithmancy, which is the basis of spell creation in that fic. Great read with 2 sequels complete.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]], Harry, a wizard of above-average yet unexceptional magical talent and instinct, uses decades worth of future knowledge of magic to remain on-par with Dumbledore and Grindelwald in the early 1900s.

** Invincible linkffn(13161929) 2012 crossover with the radiation being exceptionally deadly to magicals. Harry leads a team to get off Earth, then they run into Cylons. First dozen chapters or so are R&D to create a self sustaining magical starship.

Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path linkffn(11898648) Harry is a rune prodigy and he makes several inventions.

The Last Mage Of Krypton linkffn(12191520) Maybe not development so much as reverse engineering. Harry is Kal-El, sent to the Potters, not the Kents. Once AI Jor-El is activated they drag wizards into the 20th century and beyond.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
