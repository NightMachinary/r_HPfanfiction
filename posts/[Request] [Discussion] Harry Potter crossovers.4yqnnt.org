I'm in a very crossover-y mood at the moment, and was wondering was wondering what your guys' favorite crossovers were? Along with what ones you would recommend and what you people like to see in a HP crossover. Fusion? Dimension crossing? Just certain elements of one mixed with the other?

Personally, I enjoy fusion and dimension crossing, they're both quite fun. Especially some of the more entertaining ones I have been reading. Like linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth), where Harry gets thrown into the far future, and doesn't really take itself seriously, or the ones where Harry just sorta becomes the protagonist in the world he was thrown into like in linkffn(Rise of the Dragon Child).

What are y'all's favorite crossovers, and what elements do you prefer when mixing two or more different stories together?


** Browncoat, Green Eyes is my personal favorite crossover. This story will make a lot more sense if you're familiar with both Firefly (tv) and Serenity (movie). I think the author does a particularly skillful unification of the HP universe and the Firefly universe.

** linkffn(11157943;8099181)

*I still haven't found what I'm looking for* is probably my current favourite xover. And generally the stories where Harry(or someone else) gets dropped into a different universe are better written

The idea behind a fusion fics is cool but I don't think I've ever found/read a single good one that wasn't a Mass Effect cross, at least can't remember right now.

Some crossovers I like and everything else by /Steelbadger/ too linkffn(8099181;11115934;11132113)

Oh! And I absolutely /loathe/ stories where someone^{^{^{harry}}} end up in some other world and everything stays the same except Harry is now around to provide the author's opinions telling everyone how stupid they are being and doing absolutely nothing productive during the whole story...

Ok rant over.

#+end_quote

I'll agree with that. All the good fusion fics I read are mass effect crossovers. examples being linkffn(No Gods, Only Guns; Mass Effect: Glorious Shotgun Princess)

No Gods, Only Guns is classic Borderlands insanity in the Mass Effect universe. Probably dead but definitely worth a read if you like either one.

Mass Effect: Glorious Shotgun Princess is a fusion of... something. I'm really not sure what. Interesting read, though, and completed. It's sequel is probably dead, however. Then again the author has been writing for a long time, so they may just be taking a break...

For crossovers, there is the oft recommended linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force) which I heartily recommend as well. Mercenary!Harry is always a fun trope, especially when the person writing it doesn't make Harry an utter tool.

Linkffn(The Observer Effect) is an Avengers crossover. Mostly Fem!Harry/Tony fluff with a little sadness thrown in.

linkffn(Red Like the Storm) is another fem!Harry. This one gets involved with the Hitman Reborn! mafia world and becomes a hyper little chipmunk thief called The Thieving Magpie. (Note: not an actual chipmunk)

linkffn(Itachi, Is That a Baby?) is a crackfic that is exactly what it says on the tin.

linkffn(Mystic Knight Online) is a Sword Art Online crossover with a rather nicely mature Harry getting stuck in SOA due to Lucius Malfoy's machinations.

Linkffn(Black Magic by Lunatic Howling in the Night) is a LoTR crossover. I don't want to spoil anything, aside from a slightly confusing writing style, but it's got a unique character in it.

I definitely like crossovers. I like them more so than fusions, but that's mainly because most people can't write fusions properly. In crossovers, especially multidimensional crossovers, it creates a lot of chaos, because the two sides have to figure out the other's capabilities before they can make any drastic moves. It makes for a lot of opportunities a good author can exploit.

When it comes to story elements, I usually prefer Harry crossing over to the other story's dimension. Hogwarts just doesn't have very much to drive the story with. Naruto!verse has its wars and politics, Avengers!verse has its massive invasion and missions. Potter!verse just has a school. It's a very magical school, but it's still just a school. Doesn't give much oomf to the story.

**** Glorius Shotgun Princess is great. I think it's a cross with a tabletop rpg world By White wolf known as Exalted. But yeah when I first read I had absolutely no idea what was happening half the time, just that it was AWESOME!

And the moment when Legion delivers a verbal smackdown to Harbinger in the virtual world is one of my favourite moments on any story ever.

I have read that story, and it's very well written and fun, but I just didn't like how the characterized Shepard at the beginning of the story. I have nothing against Renegade Shep, but if I'm not mistaken, the Renegade Shep in this is the Butcher of Torfan, which doesn't fit anything for the Avatar. None of the other Avatars we know of were that flat out violent, Kyoshi killed, yes, but she didn't kill people that surrendered, like the Butcher of Torfan, and even the other Avatars, who did kill people, didn't do so unless absolutely necessary.

I did love how a lot of the different races had bending though, that was really cool.

Yeah, I can't think of a /well written/ Harry Potter fusion crossover that wasn't Mass Effect, but I have seen a couple, there are a couple of Halo ones, where either Master Chief gets thrown back in time, and stomps some Voldemort ass, or Harry gets thrown into the future and becomes a Spartan. I can't say I'm a fan of the latter, but the former is a bit of a guilty pleasure.

There's also at least one Doctor Who/Harry Potter fusion I can think of with an interesting premise that is...decent. linkffn(Hermione Song) Hermione is River Song, it was...okay from what I remember.

I know! It makes no sense, the story should be changed when you drop Harry into the world, it's irrevocably changed the second he steps foot there, whether he's more timid but determined, snarky and callous, or just plain badass.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an interesting life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. AU featuring HP characters if they were born into the Witcher world.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

** The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Black Magick. linkffn(7156926)

It's a Harry Potter/Hellsing crossover. It definitely has some flaws/things that would turn people off of it (mainly oc-based, it's the sequel to a fully Hellsing story, there's definitely some bias towards Hellsing so they get to show the wizards up a lot, and there's definite Mary Sue elements), but overall I really enjoyed it.

As for fusion/dimension crossing/mixing elements together, I would say I really mostly enjoy dimension crossing. Funnily enough, I guess Black Magick would be technically a fusion, but because the worlds of both Hellsing and Harry Potter are both quite segregated from the normal world and each other, there's definitely that 'culture shock' element that I quite enjoy in dimension crossing fics.

** I've posted this before. Right now I'm in a PJO mood, so these. There are others from other Fandoms, but at the moment here are these

These are some of my favorite. I like the twice blessed challenge, but really I just like a demigod Harry. These are a fem Harry, so take that as you will. The author is quite good and I liked them. They are only the first part though. There are second parts being written. The idea for each is that a femharry is the daughter of one of the big three. The author wrote a story for each scenario. I like them all, but consul of the dead is my favorite. They ask feature a little crossover with Rick Riordan's other books featuring Egyptians and Romans. The reason I like this so much is because in Consul of the dead we see Harry grow into a person. We also see real family relationships between the daughters of hades. Yeah they might not seem possible because of the age gap, but the female goddess daughters of hades are portrayed as immortal college age girls. This has shown to be okay with the hunters and somehow the author makes it work.I'll admit there are some cliche moments and it's not for everyone, but I liked it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309061/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-The-Game-Begins]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey]])

This is a good one as well. It is a unique look on what kind of parents Harry can have. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.

I won't bother reposting since I've already seen them, but "itachi is that a baby" and "when Harry meet Wednesday" are both good. Good in different ways. The first is a crack fic with a decent storyline and the second is a BDSM filled story with dark undertones, but I find it refreshing.

I will always recommend harveste Addams even if it's not complete. It's an Addams family crossover split into books. It's weird, but somehow satisfying.

There also some interesting ranma ones, but I can't think of their names off the top of my head. If you want to know I'll look them up

Last is a Naruto cross where kushina is a fem harry. Long explanation short a "mommaHarry" fresh from childbirth gets pulled through a ritual to the order. It had a really off premise, but I liked it linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8679745/1/Troubles-in-Time]])

** One of my favorites is You Can't Keep a Good Dog Down. Sadly it's incomplete and I don't have much hope of it ever finishing. Stargate SG-1 x Harry Potter with a very brief mention of The Mummy. The Harry Potter characters are a little OOC, but it's over lookable.

I'm on mobile, if someone could link it for me I'd appreciate it. FFN has it as does hpff I think.

I quite liked /Deal with a Devil/, a Dresden Files crossover but not a fusion. Without spoiling too much, the differences between both verses are even a topic the author deals with in the story. linkffn(11188292)

There are a number of Bewitched fusions I did have fun reading, though more for the humor value the power difference generates than for the great stories themselves. Those I know off the top of my head are /Harry Potter and the Eternal Realm/, which is still in progress, /Harry Potter and the Elder Sect/, which is complete and the one-shot /Harrison Potter Stevens/. linkffn(11329168;7051218;8399415)

/Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force/ as well as its unfinished sequel /Harry Potter and the Circle of Light/ are a fusion with the /Oh My Goddess!/ manga. The tale starts pre-Hogwarts and is mostly a good light-hearted read, but the author has slowed down a lot in writing and posting his latest updates, so I don't give it the best chances of ever being finished properly. linkffn(7846068;11577632)

Bobmin's crossover trilogy with Anne McCaffrey's /Dragonriders of Pern/ books will forever stay incomplete. Bobmin died with one of his best works unfinished. Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun reading /The Queen who fell to Earth/, /On the Wings of Dragons/ and /Beneath Sovereign Skies/. Read it as a tribute to one of the more prolific HP writers if nothing else. linkffn(7591040;8186304;10301672)

In contrast to those Addams Family stories mentioned by others, I'd like to add /Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy Bears and Spot/ to the list. This is a crossover with the old 1960's TV show /The Munsters/ and is delightfully humorous and cracky. A long one-shot at 22k words, begins pre-Hogwarts too as far as I remember. linkffn(9136440)

One Mass Effect crossover not mentioned here, I'm frankly a little surprised by that, is the still unfinished /Blue Magic/. The last update was about 18 months ago, so I'm not too sure if it should count as abandoned by now or not, but what has been written thus far is already a nice story. It begins, as surprisingly many of my suggestions did, pre-Hogwarts - most likely because so many of the other I would have suggested are already listed here. In my mind this story is the perfect fusion of Harry Potter and Mass Effect, but it is still early days and I may come to hate the author's attempt at a shared universe if he ever shows more than a few allusions. Hopefully the author does come back to this, because on his Fanfiction.net Author's page he mentioned a planned sequel at the time of the Mass Effect games and that's something I'd love to read! linkffn(8643565)

/The Wizard on the Edge of Forever/ is one in a very small number of Harry Potter crossovers with the Star Trek fandom and in my eyes by far the best of them all. Well okay, there was /The Forever Mage/ too, but while I enjoyed it, a word of warning: it's one of Darth Marrs' stories and his writings are not everyone's cup of tea. linkffn(4944819;5402371)

There is one Stargate crossover which should be on every favorites list, /The Astria Porta Project/. It is sadly much too short, but offers an excellent idea of how those two vastly different fandoms could be fused together. linkffn(9920217;5931066)

  When Harry goes to the Zoo with the Dursleys on Dudley's 11th birthday, he meets Samantha Stephens, who learns that Harry is a distant cousin and that he's being mistreated at home. She rescues him and she and her mother Endora begin teaching Harry witchcraft. A Harry Potter / Bewitched crossover, for now the story will categorize as HP only.

  Someone saw Harry Potter dropped off on a doorstep and refused to allow that to happen. Instead, he was adopted by a magical family, a family very different than what wizarding society was used to. Note: the Bewitched timeline was moved forward to fit into the Harry Potter universe.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.
