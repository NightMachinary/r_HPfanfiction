  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

** I actually saw this fic when scrolling through and passed by it because I thought that it wasn't interesting for me probably a couple years back now that I thick about it and now I come across it again you have interested me now so now it's going on my wait list of fanfics, of which there are five, for me to read later so thanks for that! :)

Edit: Good story thanks for the read.
