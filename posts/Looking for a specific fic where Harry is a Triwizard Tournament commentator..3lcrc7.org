Just as the title says: instead of being entered in the tournament, Harry, due to his academic prowess, is asked to be a commentator of the tasks. I distinctly remember a scene where he was commenting on the first task along with Bagman.

Harry acts as a commentator for the tasks in this fanfic.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
