Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

circular reasoning, prisoner's cypher and denarian renegade are for the dumbledore. the latter can be a bit of a clusterfuck and i suggest skimming through the ridiculous anime-like fight scenes. the others have more of a canon-feel.

as a rule of thumb, if ron and dumbledore appear 3-D, you're probs reading a well written story. esp dumbledore. tough to write.

hallowed has a well done darker dumbledore. he has good intentions but no qualms about using his power.

*** Not abused, Albus said it would be difficult. However, he also said it would be the strongest protection he could give, and would allow Harry to survive until adulthood.

This is a good thing.

And the Dursleys definitely qualify as child abusers, if they didn't outright torture Harry (the cupboard and the rations he got were smaller than in postwar Germany immediately after our surrender). Harry getting abused is definitely canon. Dumbledore placed him in that environment and knew it would be shitty. That is criminal behaviour, abuse of power and what not. And that is also 100% what Rowling wrote.

***** Not according to the standards of the 1980's and especially not according to the standards of the 1880s. And criminal behaviour? Really? Maybe for muggle America in 2018, sure. But for Wizarding Britain circa 1980's? Do you have a canon book of wizarding laws to refer to for a citation there old chum? Hell, not even really for Muggle Britain during the 1980's or early 90's.

Also, as I said, far better that he cop a bit of abuse, lack of emotional support from his guardians while he's a youngster, than being actually dead. There's no coming back from dead. We've no idea what sort of support that exists in Magical Britannia. And don't go referring to some fanon stuff to continue the point. Canon for Citations, or Nothing.

****** The Dursleys kept Harry on rations below 800 calories at least twice (CoS and GoF) and it is mentioned that he is malnourished in the first chapter of PS. The recommendations for a child are 2500-3200. And the cupboard needs no further explanation. Now if we take a look at at CHILDREN'S ACT OF 1933, yes more than 50 years before canon was set, it becomes clear that the Dursleys abused Harry, even by the laws of the time.

******* Wow! I did not realise the books mentioned his kilojoule intake. Seems perfectly in line with Rowlings young childrens storybook writing style.

However, just to be a pedant, I'm gunna ask for a complete quotation of that section of the book, only canon please.

  The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray.
#+end_quote

According to a quick Google search, a can of soup has 100-300 kcal, Harry doesn't eat everything and given that he is literally hurting from hunger, his other meals were not better. 3*250 = 750 kcal.

And the GoF breakfast scene with Dudley and the grapefruit is even worse.

********* Of course, that quote said that's all he ate, all day, there were never any changes, and its not hyperbole. Quite right. Don't be a nonce.

Also, I believe I asked for canon wizarding law, and also stated at the beginning, that this is better than death.

He did not notice Voldemort in his castle for nine months, did not figure out the Basilisk, did not step in when Fudge tried to have Sirius executed despite knowing that it was wrong and holding countless political positions, did not notice that his friend was impersonated for nine months, did nothing when a teacher was torturing his students (and making someone disappear is easy with magic), did not stop a Death Eater from nearly killing at least four innocent bystanders...

Do I need to go on? That was 100% canon.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezor with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

With all of this, Senior Auror Ron Weasley can't believe Harry thought it a grand time to take a desk job.
