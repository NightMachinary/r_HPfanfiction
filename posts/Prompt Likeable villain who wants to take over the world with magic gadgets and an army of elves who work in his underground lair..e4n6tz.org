Basically despicable me magic edition.


** ...I thought this was supposed to be Santa Claus from the title.

EDIT:

"The truth is, Potter, when a Dark Lord succeeds... why, he changes history itself so that he was never truly a dark lord," said Snape.

"That's a lie!" shouted Harry. "When you betrayed my parents, when you gave yourself to Voldemort, was it so one day you could say that you were on the right side of history?"

Snape paused, almost imperceptibly, but Harry had known him long enough to know that for some reason he was strained. When next he spoke, he was angrier than useful. "Of course not, idiot boy. I'm talking about the Dark Lord Nicholas of Myra."

"Who?"

Snape sneered, "You know him as Santa Claus. A thousand years ago he convinced the world that he was the Emperor of the North, and ever since then he has ruled the Winter Court of the Fae with an iron fist, yet all the world sees him as benevolent."

This was the stupidest shit Harry had ever heard.
