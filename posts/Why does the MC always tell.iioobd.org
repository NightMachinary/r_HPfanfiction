In time travel fics why does the MC always tell others about them being from the future or another dimension or being reborn? and why do they always get accepted? If I was best friends with someone who told me their technically 45 years old I would never talk to them ever again fym.

What would you do if you were in a time travel situation?

*** A lot of time travel stories refuse to tell Dumbledore because 'that manipulative old coot kept me in the dark and thinks he knows what's best for me'.

Then Harry proceeds to lie about his future knowledge to everyone (aside from the love interest and maybe a few close friends), manipulate events so that they go his way, and act as if he knows better than every other person.

***** I have just finished “A Cadmean Victory” and it got me thinking: canonically they actually got past the war with relatively few casualties despite the order's supposedly reactive role, what if the reason of them not having gone on a killing-spree the second the war was announced wasn't because of some moral high-ground, but because the result would have been far more deaths if they had? Voldemort acquired enough power and did enough damage that I can easily picture him deciding to make any victory against him the most pyrrhic he could the second he felt put in a corner.

****** Although not stated, my headcanon was always that Dumbledore specifically asked Harry to keep their lessons in HBP a secret because he didn't want a repeat of the first war (as a young kid I found Moody's recount of the late members quite unsettling). He wanted Harry to hunt the Horcruxes quietly and then challenge Voldemort at the right time. This would have ensured a mostly casualty-free war... but Neville fucked up again.

Because of this. If a time traveler goes to Canon Dumbledore (not the "Greater Good Manipulative Old Coot" from fanon), then Voldemort will be vanquished in 2 days (may take a bit of time to get into Malfoy Manor and Gringott), and then what?Either the author made a one shot and can write "/The End/", or you are stuck with tens of chapter of "MC groom little girl to be his future girlfriend" or "An adult in a child body use his previous knowledge to bully children", not to mention "MC completely reform a centuries old institution in 2 weeks because it can't be that hard".

*** Well, that wouldn't make for a very satisfying story :P

Otherwise, Dumbledore is controlling - going to him is essentially putting everything in his hands and away from the time traveler's control. It's not impossible to make that something they wouldn't do - maybe psychological, maybe logical, maybe habit - etc. It could also be a condition of the time travel.

It's annoying when they have completely incompetent Dumbledore and that's the reason he's not told - but I don't mind keeping him out for more meta reasons, too.

** The main problem is that they can't do everything alone (at least not in a good story). They need other people to help them, and the only other way to justify knowledge of the future is to pretend to be a seer (which could be a fun premise). Often with time-travelling Harry it is also needed to explain his crippling PTSD.

Also from a story it is a interesting plot development, seeing how this changes character relationships. Finally the HP universe is terrifyingly unconcerned by this. After a brief Ew moment, nobody cared that Pettigrew had been sleeping in the beds of the Weasley children for years, or that Ginny basically spent her first year being groomed by an older student.

3. By time travelling, you have altered history in such a way that the person you would have become is different than the person that you are, ergo not you, ergo not suicide.

  AU. Year 2148: Gobal Population: 1. He made a mistake 150 years ago or so and now the human race no longer exists. For a century or so, he has sought a way to fix it all. Can he, or is the end of the world inevitable?

** Worse is when the other characters somehow /guess/ that he's from the future/alternate dimension. Like, that is /nobody's/ assumption even within a world with magic.

*** Yeah, but many people would also assume something similar when the MC at age 11 destroys 6 Horcrux, outsmart Dumbledore????? and finesse Voldemort. Some people take PowerfulHarry! to extremes. Powerful is the ability to learn and adapt quickly and other things. Not to cuck everyone with knowledge. That's just stupidity

**** Not really, like even if someone was a super genius power person like that, I still don't think anybody but conspiracy theorists would come to conclusions like that. Time travel is not very ubiquitous and the conception of the limits of time travel are pretty limited in Harry Potter canon especially Peggy Sue type time travel.

***** I get what you mean but sometimes it's painfully obvious and Johnny first year could pick it up. I read one (dropped after half a chapter it was that bad) where Harry tries to get Dumbledore thrown in Azkaban tell the DMLE about the chamber and it's location, out Pettigrew and free Sirius within one day. Some people can't resist pacing and Harry should know as much as Hermoine and Ron why keeping some things secret is important. People Harp on Dumbledore but if he'd told Harry everything he knew about Voldemort and Hocrux and how he s one and how he'll need to die also telling him the prophecy and everything to the last drop of info. Harry would explode. It also allowed Voldemort to see these memories and the knowledge possessed by the enemy leaving the Order vulnerable.

** I'm on/off writing a Witcher crossover and there's really no reason for Geralt to tell anyone he's from a different dimension. He /is/ actively looking for people powerful enough to help him get back, but that is a long process and Geralt does not trust people easily. Many events are also shifted in the timeline and characters are more proactive (Harry is barely involved at first, for instance).

People do find it odd that he fights with a sword and barely does magic, but wizards are not exactly great at connecting dots.

*** It's in some fics where they go back to the first wizarding war and change so much and when someone asks how they know so much instead of preparing a cover story like you've been stalking the dark lord(highly unfeasible yes I understand but it's better than crumbling to 'Uhhm you won't believe me but I'm technically from the future and I know everything). Hermoine says terrible things happen to Wizards who mess with time so that's why you need a cover story for your knowledge or actions. For example, in canon Luna and Trelawny could both be time travellers but speak in such clouded mystery and confuse others to the point of repulsion. However, we see that Trelawney 'unintentionally' is amazing at her job and Luna always knows when to pipe up with crucial info and when to speak runnish to throw people of. I do want to see this fic of yours so when you finish it can I get a link?

**** Sure thing. Life has been kind of crazy lately and I don't want to start publishing it until I have it mostly done and polished. I have a bunch of random chapters and a decent outline set up, so we'll see lol.

** One of the biggest problems with time travel I have is not that his or her friends are accepting. You can be friends with a person who is much older than you. Even in Canon Harry is friends with Hagrid who is like six times his age when Harry starts at Hogwarts.

The real problem starts when the time traveler is in a younger body and goes back to his or her love interest - an he or she is accepting that. I mean seriously: why would a 30+ years old person love a child/teenager in a romantic way if he isn't a pedophile. And in romantic relationships the actual age counts not what you look like.

** Why 'always'?

​

I read several (some in English, some in Russian(PM if you need names/links)), fics where MC(or MCs if more than one, this is usually harmony fics) either

​

- don't tell (or at least try to) others they travel back in time (they just use knowledge from future - sometimes this even mean killing people for things not even planned yet) (one of English-language examples is "Harry Poter and the Temporal Beacon")

​

- tell VERY small circle of friends (like Luna) about some future knowledge and try to prevent that (very grim) future

​

- don't tell anything (sometimes except very limited circle of people, sometimes NO ONE) about future events (and they themselves are not time travellers but mind (or not only) mind travellers from another world and they knew at least parts of canon.

in one example MC knew canon and like Hermione from books. He gets 'invited' by dying (due to Dursleys being very bad people) Harry and make it possible for original Harry's soul to be united with Lily/James in afterlife (it was not a lie. He really did help). He suggested (at end of 1st year) Hermione to research himself and she understood he is NOT originall harry potter but it's no longer matter at this time. 'Harry'/Hermione(later known to many both as Hermione and as Lady Amethyst, and almost nobody knew it's same person)+Drako/Daphne) in same series but in different world - Harry/Hermione/Ginny/Luna + Lady Amethyst as 'guide' and 'helper' (in this world only Hermione/Amethyst knew canon,her version of 'Harry' let her read books).

​

in 3rd example MC was from future and he knew 'recent'(to him) holographic movie series about Harry Potter which had heavily modified storyline and he didn't remember most details except 'dark wizard somehow related to Hogwarts, can destroy solar system'. He didn't remember details (and parts he did remember was confusing, like Hermione's skin color). He decided to prevent this situation and if not possible - rescue his new family and people he knew, even if this meant rushing technomagical research and &lt;spoiler&gt; And only after that he found out it's book-canon world and all potential dark mages were either killed or in his employ. OC/Hermione.

​

4th example. Hermione is time traveller (thanks Troll incident) but she returned to her original body and almost at same time. She only told her family. She did not tol anybody else because she travelled in other direction (and was known as Morgana Le Fay). Hermione.

​

5th example. Hermione's memory resurfaced. Well, she knew canon (read books long ago) but she thinks she will fix elements she doesn't like and just ignore others. She is very experienced magic (and technomagic) user.
