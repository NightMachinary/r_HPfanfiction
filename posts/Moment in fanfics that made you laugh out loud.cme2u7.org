From Harry the Hufflepuff 2

So can I cast strange and powerful Parsleytongue magic then?" he asked. "Parsleymagic?"

"That's Parseltongue, and no. They're snakes. What makes you think there would be some sort of powerful magic in speaking Snake?"

"Well, it is a magical language..."

"No," said Sue. "Being able to speak it is magical. It's just a language, and doesn't give speakers any special powers any more than any other language. Otherwise we'd all be welcoming our Snake Overlords who'd rule over us with their super powerful snake spells."

Edit just found this bit from the same fic.

How about other reptiles then? Like lizards? Can I speak to them?"

"Nope," said Hermione.

"Goanna's?"

"I'm afraid not."

"Worms?"

"Even if you could, would you want to?"

"Hmm. Well is there anything else I can talk to?"

"No. Wait - yes. Axolotls."

"Axolotls?"

"Axolotls."

"Cool. Er, what the hell is an Axolotl?"

"It's sort of an amphibious cross between a lizard and a fish. A type of salamander that lives in water but can breathe air, I think. Here is a picture of a white one," she explained, holding open the large book and pointing to a colour drawing.

"Yuck. Damn that's ugly. Does it do anything special?" he asked hopefully.

"Nope," she said, smiling.

"Oh, this sucks!"


** When Severus opened his eyes, his first realization was that he had an agonizing headache. His second was that it was pitch black. For a few dizzying seconds, he wondered if he was still trapped in Alice's mind.

Then Lockhart's voice echoed from down the ward: "I have the /best/ toenails, you know. Especially the little one. The little one is everyone's favorite."

Whatever misfortunes Alice Longbottom had suffered, Severus didn't think meeting Gilderoy Lockhart had been one of them. And Severus was not remotely surprised that Lockhart spouted nonsense in his sleep. At least, Severus assumed he was asleep.

"Snape?" Alice's whisper came from the darkness to his left. He must be in Frank's bed, then.

"I am here."

"Did I just hear someone talking about his toenails?"

"We are in the Spell Damage Ward of St. Mungo's. Some minds are more damaged than others."

"Oh." She paused. "Will you help him, too?"

Severus didn't bother to give that much thought. "No."

** from linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19)

Chapter 12:

"What do I do?" Ron cried out as soon as he dragged them both into the kitchen.

Harry stared with wide eyes around the room. There was smoke everywhere. The small microwave in the corner appeared to be malfunctioning, causing puffs of smoke to billow forth and steadily fill the air.

A series of loud sparks then caught his attention.

"It's still plugged in?" he shouted, racing over to the seemingly innocent kitchen appliance and quickly detaching it from the socket.

"Careful!" Ron said, pulling him back by the shirt as the last of the sparks emitted dangerously, nearly catching Harry's arm.

They both stumbled backwards into the table and coughed aggressively as they ingested mouthfuls of smoke.

"What the hell did you put in there?" Harry said with a slight rasp in his voice.

"A chicken leg!" Ron said, looking scandalised. "Don't tell me that's on the list of hundred things not to put in a macrowave, as well."

Burying his nose into the crook of his arm, Harry looked into the glass door of the still smoking device. "No," he said. "But aluminium foil is."

"What?" Ron said in a slightly high pitched voice as he peered over Harry's shoulder. "No one's ever thought to tell me!"

"You sure about that, mate?" he asked, peeling off a bright orange post-it note with Hermione's neat handwriting and sticking it on Ron's forehead.

Ron grabbed it and glanced over the long list of 'don'ts!' before looking back up at Harry with a sheepish expression.

** There are two moments in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12646729/1/Let-it-choke][Let It Choke, by The Divine Comedian]] that always make me laugh:

"Sit down," said Remus, pointing towards a ratty old armchair. "Would you like a cup of tea?"

Already it was obvious this was not how detentions usually went. Susan hesitated, but she was altogether too British to refuse. "No milk, two sugars," she half-whispered.

"Great choice!" said Remus, who thought it was a terrible choice.

****

"/Why/ are you doing this thing with the Boggart?" she said. "What were you thinking? Did you not expect some... gnarly bits?"

"Oh, I did expect gnarly bits, and I got them," said Remus. "I did it because Boggarts are a real thing that exist in the world. When you're alone and vulnerable, a Boggart will isolate and hurt you. When you come prepared, surrounded by friends, you're capable of so much more. It's an important lesson to learn, that's all."

"So it's not because you're secretly a ---"

Remus had to admit he was slightly startled. It had taken James and Sirius years to figure that one out, and they'd lived together. Four days would be a new low.

"A what, Susan?" he asked in what he hoped was a neutral tone.

"I don't know, some sort of child-hating sadist," said Susan.

Ah. He wasn't sure if that was any better than werewolf, but he would take it.

** “Mr. Crabbe, it is only by the grace of Mr. Goyle's presence in your lessons that you have evaded the distinction of being the worst potions student I have ever taught. Are you certain there isn't another subject that you would rather pursue a career in?”

Crabbe was beginning to sweat. His eyes darted frantically around the room, as though he was convinced that the answer was hiding somewhere among the glass jars and old books that lined the shelves.

“Astronomy?”

Snape picked up his quill and made a notation beside Crabbe's name. /Hopeless./ Then he set the quill down and intertwined his fingers before resting his chin on top of them.

“Why don't we forget your lessons for a moment? Just name something that interests you. The first thing that comes to your mind.”

Crabbe closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, a peculiar longing was evident on his fat face.

“Fire.”

Snape eased slightly farther back in his chair and fixed Crabbe with a curious look.

“Fire?”

The covetous grin that crept across Crabbe's lips made Severus's skin crawl.

“Yeah, fire. I like watching things burn. Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I just sit in front of the fireplace in the common room with a stack of parchment and play with the flames. It's like having a pet.”

Snape picked up the quill again and scratched out his original comment. Next to it, he scribbled the word /mental/. Crabbe continued to talk with a dreamy look in his eyes.

*** This section from the first chapter always gets me.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys immediately sensed my evil. This was particularly impressive since I took several months to properly remember my time as a dark lord, yet they deemed me a monster upon arriving on their doorstep.

  Amid the humiliation of diaper changes, tentative steps, and lisping words, I took great satisfaction in my caretakers' building horror. Even as a baby, I could still strike fear into the hearts of filthy muggles.

  It started small as I relearned the art of wandless magic. Forget to feed little Harry and Dudley's bottle explodes. Insult him and your tongue starts to swell up. Go ahead, lock him in a cupboard. He will always find his way out, and you will somehow find your way in.

  Even misfortunes that could not possibly be my fault, such as Vernon's demotion at work, were attributed to my malice. I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.

  The Dursleys eventually decided that they feared my dark presence more than Dumbledore's threats. They dropped me off at the orphanage, the firehouse, and deep in the wilderness. They even called Child Protective Services on themselves. Repeatedly. Yet I was always back by morning.

  I blame Dumbledore.

  I was five years old when Petunia Dursley realized that she would never be rid of me. I know this because she began sobbing while insisting that she would never be rid of me.

  Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of.

#+begin_quote
  “I hardly think this is necessary,” McGonagall said, lips thinned with annoyance.

  Umbridge merrily followed the other woman into her office. She tittered. “Now, now, Minerva, I observed all of the werewolf's career advice sessions. We wouldn't want any insinuations of favoritism, now would we?”

  “That werewolf is my colleague,” McGonagall spat. “Also, that's just a silly rumor among the students. They've been calling him a vampire for years.”

  “Well, they do say that children are intuitive about these things,” she said.

  McGonagall raised an eyebrow, sitting primly behind her desk. “I suspect they had little experience with children.”

  I lowered my invisibility cloak's hood. It was a wonder it had lasted this long. Of course, Dumbledore had likely lied about its age, as he often does. Umbridge squeaked in fright, and McGonagall's mouth twitched upwards. She asked, “Here for our meeting, Mr. Potter?”

  “Of course,” I said.

  “You're quite early,” McGonagall remarked.

  I shrugged. “I was excited.”

  She nearly smiled but caught herself just in time. “Two hours early, in fact.”

  “Incredibly excited,” I clarified. “Also, I have detention in two hours.”

  “I imagine most students would have used this as an excuse to skip detention,” she said.

  I smiled, taking a seat in front of her desk. “No, that's alright. I like detention.”

  It wouldn't be nearly as fun if I followed the professors' instructions, but, unlike the other students, I have no fear of expulsion. Dumbledore would never allow me that far from his domain.

  “Ah,” McGonagall said. “Tell me, Mr. Potter, what is your opinion on Professor Umbridge's presence at this meeting?”

  “It seems reasonable to me,” I said.

  Umbridge smirked. “Thank you --“

  “After all, that's perfectly within her rights as my master. If she was at any other students' meetings, however, that would be weird.”

  It was nice to see Umbridge scowling again. Her smile gave me the heebie-jeebies.

  Umbridge turned to McGonagall and said, “I simply do not understand why you've allowed a clearly mentally ill boy to go untreated for so long while under your care.”

  “Mr. Potter is simply a child, Dolores. It's no surprise you don't understand that since you have so very little experience in teaching.”

  McGonagall turned smoothly back to me. “Now, Mr. Potter, have you given any thought to your future career?”

  “Of course,” I said, beaming, “I'm going to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.”

  McGonagall was silent for a few moments, no doubt impressed by how astutely I had chosen my career path. “Are you certain that's a wise decision, Mr. Potter?”

  “Well, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty good at Defense, and I'm great with kids.” I'd been surrounded by them for the past several years, and not one child had suffered irreparable harm while under my care. This is particularly impressive because I lead them into dangerous situations all the time.

  “Besides,” I said, “the position's always open.”

  “And that doesn't concern you,” McGonagall prodded. Umbridge scribbled something on her notepad.

  “No, not at all. I've survived everything that got rid of the last ones.” And I wasn't very well going to murder myself.

  “Perhaps Mr. Potter would be suited for a more” -- Umbridge coughed lightly -- “simple position. I hardly think the stresses of professorship would be well suited to his delicate mind, and his delinquent tendencies are hardly fitting for the post.”

  “You're the only person who ever gives me detention,” I pointed out. “I could easily argue that the problem is not me, but you.”

  I would be lying, of course. Snape still docked points from Slytherin for my misconduct, McGonagall had devised a method of punishment whereby my favorite desserts would go unmade for days after any particularly concerning transgressions, and Filch had actively avoided me since my only detention with him back in second year.

  “That's ridiculous! You earn those detentions through your disrespect.”

  “And you earn my disrespect by being a terrible teacher,” I explained. “So, if you would stop doing that, you wouldn't have to put up with my detentions anymore.”

  “Detention,” she hissed, stubborn as ever.

  I shrugged. “Besides, I would have thought you would approve of my choice to take your job. Why else would you make me your apprentice?”

  The rest of the Gryffindor's career advice meetings had to be postponed because Umbridge exploded McGonagall's office. As I explained to Umbridge during my later detention, her temper was one of many traits that made her such a terrible choice for Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

also the total apathy towards malfoy is hilarious

#+begin_quote
  ​“...Really, Ronald!” Hermione exclaimed as we exited the Great Hall. We were stopped short, however, when Draco Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, stepped in front of us.

  “Malfoy,” I said, nodding.

  “Potter,” he said. “Still dragging along the Weasel and your pet Mudblood, eh? I don't suppose you've rethought my offer for more fitting companionship?”

  “Not really. Have you reconsidered being my minion?”

  Ron laughed at the suggestion, while Hermione nearly growled. She had been getting rather territorial lately. Between her and Ginevra, it was a wonder I'd recruited so many new minions this year.

  “Merlin no,” Malfoy snapped, “I would never --“

  We clearly had nothing to discuss, since we were once again at a standstill, so I continued walking. Ron was quite nearly shaking with laughter. Malfoy gaped, “Hey! Get back here.”

  I turned around, eyebrow quirked.

  “You can't just leave,” the blond snapped. Oh right, he hadn't gotten around to talking about his father or his money yet.

** He frowned at the eagle-shaped door-knocker. 'Look, you,' Scorpius growled. 'I'm not a Ravenclaw. This is an /emergency/. You're going to bloody well /let me/ ---'

Then the door-knocker shifted before him, as he'd seen it do before, and the gold mouth of the eagle opened. From it emanated that awful monotone he'd always been able to block out, and now he had to concentrate to pay attention.

'A cat has three kittens,' it intoned in a voice so dull Scorpius thought he might fall asleep instantly. 'Their names are January, February, and March. What is the mother's name.'

Scorpius' jaw dropped. /I don't/ */fucking/* /know/, he wanted to snap, but knew it wouldn't help, and so just stood there, sputtering for several long seconds --- and then even longer as his mind went utterly blank, and when he fought to, at last, find his voice, all he could say was a whispered, strangled, frustrated, /'What?'/

'Correct.' The door-knocker stilled, and then the door swung open, showing him the winding stairs up to Ravenclaw Tower, but Scorpius just stood there, jaw still dropped, staring into space.

Again he sputtered. '/What?!'/ When the door-knocker wasn't forthcoming, he grabbed it. 'What does that even /mean/? Was "/what/" the /answer/? How does that make /any sense/ you /stupid inanimate piece of crap/?'

"Don't worry," the Professor waved off the concerns. "It's in a section of space outside of normal space, one of my experiments went a little wrong and . . . well I guess it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you figure out what to do with the Nundu."

"Why me?" Harry blinked, "it's your Nundu."

"Well," the Professor took a moment to think about it. "No it's your Nundu, I had it registered as your pet."

"When did you do that?" Harry smirked.

"Just now," the Professor nodded. "When I said it was your pet."

"So you didn't file any paperwork with any government or anything?" Harry asked sarcastically, "you just decided that it was mine?"

"That's it exactly," the Professor nodded.

"Why can't I just say it's your Nundu?" Harry tried to twist his mind around his friend's logic.

"Because it already belongs to you," the Professor nodded. "And switching owners would hurt its feelings so you can't give it to me."

** *From Gryffindors Never Die by ChipmonkOnSpeed* where Harry and Ron go from their 50s to their 4th year in Hogwarts and are snarky old men trapped in teenage bodies. What could go wrong?

linkffn(6452481)

--------------

Harry and Ron made it to the Great Hall in one piece. When they got there, however, Hermione Granger was waiting. She wanted answers.

"What is the matter with you two?" she asked. "Last week you were perfectly normal, now you're acting all strange. And speaking Spanish? What is this?" she demanded.

"Spanish?" Harry asked. "I still don't know what you're talking about." He shoved some sausage and egg in his mouth and continued to look at her with concern.

"Harry, you've never been good with attention before, and now all the sudden you're Mr. Spotlight!" she snapped. "And you, Ron, have not made one comment about Harry's name coming out of the Goblet. I would have expected you to be angry!"

"Angry?" Ron asked. He also looked at her in concern. "Are you alright, Hermione? You're acting awful funny."

"Me?" she snarled. "You two are being downright crazy!"

Harry and Ron looked at each other, and then back to Hermione. They slowly lowered their silverware to their plates and pushed back from the table slightly. "Listen, Hermione, if you need to see someone about this, we won't think any less of you. There's no shame in seeing a psychologist," Harry said soothingly.

"A psychologist?" Hermione screeched. A few heads turned in their direction in confusion. "I should see a psychologist? I'm perfectly fine! You two are nutters!"

"Listen, Hermione, I've read about this," Ron said, in all seriousness. "Have you had any big gaps in memory lately? Woken up and not knowing where you are?"

"What are you implying, Ronald Weasley? Because I'm fed up with your nonsense."

"I think you're being possessed!" Ron yelled, drawing most people's attention. "By the Devil."

Hermione's face became eerily calm. "You think I am being possessed by the Devil," she repeated. "And what makes you think this?"

"You're hearing things in strange languages. You look like you haven't slept in weeks. You've got a twitch in your right eye. And you study magic, which we all know is of the Devil."

Hermione's face then burned with rage. "We're at a SCHOOL of MAGIC, idiot!" Hermione then let out a frustrated, strangled growl. It was a loud, frightening sound, like that of an angry boar being eaten by an angrier bear that's been sodomized by a dying duck.

"SATAN!" Harry and Ron screamed as they dove over the Hufflepuff table, and under the Ravenclaw table.

"I want my mommy!" Ron yelled.

"I want your sister!"

There was several seconds of silence from under the table.

Then Ron said, "Not cool, man... Oooh! Black panties! Girls only wear b lack panties when they want-"

"Ow!" Harry yelled. Several feet were suddenly kicking him, and he and Ron found that their hiding place was no longer safe. "Ow, what the... He said it! Kick him!"

The two scrambled from under the table and found that several people were glaring at them. They shook hands. "People hate us, and breakfast isn't even over," Ron said proudly.

"Mission accomplished."

** "I can speak to turtles," Daphne said as if the rare magical gift to talk to animals was an everyday occurrence.

Eloise's eyes went wide. "Ohhhh...can you show us?"

Daphne nodded.

Everyone gathered around, ready to hear what this 'turtle language' sounded like. Parseltongue sounded like hissing so turtle language would sound like... whatever sound turtles make? Some kind of chirping sound? The room was silent as we waited...

Daphne locked eyes with the turtle.

"Can she pet you?" she asked in regular English.

What the fuck...

"That's English!" Hermione said outraged and then made a sound that sounded like a cat getting a bucket of water thrown on it. Kind of this angry squeaky hiss?

Daphne looked at her and tilted her head slightly. "Yes?"

"You said you could speak to turtles," Hermione elaborated.

I resisted the urge to rub my temples.

"I just did," Daphne stated without any emotion.

"Anyone could just ask him!" Hermione exclaimed and put her hands on her hips.

"No," Daphne refuted.

Hermione's face was turning a little red. "What do you mean...no?"

And to the shock of everyone but Daphne, the turtle nodded its head 'yes' like a person.

"He has consented. You may pet him," Daphne said while looking at Eloise.

  "That isn't a special power!" Hermione threw her hands in the air in frustration. "You literally just talked to him. This is ridiculous."

  "You try." Daphne suggested without any challenge in her voice.

  "I will!" Hermione turned toward the Turtle and Eloise stepped aside. She then cleared her throat awkwardly. "Mr. uh Turtle..." She trailed off.

  "No Mister. Just turtle," Daphne interrupted.

  Hermione's left eyebrow twitched. "Fine. Turtle, can you please spin in a circle?"

  The turtle didn't move and looked back at Hermione with large blank eyes.

  "See?" Daphne said somehow without a hint of smugness.

  "That doesn't prove anything," Hermione replied stubbornly.

  Daphne pointed at her turtle and then said, "Spin."

  The turtle spun... slowly.

  "I can speak to turtles," Daphne stated again.

  For a second, I thought steam might start coming out of Hermione's ears.

** from linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday) .... There's a lot of parts in this story that made me laugh, but this one sticks out. If you haven't read this fic, you really should!

--------------

10:30 AM (morning break)

Minerva opened the door to the staff room, expecting to see a pot of tea and, if she was lucky, some ginger newts. She was not expecting to see Sybill Trelawney sitting on Severus Snape's lap, singing about 'Raindrops on Roses and whiskers on kittens' while attempting to punctuate each line with kiss on one of his cheeks. However Minerva firmly believed that sometimes the unexpected could be better than what had gone before... Thought's of blackmail danced merrily through her head as she watched the scene unfold gleefully.

"Get off me you daft woman!" Snape hissed, trying to shove Trelawney off.

"GIRLS IN WHITE DRESSES WITH BLUE SATIN SASHES-"

"Don't make me jinx you, you drunken loon!"

"SNOWFLAKES THAT STAY ON MY NOSE AND EYELASHES!"

"I can hurt you, you know!"

"SILVER WHITE WINTERS THAT MELT INTO SPRINGS-"

"For the love of... I'm a Death Eater you know! I could curse you into a cationic state without so much as blinking, you inebriated nutcase!"

*** After the Great Kitten Debate of 1996 died down, class went rather smoothly. During the debate it was generally agreed that Minerva could not have kittens. Or that if she did they would have to be fathered by another cat Animagus and that in the unlikely event of that happening the kittens would be super-intelligent, diabolical genius kittens who would take over the Earth with an army of tabbies, which they would control with poisoned cat-nip and mind-controlling feather toys. Minerva honestly missed having the thought processes of a fifteen year old on occasions, as it would evidently be a lot more interesting than her own thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  “Hagrid continued to show poor judgment by breeding weird mutant stinging lobster things that would apparently shoot fire from their butts when they were older. The fact that he had five hundred of the things and the fact that they looked like they were going to at least the size of a man did not bode well for the school at all.”

And later,

  "Can I eat this one?" the snake asked, staring at Umbridge hungrily.

  "I fear I still have a use for her," Voldemort said. He pointed his wand at her and said, "Imperio! Tell me where Harry Potter is!"

  A genuinely pleasant look flashed over her face and she said dreamily, "He's hiding in this room somewhere. I was trying to find him when you broke in."

  Voldemort's eyes snapped up as he murmured a spell.

  Harry was already moving, jumping from shelf to shelf trying to reach the vent at the top before Voldemort finished his human revealing spell. He wasn't sure whether the spell would reveal an animagus, but he couldn't take the risk.

  He'd only practiced one spell both silently and wandlessly, and he used it now.

  "Accio grate," he thought.

  For a moment he thought his weakened accio wouldn't be enough, but the grate flew across the room a moment later.

  Voldemort pointed his wand and said "Accio ferret."

  Harry would have grinned if his current form was physically able. He wasn't a ferret, he was a mongoose. He suspected that Voldemort had never been a to zoo in his life.

  "I am," Sirius said, leaning forward so that the fire illuminated his face. "Hello, Cousin Lucius."

  Lucius' lip curled. "Cousin? Oh no, my dear boy. Did you forget you've been disowned and shunned?"

  "Thank god, I thought I was still stuck with your sort as family," Sirius sniffed. "It was a sad day when Narcissa lowered herself to marrying a Malfoy."

  The cane whistled through the air, stopping two inches from Sirius' cheek. He didn't flinch. Remus did, however, tumbling backwards into the dust, much to Sara and Brenda's amusement.

  "Watch how you speak of my wife," Lucius growled.

  "In 1592 a Malfoy sold herself into indentured servitude in the house of Black," Sirius said. "And in 1870 a Black was forced to divorce a Malfoy -- "

  "That is unsubstantiated rumour, whelp!"

  "But a better-bred whelp than you are," Sirius said with a sly grin. "And first in line."

  Lucius let the cane slide through his fingers until it once again rested near his hip. "Fine," he said. "Forty Galleons."

  "Not for two hundred," Remus said, staring up at the sky. He turned his head.

  "I didn't ask the half-breed," Lucius said, lip curling.

  "I was actually going to bargain with you for a while, just to see how desperate you'd get, right up until you said that." Sirius began to rise, but Remus grabbed his arm.

  "It's fine," he said, using Sirius as leverage to pull himself up. "Better half-bred than inbred, I always say."

  Lucius' hand went to the head of his cane, and he twisted, revealing a wand where a normal gentleman would keep a sword blade.

  "Oh look," Frank said, leaning forward as Sirius had done, until his face was lit. "A stick. Inside a stick."

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/2/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a baby?]] is full of these, but i think Dumbledores yearly opening and closing speeches are probably the pinnacle. Sorry for the following wall of text. Here are just two of them.

"To be specific, the entire catalogue of Zonko's joke shop is now officially on the list, as are any of the products from the company that makes that rather terrific bubble gum that lets you hover for several . . . well, anyway, the list is not negotiable, I'm talking to you, Fred and George Weasley.

"In addition to the forbidden objects, the Forbidden Forest is, shockingly enough, forbidden. This, too, is not a negotiable point. Any student stupid enough to go into the Forest will not be punished, we simply won't go look for you. Considering the nature of the dwellers in the Forest, I will remind the students that they should avoid it unless they are facing their Potions final.

"Quidditch practices will be posted by your heads of house in the common rooms in two-week's time. At that point, they will no doubt begin tryouts for open positions. I remind you, and I'm speaking to Mister Malfoy here, that first years are, without exception, not allowed their own broomsticks. Those who bring them will find that they are confiscated and used to update the school's shoddy stock.

"I have one further announcement to make. This year, the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden to anyone who does not wish to die a truly remarkable death. I realize that in a school of young people, some of you are certain to go exploring because of this warning, but by giving it, I am now covered as far as the board of directors is concerned. I reiterate that the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden and that any student who dies as a result of ignoring this warning will be buried in the usual mass grave in back of the castle reserved for those who have thankfully removed themselves from our society before their idiocy can do too much damage. Thank you. Now, time for bed. Sleep well." Dumbledore bowed and turned, walking out the staff entrance to the hall.

and then second year (and this is only part of it)

The food vanished and Dumbledore stood up to speak. "As usual, I have many things to say regarding the start of the year. The first will be to warmly welcome Gilderoy Lockhart to the teaching staff. Sit down, Gilderoy, I did not invite your comments." Lockhart had been halfway to his feet when Dumbledore cut him off. "I will tell you when you are welcome to speak. Here's a hint: not while I'm Headmaster. As I was saying, we welcome Gilderoy Lockhart to the teaching staff as the new Professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Let us all offer a moment of cheer for the foolish soul willing to take the post. I admit that there has been an upward trend, given that unlike his predecessors, Professor Stutterfaces only fled the castle under suspicion of assault on Aurors instead of actually dying. Perhaps that has given this poor idiot hope.

"While I realize that this will sound tired, I must remind all of you that despite its name, the Forbidden Forest is, in fact, forbidden. I know that you think that this is an invitation, but anyone who wanders in there had best have supreme confidence, since we will under no circumstances, be bothering to fetch you from whatever you meet in there. On a related note, there have been yet more things added to the forbidden list. Contraband now includes all products from 's'oknoZ' and 'onko'sZay' as well as their parent company: Zonko's. Please also bear in mind that you are not allowed to duel in the corridors. Assaults will be dealt with harshly, but duels will result in lack of medical attention. Please study up on your healing charms before engaging, therefore.

"I'm happy to say that last year continued our trend of a lack of pregnancies during the term. I understand that Miss Garadila is now expecting and I hope that her long-time boyfriend, Mister Damston, is the father, but since the conception was over the summer and---oh dear, I hope that his worry is because she hadn't told him yet and not because of indiscretions. Regardless, I am sure that as entertaining a soap-opera as that will make for your assorted housemates, that you will recall that I am Headmaster and so I get to finish announcements first. Thank you. As I was saying, the only child currently underway in this school is a result of summer break and is not, therefore, considered my problem. I remind all young persons that they are to speak to Madam Pomfrey about contraceptives before indulging in youthful stupidity. Anyone who is detected engaging in excessively stupid youthfulness will find their pictures added to the volume labeled 'idiots in the nuddy' that is made available to students of appropriate ages.

"I remind First Years that tonight is their one chance to learn a path from their common rooms to the Great Hall. To reiterate my earlier warning: expect no aid in finding classrooms, the entrance hall, the Great Hall, your common rooms, the Black Lake, and, for that matter, which way is down. We at Hogwarts believe that if you should need help finding the ground after jumping from a high place, you deserve whatever happens to you. And that, incidentally, you should publish on how you managed to have that experience. This is a place of academia, even if it always seems to just be teaching people how not to hex their own naughty-bits off.

"Now, curfew is in five minutes, off you trot." With that, Dumbledore strode from the room, leaving the students to scramble to get to bed before they could get detentions on the first night.

Sorry for the massive wall but this stuff cracked me up the first time i read it.

** from linkffn(Getting Too Old For This) Ch11

--------------

"Alright, you've all seen some of that voodoo that I do up to now, but now you get introduced to one of the more fun aspects of it. I'm going to say to you all now the four words that terrorized me all through primary school," Harry smiled widely, "Wanna feel something weird?"

With the wand he had been concealing behind his back, Harry mass transfigured each squad member into a sealed tin of potted meat. A swish and flick saw the squad rise into the air and file neatly into their improvised atmospheric re-entry vehicle. It stood just under a meter tall, was a forbidding black, and-

It was a trash can. A heavily charmed trashcan, but nonetheless a trashcan.

Harry picked it up and held it under and arm as he made his way through the ship to the airlock, whistling the tune to 'If I Only Had a Brain'. He got a few strange looks as he went through the CIC, but the command crew had all been briefed extensively by former-captain Anderson to just ignore anything they saw Harry doing that did not immediately endanger the structural integrity of the ship. They chose to let it go.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

The paperwork would take days, but I could walk into your head office, send all of their files directly to their competitors, piss on and then burn all of their computers, and then shoot everyone in the building on my way out.

The two gingers, Posh Spice, Handsome One and Conkers turned towards Hermione. Hermione sighed. “Well, this is going to be rather difficult to get into over a pint.”

“Maybe try for two, then,” Harry suggested.

“I'm afraid it might take more than that.” Hermione stared down at her drink. “Oh, dear. May as well come out and say it, shall we? Harry, you're a wizard.”

By the time the final task came around, Dobby had to find Harry in order for him to make an appearance at the overgrown quidditch pitch.

The crowd gathered there might have thought Hermione had polyjuiced into him, as he had an impressive stack of books with him. Harry stepped into the maze only to promptly conjure a table and chair so that he could sit down and continue his research.

If he had an eternity to screw around, then learning just how much he could get away with would be worth a hell of a lot more than his sixth, seventh, or whatever trip to the graveyard with the noseless wonder.

People began to boo, so he threw up a silencing charm around himself and went back to ignoring everyone.

Not that he cared, but by the end of the night Fleur had roasted the Imperiused Krum who had hit her with a Cruciatus curse. Neither was able to go on, and the surly Bulgarian jailbait aficionado died of massive third degree burns the next day.

Multiple people tried to get Harry's attention to tell him that he was the winner by default. Dobby brought him some tea while he studied and told the Great Harry Potter sir that the tournament was over. Harry gave him a thumbs up and kept on reading.

A couple of hours later, he stood up and saw the headmaster looking at him with an impressive amount of disappointment. No one else had stayed behind.

Harry walked up to him and took a leak all over the old man's bright fuchsia robes. It had been several hours since he had the chance to use a restroom.

For once, the mighty Albus Dumbledore was completely dumbstruck. - linkffn(13232887)

"The train continued to chug along as I ignored him. A couple of hours later, a pale, blond boy with a pointed nose strode into the room, two lackeys at his heels. Oh Merlin, Lucius had finally managed to clone himself. "Is it true?" Malfoy said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment." "Really?" I gasped. "Harry Potter. No way! Have you checked the whole train?" Malfoy looked surprised, but quickly regained his composure. "No, I haven't," he said. "Good luck, then." The blond left."

Harry's first trip to Diagon Alley with Hagrid

​

#+begin_quote
  Harry stared at Griphook, who stared back at him a bit unnerved by the small boy who was eying him, considering most wizards either sneered or tried to pretend he was human.

  "If I catch you do I get anything?"

  "That's leprechauns, all you'll get from me is a thump round the ears."

  "Solve your riddle?"

  "That's the sphinx for passage past what they're guarding or a date." Griphook rolled his eyes.

  "Bribe you with something?"

  "Now that's goblins!" Griphook said proudly while Harry took out a note pad.

  "Excellent! Do you have a list of prices and services?"
#+end_quote

And then later

#+begin_quote
  Harry examined the price list for a moment before telling Griphook, "25 thousand galleons please, from the main vault."

  "What's the extra for?" Stanley asked curiously.

  "Illegal deals that I don't want to bring to the bank," Harry replied cheerfully.

  Stanley looked at Harry in confusion. "I can understand the books, they're expensive due to value and rarity not because they're dark or anything and the re'em's blood was useful if long odds, but what kind of illegal deals could you possibly be interested in at your age?"

  Harry grinned cockily. "What kind ya got?"

  Griphook quickly hid his smile before the humans could notice; the kid was just so adorable!

** I send my friend funny lines but no links so I have no idea where is from but: Death figured he may as well go and do something productive with his time. Like rescue a kitten, or turn Dumbledore bald, or unleash Cthulhu on the unsuspecting populous of Earth.

Ooh and this one: Years later Draco would have a flashback to this time, to himself in an old t-shirt, slightly sweaty and dishevelled, dragging down the stairs the corpse of an acromantula the size of a dog. Years later Draco would have to sit down and have a small freak out at the nonchalance with which he had hunted and killed and disposed of the monster, shoving it in the dumpster at the end of the street because their own garbage was full.

Pretty sure this is the one from harry getting a tattoo as a small child: He was as tall and looming as Harry remembered, a hawk nose and dark, lank hair, a perpetual sense of being unimpressed around him like a shroud...

Harry frowned to himself: He shouldn't have read through that book of poetry in one go, it made him think strange things.

#+begin_quote
  "For example, Headmaster, let us say a bored student practiced spell-creating and coincidentally ended up creating a lightning-empowered noise-seeking ball of death. How would that student transfigure himself a rubber armor and gloves to have the time to throw a Finite Incantatem at the ball without ending up burned or electrocuted to death?"

  The Headmaster, very slowly, took a sip of his tea cup.

  "Mister Umbrus," he said in the end. "Would you like permission to head to Hogsmeade?"

  "No, Headmaster, I don't have the money to spend on trifling things, so why not practice?" I answered, as innocently as I could, while a treacherous smile formed on my lips.

  "Mister Umbrus," the headmaster continued, "I insist."

Another, during and after Deatheaters attack on the Quidditch worldcup:

#+begin_quote
  I swung my wand in its direction like a batter would a bludger, and then finished the motion with an /Exosso/ curse. The pale blue jet slammed into the chest, removing the bones from the Wizard's arms and legs, sending it to crumble on the ground like a puppet, and scream like a headless chicken while at it. This was a spell I had learned for removing bones from chickens, and the warning was to not point it at people due to the /unfortunate/ nature of the curse itself.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  I reckoned it was an all new experience. Watching the Headmaster walk back and forth, his arms behind his back, trying to decide whether he had the right to be cross at me or not. "Mister Umbrus," he settled for, "what were you thinking, precisely?"

  I grimaced and rubbed the back of my head. "Everyone was running around like headless chickens, so I decided to do something? I decided to fight evil, eradicate it, even?"

  The Headmaster sighed. "You /deboned/ evil,"

​

"What's her name in Hufflepuff" also has some golden moments, but just read the whole exam chapter for the laughs. This is just the potions part, and have in mind the MC managed to get severe burns like 3 or 4 chapters before during the potions lesson:

#+begin_quote
  My attention was so laser focused on the task at hand that it took me awhile to notice the odd tickling sensation on my right arm.

  Someone cleared their throat in front of me. I ignored them, and waved my wand over the cauldron.

  Awesome, it's the right shade of red. Now I just need to turn the burner up and wait about fifty minutes...

  Someone cleared their throat again.

  I turned the burner on, set my timer, and THEN looked up.

  Snape was standing over me holding a clipboard and looking pointedly at my right arm.

  I looked over at my arm.

  Oh. I'm on fire. Well, that's annoying.

  “Extinctus.” I muttered and waved my wand over my arm. The fire went out instantly. Next to me, Mandy's workstation seemed to be on fire too. I waved my wand and cast the fire extinguishing spell on Mandy's area too. I really didn't want the smoke to affect my potion.

  I looked back down at my ingredients. I needed to crush the mistletoe berries so I was ready to add them to the mixture...

  Snape cleared his throat again.

  I looked up.

  Was he trying to sabotage me?

  “Miss Thompson, are you hurt?” Snape asked sounding more annoyed than concerned.

  “No, sir.” I waved my hand in the air dismissively. “It's just a little fire.”

  Snape raised an eyebrow.

  “I cast the flame freezing charm on myself this morning before breakfast,” I elaborated so he would leave me alone to brew.

  Snape made a face like he was passing a kidney stone, made a mark on his clipboard, and then moved on.

  “Bloody hell, are those brains?” Ron yelped.

  “Enough, Ron. We'll get you one on the way out.” I opened another door, absentmindedly casting a stunner on the creature inside.

  “Crying when someone dies doesn't make you weak, Harry,” Hermione said, looking troubled. “It just makes you human.”

  “Yes, and I think we've all established that I'm better than that,” I said.

** Linkffn(Saying No by Bobmin356)

When it gets to them summoning things, I was literally had to stop reading to laugh.

The boys let out triumphant shouts and she turned quickly to see a mass of bloody tissue sticking to the wall and gagged.

"Oh, God! Pettigrew's heart?" she exclaimed, moving away quickly.

"Nope!" Ron shouted. "We took your advice and gave up on internal organs."

"What you're looking at, my dear Hermione, is Severus Snape's Dark Mark!" Harry said proudly.

"His Mark? You summoned... But I don't think... Oh, I'm going to be sick!" She gagged twice more, then bolted from the room.

** From linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) & its sequels.

This is Harry trying to come up with nicknames for Dumbledore, while talking to Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  "Let me see if I can think of a few," Harry said slowly, pausing and placing a mocking frown on his face. "Well, there's manipulative bastard, old coot, old man, senile prick, Dumbledork, Dumb-dore, Dumblefuck, Dumble-bore, Dumble-don't, Dumbles...basically anything that we can run off your name. My favourite would have to be 'Dirty, perverted, goat-fucker'."
#+end_quote

This one is from a sequel or two later, and is basically the same, but this time nicknames for Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  "Yeah, well, it just means I'm a bigger badass than the self-proclaimed 'Lord Voldemort'," Harry said. He frowned, looking thoughtful. "I wonder if there's a way to mock his name somehow. Voldemort...Voldie? Moldie? Moldie Warts? Moldie Shorts?" Harry and Dumbledore both paused. "Nah, I sound like a complete moron when I say crap like that," Harry dismissed.

** I won't go and copy-paste every scene I laughed at like the others have but I can still suggest stories I found funny.

A Black Comedy - Harry and his godfather get into all kinds of trouble

Browncoat, Green Eyes - I loved River in this

Make a Wish - Does this one even need explaining? It's a staple of the community so just read it

Strangers at Drakeshaugh - This one definitely isn't canon and it's a little different than most fanfics but I liked it

Magical Me/Amalgam - Lockhart's Folly - Can't remember which one between the two I liked best but both should be funny

Second Wind - Not only was this fanfic funny it's also probably the best One Piece fanfic you'll ever read. It's the highest-rated for a reason

The Mouse of Konoha - This is a new read that I had a lot of fun with. You'll definitely get a kick out of it

The Bitter Hug of Mortality - This one is unique but it has its funny moments and I've been desperately waiting for an update since the last chapter

Teaching History (is Old News) - I alternate between laughing at this one and feeling like it tried too hard. I still recommend it though

Odd-Job Tsuna - This one is an absolute must-read in my opinion. If you're at all into the Katekyo Hitman universe give it a look

New Beginnings - Features Naruto in the body of Hidan and chaos ensues

I still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - Harry meets Ahsoka and they travel. This is my favorite fanfic of this crossover

I didn't sign up for this - Can't really remember what it's about I do remember it being funny. Don't judge me for this one

In the Mind of a Scientist/Madness at the Gate - All-time favorites of mine and although they aren't tagged as a comedy and the humor takes a bit of a backseat they're still worth a read. The second in the series was funnier to me but I recommend starting at the first regardless. There's a third fanfic in the series too but I didn't finish it

​

They're all more or less funny but I wanted to suggest solid stories too and I hope I succeeded.

** Okay this is not HP but for some reason this one got to me, the rest of this fic while having its comedy was either more lowkey or more physical and then this gem of a scene pops up.

"Difficult to live with? That's seriously your excuse? You bastard!" Yang took a swing at him, and he yelped and hid behind Nora. She was shaking, and judging by the odd twist of her mouth it was because she was trying not to burst out laughing.

Standing slightly off and to one side was a man that Russel assumed was probably the guard. Even with his back to them, discomfort rolled off of him in waves. "Er, ma'am?" he tried.

Yang whirled around and jabbed a finger in his face. "Shut up! Just shut up! You're all just liars!" He took a step backward. "Ma'am. This is private property, you need to-"

"With my own cousin!"

Around a corner, Sky gestured frantically for them to come that way. Russel shook himself out of his daze and followed after him. He and the rest of the infiltration team absconded into the night. And, in the far distance, he could still just hear Yang's voice.

"But what about the baby?!"
