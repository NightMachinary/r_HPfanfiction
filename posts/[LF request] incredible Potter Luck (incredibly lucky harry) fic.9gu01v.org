I can't find the fic but its mainly harry just traveling and is stupidly lucky (in a "may you live in interesting times" kind of way ) and oblivious to his good luck. people end up assuming that the Enigmatic Mr. Black is an ancient dark lord looking for redemption or something. People ends up misunderstanding everything he says and do (him helping a veela to screw a light bulb but fell down and broke his pelvis somehow ending up him screwing a group of veela and breaking his pelvis). Somehow death eaters end up dead around him without him noticing, but has to put extreme effort to do something deliberately.

I would also appreciate any suggestion on fics like this too.

**** The third one was discontinued by the author. Compared to the first two, i can absolutely understand why.

**** The writing quality stays consistent throughout. In my opinion the story premise is a lot of fun, but it gets repetitive after the first 5 countries that Harry visits.
