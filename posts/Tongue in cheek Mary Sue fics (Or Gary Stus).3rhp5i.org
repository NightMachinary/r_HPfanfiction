So I was just reading a total Mary Sue fic. Victoire is amazing! Head Girl! Top of her class! Gorgeous! Veela powers! Quidditch captain! Best seeker ever! Her flaw? She eats too fast! (Don't fret though, her Veela powers keep her thin and beautiful!) I got 4 chapters in and couldn't take it anymore...

Anyway, it struck me that there is a ton of potential for a tongue in cheek version of the Mary Sue trope. Hoping someone has some recs like that?


** How nobody's linked this yet, I'll never know. I guess it's not quite what you're looking for, but it's pretty good.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** I parody some of that in [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294209][Concupiscence]], a Rose/Scorpius parody. I don't think I know any that does a tongue-in-cheek Mary Sue, but I know of a few fics that subvert the /I'm so awkward I'm a walking disaster love me/ kind of character (which always end up Sue-like), if you're interested in those.

** Okay, brace yourself and excuse my mobile fingers. edit: whoops mobile fingers didn't reply to the thread.

There's a story of how these came to be, but it is essentially us wanting to subvert silly teen dramas via Albus/OCs. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] plays it the most straight with the awkward OC and is both a parody and a sweet romcom. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311081][Welcome to Blunderland]] is of a bleaker note, think cracky indie teen wallflower comedy. Mine is the only incomplete one (two chapters left, though!) - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295950][etc. etc. (and life goes on)]], and features such an OC as an /antagonist/, with a ruthless OC as a protagonist. There are in-story shipping wars!
