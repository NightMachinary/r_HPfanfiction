Having trouble finding a fanfic where Snape adopts or becomes the guardian of Harry. 

I remember a scene where a recently adopted/ward Harry gets detention with Umbridge and she has him start writing lines using the blood/black quill. However, Harry decides to stop writing the lines and says something like my father/dad (aka Snape) wouldn't like it (as he remembers Snape saying come to a trusted adult). Then Umbridge doesn't believe that Snape adopted/became guardian of Harry so she takes him to Snape to get in trouble but Snape supports Harry and basically tells Umbridge off.

Can't remember what the name of it is so any help is appreciated.

  Harry swallowed hard and made his decision. Maybe his da would be mad at him, but he still thought it was better to talk to him first, /before/ Umbitch made him carve words into his own skin. If she was telling the truth and she was allowed to do it, then maybe he could still get his da to take over his detention. Or even Professor McGonagall. He was pretty sure /she/ didn't use this quill in her detentions. After all, the twins, who'd had plenty of detentions with her, didn't have words scarred into the backs of their hands.

  He stood up, still clutching the quill in his hand. “Professor, I'm not going to do any more,” he announced bravely, though his wavering voice made it clear that he wasn't feeling very brave.

  Umbridge's eyes narrowed. “I beg your pardon?”

  “I'm not going to write any more lines with this quill,” Harry repeated stubbornly. “Not until I talk to my da, and /he/ says I have to.”

  Umbridge snorted. “Do you truly imagine he'll rescue you, you little fool? You'll just be right back here, only you'll be writing your lines while sitting on a striped backside!”

Oh that's really close. I kinda remember though that Harry only called Snape dad/father/guardian to get out of the detention since his situation with Snape was new. Also, Umbridge took Harry with her to knock on Snape's door.

Hopefully my brain didn't imagine the story though. :)

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
