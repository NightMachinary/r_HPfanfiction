Just read Phoenix Insurgent ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/]]) and now I'm really craving an Indy!Dumbledore fic. Something where he decides enough is enough and says eff the Ministry, he'll fight them if he needs to, but Voldemort needs to die. Something where he takes off the kid gloves while remaining in character, instead of randomly being evil all of a sudden.

(Honestly, Phoenix Insurgent just really reminded me of Will of Fire, Heart of Stone. It's a really entertaining Naruto fic where Hiruzen Sarutobi gets his ass in gear, even if it's shameless witch fulfillment. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4370189/1/Will-of-Fire-Heart-of-Stone]])

  Albus narrowed his eyes. “Should they do that I might consider their actions as proof of their allegiance with the Dark Lord.” Cornelius paled, and Albus glared at Amelia. “I am growing tired of struggling to protect the innocents while remaining within the bounds of laws passed by inept and corrupt people. I would suggest you stop pushing me, before you go too far.” Amelia was about to answer him, but he cut her off. “Neither of you know what a real war is like. Ask some of the few remaining British wizards and witches who fought at my side in Grindelwald's War and you might understand why they and all of Europe scoff when you talk of the ‘Blood War' twenty years ago that you fear so much. Ask, and then ask yourself if you truly wish to have me as your enemy. For if it comes to it, I will not merely fight you, I will wage war against you as I did against Grindelwald.”

That's from my story "Divided and Entwined" which might fit your request. Dumbledore is involved in a far messier civil war there, trying to point the Ministry and the Muggleborn Resistance at Voldemort and not at each other while sending the Order against the Death Eaters.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
