[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327979][read here!]] It's gen rather than romance, and told through Scorpius' point of view alternating between flashbacks and after Rose's death.

Also check out [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=237953][teh tarik's other stories]]! She's one of my favorite authors. I've previously rec'd her Lavender Brown story [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1dketo/oneshot_a_lightness_hogwartsera_lavender_brown/][A Lightness]] here, too.

*** Not a fan of it either :( I've offered to make a skin for it, but I don't think they have anything set up for it.
