Inspired by the Slated Trilogy (it's quite brilliant by the way, I highly recommend reading the books).


** you might be thinking of Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. In it, there is a spell the Australian Aurors use called Tabula Rasa, which completely erases the memories of convicts, after which, the convicts are given new identities.

** Wait, that doesn't make any sense, a dementor's kiss isn't an obliviate. You can't just reprogram them unless you come up with a way to put another soul into the husk (where's the soul coming from?)

**** "You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."

- Remus Lupin

The Dementors Kiss is one of the most barbaric punishments I have ever seen in fiction. Completely unconscionable.
