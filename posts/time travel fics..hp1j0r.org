Pretty much what it says. Looking for good or even decent time travel fics. Not ones where harry is overpowered or fixes the entire Wizarding world in a week.

I'm fine with almost any pairing, even multis, and even femharry.

Just no slash or WBWL.


** Whiskey Time Travel is a rom-com fic I really like :

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

** Several options here during various time periods. Some are Hermione centric, but quite good. One is slash, but the romance is sweet rather than explicit (it was also one of the first slash stories I read - I used to avoid them too). If you don't want Hermione or Slash, avoid the four from Ao3.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

*** I just read Six Pomegranate Seeds yesterday. Haven't figured out where the title comes from, but it was interesting to see the time traveler work so hard and so successfully to keep out of the way and let the original events happen, while still making preparations and still caring. Hermione really had to become /ruthless/ to pull it all off.

** Most of the recs are for Harry et al going back. I'll offer linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) for Snape returning from his canonical death to his sixth year (after breaking up with Lily). The point of view alternates between Severus and Lily, showing how he's broken inside but truly devoted to her, how she moves from suspicion to accepting the change in his personality, and how their relationship develops from there. Plus, he brought back knowledge about the Horcruxes, so he and Dumbledore are plotting to bring the war to a final end.
