I was wondering if there were any Harry/Hermione fics out there about when they were on the run? I'm sure there are and I wanted to see if anyone had any recommendations for one? Preferable Mature rating that doesn't shy around the topic of sex Long stories are a definite plus! Thank you!

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

  War changes everyone: Harry resolves to face destiny and struggles to reconcile with Dumbledore's past, fully aware of the price he must pay for victory. Hermione walks through fire, determined to share in Harry's burden. Ron battles resurgent jealousy and soon discovers he may lose far more than he stood to gain. One thing is certain; peace is never cheaply purchased. H/Hr
