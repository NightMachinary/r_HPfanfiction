Harry raised him so that he was kinda lacking in emotions and his only 'friends' were Rose and Scorpius. Rose was called the Resurrectionist or something like that, because she brought her brother back to life.

It was a cool story and I'd really like to find it again, thanks!

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?
