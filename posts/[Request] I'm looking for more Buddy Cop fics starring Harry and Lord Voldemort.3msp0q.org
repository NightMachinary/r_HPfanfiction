I read linkffn(To Play the Devil) recently and am wondering if there are any other fics with a similar premise (Lightish side Harry and Lord V getting forced to work together) and preferably with a similar or greater level of needless violence. For those of you have read the story, think of how Harry and Riddle crossed the French border. That's the kind of problem solving I love to see in a fic.

Edit: In case I screwed up the bot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][here's a link to the story.]]

Edit 2: If any of you happen to run across a fic where Harry gets the personality of someone like [[http://i.imgur.com/zwh2H.png][Gilgamesh]] or a fic (from any fandom) with that kind of character as the lead please link it. I love that shit.

Edit 3: I found [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-be-a-queen-worm-fate-stay-night.339838/][something in the Worm fandom]] that sorta fit what I was looking for. It's an altpower Taylor who's basically a female Gilgamesh.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and possibly the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, and politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming and enemies abound. AU. Complete.

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots
