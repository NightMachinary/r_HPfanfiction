** Matt abandoned the sequel and gave GHL, another author on SIYE, permission to continue it.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][The Prevailing Counterpoint]] by GHL

/"We can prevail," Ginny whispered. "I mean sooner. Not later. Not months and months of people dying and lives being torn apart..." As the summer of 1997 draws to a close, Harry and Ginny return to Hogwarts to forge unlikely alliances, protect the innocent, and dispel the encroaching darkness. Propelled by powerful convictions and enlightened by a reclusive pair of mystics, they glimpse an unlikely path to victory./

/Making the most of every day in a race against the clock, our two protagonists move all of the pieces into place: teaching, learning and refining their way toward a perfect strategy to quell the mounting threat. But one sudden disaster tips their world on end: armed with love, humour and steadfast friendships, they careen wildly toward the ultimate clash./

/This is a modest attempt to explore where Matt Fake-a-Smile's thrillers 'Taking Control' and 'Free Life' could have taken us if the stories were extended. This plot presumes rigorous Rowling canon through the end of Order of the Phoenix, followed by Matt's divergent post-OotP theme. Most of the characters in this story are the intellectual property of J.K. Rowling, and many of the remainder are the products of Matt's imagination./

The story is complete at 250k words. There is a WIP sequel by the same author as well. I've never read any of them (I disliked /Taking Control/), so I can't say if the story is any good or not.

*** I'm kind of disappointed by TPC to be honest. It had way too many unnecessary scenes, I think. It started out well, but then it's just endless chapters of classes (look how much of a leader Harry is!), special stuff Ginny comes up with, like extra quidditch matches and meetings (look how awesome Ginny is!).

It took the fun out of the story for me. The author gave Harry and Ginny, who are still 16 and 15, way too much responsibility, which is boring. It slows the story down and it gives you too many factors to think of before going into the action.

** I'd assume that Free Life is abandoned at this point. Someone rec'd a sequel (by another author) to me [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=129801&chapter=1&textsize=5][The Prevailing Counterpoint by GHL]]. I read a bit of it but I hadn't read TC or FL in ages so I couldn't get into it. I'll try again once I've done a reread of them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/][Brennus]] writes Harry/Ginny stories that feel pretty similar to Matt's stuff (light to heavy bashing, powerful Harry, "us against the world" feel, etc).

*** I generally like Brennus' stories, but I think he should really tone down his usual Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashings.

  Sequel to Taking Control. Harry starts taking the fight to the Death Eaters as the Order members are forced to make some very difficult decisions. Will Dumbledore see the benefit of working with Harry or continue to try to keep him out of the war?
