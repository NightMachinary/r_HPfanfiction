:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So it's been a while since I read it, and I'm a little hazy on it. I believe that Darco had been sending info discretely to the order during the war. He is then rescued and helps out Harry, Ron, and hermione. I could be mixing up and combining two fics -one where he is being a reluctant spy, the other when he is rescued and dragged along with the golden trio. All I really remember is when the Harry, hermione, and Ron see him in Headquarters kitchen -and I think Remus was there. I know that's not a lot to go on -I'll take any fics that might fit the premise (I'm really not sure how well I'm remembering it, so it could probably be multiple fics combined). Thank you so much for any help!


** It is a long shot but maybe linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6255499/chapters/14333560]]) either way it is a good read

** Are there any pairings etc that might help narrow down? For example I read a lot of dramione (cue the downvotes) and thats a pretty common theme in a lot of them, same I think for drarry which I've read a lot less of. If there's no pairings at all, that could also help narrow the search ðŸ˜Š

*** I'm 90% sure it was just a reluctant allies turns into friendship fic. The only pairings I've ever been in to are Harry centric so I don't think it would be a dramione- there is a chance it was a drarry but I'm just not remembering. There's a very good chance I just made it up in my mind lmao - it was a few years ago. ðŸ˜¬. Thank you!!!

** I think I have a vague memory as well- did it feature narcissa telling him that to basically grow up and at nice as they were on order hospitality now? Or pansy trying to save Malfoy by bringing Voldemort to Harry only for Voldemort to kill Malfoy and then pansy when she didn't fall in line after he killed draco?
