** I held off on reading linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) for a while because the summary sounded a bit ordinary and like it would just be following canon stations with a female Harry. But it's not like that at all. It's a very original and complex story, with a rich world that keeps unfolding more layers as you keep reading. Harry is much more skilled than canon, but that comes with its own challenges; her studious nature strains her friendships, her outstanding achievements in potioneering bring scrutiny that makes it harder to protect her secrets, and her unusual level of magical power comes with control issues and makes her a target. Really well done, book 4 in progress.
