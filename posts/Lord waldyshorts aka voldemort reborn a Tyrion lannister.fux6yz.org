Had always Thoth about how the great conqueror and supreme mage tom ridddle would behave in a body can't even handle a child. Will he recover his dark arts? Will he succumb? Or maybe westeros would have a king crazier than Aerys Targaryen?

Just a curiosity. Every fic cross hp/got is always a hero transported to another world, about how would be to have a character eviler than own devil to be in this place, just joking now, imagine Voldemort in joffrey's body.

I would give everything to see this time an antagonist than the glorious knight in white stallion that every fic portrait Jon snow and Harry Potter.
