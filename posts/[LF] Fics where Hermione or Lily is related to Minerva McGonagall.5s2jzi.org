I'm looking for Fics where Hermione or Lily is related to Minerva McGonagall, either as granddaughter/great-granddaughter, or in another way.

I have read one fic where Hermione is Minerva's Great-granddaughter, albeit adopted into the Granger family, by Radaslab called 30 Minutes That Changed Everything.

Does anyone know of any others.

Many thanks in advance.

In this one, Lily is distantly related to McGonagall, who ends up raising her and Petunia after their parents die. /Really/ good.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
