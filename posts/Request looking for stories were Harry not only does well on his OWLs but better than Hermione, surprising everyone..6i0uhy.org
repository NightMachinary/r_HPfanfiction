I remember reading a story where Dumbledore holds an Order meeting at Grimmald Place including Ronald, Hermione & Ginny to discuss Harry's surprising outstanding OWL scores, how he did it, why he did it, how will this affect their plans, etc.

*** I actually recall something that made Hermione not do so well academically without making any overt changes to her character or fucking up her reputation as teacher's pet with the students. Iirc the story was set in year 3 and mostly revolved around that idea.

It went under the premise that she wasn't actually getting stellar grades because she essentially plagarizes, not other students, but the textbooks, word for word, and most of the assignments we heard about in cannon were essays.

I'd argue you'd start writing the essays in your own words after getting grades docked for three years, but kids can be really stupid and I could see a few of my friends doing this following the logic they weren't failing with an A, so why the hell should they put the effort in to get an O?

  Some investigations in the true performance of his classmates starts Harry on a different path. After all, he was really curious what reason his best female friend could have to try so hard to make people believe that she was the smartest witch. No pairings
