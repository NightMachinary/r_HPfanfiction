Almost every Manipulative Dumbledore and Dark Harry story I've read has had Harry /somehow/ staying friends with Hermione. It's one of the biggest turnoffs I have towards those tropes.

Looking for stories where they aren't friends.


** I would recommend "Hail Odysseus", but I'm sure you already read that one.

Harry is definitely dark and a little twisted in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116), but there is no manipulative!Dumbledore here.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), has what you want - major Dumbledore/Molly/Ron and minor Hermione bashing, and a quite dark Harry/Ginny pair.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
