I thought i'd start a list for everyone who're interested in seeing OP protagonists.\\
Requirements are that it has to have been published in the last year, and Harry(or the MC it it's not Harry) has to be extremley powerful, as in at minimum Dumbledore level of power by end of first year(later if the story is longer). Crossovers are included, genderbents are included, SI are included, gay/straight/bi/etc is included. As long as they're extremely powerful, it's allowed(after-all, this is as much for your benefit as mine).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Has that. There is also a NSFW version not on ffn, google should help, but don't link it here because of server-wide reddit rules. Harry is very OP and ruthless.

Can you give me a hint or something?

  I agree that it very likely won't have negative consequences, but why risk it?
#+end_quote

Because it's so unlikely to happen there's no point in worrying about it until it actually does. It just makes things harder for everyone.

The admins aren't running around nuking subs, anyway, unless the sub is completely dedicated to content against site rules. If this subreddit was [[/r/hplolismut]] or something, it might be an issue, but as it is the admins wouldn't start by banning the sub. I know of other subreddits that are larger and have more obviously graphic material that relate to underage sex that the admins don't care about even though they're aware they exist.

** linkffn(Again and Again) is being recommended a lot recently because the author returned to it after years but it fits your requirements since that version of Harry is far more powerful than anyone else and is compared to Merlin later on

I like linkffn(Courage and Cunning) which is THE Harry is Salazar fic so obviously he's already unbelievably powerful

linkffn(Death is but the Next Great Adventure) Harry is a literal necromancer starting when he turns eleven and grows up with Death as his mentor

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
