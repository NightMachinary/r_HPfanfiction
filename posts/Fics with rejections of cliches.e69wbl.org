Like Harry is going through his parent's things and finds his birth certificate, where in he is named "Hadrian James Potter", and immediately rejects it. "My name is Harry".

Or he's Lord Everyone-But-Malfoy and rejects them to go live in the French countryside.

Etc etc.

****** I dropped it somewhere around chapter 80 because I got really bored with it, so I can only talk about up to that point, but yea, from what I remember the bashing kept going. But I gotta say that the James bashing never felt over the top or unreasonable to me. He deserved it. So that played no part in me dropping the fic.

** This is the closest thing I could think of. He's still lord Black, but he rejects being a Potter.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.
