so lets say he loses all of his horcruxes but does manage to kill Harry........he is now mortal and his true goal was to live for all eternity so what does he do then??

​

Can he make more or would he have to maybe suck the souls from others to create another batch or would he have to find another means?

​

I sort of noticed he loses either way............he loses and dies or he wins but then has to live a mortal life

​

what do you think?


** The other canon method of immortality is the Philosopher's Stone. Dumbledore actually discusses this in HBP and it sounds like the stone would work if more horcruxes weren't possible.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,' said Dumbledore. ‘But there are several reasons why, I think, a Philosopher's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.

  ‘While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain his immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable.

*** Yeah but do we know that he could make one ?I mean he is already 70 so he has like maybe 120years left max. He is damaged from all his soul losses. He really isn't sane anymore and he never showed that he had an aptitude for Alchemy and only one person ever created one and never shared how it's done.

***** Which ones? The Malfoys idoits plus they abandoned him at the Battle of Hogwarts. Snape the Potion Master dead. Bellatrix either dead or alive but insane. The rest of his inner circle Death Eaters dead after the War or insane or simply not intelligent enough or versed in the arts of Alcheny Really Snape is the only one with any credibility to help him but still dead

**** Well, he had 8 pieces of his soul lying around (including himself). We know 7 isn't the cap. Horcruxes do appear to have a degenerative effect both on the body, and much more importantly, on the mind. But emphasis on /appear to./ It's hard to say if making too many of them made Voldemort into the rash maniac we see in the series, or if Rowling just tripped herself over again by describing Tom Riddle in such a different way.

***** I'm too lazy to look for it, but there is a scene where Dumbledore say something along the lines of "Tom's mind is as sharp as it was when he left Hogwarts", so it's debatable whenever the Horcruxe had a direct effect on his mind or not.

Also, Canon Voldemort is still pretty charismatic, far from the Crucio crazy manic we sometimes see in fanon (his discussion with Harry in PS, his monologue in OotP or even the Death Eater meeting in DH). The only time he truly "lost it" is when the Goblins told him Harry stole his Horcruxe, and that's kinda understandable considering the situation. I always liked to attribute the differences between Young Tom and Voldemort to his difference in situation. Young Tom was just a talented orphan of dubious origins, who had to charm people to do his bidding. Voldemort is at the top, and he know it, he doesn't have to keep any charade.

***** Oh so he might have been alright.

​

****** Indeed. Tom Riddle is this supper smart, friendly, charismatic, do-no-wrong young man, that has everyone fall for him. Voldemort is pretty much the complete opposite.

It's easy to make the claim that making so many Horcruxes messed him up mentally. But he isn't the only discrepancy of this type in Rowling's work, so I'm thinking it might be more on her.

******* Its possible that had he been at full capacity his mind combined with his mastery of magic he would have proved too powerful to defeat

​

if She didn't hobble him we may have had a very different story

The Dark Lord turned his gaze towards the horizon,the long held dread of potter leaving him. It was over......soon the boy would be nothing but a memory. He smiled.......all was well

***** I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore said that Voldemort's Horcrux-making didn't affect his skills or mental faculties, in book six. He said something along those lines when warning Harry of underestimating Voldemort.

** He'd probably attempt to take over Britain “legitimately”, but without the horcruxs and the prophecy being over means that anyone could off him. The thing about living is that it includes dying. And neither can live while the other survives.
