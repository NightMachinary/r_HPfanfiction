a fic like 'Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament' where harry realize just how precarious his position is being the uneducated famous sole heir to a noble house and eligible to inherit another, so he resolves to be more proactive.

instead of reacting to whatever life throws at him and only surviving through sheer dumb luck by reevaluating his friends and acquaintances, educating himself on the wizarding world, managing his fame and wealth better as to not become the obvious scapegoat for whenever shit hits the fan (hiring lawyer, managers, political advisors..), along with surrounding himself with competent people who are either loyal or have an invested interest in his success to advise and balance his laking instead of friends who either abandon him or make his situation worse in misguided attempt to help.

basically a harry who realizes that he is not just harry.

ps: I know that there are dozens of these fics where is abandoned, but in most of these he simply he rant about the unfairness of it all , goes to the goblins finds that he has 5 lordships that provide hiim with 10M G , 500 hectares of lands and either find the chamber or a grimoire or a hidden superpower that makes him on par with dumbles and tom combined , I don't mind harry having 2 + lordships as long as he has to struggle to get and then rebuild them, as for tom and dumbles they have to be on a league of there own seeing as they are 100+ y prodigies who had access to 90% of the magic that the ministry censored, and were just as exceptional at harry's age with time only making them stronger and more expirienced.
