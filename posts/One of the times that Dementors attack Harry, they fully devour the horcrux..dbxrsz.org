I've seen a few fics where Harry is very nearly spooky kissed and it has unusual effects. I've seen fics where Harry dies early and comes back to life without the horcrux. I don't think I've seen any where a dementor cleanly take the horcrux and Harry is cured (fixed?).

Are there any?


** There is another one, it just kills the horcrux. Although the story was abandoned and we only hear about it. No Competition linkffn(11126195)

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

So many people struggle with the bot (especially since it doesn't like a capital at the beginning of Linkffn,) but

#+begin_example
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ffnbot!directlinks
#+end_example

Is so much easier.

Then I see some people doing both links and linkffn(3428397) (ffnbot!ignore) that it doesn't make sense to me why they don't just put the link instead of the id number. The bot works just fine that way, and it is way easier than doing both, (but not as easy as directlinks).

  Voldemort discovers his human horcrux and takes control of wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live though it's a knife-edged journey. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with a strange connection to Dark Marks and Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
