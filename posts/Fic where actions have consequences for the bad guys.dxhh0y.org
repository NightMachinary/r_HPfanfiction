I was just reading a fic (can't remember what it's called) but basically during a quidditch match, Katie Bell got stabbed through the lung with a broomstick in an "accident", and the Griffydors responded by hitting the bludgers harder against the Slytherins. And then the Gryffindor's got banned from Quidditch. Now this was under Umbridge, so the lack of punishment for Slytherin makes sense, but seeing as how this fanfic was advertised as "amoral Harry" it annoyed me that's all that happened. I'd like one where either a. stabbing someone through the lung gets actual punishment, and one where Dumbledore isn't a pushover about it, or b. Gryffindor actually takes matters into their own hands on both Slytherin and Umbridge (not necessarily needs to be 5th year, random cursing in the back or getting tossed down stairs also getting punished in other years would be good too). Just gets a little old


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515), has several good anti Umbridge moments. For example, upon realizing the blood quill, Harry immediately stunned Umbridge with his backup wand, notified Dumbledore, who then memory charmed her into believing that she had cowed Harry.

*** I'm not a huge fan of starfox5 (the way Hermione is written just comes across as... revisionist, which makes sense since I'm more of a fantasy and friendship reader.) But the concepts are great.
