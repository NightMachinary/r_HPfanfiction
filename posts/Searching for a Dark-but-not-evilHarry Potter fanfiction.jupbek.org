Im looking for a fanfiction like Evitative (by Vichan from Ao3) where Harry is resorted into slytherin and turns dark but not evil. I don't really care about pairings. Please no wattpad fanfiction. Hope to see good suggestions. Thx.


** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin? Maybe not fully Dark, but I'd recommend anyway in case

*** Is it on Ao3 or Fanfiction.net? If it is on ff.n does it by any chance have ober 100 chapters?

**** Yes, over 140 chapters at present. It's probably easier to search by author - the sinister man.
