*** And then there is me wanting to read long in depth stories and sort by 100k words. If authors cut their story under 100k to split fics, i aint gonna find your fic.. (unless its reccommended here)

*** I get more annoyed when the story is too short as I read so much so I will just finish up t very quickly....although if the story is very long yet turns out to he only over one year that irritates me as well.

** I think it depends. If each year is about as involved as they were in canon, then I have no issue with them being split across multiple stories; however, if (for example) the first couple of years can essentially be summed up in half a dozen chapters or so, then I think it's better keeping it all in one story.

** Depends on length. If each chunk is 100k words, obviously that's fine. If it's like 30k words apiece, it's a bit wanky.

** I prefer smaller chunks, I won't start reading an 60 chapter fic unless I know I have a lot of free time. If its broken down by years it would (probably) be in smaller chunks so I would be more inclined to read it.

** It does annoy me - because the authors often write in the summary or makr the fic as 'Complete' only for me to find out that no, it's only the first book out of 7 or 8 they managed to complete, there is like 2 more parts that are complete, one half done with last update being 5 years ago and no word from the author ever since.\\
But if they finished the story and simply do it for visibility reasons then i don't care

** I'm not really even sure how that would have been done with any amount of fluidity. But I could only imagine that being a little grating. Time skips are annoying in general, let alone one every handful of chapters.
