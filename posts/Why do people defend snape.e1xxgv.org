The man was a horrible human being. Before people get started on how he loved lily and all that consider this

He only begged Tom to spare Lily not her *child* or James both of whom he was fine with being killed

Then there is the fact that he is a marked DE and while it is never mentioned what he does before or after he joins Dumbledore only that dumbledore kept him out of prison but we can infer how he behaved based on the actions of the other DE's and the spells that he invented while at school like sectumsempra. So it stands to reason he has killed or tortured people or helped kill and/or torture

Then there is his treatment of students which should have had him fired within the first semester of teaching.

The other points people bring up is that he saved harry the only times he had any part in helping harry was first year with broom and even then he failed and it was hermione and ron who saved him, then there is the fact that we do not see him being useful in spying even then he only does it for revenge not because he had a change of heart

It gives him a nuance that you don't see in relatively flatly written characters like the movie's version of Doofus Ron and Hermione Sue. It's similar to the dimension that David Thewlis put into Lupin (played it with an AIDS/HIV allegory to the wolfiness) or Jude Law put into Young Dumbledore (anti-government radical trapped in the closet).

** Most arguments I've heard paint Snapes life as a dark tragedy, beaten by his father, loosing his mother, tormented when he goes to school, falling into the wrong crowd, losing the girl he 'loves', being bound in servitude, accidently setting her up to die, being conned into anothers servitude, forced to deal with idiots below his 'amazing' talents.

Personally I see it more as a life lived by someone who never knew how to get off rock bottom. He suffered abuse as a child and returned it as an adult, specifically targeting the child of the one who tormented him most. Snapes design was of a pathetic man that could never let go, never move forward, never reach for something new. Plus, lets face it, his love is creepy. Seriously, did he want to be the shoulder for her to cry on about her husband and sons death? Where did he think that would go? Did he think he could hide his involvement forever? Cause Aberforth is just as much of a spiteful bastard, so I could see him letting it slip just to watch the deatheater crumble.

*** And with all of that said it makes sense why Harry views Snape as a tragic, brave figure. Harry experienced the life that both Tom Riddle and Snape lived, in parts. The main difference, and what proved that Harry was better than both is that /his/ love wasn't twisted. Voldemort only ever saw love as something to exploit. Snape, getting this love exploited multiple times over his life, saw love as something that damaged you.

Harry recognized in Snape the same thing he recognized in Tom Riddle. He could have been both of them, easily. At the end of the day, as twisted and rotted as he was, Snape still acted out of a love which he had allowed to torment his soul. Snape's final duties were in accepting that he had never let go of this love, and using that pain (that creepy, demented pain) to fuel the actions which ensured the downfall of Voldemort.

Harry, himself not growing up in a situation where he can recognize good love from bad love but knowing what love is, sees Snape as a tragic and brave figure. Because Harry, himself, was emotionally stunted.

**** I can see Snape as tragic, and the connection between his and Harry's early life, however I don't see him as brave. He only ever stood up for himself in rage and never let things go. If you wish to call him brave, go ahead, but I see him as a coward who knelt to two masters and never moved forwards.

I can understand that in his youth he screwed up when he knelt before Voldie, everyone makes mistakes, but when it was time for him to atone for it, he went to Dumbledore instead of Lily. When the plan failed he turned bitter and resentful. That he harmed both Medical and Aurors is a given, as both required a Potions Newt but Snape let in far fewer and gave Slytherin the upper hand.

I can't even say his death was brave, he died because he followed orders to protect Draco, yes, but he didn't stand up for himself, and his last action was just another order he followed.

***** Examples of Snape being /insanely/ brave: asking Voldemort to spare the Mudblood mother of the child prophesied to destroy him; going to Dumbledore, the leader of the opposite faction, aware of the possibility that he might be killed on sight, or sent to Azkaban; accepting to spy on Voldemort, considered the strongest Legilimens in the world; accepting, without hesitation, to go back to Voldemort, aware of the extremely high possibility that he might be killed on sight (and it's strongly implied he was tortured); accepting to kill Dumbledore and seal his position as Voldemort's henchman, turning himself into one of the most reviled people in the WW.

#+begin_quote
  he went to Dumbledore instead of Lily.

Because... Dumbledore was supposed to be the most powerful wizard in the word, and the surest bet that Lily would live. Again, it was extremely brave to go to him, despite not knowing what Dumbledore's reaction would be.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, he was marked for the rest of his life by the fact that he contributed to Lily's death. Are you saying that traumatised people are "cowards"? Especially in a case where there was no way for him to move forward, considering the life he had to live?

#+begin_quote
  That he harmed both Medical and Aurors is a given, as both required a Potions Newt but Snape let in far fewer and gave Slytherin the upper hand.
#+end_quote

This is... baffling. He accepted N.E.W.T. students based on their scores on O.W.L. exams, which weren't graded by him. So there was no way for him to "give Slytherins the upper hand". If anything, it allowed him to keep the likes of Crabbe and Goyle out of his class, without their parents being able to complain. On the other hand, someone like Hermione was a shoe-in.

The fact that even Harry, who isn't studious, loathes Potions, and isn't a natural talent at the discipline, was able to get an EE suggests that either the exam was relatively easy, or that Snape was actually a good teacher. Either way, you're basically accusing him of... having high standards for his advanced students??? Which should be a good thing for people going into such important professions.

#+begin_quote

Are you trying to paint the fact that he didn't trade Draco's life for his own... as a bad thing? The whole point of his character, by the end of the books, is that he tries saving as many people as he can, and is no longer concerned with protecting Harry, exclusively.

(I'm not the guy you were talking to) This is something that I never really thought of, I've read /far/ more fanfic than I have canon at this point. I haven't read canon for like a decade, and my image of Snape as a teacher became that he was just kinda bad at it, a potions master who could do but couldn't teach, but clearly Harry had learned enough to get the equivalent of a B on the government exam, and that's something portrayed as relatively difficult.

******* Hah, I appreciate you keeping an open mind about this!

From what I've seen, a lot of the people who seem to actively hate Snape (not talking about people who casually dislike him, that's perfectly understandable) have a completely warped image of him and his actions, and I suspect it's partially due to reading a lot of fanon, particularly Marauder-centric fics where Snape is necessarily made more ~evil.

Which is probably why there are people even in this post talking about Snape "torturing students", when the most he does is... dock house points and call Neville thickheaded that one time. Meanwhile, Fake!Moody /actually tortures/ Draco in front of other students (that passage is horrifying, but treated as hilarious because Harry hates Draco), and McGonagall's reaction is to... send Moody to Snape, so that /Draco/ can be punished "appropriately" for throwing a hex at Harry.

Regarding Snape's teaching skills, Hermione never once complains about his style, and is much more displeased with Slughorn, despite the fact that Snape never praises her, and Slughorn does. I take that as indicative of his actual performance, outside of his behaviour towards Harry. Also, Umbridge notes his students are "advanced" for their level (yes, Umbridge is incompetent herself, but she's clearly using some sort of standardised criteria for the evaluation).

I think Snape would have been best suited as a University professor, or at least strictly a N.E.W.T.level teacher, where he could teach teenagers who were both competent and interested in the subject. Having to let 11 y.o. kids handle extremely volatile substances sounds like a nightmare, and definitely requires the kind of patience Snape didn't have.

  He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth - she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar.

********* Context: Hermione's teeth had been enlarged by Draco (which Ron told Snape). If Snape acknowledged that she'd been hexed, he'd also have to punish the culprit. This, at a time when Voldemort's return was certain, so Snape being in Malfoy's good graces, and not taking Harry Potter's side, was essential.

Right before the bit you quoted is this:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”

  “Potter attacked me, sir---”

  “We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.

  “and he hit Goyle---look---”

  Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.

  “Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.

  “Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!”
#+end_quote

Notice how /Snape doesn't give Harry detention for hexing Goyle/? He was trying to downplay the entire incident, to avoid punishing anyone.

It's similar to the incident in CoS, where Draco insults Hermione, and Ron tries to attack Draco. Harry /assumes/ Snape doesn't notice, but it's clearly established in canon that Snape doesn't miss much, and he was standing right behind them at the time. Or the incident in OotP, where he tells Crabbe to loosen his hold on Neville, while disguising it as concern for Crabbe. And do you think he never found out about the Polyjuice Potion incident?

He doesn't want to actively punish the children of Death Eaters, because he doesn't want to antagonise their parents, but he's actually pretty indifferent about the Trio getting into fights with them, and it's likely he despises Crabbe and Goyle. If their parents weren't DEs, he'd probably treat them like he does Neville.

We see Snape in class and he's a terrible teacher and a horrible person to his students. Take some time to read about Harry's first class with him in the first book and the class on Shrinking Potions in the third book; the first where he picked on and bullied an eleven year old he'd just met and the latter where he gleefully threatened to poison a student's pet and was disappointed when he couldn't (among other shit).

Except Snape's students are noted as being "advanced" in general, and Hermione (whom I deem a much more appropriate judge of academical matters) is perfectly content with Snape's teaching style. More so than Slughorn's, despite the fact that the former is very critical, and the latter praises her. And no other students, teachers or parents ever criticise Snape's competency. So his students likely get good O.W.L. results on a regular basis.

For Harry to score well "in spite of Snape", he'd have to either be a natural talent at Potions or to be particularly studious in that area. Neither of which is the case. The point is that Snape's very high standards and constant criticisms make his students surpass the regular performance expected at their level.

Yes, he behaves terribly towards Harry during that first class. Although you should keep in mind that PS was still very much a children's book, with over-the-top behaviours. See, for example, the fact that /Hagrid mutilates an eleven year old child/ by giving him a pig's tail that he has to have surgically removed.

During the scene with Neville, he's clearly frustrated at Neville not following the instructions, and uses the threat to try and make him pay attention. Obviously, a tactic that doesn't suit someone like Neville at all, but it's ridiculous to think he wanted to murder Neville's toad. It's established quite clearly that Snape can tell whether a potion has been correctly brewed strictly by it's colour. He can even pinpoint what went wrong, at which stage. So when he feeds the potion to Neville's toad, he knows Hermione's helped Neville and the potion is fine.

Honestly, the outrage over Neville's toad seems highly hypocritical, considering the students torture animals in Transfiguration class, and raise baby Mandrakes specifically so they can be slaughtered:

#+begin_quote
  Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.

  “The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. “And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.”

#+begin_quote
  This is... baffling. He accepted N.E.W.T. students based on their scores on O.W.L. exams, which weren't graded by him. So there was no way for him to "give Slytherins the upper hand". If anything, it allowed him to keep the likes of Crabbe and Goyle out of his class, without their parents being able to complain. On the other hand, someone like Hermione was a shoe-in.
#+end_quote

All we ever saw of him as a teacher was 'Recipe is on the board' and then him terroizing students. Is there a single line in the books or scene in the movies where he actually answers a question or tells the students why you prepare the ingrediants that way? Or even helps a student other then Slytherins? So yeah, he gave them the upper hand as they don't need to worry about a stressful enviroment while working with explosives.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that even Harry, who isn't studious, loathes Potions, and isn't a natural talent at the discipline, was able to get an EE suggests that either the exam was relatively easy, or that Snape was actually a good teacher. Either way, you're basically accusing him of... having high standards for his advanced students??? Which should be a good thing for people going into such important professions.

Desperation for what? To save Lily? Then I guess nobody in the Order was brave, they were all desperate to save themselves or their loved ones.

But let's see the /actual/ definition:

#+begin_quote
  Definition of bravery 1: the quality or state of having or showing mental or moral strength to face danger, fear, or difficulty : the quality or state of being brave : COURAGE
#+end_quote

Snape faced danger, fear, /and/ difficulty. More than anyone else, except Harry. And unlike Harry, he had several opportunities to back out of it, and didn't take them.

#+begin_quote
  That was following orders, which admittedly needed guts to pull off.
#+end_quote

#+end_quote

Because that's not how mental and emotional trauma works, people can't "get over it" because they want to. They need support and they need therapy, and even then it might not happen. Snape had the exact opposite conditions - he was stuck in a place that reminded him of everything bad that had happened to him and that he'd done, stuck in a job he didn't want, with Dumbledore reminding him about Lily and his role in her death. Then Harry arrived at Hogwarts, and he projected his issues with James on him. Then his childhood bully, Lupin, also showed up, and almost murdered Harry&co. Then Voldemort came back. When, exactly, did he have the opportunity to properly work through his trauma?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Do you also have this issue with any of the other teachers, who are never shown actually instructing the students? And the idea that Snape "terrorized" the students is... pure fanon.

Keep in mind the narrative is not objective, it's from Harry's perspective, who loathes Potions and Snape (for good reason).

#+begin_quote
  "No, it's not,” said Hermione. “All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.”

  “What's that?” said Ron and Harry together.

  “Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago---”

  “D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?” muttered Ron.

  [...]

  “It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.”
#+end_quote

An example would actually be the class where he famously calls Neville thickheaded, while telling him what he should have done. Another example is in OotP, where he points Harry's mistakes out to him.

#+begin_quote
  So yeah, he gave them the upper hand as they don't need to worry about a stressful enviroment while working with explosives.
#+end_quote

It's the other way around, really, as noted by Harry himself. Since he's used to brewing in "stressful" conditions, he manages to breeze through it in normal conditions. Which brings us to...

#+begin_quote
  I'd honestly put Harry getting an EE down to Hermione forcing study habits, not Snape. And yes, I'm accusing him of being a poor teacher that expected high standards without actually *helping* his students attain such.
#+end_quote

Except Snape's students in general are advanced, as per Umbridge in OotP (who is using standardised evaluation criteria). And it's clearly presented as a long-standing fact. After all, in 15 years of teaching, nobody complained about Snape's N.E.W.T. standards.

And by your logic, if Harry managed to get an EE in Potions, despite having such a dreadful teacher, he should have gotten perfect Os in Transfiguration, Charms and other subjects. Except he didn't, he got the same grade in all of them, other than DADA. So following your own logic, Snape would have to be a better teacher than all the rest (I don't think that's the case), since he has to compensate for the tension between him and Harry.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't trade Draco's life for his own, he had no idea that was the event that would get him killed.

Are we forgetting that Snape is a Slytherin? Being roundabout is natural. They're not brash or outspoken (by design, those usually go to Gryffindor); they're quiet and more often than not work in the shadows. When Neville, Ginny and Luna snuck into his office to steal the sword, he sent them to detention with HAGRID, the one person that could keep them all safe from nearly anyone save Voldemort.

Define "desperation" and "bravery", articulating the difference.

Dumbledore: "I'm extremely fortunate to have you," "A job I'd entrust to no one else but you" (paraphrasing). It's more than following orders, if you think Snape didn't need to think on his feet to get through corners double-spying, that's hilarious.

#+begin_quote

Probably zero. Karkaroff names him dead last and does not associate him with any gruesome act. Bellatrix says he's all talk. Dumbledore asked how many people he "watched" die.

#+begin_quote
  And why was there no way to move forwards? He could have changed the way he acted, become a better person instead of what he was.
#+end_quote

After Lily died and he was exonerated, he certainly could have moved to Australia and move on. He chose a more meaningful and much less pleasant life, which is brave AF and yet people insist on viewing as petty and as dwelling. What the fuck? If you met somebody who decided to an activist against war because he was traumatized in war, would you call this dwelling? What's the difference?

Anyway, define "better person". It's not as straightforward as you think; arguably, as Snape is uniquely positioned to help defeat Voldemort like no one else can, he has a moral duty to do *that*, and not whatever you think he should've done.

#+begin_quote
  And no, it wouldn't have ruined his cover because all that would be is acting like a teacher instead of terrorizing children, hell if he needed to put up an act for his DE buddies he could have done the whole terrorize children for a year or two and then gotten Dumbledore to put his foot down publicly about his actions.
#+end_quote

Ah, terrorizing children. In the Boggarts lesson (copying from the PDF so the formatting is gonna be weird):

"Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”*Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically.*"

Everyone but Neville thinks its funny, even Neville acknowledges this. The students aren't so terrorized by Snape that they stop talking back to him. Fear that does not change behavior in any way isn't all that strong. Anyway, Hermione quotes the textbook about the Boggarts:

“It's a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever *it thinks* will frighten us most."

Lupin, god bless him, distorts this into: " when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears."

These are not logical equivalents. The WORST FEAR interpretation is not necessarily true, it might be merely *a* fear that's more on one's mind, and in Nev's case, having just endured Snape, that's Snape. Claiming that Nev deeply fears Snape more than he does Bellatrix is fucking stupid. Since according to you, all Dumbledore needed to do to stop this wholesale abuse of children, was to ask Snape to stop it, take it up with Dumbledore.

Also go read the chapters where he dies, "The Sacking of Severus Snape" and "The Elder Wand". His entire thing in these chapters is to find Harry but he doesn't manage it before Voldemort sics Nagini on him. You've clearly misunderstood everything about these chapters. Unless you're victim blaming somebody for being murdered? Which is an interesting take, indeed.

'Moving forwards' is moving on with your life. Snape lived in the past, his rage at childhood tormentors, his lost love, the deals he made. He is never shown to have pushed out of that, made himself as an adult. I don't know about you, but I have no interest in the kids that bullied me when I was at school, nor their kids, and there's this thing called dating. Hell, it's not even limited to the Maruders seeing the way he treats the other houses, and we have nothing about the Longbottoms treating him poorly. And please don't give me crap about how he needed it for cover, the way he acted should have gotten him thrown out of the school years before Harry got there and that he wasn't should have been the suspiscious thing.

Stand up for himself by making his own choices and accepting his own flaws. It's not that hard. All we ever saw from Snape was either him striking at the world that hurt him and following orders. Hell, if he was really against teaching that much he should have stood up to Dumbledore and gotten another position, seeing as the long term effects of him teaching were purely negative.

  “And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.”

  “What --- what do you mean?”

  “You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily's son.”

  “He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone ---”

  “The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.”

  There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never --- never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter's son . . . I want your word!”
#+end_quote

but obviously he also hates harry, loves terrorizing him through his time at hogwarts, loves bullying him and seeing him suffer and trying to make him explode, etc, because of how he looks exactly like james.

a lot of people try to point out that this is contradictory, but wouldn't that be the interesting thing? can you have a person who hates somebody intensely because of who they remind them of, yet still works to keep them safe because of a dead parent's wish? somebody like snape, where the idea of him being in love is a 'v. horrible thing'? i think trying to explore those dynamics is really interesting and is what makes snape a dynamic & complex character.

i also find it strange that people expect fictional characters to have no complexes or cognitive dissonances - which people irl have plenty of. of course there's a huge dissonance between what lily wants & how snep treats harry. what would be interesting is trying to figure out how this dissonance takes shape, right? (and arguably him hating james so infernally and then casually caring for somebody who looks like him would also be just as dissonant.)

the problem in fanon imo is when people try to whitewash snep (downplay him sympathizing w/ nazis, which was far worse than anything the marauders ever did, & downplay him relentlessly terrorizing students) or try to just retcon the heroic deeds he actually did (spying w/ risk of his life, saving students in DH, saving harry many times, etc.)

*** I don't think his love was creepy. It was a bit self serving but in the end it was true. Keep in mind Snape is said to be one of the only death eaters who can cast a patronus. This is because it's a spell that requires true love and happiness which he had with Lily.

I think people who dislike Snape want to make his friendship with Lily something gross or weird but per JK, up to the point they fell out Lily genuinely loved Snape as her best friend. Snape's "obsession" with Lily is an acknowledgement that she was probably the only person in his life to genuinely love him. He realized the power of that and hung onto it for the rest of his life.

Also while Snape was a highly unpleasant and messed up person, he does improve himself over the years. He went from being a Death Eater to being Dumbledore's right hand man. As Dumbledore mentions, he doesn't run away from his duties like Karkaroff does. Also when Dumbledore asks, "how many people have you hurt, Severus?" He replies, "Lately? Only those I cannot save." Which is a far improvement from the man willing to let James and Harry die because he didn't give a shit.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  "That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Lucius's mistake, I know it!"

  Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.

  "That's why he's chosen Draco, isn't it?" she persisted. "To punish Lucius?"

  "If Draco succeeds," said Snape, still looking away from her, "he will be honored above all others. "

  "But he won't succeed!" sobbed Narcissa. "How can he, when the Dark Lord himself-- ?"

  Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.

  "I only meant. . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . Severus. . . please. . . you are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . you are Lucius's old friend. . . I beg you. . . you are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . will you speak to him, persuade him--?"

  "The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it," said Snape flatly. "I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed. "

  "Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!" choked Narcissa. "He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!"

  (...)

  "In other words, it doesn't matter to him if Draco is killed!"

  "The Dark Lord is very angry," repeated Snape quietly. "He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily. "

  She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.

  "My only son. . . my only son. . . "

  "You should be proud!" said Bellatrix ruthlessly. "If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!"

  Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair.

Second, movie Snape, the way he carries himself, and his actor influenced a lot of people's opinions on the character, too.

Third, Snape sucks as a human being, agreed, but he IS a damn interesting character. I am sure many people like him simply because he does not quite fit into any category. He definitely is more complex than many other characters in the books. - And, if you like a character, even for them beeing a complicated jerk, it can happen that you overemphasise with them.

** Look at Snape's life from his perspective. His childhood was

-abusive father and neglectful mother

-living in abject poverty

-isolated from other children until age 11 (excepting Lily)

-bullied at school by people who targeted him for humiliation

-seems to be generally disliked by mostly everyone

He has no social skills, rage that comes from being an abused and unloved child, and no support network at all.

Frankly, I would have been shocked if he didn't become a death eater. Probably the only people who provided him any validation at all were fellow future (or present) death eaters who saw the potential in him, as he was quite smart and powerful.

But where is love in this? Where is kindness? I don't think Snape saw any of that his entire childhood except from Lily. How could anyone be kind if they've never been shown how? This is not to mention that Snape was recruited as an impressionable teenager. Tom Riddle almost certainly prayed on Snape's loneliness and need for love/validation to win him over. Just like the Potter's put their trust in Pettigrew as a friend, Dumbledore acknowledges that Snape "put his trust on the wrong person" with Voldemort.

So then he gets to be an "adult," and in this case that means he's the ripe old age of 20, and he finds his life in shambles. Riddle is no doubt a cruel master. He was probably tortured on a regular basis. His "friends" who are death eaters are no doubt only so when they need something. All this while living in the childhood home where he was abused by the people who should have loved him. I can't imagine the level of loneliness and misery he must have experienced.

But he remembers one thing. One person who genuinely loved and cared about him. Happy memories of a better time, a better version of himself. He knows he was better off with Lily. He knows she made him a better person. He loved her, really truly loved her because she loved him and she was the only real friend he's ever had. He probably thinks about how his life would have been different if he had chosen her instead of the DEs.

Which is why when he realizes what he's done in conveying the prophecy to Voldemort he's willing to risk his life by going to Dumbledore. That's no small thing. He could have been killed by Dumbledore. We as readers know that Albus would never do that but Snape's only known cruelty his whole life. He wouldn't have expected mercy.

And he never looks back. He spies for Dumbledore at considerable risk to himself. He goes back after all those years to Voldemort at Dumbledore's request. God that had to be terrifying. To go back knowing he would be tortured. Then to live a lie, to let everyone on his life think that he killed Dumbledore, arguably the only other person in the world to have ever loved him beside Lily. It's a miserable lonely life and I could never have done it.

Oh and the reason he does it? For love. He isn't getting anything else from it. He could have run away. He could have moved out of the country and just hid. But he stayed because he was brave and because he was driven by love. Think how hurt he was when Dumbledore told him the plan to let Harry die. He truly believed Dumbledore was doing everything to protect Harry and was hurt and furious to realize he was risking the boy's life.

And yes, he's an asshole. He has rage issues and does not seem to understand how to interact with people on any level. He's cruel to Harry. But that doesn't make me mad. It makes me sad. That a grown man could be so miserable and alone an unable to move on with his life.

I think Harry understood that in the end. He realizes the enormity of what Snape had to overcome just to do what he did with his life. Harry too was abused, but unlike Snape, he has friends and adults who loved him and were there for him.

So sorry I do like Snape as a character. He's not someone I would ever want to interact with in real life but he is someone who I highly empathize with.

No, as per your own words, he would have nicked his head/neck. Snape was clearly able to control the amount of damage inflicted, and the idea that he would have tried to murder anyone /in front of the whole school/ is... embarrassing.

Why PTSD? I understand after the war but before? The reasons as too why he couldnt see Threstrals until 5th year was because he didnt have attachment to Quirell or his parents. After Cedric no and for sure some councilling after Sirius same with Dumbledore. But not PTSD.

#+end_quote

I guess that depends on your definition of child abuse. According to my definition they constantly abused him emotionally and potentially occasionally abused him physically - depending on how serious we can take the thing with Petunia swinging a pan at him. I do not count what Dudley did as child abuse, that was just bullying. The Dursley's reactions to it might fall under the emotional abuse though.

#+begin_quote
  PTSD
#+end_quote

I think they meant after school. We don't really have any indication about what exactly he did after school, so I think that is a bit unfair, but on the other hand I seriously doubt the Wizarding World has /any/ idea at all about mental illnesses so it's relatively unlikely he got any help.

#+begin_quote
  Threstrals The reason he couldn't see Thestrals until year 5 is that JKR hadn't invented them before that. Thestral invisibility has nothing at all to do with attachment, it's about seeing and accepting death. He was too young when his parents died for that to happen, but he /should/ have been able to see them after Quirrel died. If you want an in-universe asspull explanation for why he didn't, just assume that he repressed his thoughts on the whole thing because it was so traumatic.

  for sure some councilling after Sirius same with Dumbledore I'm pretty sure he didn't get any counseling at all after either Sirius' or Dumbledore's deaths.

  Harry had never shown PTSD symptoms ever in cannon, so how now????
#+end_quote

Yes actually. I don't know about any other occasions but he did have flashbacks/nightmares about Cedric's death (and possibly Voldemort's resurrection), which we know because Dudley made fun of him for crying about it. Of course having some symptoms doesn't mean he actually did have PTSD, we just don't know for sure since he wasn't diagnosed canonically.

I'm pretty sure 90% of the population don't experience anything as traumatic as Harry did, but I wasn't saying Harry did have PTSD, just pointing out that he showed at least some symptoms of it. From the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder][Wikipedia article]]:

#+begin_quote
  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, child abuse, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  the event is commonly relived by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, dissociative episodes of reliving the trauma ("flashbacks"), and nightmares.
#+end_quote

Of course there is more to it, for example that it must go on for at least a month (probably applies) and that it must cause dysfunction in life or clinical levels of distress (might or might not apply).

#+begin_quote
  Also abuse by Dursleys is a grey area to me as it isnt shown or mentioned
#+end_quote

Emotional abuse is abuse too.

#+begin_quote
  And yes Dudley was bullying Harry but older years not really.

Does that matter?

Yes, some sort. Mostly the "completely broken mind" and "batshit crazy" types. Moody's paranoid behaviour is pretty much called out, but not really as a mental illness. We don't /know/ whether they recognize mental illnesses but it doesn't /seem/ like they have any idea what a therapist is.

***** two words: 'Harry Hunting'. so no it's not just '/boys being boys/', it's growing up with your school bully and having to deal with him even when you go 'home'. It's never really having a break from being treated like crap from the time he could walk, up too the time of his 11th Birthday (and i'm not even going to go into his Hogwarts years) . all I can really say is a least Dudley grew up by the seventh book, unlike Harry's Aunt and Uncle.

"Dursleys didnt abuse him, neglect yes"

*examples of emotional abuse:*

- */Not providing the child with a safe environment. The child witnesses violence or severe abuse between parents or adults. -( locking Harry in a dark, cramped cupboard/ room with bars the window, unable to get out because the door locks from the outside)/*\\
- */Threatening the child with violence or abandonment. - (they actually do this in book one when suggesting to make Harry Stay in the Car while they are enjoying the zoo.)/*
- */Constantly criticizing or blaming the child for problems. -(everything was Harry's fault in the Dursley Household)/*
- The child's parent or caregiver does not show concern for the child, and refuses help from others for the child.\\
  ( [[https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007225.htm]] )\\

*examples of child neglect:*

- */Rejecting the child and not giving the child any love. -( do I even Have to point this out?)/*
- */Not feeding the child. ( they feed Harry very little compared to what he should be eating, and if this quote/* "I'm warning you now, boy--any funny business, anything at all--and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas" */is anything to go by i'd say withholding food from him also happened at times.)/*
- */Not dressing the child in proper clothing. -( only allowing Harry to wear his cousins old clothing.)/*
- Not giving needed medical or dental care.
- */Leaving a child alone for a long time. This is called abandonment. - (they do this when they drop Harry off alone at the train station, all while believing that 9 1/4 didn't exist with no money to go anywhere/ buy anything if their beliefs were true)/*\\
  ( [[https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007225.htm]] )\\

So in concussion I'd say that how the Durley's treated Harry could be seen as both abuse and neglectful.

Honestly I think its more because Dumbledore defends him.

I personally think Dumbledore was a master manipluator and a somewhat terrible person in many ways, so I don't think his defense of Snape is all that impactful, but to many, Dumbledore is seen in much higher regard and that trickles into how they view Snape.

Throw in the fact that the idea of someone spying on someone as horrible as Voldemort, and it automatically makes you want to sympathize with how much they have to risk and deal with to do so. Meanwhile they forget how he got there in the first place.

** Well, he couldn't really beg for Harry's life. Harry was prophecied to defeat Voldemort - there was no way he could have convinced him to not kill the baby. And why would he save James? They hated each other, and again - how would he justify this in front of Voldemort? Lily was the only person he could reasonably expect Voldemort to spare.

I like Snape but I think he was a horrible person. He had a hard life, a difficult childhood, was bullied in school and in a house full if future DE. I don't think staying away from them or opposing them was a real option. He slept with them and has meals and classes with them... besides none of the other houses would associate with a Slytherin if he decided to stay away from them. I think he had very few choices and it's understandable that he turned out the way he did. I know people always argue with the “it's your choices which define you” stuff and of course that's true but how many people do you actually see who can outgrow both genetics and environment? Almost none. I am a teacher and I constantly see sweet children turn into their parents. I also don't think Draco had any chance of being anything but a racist bigot, with his parents being who they are and his peers being all Slytherins. It explains why they acted the way they acted. It does not excuse their behavior.

And I think the discussion is mostly about whether he is evil or not and... he's grey. He was risking his life for the good side. But he was a terrible person and teacher. So both - good and bad.

There are loads of backstory's you could create for Snape to excuse some of his behavior later in life, and that's what people do. Because it's fun and interesting. It's a challenge to take a character who's completely fucked up and then make them likable. And a lot of people find that challenge fun.

I also think one of the reasons people identify with Snape is because of the abuse/neglect/bullying he suffered as a child. Sadly, child abuse/neglect/bullying is way the fuck more common than anyone wants to think about and a lot of people who suffer it don't turn out like Harry. They don't brush it off and live to fight another day. They get depressed, they get anxious. They don't shower regularly, they're bad at their jobs, they're bad at making friends and connecting with other people, they then find themselves hating other people and turn inward on themselves, pushing everyone who could help them away. So when they see a character like that, that's like them in those ways, and learn some of his backstory, they start to identify with him, despite all the terrible things he's done.

So with that being said, one of the biggest reasons people defend Snape is because of all the Snaters out there. Those people who go red in the face denouncing Snape as such a terrible fucking person. As worse than Voldemort, worse than Umbridge, worse than Dumbledore. So the people who like Snape because he's interesting, and they like to play with him in their stories and the fanfiction they read, defend him. The people who identify with him because he has some of their flaws and characteristics, they defend him too.

Frankly, he's a fictional character and we're allowed to like, dislike, love, hate, etc. different characters but we don't have to be assholes about it. I've seen a ton of Snaters be complete fucking dicks to people who defend him or like him for seemingly no reason. On the other hand, I've seen a ton of Snape stans become complete raging assholes to Snaters for seemingly no reason. It's fine to dislike a character, it's not fine to be mean to other people because they like the character you dislike.

Also, you're making a lot of assumptions about his actions and his character - Snape fans generally make /different/ assumptions.

Personally, what makes /me/ defend Snape is the continual insistence of this new wave of HP fandom to villainize him and completely flatten his character. There is such a thing as nuance. Characters - and people, for that matter - can be unpleasant, and bitter, and vindictive, and terrible teachers, without also being completely evil.

Whether out of genuine loyalty or simply a desire for recognition, Snape relayed the prophecy to Voldemort, and he's responsible for the consequences of that decision.

Also, the whole "why would he ask Voldemort to spare James or Harry" thing has been brought up loads of times in this thread alone, and it hasn't gotten less offensive with repetition: the facts remain that Snape gave Voldemort information which led to him targeting the Potters, that he expressed no guilt over putting James and Harry in mortal danger, and that he displays no remorse for getting James killed and Harry orphaned, only for getting Lily killed.

He only got bits and pieces of the prophecy, not the whole thing. But either way, yeah, I agree with you, he shouldn't have been working with the wizard Nazis in the first place. But he was barely 20, and if he'd left the death eaters before then he would've been killed. I highly doubt Snape wouldve eagerly gone along with killing another innocent family. He would have probably done nothing, which yeah, is horrible and cowardly, but I doubt he would've been foaming at the mouth to murder them like Belatrix. but moreover, it's clear to anyone who's read the books that it wasn't just his love for Lily that kept him going to the end. He genuinely changed his belief system. Otherwise why save lupin in the battle of the seven potters, when he despised him? Why not just abandon Dumbledore and the order when Dumbledore told him Harry had to die? If Harry had to die, then his promise to Lily would've been broken either way, but he stayed. By the end it wasn't just about Lily to him, it was about the Wizarding world as a whole. Snapes defection may have happened in the beginning because of Lily, but anyone who can't acknowledge that his motivations changed towards the end is just denying reality.

The same conversation you quoted to show his supposedly caring about Harry is the same one in which Snape vehemently denies caring about Harry and all but outright states that he's only protected him because he's Lily's son. It's also abundantly clear that Snape only cares about Harry being alive, not his health or happiness.

Snape not actively /wanting/ to murder innocent families is cool, I guess, but I shouldn't have to explain why I find this point underwhelming.

Snape does update his belief system as an adult, yes, and he does genuinely want to take Voldemort down, and his role as a spy was both incredibly brave and incredibly useful. He feels genuine guilt over what he's done and is legitimately trying to make amends, /except/ for where Harry and James are concerned, which is really all I was talking about. He assumes that Harry is a carbon copy of his father, refuses to acknowledge the fact that this is clearly untrue, and bullies and abuses Harry while in a position of explicit power and authority over him because of this assumption/willful delusion.

I didn't bring up that conversation to make a point about Harry. I brought it up to make a point about how Snape, by the end of the series, was clearly not unconcerned when It came to other's lives, and was willing to risk it all to save people. And why the hell would he care about anything other than Harry being alive? Snape doesn't like Harry, and barely knows him. He may not be peppering dumbledore with questions about his happiness, but it's abundantly clear that his reaction to Harry being raised for slaughter is one of basic human decency that's like, hey, even though I think this kid kinda sucks he doesn't deserve to be led along like a pig to slaughter. I'm not defending teenage Snape, but it's almost like you're discounting the person he grew to be entirely. And as for James, exactly why the hell should he give two shits about someone who he vehemently hated and made his life a living hell for? I wouldn't expect a sulky teenager who's only impression of someone is the time they sexually assualted them in front of a group of classmates in addition to hexing and cursing them to care all that much if they died. And even in the end, not only did he ask Dumbledore to spare Harry and James too, but he saved Lupin as well, who we all know he didn't like much more than James. All your references from the past are things that he acknowledged he fucked up in doing, and clearly changed his attitudes for. Now, am I saying he's a saint? Absolutely not, even though he's clearly a hero by the end of the series and has repented his views, he's still an emotionally stunted, vindictive asshole. I'm not discounting that. He shouldn't have been a teacher (in fact I don't know why Dumbledore couldn't have found another position for him to be just as useful in, but whatever) and he was overall a petty, bitter man. That doesn't mean he was evil.

He makes it pretty clear the only reason he does any of his good deeds are because of Lily. If he never met Lily as a child, he'd probably be just as bad, if not worse, than Lucius. The child abuse isn't enough for me to sympathize with him... Sirius denounced his family and their ways when he was /eleven/ (if not younger, but we know he managed to end up in Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, so at least at eleven), and while yes, he could be a brat in school, he picked the good side when push came to shove.

Even Regulus, who saw what their parents put Sirius through, who ended up in Slytherin, and ran with Death Eaters made the right choice. As far as we know, he did that because that was who he was, not because of anyone. Sirius left when Regulus would have been like 14, and Sirius never knew what Regulus did, so it wasn't because of his brother.

Do I think Snape has some good moments? Sure. Showing his Dark Mark in front of everyone to show that Voldemort was back was pretty badass, as was lying to Umbridge and alerting the Order. But I think at the end of the day, he wasn't a great person.

** Snape is a dumpster fire as a human being, but he is one of the most complex, morally grey characters in modern literature - which is where a lot of his appeal comes from. He is also a clear cut example of an anti-hero whose redemption arc was unexpected. Snape's redemption arc thrilled many people but also pissed a lot of people off.

We also know that Snape hadn't killed anyone prior to Dumbledore, because when Dumbledore expresses concern for Draco splitting his soul, Snape asks about his own soul.

Snape's actions toward his students are despicable, but I then find myself asking how I, as someone in their early 20s, would feel being forced into a career I didn't want, ask for, or was passionate about. I'd probably be an asshole too, anyone would. That doesn't excuse them though. That's where everyone can agree that he's a dumpster fire.

And in Snape's defense, it was never realistic to expect Voldemort to spare Harry. By asking Voldemort to spare Lily, Snape provided Lily the opportunity to sacrifice herself for her son because Voldemort asked her to step aside. The allowance of that by Voldemort because of Snape and Lily's sacrifice combined are what saved Harry, not just Lily alone.

Bellatrix's entire reason for despising Snape is because she believes that he just slithers out of his obligations, and in HBP, basically calls him a coward for not murdering, torturing, and duelling like the other Death Eaters. At the very least, Bellatrix strongly suggests that Snape basically never went along with that stuff. Even Crouch Jr implies that Snape was a coward and less faithful, and seemed to dislike him almost as much as he hated Lucius.

As a Death Eater, the worst he does is tell Voldemort the Prophecy which compared to the actions of other Death Eaters, is really tame. Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan, and Crouch Jr tortured the Longbottoms into insanity; Bellatrix later went onto kill Sirius and Tonks. Lucius had no qualms slipping Ginny the diary Horcrux with the desire to set the Basilisk on Hogwarts students. The Carrows tortured Hogwarts students and were worse than even Umbridge. Dolohov was in the group that killed Fabian and Gideon Prewett, almost killed Hermione in OotP, and he killed Lupin in DH.

I think the closest Snape gets to killing someone (aside from Dumbledore obviously) is when he planned to have Sirius get the Dementor's Kiss, but given that Sirius was believed to be a dark wizard who escaped Azkaban to kill Harry (even Dumbledore and Snape believed this), I don't even count that as a bad thing. Snape was wrong about Sirius, but so was literally everyone in PoA until the last minute.

Snape being a marked Death Eater doesn't make him special or of any importance, given Draco and Wormtail had the Dark Mark too. In fact, its heavily implied Snape was a low-ranking Death Eater during the First Wizarding War (given how little he actually did). He only rose highly in Voldemort's inner-circle once Lucius and Bellatrix failed in OotP, and even then its also suggested that Voldemort never actually trusted Snape whatsoever until he killed Dumbledore.

On another Snape-related note, what fascinates me most about the fanon regarding Snape and Lily is this MASSIVE misconsception that Snape didn't love Lily, but was apparently just obsessed with her. I think its very telling that in the books, the only character who believed Snape was Voldemort, the character who doesn't understand love at all. In Deathly Hallows, Voldemort basically makes the argument that Snape just wanted to fuck Lily, and didn't love her.

#+begin_quote
  He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him
#+end_quote

Dumbledore believed that Snape loved Lily, and evidently Harry believed the same thing. I'm pretty sure at least the Marauders (or at least James) suspected that Snape loved Lily, and it probably gave James an additional excuse to bully Snape. Meanwhile the only actual claim in the entire series that Snape was obsessed with Lily comes from Voldemort who not only incapable of understanding love, but was also completely wrong about a lot of things in canon.

** Some are probly using his awful childhood to project how damaged he is... but he had a /Choice/ in how his behavior and actions would be all through Hogwarts and especially as an adult.

I believe others are using the excellent acting of Alan Rickman and projecting some kind of decency based on that, because the movies never showed how nasty the character really was in canon.

Finally, JKR is/has a /really/ skewed view of human interaction and emotions, imho.

**I really wished JKR had killed off Snape rather than Sirius who had just as bad a childhood and adulthood (Azkaban) but was still in Harry's corner against some of the crap he had to deal with even from the 'light side" supposed adults. Sirius had many glaring flaws, but he loved Harry and looked after him as best as his Azkaban damaged mind and body allowed.

**IMHO only.

** Snape is a very complex character and I honestly think that anyone extremely for and against Snape hasn't really thought it through.

But I think that it's because of that that he's so popular. There are a lot of ways to interpret and/or to justify his actions. Asking Voldemort to spare Lily and not James and Harry could be seen as the desperate act of a young man trying not to loose his (former) friend. He hates James and most likely has never met Harry before, so he wouldn't think of them first.

But that's just one way to look at that. There's plenty more, which makes Snape intriguing.

I'm mostly speaking of my personal experience here, but I want to see and learn more about Snape because of what I said above. I also got annoyed from all the hate he was getting from Harry. It was really unreasonable at times, which led to me defending Snape.

I'm not a Snape Lover though, he's done some things that aren't morally acceptable in my opinion and he's a bad teacher.

I like to see him redeemed or redeeming himself in fanfiction because it's nice to read about a grown man getting his world view broken and rebuilt by a bunch of kids lol :)

** Well to be fair Voldemort was never going to spare Harry under any circumstance, what with the prophecy so I can understand Snape not asking that.

As for James I'm in to minds of this one hand he could have but the fact of matter is that he hated him and I can't honestly blame him on that.

This mostly due to jk's writing and show and tell, whenever we hear about him he's a stand up guy who grew up out of his bullying phase, however when we see him he hasn't.

And yeah Snape wasn't a saint back in school but ultimately James and co were worse imo for the fact there was four of them while Snape was mostly on his own.

Now I don't know if James stopped targeting Snape after lolly broke it off with Snape but honestly I don't what's worse if he did or didn't.

So taking all that into to account while I can understand why he didn't ask James to be spared it's still a dickish thing to do

Also Alan rickman and people love redemption characters

** This is probably a /really/ unpopular opinion, but I honestly don't think that Snape is a remotely complicated character: he's a villain who happens to be on the heroes' side of a morally black and white conflict by coincidence. He was a bitter, abusive scumbag right up until he died, and the only reason he opposed Voldemort was because he was emotionally blackmailed into it by a man with a passing familiarity with the concept of basic human decency.

TL;DR there's a massive gap between the character Rowling wrote and the one she thought she was writing.

** I think his obsession with Lily was creepy af and his hostility against Harry leaves me with a bad vibe of "if I can't have her, nobody can have her".

Because if you really love someone, you want this person to be happy. And if this person our happy with someone else then move on! I think this was quite a "Nice Guy" behavior that he showed.

And bullying someone because you are bullied is nothing a good person would do, especially if he concentrates his ire on the weakest. It shows lack and /or weakness of character. He isn't a kid or a teen that lashes out - he is a grown ass man and should know better.

But I think in the last book he slowly began to redeem himself. He died before he really changed and I think this is the character arc that many keep in mind. A glimpse of what could be.

** a lot of fanfic is wish fulfillment.

-people who've been bullied and ostracized might like villain characters because the villain is also hated, though for a different reason

-if something Bad happens to a character in canon, a fan might sympathize and enjoy narratives constructed around making it clear the Bad thing is undeserved

-people might share a trait or background with a character, and therefore sympathize

-people who like the actor who played a character and therefore want to like the character themself

-people who were once awful to others and became better people, or who are actively trying to better themselves, might prefer stories where that happens

-some people see the best in others. i don't really get it, but i think it extends to fiction as well.

-it can be fun to change characters completely

-we don't know the full story of every character, and expanding on it is fun.

personally:

as soon as the most popular Sorting Hat quizzes, and eventually the official Pottermore quiz came out, about a quarter of the fandom found out they were only represented by the Literal Worst characters. fanfic is a place to make those characters Better, or at least to focus on the reasons for that behavior.

i'm not saying i agree with all of the listed reasons in the case of Snape specifically, but it makes sense that some people want to write him as a sympathetic character. and i'm gonna read it if the writing's good.

** tl;dr - Snape's character represents what it means to be a human. Where life is not just happy rainbows but also not a desolate place full of hatred. Snape embodies the gray area that humanity resides in, and the imperfectness that makes us human.

--------------

Multiple parallels can be drawn between Voldemort and Harry, obviously due to the prophecy and Voldemort's actions that led to his first downfall. The two of them lived very different lives, but one could argue that that was due to their place in the age-old light vs dark war.

Voldemort chose the dark from a young age, always pursuing to push himself above and beyond what was expected whatever the cost may be. He deemed himself 'special', and carried this mindset throughout his life.

Harry's upbringing around the Dursleys hammered down on his self-esteem and he deemed himself as a nobody up until his introduction to the wizarding world. Harry was just happy to know that he was viewed as a person after years of being called a 'freak'. Harry never made any attempt to make himself stand out and always downplayed his achievements, which is ultimately the reason why he chose the light.

If the situation was swapped, and Harry deemed himself above everyone, then he could've easily become the next Dark Lord. The same can be said for Voldemort. If Voldemort learn a little bit of humility, he might've been the next Dumbledore, who knows.

Snape fits into the parallel lines by taking from both sides. As with Tom and Harry, Snape is a half-blood, whose childhood was severely subpar. Snape attained the wits and ambition of Voldemort, which put him into Slytherin, but also the yearning for companionship from Harry. Both sides are evident in Snape's life. i.e. Snape was a prodigious potion-maker and knew plenty of curses and hexes during his tenure at Hogwarts, but was also known to be very close to Lily Evans, whomst was the first person to show Severus any form of kindness.

Ultimately, Severus chose the darker side of himself, and joined the group of would-be Death Eaters that were his 'friends'.

As much as the seven books of Harry Potter were about Harry and Voldemort, nobody knew the impact Snape had on the plot, until his dying breath. Severus' life story has been a never-ending tragedy, full of regret and pain.

Severus spent the years following Voldemort's first downfall repenting, trying to find ways to cope with the lost of his first, and only love. He knows that he ultimately caused her death, but Dumbledore convinced him to then protect and care for Harry, as Lily would've wanted him to do, which he did until he was murdered. Without Snape, Voldemort wouldn't have been vanquished both times, no matter how malicious his actions were. He was a flawed character who played both sides, who never found lasting happiness, and a character who gave everything to repent for his mistakes, and came away with nothing but pain until the end.

And that's why people defend him. Snape's character resembles the human life more than any other character. The ups and downs, the lifelong regrets, the foolish mistakes that shaped him as a person, of love found, and love lost,

Snape's life story and emotions stand out in a world full of black-and-white characters in a children's fantasy novel. The older readers can easily empathize with Snape and the younger readers will learn just how much he gave to repent, and why his character was always so bitter, and so hateful, much like I did when I finished reading the books.

The same is true for many of JKRs characters: You have to evaluate most characters' actions through heavily tinted glasses - the tint being who they are supposed to be in the overarching narrative. For example: "Well, we all know that Dumbledore is supposed to be the wise old wizard, therefore his behavior can't possibly be moronic, there must be some convoluted explanation for his stupid actions!"
