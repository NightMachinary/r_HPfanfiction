** Hufflepuff Harry. Or at least a fic where the Hat give a logical explanation for why Hufflepuff isn't good for Harry. I mean each time I read this: "You're very loyal but only to your friends."

I immediately stop reading when I see this because it means that the author is stupid and doesn't understand that Hufflepuffs aren't ready to everyone! Sorry for the rant. I hate authors who do this.

*** I wish someone would write a Hufflepuff Harry that makes the house have a bit more bite than it does right now. Hufflepuff is always portrayed as the â€˜leftover' house. I think fierce loyalty would make them adamant they stick together, learn together to be the best they can be, but also a darker component of defending each other in whatever ways necessary.

Not saying they can't be amicable and all that but maybe a bit more guarded and stronger.

***** I remember...reading? hearing about? a fic where Harry kept reliving his life, tried changing things up, and whenever he got sorted into Hufflepuff he ended up having basically a personal army of Hufflepuffs.

Unfortunately it's been so long I can't remember the name or any other details. Just that one gag of Hufflepuff being the house to give him an army. /Consistently./

** Regarding polyamory: it's /very/ rare for people to be in a happy threesome. It's more likely to be a foursome, where two couples occasionally do things together. I'd like to see the latter case instead of Harry/multi.

Harry/anyone who isn't Ginny, but Ginny isn't bashed. Maybe she could be with Neville instead? I think I've seen that before. Besides, it's not like we know anything about Neville/Hannah

Tonks/Charlie, but I also like the idea of Teddy Lupin, so maybe a post-war fic where Tonks survives but Lupin doesn't

Two couples would be more realistic, but I honestly don't find any of the guys even remotely close to Harry's age interesting (and that's just from a character standpoint, I'm not even considering attraction here). The closest one would be Ted Tonks, followed by Grindelwald, and there's no way either of those would work outside of crack. I'd take one of the name only characters, but honestly, who would write a Harry/Ginny/Wayne Hopkins/Hermione fic?

Hell, I wouldn't mind Harry/his OC sister/Morag McDougal/Terry Boot for what it's worth, but practically any Slytherin has Death Eater ties and the only two cases of Slytherins doing something decent are Andromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy, even though Narcissa was just acting out of self/family interest.

And most stories with Slytherin characters have subtones I don't particularly like (Slytherin is best house, the Death Eaters had a point, the Muggleborns are ignorant idiots, pureblood culture is the best, that kind of stuff).

*** The problem here is that he really isn't in a position to do much. With even the Muggles on his tail, the only way I see for him to really do much is going down the "Ancient and Noble House of Black" route, and that's a dark path.

He could do smaller things, like being a better penpal for Harry, but between being wanted for murder, the psychological damage from the war and the number the dementors did on him, it's really difficult to come up with something believable. I toyed around with that premise for some time but settled on Sirius getting Andromeda to take care of Harry while he spends the next year getting the psychological and physical damage from Azkaban fixed. I couldn't really figure out how to explain y his presence.

Harry only really sees Sirius a bare handful of times. He could be anywhere, doing practically anything between those times. He must have had adventures getting from Azkaban to Privet Drive, yet I don't think I've ever seen a story about it. And the house at Grimmauld Place is another massively underused resource; anything could happen in there. I think there is a huge amount of potential. I could easily spend the rest of my life writing stories about those things but unfortunately there are too many other things I have to do first. I'd love to come back to it one day. Perhaps I will.

You don't 'run into' them unless there is a plot to start with. And a premise is not a plot. I have always thought there is a rich vein of material to be mined in Sirius's story and in Grimmauld Place. It fascinated me enough to come to fanfiction looking for it in the first place.

********* I'm not a particular fan of the canon plot, especially the way it played out. I mean, between Hermione, who had no issues leading Umbridge in a creature gang rape (or to become a victim of wreck it Ralph) and Dobby with his "not kill, only seriously injure" attitude, someone should have dealt with Umbridge two weeks into her torturous detentions.

Harry/Cho for example could have been a great hurt/comfort relationship if someone would have explained Harry the basics of dealing with women or even a little wingman-ing from Hermione. And Sirius Black, who went through hell and back, and, supposedly, was quite a womaniser (a decent looking rebellious guy would get a lot of action in a de facto unsupervised environment), would be perfectly suited for that briefing. Harry helps Cho over the death of Cedric while she helps him with some of his demons.

But yeah, coming up with canon compliant plots where Sirius plays a significant role is difficult. The best I can come up with is Sirius getting pissed in Vegas and accidentally pushing the commander of an missile base in front of a truck. The investigation then reveals that the General had turned traitor and was in the process of selling nukes to a Middle Eastern government.

Sirius has to stay in Grimmauld Place, but he doesn't have to /just/ stay in Grimmauld Place.

Same for the room of requirement, it's supposedly one of a kind. Sure, you could have some fun with space expansion, but it is no proper holodeck (you can't replicate people as far as we know).
