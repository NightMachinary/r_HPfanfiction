Hello fellow fanfiction writers and readers.

I have a bit of a problem. You see, I am toying with a large amount of ideas for my various fanfiction projects, and I have been working on one fanfiction in particular.

Now my problem is, that I am in the need of a good main plot. I have a lot of good plot devises, sub-plots, character ideas and advancements but I feel a need to bind it under a main plot. Mostly people use Voldemort as the guy behind the scenes pulling the strings, but what if his disappearance on Halloween 1981 was actually the true end of Voldemort.

Sure the bigotry remains, and the purebloods rally to remain in power, but what happens after that? Is there new dark forces moving in? Any game of politics is difficult for a fanfiction in Hogwarts-era, because it would require Harry to deal with both that and school. So, do any of you have any ideas of a man working in the shadows, who perhaps on a yearly basis challenges Harry Potter? I will continue my brainstorming, but I would love to hear your ideas.

Also, on another note, where would I be able to sit down of a forum and/or chat and discuss various ideas for my story?


** Why not use Grindelwald?

A few former Death Eaters break him out. Disgusted by their simple prejudices and lack of vision, he kills them all with his Dumbledore-level skill, and heads for Britain. He feels remorse for the atrocities he committed during his younger years, but he still thirsts for power. He still wishes to see himself ruling over a wizarding world that is not hidden from the muggles, but dominating them.

Could lead to some interesting machinations / power plays.

P.S. You might head to DLP or MuggleNet for story advice.

** If you're gonna have Voldemort die, there is a whole hell of a lot that's going to change. Harry won't be raised by the Dursleys. He'll grow up knowing that he's a wizard. He'll know his story, and he'll be aware of his own celebrity. His scar will be different (depending on how you interpret canon -- he'll either have no scar, or a faded scar) and he won't be a Parselmouth anymore.

You'll have to explain the backstory before you can come up with a new antagonist. If Voldemort died on Halloween, does that mean that there were no Horcruxes? If there never were any Horcruxes made to begin with, that means Voldemort's body and soul were intact. Perhaps he had a family? Maybe even children? Or, if there /were/ Horcruxes made and then destroyed, perhaps the person who destroyed them will play a role. You'll also have to explain how the Prophecy fits in. If there was a Prophecy, was it the same as in canon or was it different? In the absence of a Prophecy, you'll have to explain why Voldemort targeted infant Harry.

Even if you explain all of that away with "everything is exactly as in canon except for this one thing -- don't think about it too much!" (and that's definitely an option!) you'll still have to deal with one question: /Why/ would Harry Potter be encountering this new antagonist?

Why is this new person going after a schoolboy? Or, alternatively, is Harry the one seeking out the antagonist? If he is, why? If it is still the antagonist seeking Harry, what is their motivation? Is it revenge in Voldemort's name, and if so, are they a former Death Eater? Is it because they see Harry as a threat to be neutralized as soon as possible? Are they trying to recruit Harry into their ranks? Have they been after Harry all of his life, or does his entering school trigger the confrontations? Why are they going after Harry while he's at Hogwarts? Why can't they wait until he graduates?

If you can come up with some answers to those questions, then the antagonist will slowly become more defined. Extrapolate on the world you create and see what kind of antagonist would naturally evolve in that setting. For instance, if Voldemort is found dead, then the Longbottoms wouldn't be tortured for information on his whereabouts. If Bellatrix, Crouch Jr., and the Lestrange brothers never torture the Longbottoms, that could mean that they escape imprisonment, flee England, meet a new evil dude while abroad, and persuade him to target Harry Potter for one reason or another. There are so many repercussions of having Voldemort dead that if you just pick a consequence (like the Longbottoms being spared, or the Sorcerer's Stone never being destroyed, or the curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position being broken...) then you can follow it wherever it may lead and decide whether a new villain can spawn from that thread. By working this way, you can slowly reveal to your readers just why everything is happening, and the story you tell will be much more in-depth than "Harry is basically just a magnet for evil dark lords."

*** I realize all this and I have been working with that in mind. I would like to point you to [Lords of Magic]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I]]) by Taure if you want to see it in action. I am very sorry to say it is on hiatus. It is one of the few fanfics that deal with an AU world.

*** I think that the best way to get rid of Volde permanently without caring about the 'cruxes is saying that the horcruxes don't actually work. I mean, they were invented long ago (and they were relatively common knowledge - a potions teacher on the good side knows about them), why don't we have ancient evil wizards who made horcruxes ruling the world?

What about antagonist in form of bigoted pureblood society? Or maybe Lucius Malfoy in particular? He is already well established as pulling the strings and is far more interesting than I-am-so-unoriginal-that-I-am-unable-to-even-find-interesting-torture-and-hiding-places-of-my-horcruxes-are-hilariously-obvious. With Lucius you avoid problems caused by introducing OC and have character that may be used to spawn any type of plots without going OOC.

It also gives possibility of Dumbledore as "muggle-loving fool" rather than "this guy responsible for all problems in Harry's life".

#+end_quote

Maybe in reverse of typical "UK is the only place in magical world with bigotry, all other countries are perfect" magical Britain is OK compared to other countries (Durmstrang does not admit Muggle-borns, etc) and problems are in the form of Umbridge imposed by ICW to uphold ancient and proper traditions? (see [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/19/Harry-Potter-The-Forgotten-Brother]] for example of situation like this)

What about either skipping first few years or declaring that in your fic Hogwarts starts for 15 years old to avoid "children in my story are adults" problem? Or is the problem a bit different?

*** I do like the idea of a Lucius Malfoy type character being the main antagonist, and the more I think about it the more I want see the benefits in doing so. But in that case we are dealing with a very political opponent, which leaves the problem I brought up about him being in school.

I just don´t see a boy/teenager being able to outmaneuver an old fox who's been in the business for years and years, and who has everyone in his pocket.

/How would you say he could make problems for young Harry, and how would young Harry fight it?/

This is a very good idea. Have you seen this being implemented anywhere or is it just something you came up with?

Obviously apart from here.

Something in the style "somebody, completely not me caused disaster in the school therefore Dumbledore is incompetent and should be replaced by proper and upstanding pureblood" - like it happened in the second book. Or maybe some ridiculous plot started by Draco, inspired by his father.

My idea, but I recently encountered it in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]] (deep AU, action starts in the third year what makes it easier to ignore that everybody behaves like adult).

**** Honesty it's really easy to put someoe like Malfoy as the antagonist behind the antagonist. Have him scheme towards an end benefitial to him, while applying money, political pressure and the ocassional "accidental" death. Assuming that Harry is the simbol he's painted as, he would be a very valuable piece to try to draw to the antagonists side and if that fails to subtly manipulate him in a place where he would help. And Harry being a kid and not really having the understanding for politics can have the ocasional small win while still moving the antagonist's plot. I'm assuming you can go from there.

** I think you already have a great example of this in OotP.... Fudge is fighting to remain in control no matter the consequences. And he knows that to change a culture, you start with the education system and curriculum. In fact, that's not the only time Fudge makes Harry's life horrible. Why not use Fudge? You could make him less bumbling than he is in canon.

** I've been thinking of a relatively similar story myself. Voldemort's Horcruxes don't work. I mean, they were invented long ago (and they were relatively common knowledge - a potions teacher on the good side knows about them), why don't we have ancient evil wizards who made horcruxes ruling the world? So, Horcruxes just don't work. However, Dumbledore thinks that Voldemort actually did come back to life. Dumbledore is the antagonist while still being on the good side. He wants to prepare Harry in his normal, semi-abusive way, which isn't needed at all.

Alternatively, Dumbledore is evil. That's a fairly overused plot though, so if you go with that, it won't be original.

** Well - going from the Pottermore stuff, some of Voldemort's followers viewed Harry as a potential new Dark Lord.

With that in mind - how about Lucius Malfoy and a league of former Death Eaters, is attempting to push Harry towards using Dark Magic - the yearly challenge is arranged by him to force Harry into darker and darker actions to protect him and his friends.

As a villian, Lucius also has to try to alienate Hermione from Harry - potentially allowing her to take more of Ron's part later in the story - and using his political influence to pass anti-Muggleborn laws, without alienating Harry as a potential future ally.

** Apart from Lucius Malfoy there aren't very many other adult characters who are main character-type antagonists without inventing your own. The only other one I can think of is a bat-shit crazy Bellatrix Lestrange trying to get some sort of revenge or continue on with the Voldemort-type idealism.

EDIT: Or Dumbledore. I don't know what your fic is about but if Dumbledore turned bad (like evil) somehow that could be really bad because he could be deceptive and he is so powerful.
