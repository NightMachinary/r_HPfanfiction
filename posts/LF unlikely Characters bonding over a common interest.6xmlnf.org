Something like Harry and Cedric becoming friends earlier because they love painging or Draco and Neville enjoying together a good chess game or Snape and Bellatrix tolerating each other because they both like gourmet food, silly things like these.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) Snape and Sirius bond over saving Harry (Harriet in this fic). This includes going behind Dumbledore's back to use effective and fast dark magic rituals to find her when she was kidnapped. (Also, I know the fic mentions future Snape/Harry pairing, but it's totally worth reading and is entirely gen with no romance at all at the moment.)

Also, I do remember a fic where Snape and Ron played chess together, but I can't really recall which fic it was. It may have been linkao3(a year like none other)

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
