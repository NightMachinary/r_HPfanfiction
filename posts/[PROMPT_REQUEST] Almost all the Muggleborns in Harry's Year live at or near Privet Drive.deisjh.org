  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

You know what? that is not an uncommon opinion over on the Harmony subreddit. People there think they would be good together, but think that authors overcompensate trying to sell the relationship. That they would be happy together, but not this perfect thing that most modern fanfic authors write it as.

***** I mean if there was attraction on Harry's part in the books, they'd be functional together.

I think the way the book handled romance (not the characterization of Ginny) between Harry and Ginny (being a very low-key sideplot in book 6) was a great way to handle it.

I mean, there was one or two times... (Yule ball, Hermione telling Harry to call her ugly, he refuses.)

--------------

But really that is why the "Harry realises that Hermione is a girl" and "Harry realises how important Hermione is to him" tropes exist. Characters throughout the series constantly think they are together (Krum, Skeater, Molly) or close enough to think that they might become attached (Ron for example). Hermione seems to carry a torch for Harry,

#+begin_quote
  "Bye, Harry!" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.

  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.”
#+end_quote

So the last piece of the ship that needs to be installed before it can leave dry-dock is Harry realising that he likes her enough to overcome her disadvantages (or just as often in fanfic, realise that she resembles Emma Watson...), and thus a trope is born.

If Harry does really become attracted to her, well it could work.

Please no Emma Watson. I admit she's moderately attractive, but her attitude in the later movies was blegh.

Haven't seen the later movies myself, but I agree for the most part. Emma Watson is not Hermione.

Me and a friend play a game every time we see a piece of merchandise starring Hermione, Movie or book. "This lego minifigure?" "book." "that other one?" "movie." "What about this figurine?" "Why is her Hair ORANGE?" and so on.

********* I saw an interesting one about a fanon Weasley curse preventing birth control and making the spouse a redhead.

I thought it was funny and a lot less disturbing than 2 people with red hair in a 10000 person population (some of which would probably be technically counted as immigrants) marrying.

****** I never got the impression Harry found her annoying. If anything, she was closer to Harry than Ron was, especially as she never outright betrayed Harry like Ron does (multiple times). Sure, he got mad at her for things, but those situations were all reasonable for him to be mad at her for, and for her to have done them to protect or help her friend, and they ALWAYS worked it out.

******* Ron doesn't really betray Harry. They had a spat at 14. The horcrux was the main cause of leaving in book 7 and as you see, when he took it off and left, immediately tried coming back. Hermione was a steadfast best friend, but she was not his absolute best friend.

******** I'd say 4th year was way more than a spat. I never liked Ron as a character, and I haven't even read the 7th book (the 6th book was bad enough shit, and the beginning of the 7th made me almost quit the entire series, and certainly made me put the book down with no intention of ever finishing it), so I wasn't really counting that one, though I'm aware of it aside from the details. Honestly, aside from Ginny and the twins I never liked the Weasleys, and I especially disliked Ron's characterization. To me, Ron will always be a bad character, regardless of how he was meant to come across as.
