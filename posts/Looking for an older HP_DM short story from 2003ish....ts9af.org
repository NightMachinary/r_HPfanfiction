There was a certain short story that involved the line "if one raindrop means I love you, then it will rain forever." It starts off with Harry Potter hated the rain... I guess this is a pretty vague and unhelpful description, but it's all I can remember about it other than it being very sweet, and from around 2003. Thanks!
