How it is, is up to you. Is he a prisoner and have no control over Harry? Is he able to communicate to Harry? It could be interesting because once he goes back in time and this happens, his past self is still trying to kill Harry,while meanwhile this Voldemort is trapped inside Harry.


** I like to imagine he is a voice in harry's head.

but since its voldemort and he has a massive ego, harry has to do well as voldemort will not allow his host to do poorly

Brain voldemort 'Damn it harry are you paying attention in class we only go a A- if you listened to me we would have gotten an A+'

over the years voldemort slowly turns into a snarky monoluge in the back of harrys head that gives advice. including dating.

'kill cedric, take the cho women as yours,'

#+begin_quote
  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).
