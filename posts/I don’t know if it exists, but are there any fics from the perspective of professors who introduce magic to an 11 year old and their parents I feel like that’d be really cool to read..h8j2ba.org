#+TITLE: I don’t know if it exists, but are there any fics from the perspective of professors who introduce magic to an 11 year old and their parents? I feel like that’d be really cool to read.

** Just imagining Flitwick practicing neat shit to show the muggles, claiming dibs on as many kids as he can, getting on his finest robes for the occasion, just super pumped to get to share magic with the next generation.

** The closest thing I know is the second chapter of Methods of Rationality. It has McGonagall showing magic to Harry and his foster parents.

Big Things in Small Packages

corvusdraconis, Dragon_and_the_Rose

Summary:

[HG/SS] AU/Crack: Severus Snape has to deliver the acceptance letter to the Granger home thanks to Minerva being sick with the cat flu. He has no idea how this one event will change his life forever. SSHG

​

My notes: Everything corvusdraconis does is major crack and absolutely delightful. So this story is probably not precisely what you are looking for. It is still delightful. I prefer reading this on AO3 but corvusdraconis has stuff on ff dot net that isn't on AO3, so if you do a deep read on them, check both.

And btw, much of their stuff is marked incomplete, but it is all functionally complete; they just reserve the right to add to it if they get inspired.

*** I'm also a huge fan of corvusdraconis. I'm working my way thru her canon and my heart is major warmed. Know any other authors who write in her kind of style? (fun and heartwarming)
