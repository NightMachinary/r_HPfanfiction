I'm looking for a fic where Harry gets transported to another universe where his parents are alive. I think he is in his 7th year. He's engaged to Daphne, she tricks him into dueling Nott(i think) to get Tracey out of her contract. I think he's heir to another house - Grey. So he is also lord grey. Oh yeah, Dumbledore dies or gets knocked out and he fights Riddle. i think Susan likes him too. I'm almost certain I'm not thinking of multiple fics. Thanks for the help/

EDIT: Sorry about the remind, but this seems really interesting.
