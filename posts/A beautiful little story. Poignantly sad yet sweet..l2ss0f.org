If you liked the movie Up, you might like this. Read this and tell me you didn't get a little emotional...Maybe it's just me, but witnessing the passage of time makes me more emotional than actual tragedy.

Summary: 'Cottage For Sale' said the wooden sign hammered into the lawn at the front of the property, just behind the stone-brick wall and to the left of the creaky wrought iron gate.

*** Yeah, it's more terrifying to me than dying randomly or something. Maybe bc it's inevitable. I don't really see many fics that show it, but when they do it hits home a little too closely.

** It's not sad. This is the happy ending. Or at least as happy as anyone ever gets. To the extent that it's sad it's because life always ends, but this is a Harry who gets his wish as much as one can possibly get it.

*** You are right in that this is about as happy as it gets, with a fulfilling life and no regrets. But I always get sentimental and sad seeing time pass and a life come to an end. Even if it was the happiest life one could have had. So it's a mixture of feelings for me.

**** Perhaps someday people will cure aging; it's probably not that far off. That will be a nice thing; there's no joy or beauty in senility or arthritis or wrinkles or osteoporosis. Even if we do fix it, though, eventually you'll have an accident, or at very very unlikely best, the heat death of the universe will get you. Would five thousand years or five million be more fun? Sure, but that's not forever either. Even our planet will someday be forgotten, and if you wait long enough, all trace of our species and its works will vanish without a trace.

Every story ends. You have to find your own meaning. That's fine though. The Harry in this story gets everything he could ask for. This is what ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù actually means. It's a fine ending. Most of us are unwilling to stare it in the face, but it's better to face it without horror.

** Sorry, while I'm one who often gets attacked by feels from stories, this one didn't do it for me. I have to be immersed in the story to get the feels, and I kept getting thrown out of it.

I lost my suspension of disbelief almost immediately, with the author's claim that the people going deaf could hear the high-pitched squeal of the gate better than a knock on the door. People lose the higher pitches FIRST when losing their hearing, not last.

Then I got distracted by the vinewood end table, and a third time by the vinewood wardrobe. You see, I'd never considered before that that vine is not a specific wood. That's like saying everybody else's wands are made of tree. I even stopped in the middle of reading the story to make a post about that.

And the final thing that kept me from connecting to the story was the confusion at the end. Clearly Hermione has passed on, yet Harry is thinking of the Elder Wand being buried with himself. Is he dying? I thought the story was going to say that he was going to bury it with Hermione, although indications are that she's been gone for a while, which of course nobody would ever go looking for it there. Where is he going to keep it until his death, and how will he then make sure it's buried with him? That part made no sense.

So no, I did not get attacked by the feels.

*** Hey, author here!

Your first point is valid and something I didn't think about until after I'd posted it, by which time I decided that liked the imagery more than I thought being technically correct was important.

The second point is actually something I'd debated changing but ultimately decided that if vine wands are a thing then there must be something else there besides normal vines, else Hermione's wand would be floppy! I put it away in my head that maybe there's a species of magical vine that grows like a tree rather than a crawler.

Your third point is something that I left ambiguous because I didn't think the particulars were too important to the point of the story, which was mostly reminiscence. Selling the house meant that it'd be safer elsewhere so it was time to find a new home.

Thanks for reading either way though, everybody responds to fics differently I think :)

**** Thanks for the clarifications. I didn't mean to imply that I didn't enjoy the story, because I did. Just that it didn't "grab" my senses because the little niggling details kept distracting me.

Check one of the earlier resposes for a link to english vine. It shows quite thick vines melded to a thick tree trunk. That certainly would be wood-like enough to be a wand. My epiphany was that "vine" could be any number of things. When we hear about somebody's wand, we hear yew, walnut, etc. (although "pine" is also non-specific, now that I think about it). It was your references to furniture made of vine that made me realize that we didn't know what KIND of vine. I actually liked the imagery of them having furniture that matched their wands' woods.

I'm still curious how Harry intends to make sure the Elder wand is buried with him. With Hermione gone, I guess he'll have to take somebody into his confidence; presumably whomever he thinks will be the one planning his funeral (whenever that may be). Oldest child, maybe?

***** I like to think that he asked their eldest child to make sure it got buried with him, or maybe one of the DA members if he's not the last one. Glad you did enjoy it, but it wouldn't have been a problem if not :) Everybody has their own tastes and things that turn them off stories

****** I was thinking the DA members would be problematic because they're all the same general age as he is --- there's something like a 50/50 chance that the person he picked would die before he did, and then he'd have to tell somebody ELSE. While nothing in life is guaranteed, there is a higher chance that his son would outlive him than any of his contemporaries.

*** Well, now you're having /me/ google vinewood wardrobe lol....

Hmm, idk I think that Harry is near death too or at least knows that he will be dying soon because the cottage is finally on sale. He's kept the cottage for so long, sort of guarding it and the memories associated with it while he still could and selling it is a move he makes when he's no longer able to do so. I think that's pretty much confirmed by the last sentence:

#+begin_quote
  Slowly making his way down the path, past the overgrown lawn and the weeds and the dead plants, and past the sign beside the gate which told the end of Harry Potter's story for all to see.
#+end_quote

The end of his story/life.

Just my interpretation, I could be wrong.
