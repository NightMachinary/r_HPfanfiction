Hello, today I published the first chapter of my very first fanfic and I would like to know if it is decent enough to work on further. The first chapter has only 1.2k words so it is not much time so if you want plz read and tell me here if I should work on it further. Thanks

** It's too early to say anything about the plot, but to be honest: Your writing / prose isn't great.

If you use more than one exclamation-mark per chapter - especially outside of speech - you are doing something wrong. The story sounds like a dog when its owner comes home: Overly excited.

You have speech that you don't put in quotation marks, which is simply wrong. Something you probably would have fixed if you had read your story a few times before submitting it.

Your grammar is often wrong in other ways (He +buyed+ bought a cauldron) - some of them would be told by any decent text processor.

The language you use in general is extremely informal (school stuff vs. school supplies).

I recommend you read the chapater again and again with a very critical eye, and try to fix it. Seriously, do that 4-5 times - at least!

Try to think about every sentence: What does it achieve? What will the reader gain by reading it? How does it relate to the sentence before and after?

If you read through the original HP series you will find that almost every sentence has a purpose and is written to fulfill it.

Your writing at points feels like the opposite, like verbal vomit.

In summary, you need to practice writng and restraining yourself while doing so. Try to fix this chapter a few more times, and then it might get good, because quite honestly: At the moment it isn't.

This has not much to so with talent, but with practice and patience - if you get both, you will get better.

Edit: And I know that you're not a native speaker, but neither am I. :)\\
For most of the points I made it doesn't really matter.

So a large majority of books ever written in the English language are doing something wrong, then?

**** I don't know, in my experience there are even less in books, but it might just be the kind of books I read.

#+begin_quote
  In his book 10 Rules of Writing, Elmore Leonard offered a rule about exclamation points. He stated, “You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.” Leonard was prolific. He wrote more than 40 novels in his career, totaling 3.4 million words
#+end_quote

He - of course - didn't follow the rule himself - almost no author does. However, most authors don't use /that/ many - and I think you shouldn't either, especially like OP. Rowling does like one every 13 sentences.

Generally - like with all rules in writing - you can ignore this rule when it fits your text. But a lot of professional authors agree with me. Until you have your language under control it's easiest to avoid exclamation points alltogether.

Of course there are many people that disagree with this rule, but in most cases I think an average of one exclamation point per chapter is sufficient.

And as soon as OP gets better in writing he will - like all good writiers - starting to selectively ignore advice and experiment.

So yeah...

***** I think a middle ground is best. No more than a dozen or so perhaps, assuming the chapter isn't primarily focused on exciting or terrifying events, but no less than three or four.

A complete lack of exclamation points in a fictional story is highly unrealistic under most circumstances.

****** Yes. Also note that OP updated his story since I gave my feedback.

There are way fewer of them now.

** Also, to add on to what fflai said, your first chapter is three blocks of text and nothing more. To me, that's an immediate turn-off as my eyes tend to wander with such huge walls of words. Try to break it into small chunks.

In addition, your first chapter seems to do more "telling" instead of "showing." This disengages the reader completely as it sounds more like a lecture instead of getting lost in the magical world.

Again, like fflai said, EDIT, EDIT, EDIT!

Editing [of my own comment]: Your summary needs work. It doesn't really tell us anything and doesn't hook any potential readers into clicking your story. Think of a more creative summary to regale.

** Practice writing and revising more. It's extremely difficult for many people to read large walls of text with highly informal writing that is filled with a number of spelling errors that Microsoft Word oftentimes corrects automatically. In addition, make a captivating summary. Your summary needs to catch the interest of potential readers. A bland summary won't make readers want to read your story.

I see English isn't your native tongue. Perhaps use your revising as a way to help improve your English.
