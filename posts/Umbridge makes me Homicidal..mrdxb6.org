Anytime she's included in a story, especially when the students are being tortured with a blood quill, I lose my mind. It's always the same shit, no one complains even though it is obviously super illegal to do. Harry wants to 'tough it out so she doesn't win'.

That is the dumbest fucking excuse I have ever heard. It doesn't even fit harry's character. He acts, he doesn't often think through shit like this, but all of the sudden he has a grand fucking plan.

My solution for umbridge is simple. Just kill her. I am aware it isn't the most sane plan, and any character with a healthy moral code wouldn't just murder her, but she needs to die. I hate how she always gets her commupence some other way. I just want her to die. Why can't harry just walk into detention one night and just blow her head off an walk out.

It's not like those stupid fucking cat plates can snitch on him, he has detention alone anyways. There would be zero proof.

I hate her.


** I think the problem with killing Umbridge isn't so much a morality issue (I've seen worse in fanon) than it is the butterfly effect. Maybe the writers struggle to get the 'snowball' rolling once the canon divergences start happening, and killing Umbridge would have massive implications for sure.

Part of it could be due to writers wanting to stay comfortably within the range of canon. They can then focus on fluff, ships, characterisations, and so many other things without having to plan out a seriously divergent story.

I've also seen fics wherein the writer did try and follow through with the big changes (e.g., killing Umbridge) only to end up abandoning the story anyway. It could just be life, though, which is another reason why people might be struggling to truly diverge: they just don't have the time to thoroughly plan things out.

Just my opinion.

** Actually, Umbridge's Black Quill (which I'm not sure if it turned out to be quill/s/ later in the year in the books too) is not illegal because she's the one who invented it. As such, the Ministry doesn't know about them since she won't reveal her obviously sketchy quill for it to be registered for its legality. Also, lest we not forget that Umbridge had the express support of the Minister and as such had carte blanche when it came to undermining Harry and Dumbledore. The narrative made by the Prophet during the whole summer would also not help - to put it lightly - Harry's cause and credibility if it were uncovered and, say, taken to justice. Lastly, Umbridge had been able to get permission to publicly whip students (such as Fred and George) as discipline. So, I don't think getting rid of Umbridge, even with murder, would be feasible.

** Just a few things:

1. As said before, the "Blood Quills" are technically not illegal. It is only due to a technicality since it's an unique item created by Umbridge, but that's totally the kind of technicality she would use.
2. Umbridge is not stupid, and chose her targets. After spending being slandered for months by the medias (well the Daily Prophet but it's not like the Wizarding World as a lot of alternative), Harry has a credibility close to 0. Any complaint about the Blood Quills would have been treated as the plot of deranged liar to get some attention. The few other students who also been subjected to the Quill (such as Lee Jordan) are also probably the children of people "who don't matter", which means they could also be ignored. Pureblood with relations such as Susan Bones or Cormac Mc Laggen must have never been a detention with Umbridge, or then they did boring things like normal lines.
3. At this point in the story, the Ministry is litteraly there to get Harry, and they would jump on any opportunity to do this. Any serious incident (such as the murder of Umbridge) would see the arrival of an army of officiels, not there to find the culprit, but to somehow make Harry and/or Dumbledore responsible.

I agree that the character of Umbridge can be very annoying, but that's exactly how she was intended to be. And I prefer to see Harry struggle against her, rather than the plot going off the rail with something like "Harry was the last person who saw Umbridge alive, his wand used a spell that correspond to what killed her, but he said that he went to the Kitchen so it's not him, another mystery for the school".

But literally everyone at Hogwarts would vouch for Harry's alibi. It reminds me of Lindsey Graham's quote about Ted Cruz: "If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you‚Äù.

**** Except not everyone would vouch for Harry. A good part of the school either believed the lies about the Harry, or was still on the edge. But Harry violently murdering a Ministry official would probably be seen as Harry's finally snapping and push them on the other side. These people would either refuse to lie for Harry, or would break down against any "serious" questioning. And that's without mentioning all the people who would lie to put him into troubles (at least all the members of the Inquisitional Squad).

And that's without taking into account the fact that the Ministry could ignore the testimonies that's doesn't say what they want (like Fudge did in PoA), or that any testimonies may not be needed if there are enough evidences against Harry. Not to mention all the other ways the Ministry could use the situation even if they can't actually send him to Azkaban (declaring him a suspect and putting him in a cell while using the fact that he was arrested to defame him even more as an example).

There is a reason why McGonnagall told Harry to keep his head down in OotP, their hands are litteraly tied.

***** It's more that everyone would vouch for him because they hated Umbridge so much as opposed to being pro-Harry

Don't forget that McGonagall was helping Peeves destroy the school by the end

****** Even by the end of OotP, when most of the school was against Umbridge, she still had the support of some like the Inquisitional Squad. And it's not like Fudge wanted to listen to reason or something like that.

In the case of Umbridge's murder, if 100 students said "Harry didn't do it", and 1 student (let's say Draco) said "Harry did it", Fudge would choose to listen to that one student and have Harry arrested.

Also, most of the outside world didn't know about "Umbridge reign of terror", since she controled the mail, and only had the Daily Prophet (who would sing her praise) to learn about the inside of Hogwarts. And even if she was not a good teacher, I maintain that only a very small minority of students got to use the Blood Quill. So for most of the parents, Umbridge would have been murdered without any good reason.

** What makes you think the blood quill would be illegal? I mean, where I live, it's perfectly legal for teachers to hit students with wooden paddles. They'd probably use blood quills on students if they had them.

** Umbridge is an interesting character to me - not so much her personally, but seeing how she's by far the most hated character in the series. Despite being less terrible/evil than Voldemort, she's pretty obviously more reviled, and (though it's understandable) it is an interesting phenomenon.

*** That's because Umbridge is the kind of evil that is all too commonly encountered in the real world; while Voldemort is a rather over-the-top, Saturday Morning Cartoon kind of evil.

** I have my oc setting off charms that make her quills explode and her other means of torture are also targeted driving her a bit closer to unhinged as the year goes on until she's taken prisoner in the Forest.

But she eventually has to grovel for safe passage to a hidden island to avoid being killed in the DH year but eventually is killed in the third Wizarding War that comes up after the second ends.
