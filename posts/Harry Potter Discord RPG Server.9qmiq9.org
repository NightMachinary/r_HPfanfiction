This is a Hogwarts School of Magic Discord Server, everyone MUST be 18+ to play.

We are looking for people interested in play with us in a serious server, with lot of RPG in it. Warning, we have some NSFW channels.

We are open and accepting applications, but that doesn't mean we accept everyone. You must pass an interview with a member of the Teacher's Council to be accepted. We had problems in the past with people who came.. and didn't put any effort. We want everyone playing enjoying, so this time we are more strict.

** Game starts November 1st.

You are a new Student in Hogwarts, with an age of 13-15 years old, and you could choose between 2 Houses of the School (We want to keep it balanced, but also give choice).

We have a complete economic system that makes playing more interesting and rewarding... duels, bets, paying others to do you favors... All that system is integrated in the RPG game.

So... if you want to joins please come and take a look here:

** Can you give more description as to how the game is played and about the server in general? What systems are there? Are there classes? How active on average does someone need to be? What are the rules and what is and is not allowed? Is there an overarching plot or just random rp between members? Are there events?

Just some more info would be helpful I think in getting people to want to check it out or click the link.

*** Hi, sure

The game is played in Discord, in channels that are places. In several scenes at a time.

There are classes, and we will have quidditch matches too.

The House system is also important, beacuse the more points you get for your House... the more things you can buy, like skill improvements, wands, brooms, cauldrons...

We usually play daily, but people playing 3 or 4 times a week it's ok.

We didn't start yet... but i bet we will have quite active game. We had a server before, and it was played daily.

No overall plot, just a school year, but yes to events, like balls. And in the future... we probably will introduce some special stories. But ... not yet.

The links is this one:

Feel free to take a look
