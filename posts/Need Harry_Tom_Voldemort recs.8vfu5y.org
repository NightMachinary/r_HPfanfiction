So, I just read To the Waters and the Wild by paimpont on ff.net and it was AMAZING. I fell in love with it. But, it's incomplete and I don't think the author is going to finish it since the last time it was updated was 2013.

So, if you guys could rec me any fics like it, that would be awesome and I'd love you forever. Thanks! ðŸ˜Š.
