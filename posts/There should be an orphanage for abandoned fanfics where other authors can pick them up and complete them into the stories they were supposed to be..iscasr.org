** Abandoned fics shouldn't be adoptable by only one person. As hard as someone tries they just might nit have the same style or flair the original author had and for an epic fic to be adopted would be a noteworthy task only for them to ruin the fic would cause a lot of hate towards the new author. Maybe make abandoned fics a word prompt type option. After a year people get to pick and choose which is their favorite adoption.

*** I've seen something like that before!

Except it wasn't and abandoned fic, per se. The author had a note up that said they had run out of steam on a oneshot that they had meant to be something longer, but that people were free to write follow-up chapters if they wanted, so long as they messaged them. There was a list of like 2 or 3 other fics that had been inspired by the first one, and it was really interesting to see where people had taken the original author's ideas.

That kind of fic-ception is actually a surprisingly common occurrence in the /Star Trek/ fandoms where fans have created conlangs or biology manuals for the different alien species.

It would be really interesting to see an abandoned fic have several different continuations!

I feel horrible for my loss of interest in writing a story and universe that I still love dearly. there isnt a day that goes by that a small part of me wishes the muse would just return but it just wont. I spend more time writing and working on my professional content in theology and I love it truly, but I miss writing fanfic, my brain just wont do it anymore. I get bored when I try to write it and i feel horrible for that, I had a small number of readers who were following it religiously and I truly feel like I let them down in the worst way.

** Writing fanfic of a fanfic: fine.

Taking someone else's fanfic as your own: plagiarism.

If there's an abandoned fic that you wish was complete, you should write your own version of it, in your own words.

You should /not/ take their work, repost it as your own, and "finish" it (unless explicitly given permission). This is quite rightly against established fanfiction etiquette and will get you banned from most fanfiction websites.

Writing a fanfic of a fanfic is fine, but as an ethical matter, it should be clearly marked, e.g., "PoD from Chapter X of Fic Y" or even "Continuation of Fic Y from [current last chapter]."

Obviously, this gets awkward if the original fic has been deleted. Then, you're probably better off writing your own version.

I have a problem with the latter as well.

Imagine that during 2006, JK Rowling's incomplete draft of Deathly Hallows was leaked to the internet, prior to its publication in 2007.

Imagine you then wrote a story based off completing the story of the Deathly Hallows as it had been leaked, and that you put your version on the bookshelves for sale before JKR did.

Is this okay, in your view? Forget the fact that legally it would break copyright. Is it /ethical/ to take someone's incomplete story, then write an alternative version of it, beat the author to market and publish something which competes with the original author's story?

I would propose that all decent, honest people would say "no". That story is JK Rowling's to tell.

Does it become OK if a few years pass and JKR still hasn't published? Again I would say "no" - impatience does not entitle you to something that isn't yours. You're still beating the original author to market, meaning that you're supplanting their right to tell their story they way they wanted it to be told.

Even if you don't copy JKR's text and just pick up where the incomplete draft left off, even if you clearly say that the original story idea was JK Rowling's, your version is still on the shelves, competing with JKR's as-yet-unpublished version.

This is basically what a WIP fanfiction is. Authors are inviting readers into their creative process, allowing them to see a story as it is in the process of being written. In return they get feedback which hopefully improves the story. What readers are reading is an incomplete draft. If another person takes that incomplete draft and continues it, even if they do so with credit, what they have done is create a story which exists in competition with the original, beating the original author to market.

The difference between (i) writing a fanfic of a fanfic and (ii) completing someone else's story is the difference between (i) writing a post-DH story and (ii) completing JKR's unfinished DH draft and beating her to market.

***** I see writing a continuation more as writing a post-HBP fic before DH was published. No, it's not stepping on JKR's toes as regards the actual draft, but the story was /always/ meant to be all 7 books, and it was still unfinished.

It's not really going to compete with it, either. Fans who read and wrote fanfics still bought DH, and fans of an abandoned fic will still come back to it if and when it updates. Now, the continuation may get more exposure with /new/ readers. Because of this, I think the author has an ethical obligation to inform their readers if the original updates. The new author should also respect the original author's wishes if they want it taken down.

Also, the original question was about /abandoned/ fics. For a fic where the author has been totally radio silent--no update on any story, no profile updates, no social media posts (if applicable) for 2+ years, with few-to-no prospects for getting a response from them--I would say it's fair game.

Now, this can still get awkward if the original author ever comes back. In fact, I can only think of one story where I've seen a true continuation done at all successfully. That was /The Marriage Stone/, which had two different full-length continuations, the more recent of which ended messily, but that was a weird one because everyone thought the original author was /dead/. There's not much you can do about something like that.

But my counterexample is /Following the Phoenix/, which was technically a PoD fic for HPMOR, but it /felt/ like a continuation (I'd forgotten it wasn't) because it started 90% of the way through the then-published chapters and rapidly outpaced the original, which was only being updated slowly. Plus, it was by far the best spinoff of that story. Should that author have waited for the original to catch up?

My feeling is that as a courtesy, you should always /try/ to get in touch with the original author and should /definitely/ respect their wishes if they respond. But at the same time, if someone wrote a continuation of /Animagus at War/ right now (not copying my words, of course), I'd be a little annoyed they didn't consult me, but as soon as I post the next chapter, it would become "PoD from Chapter 28", and I'd regard it the same as any other spinoff. I can understand if you feel differently, though.

*** Most don't know what a DMCA is and how it can get them banned from their favorite fanfic site. I've written about a hundred of them over my time to get my fics taken down from various places. It not only gets their fics downed, but them banned and a nastygram from me.

Taking over someone's fic without permission is plagiarism and that gets you a ban hammer. If the author allows you to take it over, fine. Just make sure you get documentation to prove it.. If you take it without permission and an author's fans find it...woo Nellie, you are in for it! Not only do they tend to dogpile you, but they then find the author and then the real 'fun' begins.

General rule: don't steal fics, even if you just want to post the fic on a site the author doesn't want it on and you give credit. Definitely don't take over an 'abandoned' fic. You don't know if the author is still around. You do and your pen name will end up blasted all over the web as a plagiarist (depending on what you use as a pen name that can affect you IRL as well for years to come) and will prolly get the ban hammer dropped on you for it.

*** I agree. I'm kinda shocked you got downvoted. It's weird how people think just because it's fanfiction that they can steal work. Fanfic authors are still authors, and vast majority of these authors write fics for free for us readers. It's like if someone drew incomplete fanart and you just took it and drew over it.

I love this idea, but I could only get behind it if the original author of said abandon fics gives permission for it. I assumed that was a given, but based on people's seeming disagreement, apparently it's not... It would be cool if with this "orphanage" there would be a way for authors to place their own fic in there with the understanding anyone can then pick it up (and not, as some might think, just pick up a work they see is abandoned and assume the author won't respond to a message or is immediately okay with it).

[And on that note, I know some authors who have long hiatuses but don't intend to abandon a fic and don't like someone to continue it from the point it was left off. So it's always best not to assume on the author's behalf.]

**** Ultimately it stems from an attitude of entitlement. "It's okay to take people's stuff if I really want it."

The common argument in support of the entitlement attitude is something like "all fanfiction is plagiaristic in nature; we're all stealing from JKR".

But this is just a bad argument on many levels.

1. As a fanfiction writer, you should not be using JKR's words/adopting passages of the HP books as part of your stories. If your story covers a scene which occurred in canon, you should be putting it into your own words.

2. More broadly, fanfiction is not in competition with canon and therefore it has a different moral character. Posting a fanfiction does not reduce JKR's authority over the HP universe, her right to tell the "true" version of the HP story, or undermine her sales. Conversely, if you "continue" an abandoned fanfic, you /are/ taking away from the original writer: you're taking their views, favourites, reviews etc., and you're supplanting that author as the authoritative voice as to the "true" version of that story.

3. Fanfiction is a community which is characterised by solidarity and respect between its members. It is not a community of naked greed and entitlement, but rather a community where people act out of kindness and support for the writers who give their time and talent for free for the entertainment of all. The relationship between two fanfic writers is not the same as the relationship between one fanfic writer and JKR. Fanfic authors act with solidarity towards each other and this is principally reflected in the way they respect each others' wishes regarding their creative output. If an author is okay with you adopting their works, they will say so (see: Raining Ink).

***** I somewhat agreed with your original post but now I feel the need to speak.

While I'd argue not plagiaristic (the Tags would give credit I'd argue) fanfiction does violate copyright. This is why it's a debate and authors are allowed to go to a site like FanFiction.Net and tell them to take down everything relating to their IPs. JK Rowling likes fanfiction (as stated in interviews) and is one of the biggest supporters of it. Whereas an author like George RR Martin has said in interviews that he feels fanfiction should not be allowed to exist.

Now for your points.

1. I agree, you shouldn't be taking things word for word. However, just putting something in your own words doesn't solve copyright issues, and it's still the same work.

2. Two has two main points and I'll comment separately.

Fanfiction is a violation of copyright because it's close enough to be in competition with canon. Much closer than anything else. The reduction of value is why courts have ruled in favour of authors previously and why authors take issue with fanfiction. It desensitizes the audience to the brand because of exposure. Disney used a similar effect with the 7 year cycle of its movies on disc.

The only time someone supplants the author is if the author hands it over in form of saying they do. Also many abandoned fics I've come across are accompanied by an abandoned account. Nevertheless, the issue would be resolved by saying in the first chapter “this is continuation of x fanfic and assumes you've read up to chapter y” which is what should be done imo anyway.

1. I don't actually see how this helps you're point against the plagiarism argument. The main thing I disagree with here is that we treat each other differently than we treat JK Rowling. The main difference I see is that we say her books are established canon (followed by other things depending on personal opinions) and when we criticize her we call her out versus when we criticize fanfiction authors we call out things they do (literally anything done with Snape/Ron for example).

I think my opinion on the matter was made clear in the second half of 2. I think anyone should be able to continue anything they want, just do it in that manner. Then it's a continuation fanfic of a fanfic.

** I like the sentiment, but too often someone takes up someone else's fanfic with the author's permission & the promise to write further; upload all the >100k of the original author, post one, maybe 2 chapters of their own, and leave it to die as well. I get why fanfic authors get pissed of with that kind of nonsense and don't want that to happen to their baby.

Write a fanfic to someone's fanfic if you must, give them a heads up & tribute it to them. The way people write Mr Black fics to Rorschach's Blot's Make A Wish, or the way someone made a beautiful companion piece to Miranda Flairgold's A Second Chance At Life from Draco's pov after he's been captured by the vampire.

Ao3 even has a option to dedicate or gift fics to people if you wish to do so. But don't go and try to make someone else's baby your own when you probably don't belong to those 5% of fanfic authors that we all love and respect because they write that much better than we do.

That said; Steal concepts, pairings or settings if you must; that is how fanon is born or developed.

***** It was pretty on the nose by the point the story is abandoned. Especially with how those dragons are actually mentioned by name, and how Rakesh already does everything to piss those elves off.

I think that if Flairgold hadn't abandoned it, eventually there'd been an epic meltdown from the elves over his wandwood, where Namach would have to save his hide, probably by somehow bruteforcing Rakesh's first transformation into a Death dragon and then arguing that if he is a death dragon nobody can complain about it.

The groundwork for that part of the story was already there.

I am far more curious about that second world they had created. That is pretty much completely uncharted territory, and the closest anyone came in fanfic territory to that concept is Batsutousai's Xerosis where they plan to immigrate to the moon, but that is also an abandoned fic OTL

Edit: Namach would totally trick someone that doesn't know Rakesh is Harry Potter and would not be invested in his privacy into reading his mind, forcing Rakesh to try soul suicide like he tried earlier in the series; and when he succeeds in such suicide he'll come back as a death dragon.

That also would be a far better counterpart to his thunderbird animagus than his basilisk one, purely because the basilisk comes from his parseltongue ability.

*** just to clarify, on ao3 there is an option to gift a fic; but more pertinent to this discussion, there is also an ‘inspired by' option, and it will link your fic to the original fic that you were inspired by. This will appear in your author's note

***** nope. It's been there since I joined in 2017. Hang on I'll show you.

Ok so mind the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5163785][story]], it was written ages ago, but if you look down you'll see an ‘inspired by' link, and it shows the work title and author's name

Eta to say, apologies, apparently I joined in 2015 lmao

** This is a really good idea, but don't be too hard on the authors. My dad is an author and I've dabbled in writing fanfictions as well. Sometimes the spark is just gone and there's nothing you can do about it. The bird of inspiration is fickle my dad says.

** Absolutely! It'd be set up like ao3 so you can filter through fics easily and pick one you love! And also kinda like [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] but with parts of abandoned fics that you can read, adore, and then continue. I'd definitely feel less bad if there was a fic orphanage, because I can feel pretty awkward and guilty for just /asking/ if I can continue a discontinued or finished fic.

** I'd love to see Harry Potter and the Natural 20 written to completion. However, the “Rules” have been seriously updated since the fic was last updated. But DnD games die as well, so it fits the genre crossing.

** I suppose it depends on the story. If Prince of Slytherin got abandoned, I think I'd rather it just stay that way. For me there are alot of great fanfics where I have trouble choosing which one I prefer, then there's Prince of Slytherin, which is just so far ahead of the rest. I'd rather it stay uncompleted then see it tarnished if it gets picked up by someone who doesn't have the skill to do it justice, which would basically be anyone, since all the good writers are actually writing their own stories.

** I've got many of my own stories, mostly my older, less good works, that I'd be happy for people to take on myself if they wanted. If anyone does want any of them, feel free to PM if you want to know what my plan was for the story if you want to follow it, or go your own way and just link it when its published :)

*** It's incredibly annoying. I've started using the option on ao3 to always click the “completed works only” button in the filter section. It definitely narrows down the options but fics get abandoned so often it's just not worth it to take the risk anymore.

So I've gone ahead and started working on a subreddit about just this very thing. [[/r/FanFictionOrphanage]]

** Eh, there's no real reason why it can't be done but I think that if you get in the habit of taking other people's prose eventually you're just going to become a "copy-cat" fanfic writer. I can imagine very cringe fic authors like DZ2 just spamming their page with horrid fanfic continuations that only serve to make the fics become remembered poorly.

** "It always annoys me when an author abandons a really good fanfiction." I agree with you. A great story, grabs your interest and then nothing. Also annoying are authors who threaten to not continue unless they get a review, etc. I don't care how good a story is, if you try to blackmail people for praise, I quit reading immediately. Last rant. Is it really necessary to have author's notes on every single page of a story especially if it's the same thing on every freaking page!?! I want to read your story without having to go down half the page to get to it.

** Jeez, I can't count how many times I've thought the same. I think more about the continuation of abandoned stories than I do my own. And I often wonder why the author abandoned it too, when there's no explanation - there was one case where a (relatively-ish?) famous Supernatural ff author died and I mourned like she was my sister. I still reread her stories every year or two as well.

But yeah, got a little off track there. Someone should make a site specifically for adopting abandoned fics! Writers who don't want to continue or people who get the author's permission can post them there and then someone else can continue.
