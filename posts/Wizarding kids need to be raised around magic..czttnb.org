I would like to see a fic where Wizarding kids need to be raised amongst adult wizards in order for proper magical growth.

Like a muggleborn wouldn't need to be raised by wizards because their magic sensed the lack of adult magic in the home. So their magic is more subdued and easier to control. The drawback is that it very rarely lashed out and tested limits, so it doesn't get to grow as much. So muggleborn students typically have better control and finesse but lack real power. Lily could even be an exception to this because she met Severus and his mom. Being around her allowed Lily's magic to lash out and grow some.

But wizard kids born to wizards or wizard/muggle pairs need to be raised by wizards because their magic senses the magic around them before they are born and is more free. The magic knows and expects the adult magic to be there for guidance and protection so it feels free to stretch and test its limits. Without an adult's magic around, a child's magic can grow out of control or too fast and hurt the child. It can also cause weird environmental effects.

** A nice premise to evil!Dumbledore. He let Harry grow with muggles because he'd grow up with weak magic and would be killed easily by Voldemort.

** I read a fic where muggles just understand that magic is dangerous and no muggleborns get along with their muggle parents. It was part of a way to set-up a woobie Hermione but it's a pretty cool concept adjacent to yours.

**** If it's the one that's tickling my memory, it was one of the Independent Harry in a magical space-expanding time-dilating trunk stories, and also involved young witches being assigned older witches as sexual partners in their second year at Hogwarts. Which latter detail was where it lost me.

So the Muggleborn are kunoichi and the purebloods are shinobi?

*** Or a plot point. You could have a subsection of the anti muggle and pro muggleborn factions ban together who want to liberate children from muggle families. For either the safety of the children or the goal of fostering stronger magic. One which can either "find" Harry at the Dursleys or he can sympathize with post Hogwarts.

*** No. Not really. His magic would be chaotic. And there would be a lot of it. And it would be hard to control because he lacks the magical guides to reign it in. He'd probably be very sore from the magic having nowhere to go and causing health problems.

But it would be more like a small child being left in the woods and raised by wolves or something. Stronger than normal, but also quite feral.
