** /What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little squib? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Auror Academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the Death Eaters, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top auror in the entire magical world. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the wireless? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across Britain and your wand is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the country, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo./

Mrs. Weasleys voice could be heard from all over the great hall.

** There were memes in the 90s as well such as "On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog". Probably most people didn't understand them (considering that muggleborns are so few - only 2 confirmed in Harry's year and 3 with Dean who's past is unknown) and didn't give a shit about them.
