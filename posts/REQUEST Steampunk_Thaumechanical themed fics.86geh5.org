So basically everything's all mechanical (think dwarven or gnomish tech) in a manner that, while it shouldn't actually work, seems like it should if you ignore how things actually work, and thus it does? So instead of actually designing things to work, it's more of a fitting all the magical components together kind of thing? I mostly just wanna see a steampunk or mechanical style Harry.


** A lot of my recent stories are magitek but not really steampunk thougn I do have some notes on Harry building a steampunk spider after seeing wild wild west and using it to terrorise muggles when he decides ro become a supervillain.

** There's a series on Ao3 called Steampunk Roses, which is exactly what you're asking for. The author is close to finishing 3rd year. However, the chapters are quite short (though still full of content) so don't settle in for a long read.
