Okay I read this piece of amazing fanfiction years ago right before the last book came out. It involved ron and hermoine showing up at the dursleys and right before they leave they do something to dudley for being a twat harrys whole life, some other things i remember is ginny goes on the final adventure with the trio. Theres a lot more romance and some more graphic scenes then the book. I remember a battle scene in hogsmede or diagon alley with the 4 of them a bunch of aurors and a majority of the major characters .. ie the weaslys, lupin, tonks ect vs death eaters and the DE's were stationed in gringgots (so i guess its diagon alley then haha) on the stairs and im pretty sure bellatrix was in charge. Its pretty much this authors take on how the 7th book would be written in there eyes. Again it was out just before the 7th was released if that helps.

I can give more details but its been so long id have to sit and think about it. It was an amazing read and Ive been looking for years to get my hands on it again.

Thank you guys for your time.

Long time fan :)
