Hey there! First, I wish to apologize for the lack of flairing as I did not know how exactly to flair this post (what kind of flair). Anyway I wanted to ask for your guys help in finding Harry Potter FanFic communities in ff.net. Basically what I am looking for are specific communities that archive a certain kind of stories. For example: "Harry is founders'/Merlin heir" "Harry x unusual girl" "Harry x multi" "Harry goes to Azkaban" "Alive Lily and James" And so on and so on... The way I search for communities are by the amount of followers but it always finds the same communities and they always festure a massive mix of different things. What I want is a specific community that focus on a specific subject like I described above and the ways to find said communities. Thanks!


** Well if your search criteria isn't working for you, you'll have to try another. Apparently there are over 8k HP communities so it would be a mammoth task to go through all of them, but my very first search of 'Harry Multi' in 'communities' put this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-Harems-and-Multi-relationships/90779/]] at the top of the list with 220 archived stories, so that looks quite promising. I would just try various combinations of keyword searches.

** on the top right you have a search bar, It should say story, Click on story and choose Community, Write keyword and press enter, You will come to a new page where on the right you have a list of what kind of fanfiction communities you want to search. Pick Books and Harry Potter after.

*** I know that lol but the results it provide are very far from what I search and there is no way to filter the results afterward. What I meant is if there is a 3rd party website or a wiki that basically contains the archives or something like that

**** You might want to try [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

It is an improved search engine for stories that allows more blacklisting and syntax searches.

***** That site is amazing dude! But can you explain to me how exactly it works? I mean I only know how to use the -/+ functions and not the * and (...) or "..." functions because the explanation in the site is complicated. For example if I want to find a fic where Harry is resorted or Harry is paired with a Dark version of a character like Daphne for example how can I put that in the site so it'll find the appropriate fics?

******* Thanks! I'll be honest it helped only a little and I still do not understand how to properly use it tbh. I want to search for specific things like "Harry resorted" or "Dark Daphne" or "Founder's heir" but whenever I use the summary function and put those things in it gives me the same results and it seem to ignore the filters I have placed.

******** It searches the description, not the nonexistent tag system. So you only get hits if the author puts these things in the description. If you want to search for Tags try AO3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/]]

It has even more slash but that is the price you have to pay for having tags, which are overused in a lot of cases (especially for background characters)
