So I've got this stuck in my head for an hour and I don't recall seeing anyone write about this

There's that line where Mr. Weasley says 'How many time have I told you, not to trust a magical object if you can't see where it's brain is'

And we see how the sorting hat can keep the sword of Gryffindor within itself, which could just be a skill the horcrux has like how voldermort's horcrux had their own.

So what do you think? Yes or no? If yes how far could this go? Would the other founder's also have horcruxes? We don't even know what's needed to make horcruxes. Is it really evil? Or could there be multiple ways of making them.

Leading back to the main question, what if the sorting hat actually had a piece of Godric Gryffindor in it.


** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë) the sorting hat is a Horcrux. Although it's been some time since I read it, so I could be mistaking.

*** Salazar never left, Godric murdered him in his fury and created the Hat as a safeguard. Regret healed Godric's soul and allowed him to pass on.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

If we go by personal opinion, I don't think any of the Founders made any Horcruxe, and I also believe Godric would be the least likely of all to make one. It feels like the values of his House (and by extension, his owns) would be the most in conflict with the act of creating a Horcruxe (fearing Death enough to try to cheat it does not seem very brave, and I doubt there is anything chivalric in the whole process).

Concerning the Horcruxes in themselves, they are totally Evil. We don't much about how they are created, but we do know several things :

1. Tearing his own Soul apart seem to be one of the worst thing a wizard could do to himself, if the reaction of Slughorn to the idea is anything to go by
2. At the very least, a murder is necessary to "crack" the soul before tearing it appart.
3. Not in the book so not Canons, but Rownling wrote somewhere (maybe on Pottermore) that she could not bring herselve to write about the process because it was something like "too horrible"

With all of this, I think it is safe to consider that the Horcruxes are evil, from the idea itself to the execution. I don't think there is any way to make them more evil, and anyone trying to seek immortality should probably look for another way rather than developing Horcruxes (like Nicolas Flamel did with his Stone).

If the Hat was truly an Horcruxe, I also doubt that nobody would ever notice the Wraith main soul roaming around the countryside for a millienium, or that the main soul managed to maintain its form. In GoF, Voldemort kinda implies that being a wraith is painfull, and that he could have "died" any time if he ever "gave up". If 13 years was difficult for a genius like Riddle, one would need to be a true monster to go on for 1 000 years. I guess it could also create problem during the Sorting, since a Hatcruxe would not really be impartial (though it could explain why idiots like Crabbe and Goyle ended up in Slytherin).

​

Anyways, going back to the main subject, I like the idea of a "Hat Horcruxe", though I would prefer if it was a "dormant" one. The Hat is still enchanted to do the Sorting, why a piece of soul sleeping inside it (probably Godric since it was /his/ Hat, not to mention it can summon its sword). Until the day a suitable mind/soul/body is finally Sorted by the Hat, waking the Horcruxe up and letting him trying to possess this body and return among the living.\\
I guess the Horcruxe could either try a full takeover during the Sorting (risky), or gently goad the student into wearing the Hat (promising stories about the founder, the school or the student parents I guess) until he opens his own soul, just like what happened to Ginny in CoS.

*** Oh my god thanks for such a detailed response. Yeah the whole idea did seem flawed but it was still so cool, like what if the founders did leave their legacy behind in the form of a piece of soul who looks for worthy apprentice to teach, or maybe take over (even though evil founders seem pretty dumb). Anyways omg thanks for such a reply. Made my night

** In linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg), the Hat is a form of Horcrux for Godric Gryffindor, but that fic has it possible to put your whole soul into a Horcrux rather than splitting it, presumably without all the monstrously evil stuff a Herpo-style Horcrux requires. Hogwarts Castle itself is also a non-evil Horcrux for somebody, and they comment about the complete horrorshow it would be if it'd been the split-soul type instead.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

** there was a Short story about R. Ravenclaw (Don't know how to spell her first name). Where she was far worse than salazar in regards to loose morals. She basically killed a student to create a soul anchor. Turned out her horcrux was the Room of Requirement.... Thats why it could do all those crazy things.

** I've actually got part of a story in outline where after ravenclaw dies, each of the remaining founders, realizing the imbalance that the school would have with one founder missing, agree to pass along their roles to others and watch over the school from the shadows. Each finds a different route to immortality. Gryffindor makes a horcrux by taking his own life, thus making the hat-crux the seat of Gryffindor's (undamaged) soul.

Another method would be becoming an animagus of an immortal creature (though you wouldbt be able to leave the form without dying after a certain point)

The last founder is just badass enough to arrest all aging and become immortal directly.

** Kinda toyed with this sort of idea when I saw someone talk here about Harry getting The Colt from Supernatural

--------------

Harry lifted the small chest, finding it surprisingly heavy, and he carried it to the man. Rusk ran his hands over the lid and removed it. Inside was blood-red velvet and a dark gray revolver.

"A gun?" asked Harry

"/The/ gun. Samuel Colt's final contribution to mankind. I would have given it to Albus had he been able to ask for it."

Harry wasn't sure what he meant, and Rusk left him no room to ask.

"I understand your enemy has anchored himself to the world of the living."

Harry was almost shocked to hear that, "You know about horcruxes?"

Rusk nodded, his face hard, "I know of anchors, which are a kind of horcrux."

Harry began to have a strange feeling, "'A kind'? What do you mean?"

"A horcrux is no more part of its creator than if their arm were amputated and buried. The true nature of the horcrux, not yet entirely lost to history, is an artifact created through ritual that uses the soul as its reagent. There are horcruxes that anchor souls to this world, and there are others."

Harry's mind was racing, "What are the others?"

Rusk said "Surely you know of grand relics; objects that defy our common understanding of the limits of magic?"

Harry could immediately think of one, "The Philosopher's Stone."

"Yes, I suspect."
