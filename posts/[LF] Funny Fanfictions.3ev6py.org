I'm looking for funny fanfictions, aside from the following, which I've already read:

- /The Misadventures of Draco Malfoy, Ferret/

- /The Sorting Hat's Love/

- /The Original Naked Quidditch Match/

- /My Immortal/

- /Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles/

- /First Encounter/

I will read hilariously bad (or very funny) fanfictions that are not included in the above.

No preferred pairings.

Both are hilarious (the author of the former also wrote "what if Lockhart adopted Harry fic" which is funny but not quite as much so as well. The Seventh Horcrux might be the funniest thing I've read on FF.net and I couldn't stop laughing until midway through the fourth year.

*** Although I see it recommended all the time, I thought Oh God Not Again! was average at best.

It's a bit full of itself. Characters used to responding to reviews. Inconsistent with its internal logic (Harry can't finish the second quidditch match against Hufflepuff straight away because "the timeline has changed", and yet dementors still show up in third year and the World Cup has the exact same result). It's just another time travel fic where nothing is changed and canon is followed completely, except Sirius is free.

The only character I liked in the story is Lockhart. It was a crack fic with a chip on its shoulder.

It was funny and a good story, I was just disappointed because so many people recommend it so often.

**** It's funny enough though to warrant a read over some other fics I've seen recommended to me, I mostly recommend it myself for humor which that particular author is rather good at.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

The L has to be small, and I can second both. Actually read everything by Rorschach's Blot, you can't go wrong with that. Well other than his 700k collection, that one stalls somewhat.
