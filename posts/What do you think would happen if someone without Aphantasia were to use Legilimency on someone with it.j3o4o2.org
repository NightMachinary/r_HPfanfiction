Also how do you think someone with Aphantasia would go Trying to learn transfiguration considering the Fanon version is all about visualization?


** Assuming they're able to learn legilimancy then I'd think that what they'd see wouldn't be radically different to how they experience things normally. In that they'd see whatever they're reading from another person just fine. Aphantasia only stops the legilimancer in this case from being able to visualise things, it doesn't stop them from seeing those things.

It's likely that this magical wouldn't be very good at transfiguration, in so far as they'd likely only be able to transfigure things into things that they can already see. Likewise this person would either be very limited in or be unable to apparate too.

*** I think would be interesting to see them having to learn or create a version of transfiguration that is not based around visualization.

A non-visualization take on magic in general

**** If magic has any sentience then it's possible that they could do transfiguration (and other visualisation heavy/dependent magics). For example they could know that they'd want to transfigure something into a cat without actually being able to visualise one, as long as magic itself knows what a cat is.

In fact that's not really unbelievable, as it's unlikely that even a master of transfiguration knows the anatomy of a cat (or anything) down to the sub-cellular level anyway, so it's probable that magic already fills in the blanks.\\
Perhaps, then, the worst effect of being unable to visualise is that, maybe, the magical cost of transfiguration might be higher.

Also, this doesn't discount the possibility of specific transfiguration spells that are designed to transfigure things into particular forms. Say a transfiguration spell to make something into parchment, or the match into needle spell may /only/ be able to make needles. If that's the case, then the limit here would be in crafting and then remembering all the spells needed. I'd see this as maybe the sort of thing that kids are taught at school anyway, and it's only during/post NEWT level that visualisation could be depended on more.

** I don't think they would suck at transfiguration. Someone with it just process things differently, they would probably just have to to it a bit more in deep than just surface level optic. If they imagine something changing, like a hand into a claw, they would think about the difference in bone structure and the texture of the skin and which muscles have to move differently.
