** I read this fic a couple years ago, and bookmarked that I read it, but I cant remember ANY of the plot. I could just read it again, but I was hoping one of you guys could jog my memory (with spoilers!).

** What I do remember is that Hermione goes back in time (into her younger body??) and part of the plot is that Harry and Hermione both did a memory charm so that they would forget eachother? Something like that?

** Not sure about a memory charm. Hermione realises that her world isn't "right" and that Harry messed with it. Harry went back to the past to convince his younger self not to start dating Hermione to save her life. Then future Hermione meets/seduces time-travel Harry to stop him from meddling

Something along those lines. Long while since I've read it.

*** To add to that:

After future Hermione convinces future Harry to stop meddling, her timeline is erased. Thus Harry and Hermione admit their feelings to each other during the horcrux hunt, but in the process create a timeline in which Hermione inevitably dies.

Future Harry eventually becomes MoD finds a way and sacrifices himself during the Malfoy Manor escape, thus granting Hermione the same protection that Lily gave to Harry and saving her from Bellatrix's Avada Kedavra during the final battle.

This ends up breaking the loop in which Hermione is destined to die. In the end they get their happy ending.
