The only thing I can distinctly remember happening was that at some point (I'm pretty it was during the fourth year before the weighing of the wands) Hermione accidentally broke Harry's wand by banishing it into a wall in the Gryffindor common room.

I'mâ€‹ pretty sure that it was Haphne but it could have been H/Fleur.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
