I was following the first story for quite some time. The premise intrigued me and it was quite unique. Not to spoil much but basically Harry is sorted into Slytherin and befriends all the Slytherin girls in his year (which for some strange reason include Sally Anne Perks). He's kind of a jerk, but quite friendly and a really good person that will go the extra mile even for people he doesn't like (hence the title).

The story has some issues and I realise it's not everyone's cup of tea, since it was fairly slow paced and some people might feel the story awkward. But I truly think it's originality and uniqueness make up for it. Never read anything like it.

The writing is consistent but nothing spectacular. May seem confusing at first, since it starts in third year and a lot is hand waved away for canon's sake. Yet it captivated me and I always looked forward to every update and still do as the sequel is regularly updated.

Check it out and see if it's for you.

** I think I'll have to ask: how much of a divergence is the fic? Do canon events still happen? Are Ron and Hermione still his friends? I noticed that the fic has Ginny, Hermione, and Pansy as important characters.

*** Divergence... difficult to say, the Sirius confrontation happens but in a totally different way. As far as I remember the second year was almost the same in outcome of course. Harry went down the Chamber, saved Ginny. Third year doesn't go like the canon one like all, though all the major events happen (Hippogrif vs Draco, Sirius Black, Dementors on the Quidditch Pitch etc.) but I would never call this canon rehash.

**** How is that not canon rehash if all major canon stations are followed?

***** It's not. What you're saying is that any fic that has horcruxes or the Troll on Haloween is canon rehash. Canon rehash is when despite the plot of the story, canon events happen anyway. Here they are integral and told in their own way, with their own, different results than in canon.

***** You can write a Battlerap AU which follows the stations of canon. Following them means that the event itself happens, not that it plays out the same way. If you have an Underground street racing AU and Harry has to race against a resurrected Voldemort around the Graveyard in Little Hangelton, you still have the graveyard scene even if they race in 1993 Honda Civics instead of duelling with magic.
