Any writers/readers out there. I have a simple question.

Do you write dragon fire as one word, two words, or hyphenated? Its not that important, but I realized I have seen all three at various points.


** In canon, it's "dragon-fire", at least when talking about the "dragon-fire button" on Sirius's bike.

** I think it depends entirely on what impression about the subject you want to give. When I see 'dragonfire' I assume it's something inherently magical and unique to dragons, whereas 'dragon fire' is just fire that comes out of dragons. ;)

** Dragon Fire refers to the ability of a dragon to exhale/produce fire.\\
While Dragonfire may be a spell or ability that merely copies the Dragon Fire.
