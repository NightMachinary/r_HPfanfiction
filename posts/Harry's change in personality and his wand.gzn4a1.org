In many fanfictions, Harry has a change in his personality. The problem I have with this is that he still has the same wand. A wand shows the personality of someone and that should mean he would have to get a different wand if he has a different personality. It doesn't make sense for him to still have the Holly wand if he is not adventurous or curious but cautious, understanding and calm.


** I find it particularly odd if Harry gets his holly wand if he doesn't have a piece of Voldemort's soul within him, otherwise I think it's fair play.

** This is definitely a minor pet peeve for me. If the character's personality is different, they should get a wand to match. Whenever somebody gets a specific wand in a fic, I tend to look up the wand wood to check whether the author did their research or not.

** Yknow I never really care, especially not enough to make a reddit post about it.

** I haven't really come across that. I've typically seen a wand change.

** Alternatively he sometimes has to change his wand after getting it even though a wand and wizard are supposed to grow together.

** It doesn't say anywhere that wands choose the wizard based off their personality. The only things that can be assumed is that dragon heartstring wands are more powerful - even though the wand doesn't really determine the power of the spell - and that unicorn tail hair wands might go to "pure hearted" people.

Also, the wizards who purchase their wands at 11 cannot be the same person a decade later. The wands work for them just fine through all the change they go through as they live.

*** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand]] There is a list of the wand woods and Ollivander's notes. In these, it clearly stands that those who have these kinds of wands have certain personality traits. Why would they use different kinds of wood, if they had no difference in usefulness and effect?

**** Alright, but my last line still stands. The wizards who get their wands at age 11 aren't the people they will be at age 17 or 21. They don't get new wands though.
