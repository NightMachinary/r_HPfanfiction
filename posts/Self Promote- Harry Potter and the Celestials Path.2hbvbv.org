So, self promotion time. First fic I've written in a while. Its' A/U Voldemort never killed James/Lily but was defeated by Dumbledore instead. Bellatrix is roaming around causing trouble and Sirius is a celebrity auror.

First chapter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712975/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Celestials-Path]] enjoy :)


** Interesting premise. Following it to see where things go. Might want to punch it up a bit, really pull people in. Maybe hint at what the "and the Celestials Path" part means in the first chapter.

Things are starting a little slow. It is an AU, so hit us with some big and surprising changes. Parents alive, James being harassed for some reason, and Bellatrix being free just don't seem to be enough. Without the summary, I don't know what to expect.

Got a few technical suggestions as well. Stuff I've been called on myself on occasion.

--------------

Make sure to end quotes with dialog tags with a comma, like:

#+begin_quote
  Gryffindor*,*' Ben said.
#+end_quote

Not with a period.

Consider capitalizing the word "Muggle". I've been inconsistent with it myself, but I think it helps to emphasize it. JKR did, and it is also technically a proper noun for a named racial group.

And make sure to look out for those typos and odd words. Read everything, especially the dialog, out loud to see if it sounds right. Some of the kids' stuff seems a little awkward.

--------------

Aaaaaand you just posted chapter two, as I was typing this. Going to read it now.

I wish you good writing.

*** Thanks! I will add though that in the first chapter of Philosophers Stone, we didn't really get any hints as to what the stone was. And to add that I have already given a tiny hint already. Nevertheless thanks!

**** But we do get perfectly normal relatives, a cat reading a map, strange people in cloaks celebrating, owls everywhere, the word Muggles, a man in robes with a long beard putting out lights oddly, Voldemort's name, the Potters are dead, a flying motercycle, and Harry Potter left with his relatives.

So, quite a lot, really. It doesn't have the Philosopher's Stone, but it does have /Harry Potter/, and why we should care about him and the situation he's in -- plus all the odd things this world has that the one we know doesn't.

** I did enjoy, well enough. There are a few grammatical errors, run-on sentences mostly, but well written enough.

** It's great! There were a lot of grammatical errors, but I'm excited to see where the story goes. You described everyone physically in detail, but you don't really describe them after that. Perhaps add more characterization to your conversations by adding how they say words, what they are doing with their hands while they are speaking, etc.
