*** My headcanon is that he picks up accents easy thanks to this. It seems kids who mix with different accents seem to be able to do so. (I did the good old 'pretend you're posh' when I moved schools and accents in general are pretty easy now to pick up subconsciously)

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

Well, if we go with the usual guess that Cokeworth is somewhere in north Derbyshire, then she'll sound like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVR2GeqXzUs][Kelly off Misfits.]] - she's the one in the orange boiler suit. Lauren Socha, the actress playing Kelly, is from that part of the world and using her natural accent.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

** Snape I can believe would have a strong accent from his father, if not from the neighbours (does he go to school? I don't think he mixed with other children, other than Lily), although his mother, as a Pureblood, would have influenced him, too.

Lily and Petunia I always read as middle-class, although probably not very high up as by the events of the first book Petunia reads as lower middle: they could be more middle-middle in Cokeworth, but Petunia seems too dainty about things by Harry's time for that to ring true, for me. This would suggest their accents would be mostly RP, although there would probably be significant local influence. Lily would probably have lost most of the local Cokeworth element at boarding school (Hogwarts), and I suppose how strong Petunia's was would depend on where she went to secondary school.

This could be an extra source of resentment, actually: if Lily is losing her accent and clearly rising up the social ladder, on top of the magic, while Petunia attends a local comprehensive or even secondary modern, given the time frame. You could have her trying to tone down her accent, to match Lily's and with an eye to the future. Maybe she'd get records of elocution lessons to follow along to. I suppose she could have gone to a grammar school, which would probably tone it down a lot.
