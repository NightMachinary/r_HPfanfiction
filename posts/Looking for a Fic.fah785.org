:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this post book 7 fic on fanfic.net back in 2011 that had about 40 chapters and it was written so well it felt canon. I've been dying to re-read it. I don't know the name or anything but it filled in those 19 years between the end of the war and the epilogue. Ron was working with George at the joke shop and Harry was staying at the Weasley's for a bit. Ginny eventually worked at the daily prophet as a quidditch reporter I think, but I can't be sure.

If anyone else remembers the title please give me a shout, please!


** Not sure if it's the one you're thinking of, but there's Aftermath by BlackHawk13.

There's also These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo. It's similar to what you're looking for and it's pretty good.

** Try The First Day by Little0bird. There's a whole series, but those plot points would definitely fit and it's an awesome read. Just know it was written before all the extra Pottermore info came out, so some random tidbits aren't Pottermore canon, only series canon.
