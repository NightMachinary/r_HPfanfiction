I've not read many fics that feature Grindelwald, but I was thinking how interesting it would be to see him escape prison or something. It can be he raises Harry, mentors Harry or even just does his own Dark Lord thing while Harry's at hogwarts? If that makes sense? Any pairings are fine, or none at all. Was just wondering if there are any good fics like this out there! Thanks
