I just read linkffn(The Lost Summer).

Nice idea but rather short. To summarize, Harry vacations in France after the war because he needs to stop brooding. Turns out his house is close to the Delacour's so he babysits Gabrielle and her OC cousin. He turns into a sort of big brother to them. He becomes closer with their families and eventually ends up with the OC's older sister. The last 2 chapters felt rushed (author did admit to making the whole story in 48 hours) but it was still a nice read.

Looking for any veela based fics. All pairings are fine except for H/G.


** Boy do I have a gift for you.

-<HP>-

Harry/Fleur (otherwise known as "Flowerpot") is my OTP, and I have a veritable library of fics in that pairing (40 in all) and I felt like sharing them.

Before any other Fic is recommended, here is one of my favorites. It was taken down from Fanfiction.net and now only exists in this archive. It is a miracle, lightning in a bottle, a blend of the absurd humor of a crack fic with the literary skill of Shakespeare. It is without doubt worth a full read.

Before I begin, please know this. Not all these fics are complete. Not all these fics are long, not all these fics are short, not all these fics are recent or even good. What they are, is a record. A history written in other people's words, a history of the love and passion of a single person for Harry Potter manifesting itself in a way familiar to all of Us here. This is my OTP. Starting with my all time favorite fic in the HP fandom.

  Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.

** The Lost Summer would be better without the random and unnecessary Weasley bashing. Though I think that describes a lot of stories. I also don't really care for Harry/Hermione. I do enjoy this fic though.

**** I don't understand why so many authors do that. If you don't like Ron or Ginny just don't include them in the story. If it's set post-Hogwarts and you feel it is necessary to explain why Harry and Ginny are not together just have a paragraph saying they dated for a while and split up. You don't need to make her a fame-whore or a cheating slut, people often just find that they are not compatible and break up.
