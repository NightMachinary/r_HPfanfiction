I read a one-shot where Hermione works for muggle government who are secretly trying to subdue Ministry of Magic. Can't find it anywhere on FF.net and don't remember the exact title.

SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!

She is a witch but had her wand snapped when younger and now want revenge.


** It's a one shot on DLP done in one of the competitions. [[/u/Pers][u/Pers]] posted it, but it's on fanfiction within his snippet collection [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/9/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][here]]
