Angst, fluff, etc is fine. Preferably no non-canon couples in the PJ side, with HP I don't care as much. No bashing if possible. Doesn't really matter to me when the fic takes place. Hp characters can be demigods and PJ ones can be part wizard or witch, I don't mind. Don't mind how the meet for the most part.

Can be ongoing or finished, but I'll give abandoned ones a try. I don't mind the length but I prefer something that isn't extremely long or extremely short (unless a one shot or something-)


** I can't help but re-read linkffn(10641167) shame no update since 2017 though.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** In my experience, there aren't many good Percy Jackson fics to begin with (unless you really like soul mates or high school AUs), so finding good crossovers is extra difficult.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) is the most popular one, so you've probably already seen it. If not, then there aren't many better options, so you might as well give it a shot. But it's over 300k words (and updating decently regularly), but it only has maybe 20k words of actual story. The rest is pure fluff and Harry getting new toys. It's at least an easy and not unenjoyable read. At least until you realize that nothing is likely to ever happen and that Harry is probably the biggest Mary Sue you've ever seen. It's basically fanfiction junk food.

linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is probably my favorite Percy Jackson fic, though it is still just getting started. What really sold me on it was Persephone being a main character and the actions she's getting up to.

**** ... Have you read "Shattered" by bobinthecomments? Or anything from them? I swear, till this day I haven't read anything greater that shattered... Like, the amount of world building is mind-blowing and the characters are so detailed... And the end! God, I cried so much during the final chapters I actually had to process for a few days. Also, the fanservice is... Well, you can mostly ignore it if you don't like the pairing? ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10793172/chapters/23940162]]) Summary: The world is hardly ever what it seems.

We have seen our heroes fight monsters, gods, titans, and even the very Earth itself. But, there were rules and procedures to be followed. A clear defined path to victory.

Now the enemy has no limits, no safeties, no restraints.

Or

Mortals aren't as blind and powerless as the gods seem to think..

It's not a crossover but a fantastic fic nonetheless.

** I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if this messes up, but linkffn(The Professor by lildrummerboi) is one I've been enjoying for a bit now. It started pretty recently and the author likes to post story arcs in spurts. I especially like the dynamic between Percy and Harry, and the author has made it clear it's very much Harry's story, with Percy in a supportive role.

  Between quidditch, blood prejudices, and monster attacks, Harry had enough on his plate heading into his second year. But things got even more complicated, with the arrival of his new History of Magic Professor. Harry didn't know who this Professor Jackson was, but there was something not quite right about him.

** Obviously I have to recommend the Harry Potter and Some Other Nerds Series, first book (Oi, Death wants to protect you cuz some other loser has got to die) is complete and suuuuper awesome! We're following the OC's for a good time and Percy doesn't figure much, but ughhhh the writing is great. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/898773]])

And also the crack/one shot How to interrupt a monologue: Nico di Angelo's Style. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13948497]])

There's some more on AO3 but not complete or the ones that are... Well, they aren't my cup of tea. :/
