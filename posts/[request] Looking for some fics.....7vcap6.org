I have two different requests.

The first one:

Fics where Harry is a teen daddy and raising his child, much like in A Father's Courage by Father Snape linkffn(A Father's Courage by FatherSnape)

The Second One

I don't have clear examples of, but I would love to read some fics where Harry is just as arrogant as Snape always said he was. ( I do believe Canon Harry was arrogant, but I do not believe it was to the point that Snape had said hence....)

  With Sirius dead, Harry expected a summer filled with dark times, marinating on how he was to blame. What he did not expect was for the Dursleys to thrust a baby into his arms and declare it his. One night of recklessness was enough, but he refused to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Could he do this at 16 on top of school and extra Defense? (Mentor/Fatherly Snape, eventually.)

** There was a bit of a teen dad Harry phase early in the fandom, before angsty Indy Harry got popular. They're insanely cheesy compared to modern fanfic and they haven't aged that well, but here are a couple notables:
