Any fics where Harry or the protagonist uses magic in unique and advanced ways during dueling. Also would enjoy more esoteric forms of magic. Dark magic that is actually dark (drains the life from people, summoning demons, necromancy, really disgusting curses and things that actually should be outlawed by the ministry). Some examples (Turning the floor into acid, using summoned weapons as projectiles (daggers, swords), time altering field where opponents are slower), just examples but anything besides the common cutting curse, stupefy, expelliarmus, ect. No slash please and no bashing/indy!Harry please.


** Reminds me of this one fic where harry used transfiguration to severely manipulate his own body in an animalistic way, and where there were three components to it: the Wand, the Word, and the Wild. Also, it spoke of repercussions of transfiguration of oneself: like a person transifiguring themselves to have werewolf like features and then being stuck in a feral, wolf-human state permanently. Harry was a transfiguration prodigy and wanted to transfigured his parents' brains to make them better, as he and Neville were sort of role swapped as well. I forgot what it was called, though...

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

**** He turns divination into a real discipline, where you can get results (often small or unclear ones) from properly using a crystal ball, scrying in a pool of water, tea leaves, etc. It doesn't provide all the answers, and often the answer it gives doesn't make sense until after the fact. I found it really fun and interesting.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** In linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon), Harry has mastered wandless magic enough that he effectively has some invisible arms made of magic as well as his regular arms. He uses those arms very effectively in battles.

The story also explores the magic of wards and various ways to break into places despite them. This magic is not used in duels, though.
