Hi, this is a rant. My slash recommendations get repeatedly downvoted and I just can't believe the number of people who downvote slash recommendations. My recent post recommending Batsutousai was repeatedly downvoted. If you have read Batsutousai, you can see my problem here.

I am part of [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too, but there are gen fics with background slash relationships that is more plotty and has less emphasis on relationships. These are fics with MoD Harry, Powerful Harry, Dark Harry, Indy Harry etc. and many of them come with a M/M relationship.

I read HP fanfic for the story sake and I would consider myself a Gen fic reader. I read most types of fanfics - both Het and Slash , as long as the story is good. I navigate towards Slash fics though, some of the fics filed under M/M relationship ffnet and AO3 are too good.. I really don't understand all this hate towards Slash fics, If you religiously avoid slash, keep doing that, and stop downvoting posts for those of us who like it!


** I don't like slash, but I don't downvote because of it. I'd only downvote a post if its trolling or mean-spirited. Imo, its a problem all across reddit, downvoting is used too liberally to silence discussion people disagree with.

There's a certain contradiction at the heart of redditquette, which is that it wants reddit users to pretend that reddit is not a content aggregator.

I follow both [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]] but... I dunno. It is discouraging to get downvoted on this sub, but I find [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] too limited. Especially since I really enjoy sharing the fics that I like with others. It honestly makes me happy when I can recommend something, and someone ends up enjoying it.

*** Yes! and I am thinking of it too, which is sad because I've gotten pretty good recommendations from this subreddit which prompted me to join in first place. I am also thinking of using my account to just request fics or browse through existing recommendation , and refrain from recommending any more fics.

At end of the day, (and I think this applies to many of us), I post recommendation here simply to share my excitement of having found a really good fic that I read and bookmarked, and not for actual upvotes. This is why I was, I guess a bit upset, because I wasn't asking for upvotes (even though it's a damn good fic in my opinion), but I didn't definitely expect all the downvotes simply because they don't agree with a background relationship.

I thought that was just that you couldn't discuss the request itself, discussing the individual recommendations on their own was fine?

So if someone asks for fics of ___ type, you can't post a reply saying how terrible those fics are, but if someone suggests a fic that might fit you /can/ post a reply saying how terrible it is so long as your reasons for disliking it are more than 'it fits the prompt'.

People will continue downvoting. That's just something already deep-rooted in reddit. Not much we or the mods can do.

Personally, I don't really mind it. I'll probably not read it, but I tend to ignore romance in fiction anyway, slash or not.

Posting on [[/r/HPSlashFic]] would /probably/ net you less downvotes than posting on here.

Now the question becomes, "Do I post on the main sub and damn the downvotes, or do I post on the slash sub where I'll get less downvoted"

The only thing that unites all slash as a genre is that slash stories feature same-sex relationships. "Disliking slash", therefore, means nothing more or less than not liking to read stories about gay people. Homophobia encompasses a very broad range of negative attitudes towards queerness -- not liking reading stories about gay people is a fairly mild homophobic attitude, but it still *is* a homophobic attitude. That doesn't mean that you hate gay people, or that you're a bad person, but it does mean that you're uncomfortable seeing a gay relationship portrayed.

Sure, a lot of slash is pretty horribly written. But, like, a lot of fanfic in /general/ is horribly written.

******** Is a reader who only reads slash "hetphobic"? Or are they just consuming the form of entertainment which satisfies their preferences?

People have a tendency to confuse "being straight" with "being homophobic". Naturally, when imagining themselves in relationships, readers prefer imagining themselves in relationships that they would actually want to engage in.

Fundamentally, people who dislike reading slash are no different to e.g. harmony shippers who dislike reading Harry/Ginny (or vice versa). At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether the reader finds the target of the protagonist's affections attractive.

The issue is not so much being straight or whatever, the issue is that people are actively silencing other discussions due to their own preferences. People who have spent hours upon hours writing a story, posting it, and then being downvoted to oblivion is really disheartening. You do not see people who like slash furiously downvoting works that are male/female because it does not appeal to them en masse.

If you do not desire to read something, do not read it, do not comment on it, leave it alone. If you downvote it, it removes it from the ‘pool' and stops others from seeing it.

But that doesn't mean you should downvote it on something arbitrary like that. Liking or dislike slash is purely a preference, so don't downvote because of it. Preferably just don't downvote unless people are trolling or being assholes. If you absolutely must downvote fics, at least do it because of objective facts- the grammar is bad, the dialogue terribly written, it's racist or homophobic or terrible in some moral way.

But, if you're reading Harry Potter fanfic, then presumably you can relate to wizards and British people and orphans and scions of aristocratic families and youngest sons with many brothers and people marginalized on the basis of their parenthood and house elves and any many other characters that are unlike you in significant ways. It's certainly possible to relate to characters who differ from you.

It sounds silly to have to say this so directly, but gay people aren't incomprehensible to straight people. The romantic companionship a man feels toward a woman isn't a fundamentally different beast than that felt toward another man. It's the same kind of emotions and same kind of love. There may be some differences, but there are also differences within straight people, and those don't rule out relatability.

So if you find yourself completely unable to relate to slash, it's hard to see that as anything other than a confession that you can't see the common humanity gay people have, that you've painted them as some unknowable other. I know this subreddit doesn't like the word "homophobia", but that's textbook low-key homophobia.

I don't read slash anymore because it is nearly 95% homophobic fetish trash by straight women masquerading as gay allies. I find it repulsive specifically because it dehumanizes gay men. In my mind, such content is even worse than simple lack of acceptance because it poisons the well-- even someone that is not hateful towards gay people by nature can be fooled by these things into becoming subtly homophobic because they masquerade as pro-gay!

It is my experience being disabled and in watching the dynamics around my homophobic family members that people who are misguided in such a way are infinitely harder to change than the hateful. It is easy to realize that what you are doing is evil when you meet a minority and realize they are just like you. The same cannot be said for people with bizarre, involved webs of twisted misinformation that cannot be disproven in simple terms and the idea in their heads that they are HELPING minorities.

I think it's more basic than that. People see HP fanfiction as some kind of zero sum game. They consider e.g. the more people write Harmony, the less people writing Harry/Ginny, so if you support Harry/Ginny you must dissuade people from writing Harmony.

****** Yes! HP fic is exclusive, in my experience. People have three or so favorite characters/pairings and generally don't read much out of that sandbox (of course there are exceptions, don't @ me) Contrast that with Marvel fic, where it seems like people have three or so characters or pairings they /won't/ read, but will generally check almost everything else out. It's inclusive.

I write a wee tiny pairing in HP. I started a Marvel fic for a pairing that has no complete fic over 20k and 5 total stories---it got way more reception as my first fic for the fandom than I would have expected. (Remus/Hermione vs. Darcy Lewis/Howard Stark)

The upshot of this is that HP readers get insular and sometimes even vindictive against the stuff they won't read. It's a part of their identity, especially if their pairing is polarizing.

Not true. Dark!Harry and Indy!Harry request threads only get downvoted when there's been multiple threads with nearly identical requests in the same month. Otherwise those types of threads get upvoted. Meanwhile M/M request threads that mention Voldemort or deatheaters /always/ get downvoted off the front page of the sub regardless of how rarely such threads pop up.

As for recomendations, plenty of Indy!Harry and Dark!Harry recomendation comments get upvoted because they are quite popular on this sub. (For example, Rise of the Wizards typically gets at least +4 upvotes.) Meanwhile deatheater slash recomendations get downvoted, even inside threads where they are specifically requested by the OP.

** Well, this is why [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] got started. There was a core of users who tried to participate here and got fed up, discouraged, or angered by their reception, the incessant downvoting, and the resistance to even talking about slash. There's a sufficiently broad range of people on this sub that it should have been possible for slash fans and vaguely interested parties to have lively threads while all the other, het-only people went about their business. But there's a certain aggro towards slash, and I do think it's partly that the members who feel ownership of this sub don't, at the end of the day, want slash to be a regular topic of discussion. The reasons can vary, but they unite in attitude against it.

There's also an occasional tendency in slash threads for the discussions to get inflammatory in a way that feels personal, and it can be hard to feel like you belong in a sub after running into that sort of judgment. It happens much less than it used to, though.

I do ship all the wrong things and ways - foeyay, hatesex, enemies ships, cross-gen, m/m, unattractive older characters together, dysfunctional relationships, imperfect redemptions - and frankly, if I want to discuss those dynamics I go elsewhere, because there's no way I'm going to have a fruitful or entertaining conversation here.

My (possibly mistaken) impression is that more slash fans have found this sub and joined with the expectation of it being more inclusive than it actually is, so the question keeps getting raised and the non-slash fans are being asked to explain their responses. The more general questions about writing or tropes or personal favorite fics can be interesting, but I don't look for discussions or recs of slash content here.

** My philosophy about voting is this: I only ever upvote something if its interesting for me, or its about comments that are either entertaining or enlightening about something, like a comment from [[/u/Taure]] about a possible way of defining how Parseltongue may work. It had only 1 upvote, so it was down at the bottom of the post, but it was interesting and had good points.

I only ever downvote (never on a post itself) comments are just either plain stupid, agressive or against the ToS. And even then, my usual reaction is just, "Meh, w/e, couldn't care less".

I dislike slash (and I mean maleSlash) simply because I can't, for some reason, empathize and relate to a man /finding another man attractive/. Not because its wrong or amoral or w/e. I just can feel attracted to men, so I can't relate to a character (only main narrators or character, also couldn't care less if its on background or a main character that isn't the protagonist). I don't mind femSlash (actually i enjoy it a lot) because women for me are the pinnacle of, well, allure. So two women is double that. I, curiously enough, love femHarry(mostly because femHarry are the most written genderbend fics I've seen, could be another protagonist) with a male pairing, especially if its a crossover. I have no idea why.

This is coming from a straight dude, who has two childhood male friends who are gay (one is even engaged) and mostly only had female friends growing up. Only in uni I ended up making more male friends (all of whom are massive fucking nerds, like D&D on the basement, nerds, just like me)

Bottom line. Don't downvote unless its stupid, wrong or illegal. It fucks up the poster and commenter for no reason at all except to "show" your dislike. If you don't like something, and it isn't wrong, just ignore it. Its like you're walking on the street, and you see someone spit at the ground, harming no one. You might think its disgusting, and I'd agree, most times, but wouldn't your reaction in 99% of the times be to just ignore the person? Same principle. At least that's how I see it.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

This is one of the reasons why people get emotional and negative over slash fics. You simply do not allow people to have their preferences. Homophobia is an INTENSE insult-- one of the worst things you can be in this day and age-- that you people throw around at the first opportunity, and no one wants to deal with people that launch vicious personal attacks indiscriminately.

** As a general rule, I downvote any thread where some jumped-up ninny comes on and tries to tell me how I should vote. This thread is no exception.

As for slash recommendations, I generally don't care to read them and don't bother voting, whether yea or nay. This is not because I can't or won't accept M/M relationships, but rather because I dislike stories that center on the relationship, which slash stories seem to be with high probability. There are better ways to spend the bit of time I devote to fanfiction than reading stuff I find tedious.

This is much the same for me as with stories centered on heterosexual relationships. Ones where it's a backdrop to an otherwise interesting and compellingly written story? Yeah, I'll read. Ones where it's all about the feels, the tedious "will they, won't they?" dance? I'll pass.

** I will preface this by saying that I agree with you that people shouldn't mindlessly see slash and disregard/hate it, but I will describe my wariness of it.

M/M has a certain verve to it that doesn't mesh with me. I am a straight man, so the lens that I view romance stories through is that of a women being involved. I read a lot of F/F because I can relate to liking a girl. But this itself is complicated, for instance I refuse to give Bellatrix/Harry a chance, but I love Bellatrix/Hermione. This is in part due to the good stories of that pairing out there, but it's also because I gave the authors in the F/F community the benefit of the doubt that they could make this ship work in a way that the Het community never could.

At the same time I've tried to read M/M before and always walk away dissatisfied. This is, in large part, because these stories are not (and should not be) targeted at me, but it's also because the most popular ships feel more plainly wrong. This is my hangup, if you gave me good a Drarry story but rewrote it to be a male Daphne or Blaise instead of Draco I would more easily read and enjoy it. Meanwhile the same isn't true of fics that swap around Voldy, Draco, and Harry's genders, none that I have read ever read well to me.

I may not like almost all M/M fics, but that's on me, I can not subjectively or objectively talk about the overall quality of this area of Fan-fiction. I have never given M/M a fair shake, but people that do try and dump on it do not accurately represent the overall quality of Het. There is a lot of bad writing and poor stories in every corner of Fan-fiction, and taking bad stories/tropes as examples to try and say something about the entire genre is wrong and really warps what people like me think about these segments of writing, and requires reading it ourselves to get a more accurate view.

This kinda turned into a ramble but I just want to apologize that some people don't want a significant part of this community to be represented here.

*** For me ( straight girl) it doesn't really bother me if its f/f m/f or m/m. I personally hate self inserts so its never gonna feel like my romance but a romance so the sexual preferences don't make a difference. But I do relate to not giving things a fair chance because it turns me off. Its more I guess a type of story or trope or ship that I've refused to give a fair chance because of the impression I've gotten from it has turned me off. Rather than the genders of the characters.

Like Dramione for example fanfics can rewrite things so while I hate the dynamic in canon I wouldn't in theory be against seeing it in fanon done differently. But when I considered trying some the kind of dynamic that was popular and the kinds of fics that were popular turned me off from it. I dont like the girl fixing the bad boy tropes or the turned good for one person trope and I hate marriage law stuff. And thats what I found alot of when I tried so it turned me off. Those tropes might produce decent fic but all of them in their concept turn me off. So that ships and those tropes I refuse to really give a fair shake because i know already its not gonna be my thing. I used to be alot more shitty towards people who liked those things but ive tried adopting more of a to each their own kinda attitude like you have.

** The comments on this thread are so discouraging! I really don't understand why same sex couples are put in this entirely separate category that people refuse to read and then downvote to oblivion when they're mentioned in any way. I don't think of my ships in terms of slash, femslash, or het, I just write the pairings I want to write and each is unique and interesting, and I do my best to make the fic well-written, fleshed out, and satisfying to read. It's upsetting that my writing and my recommendations could be being downvoted because of the gender of the pairings, even if the ship is realistic, the prose beautiful, the fic well-paced, all the things people say they want from fics.

A lot of people in this thread are saying things like "well most slash is Drarry and I hate Drarry" or "I just think slash is badly written" - but in request threads, why not just make your requests more specific by saying "no Drarry, well-written" instead of completely writing off any story that happens to have a same-sex pairing.

I get that I probably won't change any minds about so-called "slash" with this post, but the core of the issue is that it's unfair to downvote things you happen to personally dislike. It's making a lot of us feel unwelcome and like we don't belong in this fandom and this community. And for those of us who are gay in real life, it feels like we're being judged for wanting to write about and read about gay people, and it's not a good look.

Shitty slash includes, but is not limited to:

- Ridiculous relationships. Harry/Draco could theoretically work, but Harry/Snape is way too far out there. Not only would that be paedophilia, but the power level mismatch would make it a rape.

- MPREG. It's ridiculous. Not only is it unbelievable, but it's nearly always dom/sub relationships, usually based on a teacher/student relationship. See above.

- Obvious teenage wet dreams. Usually teenage girls who have no clue what sex is, let alone gay sex.

- Badly written. See above.

As for the other two, I think it's shitty to downvote them just because you think they're "ridiculous". It's a fantasy universe! All sorts of ridiculous things happen.

I just dont personally see Slash as uniquely worse but just bad in different ways sometimes when it is bad. Like I hate Mpreg which is exclusive to slash. But as far as ive seen marriage law and arranged marriage is exclusive to m/f or at least way more common as are harem fics. And I hate all three equally.

******** Just because you didn't find a MoD Harry better than this doesn't mean this is good. It is an infantile power fantasy. The author has a good idea, I'll admit, but very obviously doesn't have the chops to write an OP ruthless MoD Harry. The author can't even imagine such a person, nvm writing it. But that's okay, because we'll be reminded of how speshul he is every other paragraph by his inner wolf and his "quirky" and "funny" interaction with his pet, death!

I had to slog my way through the first chapters and it was an absolute cringe-fest. Harry is written as a complete Gary-Stu and everyone falls over themselves to lick his boots. Meanwhile he can't even do one thing without being caught or doing it so badly that everyone sees through it. But that's okay, because besides having his growly inner wolf and his slave death who takes care of things he wouldn't even think need taking care of, he also has the thing where everyone else he meets in the story immediately get on with the program and want to make sure his wishes come true.

And even so, I would have read this if the author could stay consistent with the idea they had in the beginning, as I said, that was a good idea. If I am reading about a MoD Harry I want to see someone with no mercy, smart, one man army laying siege to his enemies. So he jumps dimensions being motivated by blood lust and the thought of torturing his enemies. That's good so far. But this is literally where the good things stop in the story. His wolf goes rawr and shit and death does the thinking and choosing of the details for him.

So he stumbles and bumbles his way into freeing Sirius by sheer dumb luck, is flabbergasted Dumbledore can see through his stupid charade written to pad the word count of the story (but that's okay, as I said, everyone wants to suck his dick) and suddenly thinks "you know how I am here because I was motivated by revenge? well, never you mind that (rawr growl + death attempting to be funny in the background) maybe I can take my biggest enemy and uhhh find some use for him??"

Without reading further I can predict what will happen: his inner wolf will need some petting soon. Death and Sirius make more stupid unfunny jokes. As soon as he meets Voldemort they'll want to suck each other's dick and ofc it will happen because Gary Stu. He's the alpha of all non-humans now and there's an even more speshul prophecy about him (thanks death!) so he'll become some sort of ruler over them and have a lot of power in that world but someone else will do the actual ruling (probably Voldemort) while he'll sit there being useless and occasionally coming up with stupid ideas that everyone else will work to put into practice with amazingly good results.

TL;DR it's drivel and you shouldn't use this as an example of a good story in case someone who doesn't know better tries to read it and assumes all slash is this bad.

#+begin_quote
  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

**** I prefer stories over romance, and I thought that was the point in writing. No - that /is/ the point in writing. The best stories have whatever romance is in there as seasoning.

I'll put it this way: would you sit and eat a plate of chillies for dinner, or would you make a sauce out of a few of them, cook meat and vegetables in it, and eat them that way?

It isn't really your place to tell me I'm missing out on anything.

******* No one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to read anything.

Just don't downvote people looking or reccing stories that aren't to your tastes.

As I said, if I limited myself, I would miss a lot of good fics if I "...just stick to het romance. There's wonderful fic in het, slash and gen."

See that gen category there? You're trying to twist my words and I don't appreciate it.

**** I'm bisexual too, and in all fairness I don't really come here often enough to see how much slash there is. My main thing, really, is that it's actually a genre of its own, and doesn't belong. I'd say the same about straight erotic fics.

Where slash (or, as I said above, sex) is the point of the fic, then it should be in a more adult-centred space. Simple as that.

Also, I'd've thought that people who keep getting downvoted for posting certain things in a sub would take the lesson that it's not wanted there. But they don't take the lesson, and then people start threads to complain, which I've seen happen a few times aside from this one.

No. This subreddit is for /all/ Harry Potter fanfiction, barring stuff that breaks the rules.

Except that's not the point of the sub. This place is for the recommendations and discussion of /all/ Harry Potter fanfiction, not just stuff you specific want to talk about. I'll ride Harmony until I die and am subscribed to their specific sub, but that doesn't mean I downvote threads about Ron/Hermione despite my utter loathing of the pair. If a thread is about opinions, then yeah offer any and all you've got. But gatekeeping a catch all sub because you don't like some of the topics is shitty behavior.

*** You're not wrong, but considering the historic prevalence of slash in fanfiction and the heavy skewing of writers being women, gay male relationships being fetishized isn't exactly a moral high ground. A whole lotta slash can be categorized with lesbian porn as ‘this clearly isn't for the people involved'.

** I downvote all out-of-character stuff in threads that do not specifically request that kind of divergence.

You can have Dumbledore/Grindelwald. You can even have Dumbledore/Other canon character Dumbledore's age established as homosexual. That won't lead to downvotes from me, but if you make characters that are canonically straight homosexual for no reason I don't see that as interesting or having any merit as fanfiction. It's just bad.

Furthermore, smut is just bad. It's just not interesting.
