I don't remember all of the details, but basically Harry runs away from the tournament - Viktor helps him, I think. He changes his appearance slightly, then runs into Artemis. I can't remember if they're soulmates (which I /think/ is the case) or if they just fall in love, but the second half or so of the story takes place from Artemis' POV with him taking care of Harry. I think there's a bit of drama too when Harry reveals who he actually is and Artemis wants revenge - something like that.

Haven't read this in like eightish years and I probably have some of the details a little off. I couldn't find it on ff.net, but I'm not sure if it was deleted or if I'm just not looking hard enough. It was relatively short, less than 60k I think, and complete. Does anyone have a copy or know where to find it? Or does anyone know the name at least? This story seriously haunts me and I'm pretty desperate to read it again.
