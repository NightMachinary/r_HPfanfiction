I've read all the popular well known stuff. I'm not picky, just rec anything you've enjoyed.

Thanks.


** First instinct: I recommend extra blankets, some chicken broth and a Pepper-Up potion. Sounds like you have something Sinus-y.

** Oh girl (guy?), I was hoping someone would post looking for this. You said you've read all the popular, well known stuff, although I'm not entirely sure what those would be because I've also read all the great stuff (imo) and no longer have any Snarry to read. I also read these way back, almost 8 years or so ago and am currently re-reading.

First rec that come to mind are Alchemia Dent & Buglands A Bittersweet Potion series (which to my knowledge was never completed, but it doesn't matter because they planned for 7 or 8 books but only wrote 4 and the first book is good enough to be read on it's own)-[[http://www.intertexius.com][www.intertexius.com]]

Telanu's Hard Liquor, Tea and Coffee series-[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Telanu/pseuds/Telanu/series]]

Sushi's Civil War series-[[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html]]

The Snidget by sinick and ac1burn (anything by them in general was good)-[[http://www.thebejeweledgreenbottle.com/2009%20Mixed%20Games/Fic%20Snitch/snitch-sinick-ac1d6urn.html]]

EDITED because I found The Devil Will Drag You Under by DementorDelta-not for the weak, and not even posting a link. skyhawke though
