:END:
Hello again.

​

I know when reading the tag, but this's more of finding a user. Here's why, as a young lad, I read this user's very weird and cringy lemon harem-ish fanfic, where Harry has sex with every girl at Hogwarts, and every chapter has titles of what girl Harry is having sex with, which I remember of a chapter that he has sex with Fluer sister. This user did it with HbP, I used to like it, and now I hate myself for reading it.

​

This user also did similar stories with Hermione with multiple guys, which was also very cringed. He also did an incest story with Ginny and Ron, which was also very weird, I look everywhere but I couldn't find the user.

​

I want to find this user stories so I could cringe at my mistake.


** Could you be referring to [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/megamatt09/pseuds/megamatt09][megamatt09]] ? Haven't read any of his stuff but he has probably covered just about every pairing in all the word-bloat.
