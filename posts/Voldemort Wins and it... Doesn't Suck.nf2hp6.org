** If we're picking up straight from canon but then diverging with a Voldemort win at Hogwarts, it'll take some real writing skills to make it 'not suck', considering things like the Snatchers having done their thing during Voldemort's takeover, the Muggle-born Registration Commission sentencing people to Azkaban, Muggle-borns being reduced to being the so-called 'Wandless', aka beggars, etc.

*** And yet, so many fanfictions diverge from canon so hard it makes your head spin. There are some fantastic writers out there who achieve what so many would deem impossible, and writers who can convince the reader of so many things they probably hadn't even considered in the first place. I think it's closed minded to assume that just because it's unlikely in canon that it's never been written about (sometimes successfully even!) nor that people might actually read it with interest.

** Linkffn(prince of the dark Kingdom) fits this premise. Voldemort wins before Harry is even in hogwarts. The author recently returned to finish the super long series too. I'm one of her beta readers.

** Try Mi Aedijekit by local_doom_void. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/chapters/44742046]]

I am really enjoying this fic. WIP. Harry is drugged by Voldemort and wakes up a thousand years later in a very different world. Amazing world building, great OCs. There's a short prequel that basically takes the perspective that V wasn't motivated by anti-Muggle sentiment but was using that to manipulate purebloods - it was actually all about the power.

Right, which has never ever been done in all of fanfiction. Totes, you're absolutely right. I should never ask if people know of any fics that are too far into the fantasy realm of a fictional genre. Got it. üë©üèª‚Äçüéì

**** The ministry is not fascist. Fascism implies that people of same nationality are united and accept no outsiders. Which is not the case considering they accept muggleborns, cooperate with the muggle government and with goblins. At the very most is a centrist conservative government.

***** Oh buddy, oh pal, that's not what fascism means

You're describing nationalism, I think. Which is something fascist are very keen on, but not the whole definition

Let's be super basic here: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism][fascism]] (/Ààf√¶ É…™z…ôm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by /dictatorial power/, /forcible suppression of opposition/, and /strong regimentation/ of society and of the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe

Fudge throws Hagrid in prison without a trial, attempts to have Sirius summarily excecutd without a trial to suppress the truth about a fuck up/illegal incarceration; and then summarily executes Crouch, who is a fucker, but still should have had a new trial for his actions in casting unforgivable at school children and the spot of kidnapping he seems so fond of. Also polyjuice is restricted, so he needs to go on trial---let alone the questioning he should have because he's involved in a conspiracy which they didn't truly unwravel before he offed him to shut him up.

Then he goes on to suppress information about a terrorist, not just from the public but also from the authorities; and then he starts a blatant propaganda campaign against a teenage boy, who he tries to kill again.

Let alone the shit umbridge gets up to in the education system, which is pretty much spot on for a fascist regimen

And the way he treats the Muggle prime minister is really just awful and quite terrifying

The ministry of magic is /absolutely/ fascist.

And they don't really accept or cooperate with the minorities you mentioned, they just aren't as blatant as Voldie and Bellatrix. The way Binns and even Hagrid talk about goblins is really super shitty, and shows signs of a very long history of systemic oppression. There are signs all through the books that magical Britain is super fucked up

Either you extrapolate it a little to see that it's fucked up, or you extrapolate a lot and see that it's really super fucked up, but all of it is a mess.

****** Fascism literally comes from fascio which means a bundle of sticks tied together symbolizing unity. That was the primary ideology. When the whole world was against you, you had to unite as a nation under a powerful dictator. What you're talking about is abuses of power and cases of corruption but they are not specifically related to fascism. Voldemort's government is fascist but not the ones before.

****** This is ridiculously cherry-picked. By this sort of argument, you can easily "prove" that the US is a fascist state.

At the very worst, Wizarding Britain is an anocracy. Minister for Magic has to worry about reelection (end of GoF), there is freedom of the press (since the Quibbler is not shut down during OotP), and the government can't punish a schoolkid without holding a trial, which delivers an acquital (start of OotP).

There is a lot of corruption, jingoism, and personal bigotry, and the checks and balances are certainly inadequate, but if you see actual magical fascism in action, you can just look at the year under Voldemort, which comes back to [[/u/Kettrickenisabadass]]'s point.

I mean Voldemort is unquestionably the worst. But he started out as an orphan who thought he was a muggleborn. So that guy? Could have some shit he could do. He's not any more privileged than Harry is. But then he decided to be the worker instead and collected terrible people around him who genuinely didn't even think he deserved to live, so that's irredeemable, even if some people might be ok with his regime
