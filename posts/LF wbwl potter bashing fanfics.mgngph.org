  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

*Warning*: WBWL, Azkaban!Harry, Lord-Potter-Black-Slytherin-LeFay!Henry, Evil!Jily, Ron bashing, Snape bashing, marriage contracts + "politics," Light Lord Dumbles.

Side effects may include a loss of sanity, guilty pleasure, and a noticeable loss of IQ. Ask your doctor if /Dark Prince Rises/ is right for you.

#+begin_quote
  Henry James Potter has been betrayed by his family and Light, having been sent to Azkaban for defeating reborn Tom Riddle and his Basilisk. Two years later, with Voldemort once more living, he is given a chance to avenge himself and punish both the Light and the Dark. Enemies of the Dark Prince beware, for he knows no mercy. Older!Dark!PowerfulHarry. Bashing!Light and Potters.
