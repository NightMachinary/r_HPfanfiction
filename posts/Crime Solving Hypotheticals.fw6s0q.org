To preface - I know Auror's are just Dark Wizard Catchers, I'm using the term in its fanon shorthand for any type of magical law enforcement so I don't have to type 'magical law enforcement' every time because that would get tiresome for all of us. Also, it's the same equivalent of calling any Muggle Law Enforcement officer a cop or a bobby or whatever, just from the detective side instead of the on-the-beat side.

So, I'm an Auror (I'm not - see title) and I'm out to solve dem crimez. How do I do it? What's the Procedure in the Magical-Police Procedural? Are there spells an Auror would use? Magical techniques (does looking into a wizard's eyeballs show the last thing he saw? - is phrenology legitimate criminal profiling in a Rowling-Magical world?) used? How would sentencing be determined? How would punishment be carried out? Are there corporal punishments? Are there Magical Pinkertons? Magical Holmesian Detectives? Do we have a magical forensics department I can take my cases to? Is there a Medical Examiner at the St Mungos Morgue?

I know most of this isn't in canon, but I'm curious about the fandom's thoughts. And yes, I know about In Spite of Obstinate Men and that one named after the position Harry takes when he returns to investigate after Draco Malfoy is accused of murder. And to help people think, I've got some example crimes.

- Someone has stolen the Ancient MacGuffin Clan's Ritual Doodad, how do I track it down and find the thief?

- The Lady Malfoy's Butler-Elf has been found bludgeoned in the master study during a dinner party, how do I find whodunnit?

- A mugging went wrong and the victim died, I've found a splodge of blood under his fingernails, how do I identify who it came from or whether he was a vampire and that's just smushed bits of his Blood Lolly?

- Gringotts has now reported every vault is completely empty of Gold and instead is filled with what appears to be small purple pellets that smell vaguely of eggs and a single red rose was found on the Vault Overseer's desk. How do I find the culprit?


** Priori Incantatem would be a good tool if you catch a suspect near the crime scene.

Hairs you find can be thrown into Polyjuice, so some kind of forensics is possible. Maybe something similar can be done with blood.

Fingerprints are an option, the existence of polyjuice is a possible defence, but that's for the judge to decide.

Tracing apparations might be possible, but to make that balanced let's say that you have to be at the origin within a few minutes of the apparation.

*** Huh. That brings up an excellent question - would DNA shed while you're under polyjuice be yours or the person you're imitating? ie. Who would the polyjuice show if you used the hairs of someone under polyjuice?

***** Quite true. Just because a piece of evidence could be wrong or tampered with, doesn't mean you don't collect it and work things out from it - you just keep aware of it being possibly incorrect or misleading. Because that's my point - if it was someone else, would you be able to tell magically? Or is it solely a mundane investigation from that point?

I think Polyjuice can only last an hour per dose though - so if they were around for three hours, they'd probably not be polyjuiced or you'd probably be stupid for letter them drink something. :D

And quite true - I always wanted to see an Indy!Harry fic where Dumbledore was manipulative, but he was manipulating Harry into becoming independent, severing all connections to his friends and family so he'd go after Voldemort more freely. Potion!Weasleys were framed, Tattletail!Hermione was manipulated, Absentee!Remus was bullied, Absentee!Sirius was tricked, etc. It'd be so fun to see that done properly.
