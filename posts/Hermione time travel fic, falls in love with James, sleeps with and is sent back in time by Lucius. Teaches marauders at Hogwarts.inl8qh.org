:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Desperately trying to find a fic which features Hermione sent back in time and becoming a teacher of defence during Marauders 7th year. She doesn't like Lily who is manipulative, but falls in love with James. She has to sleep with Lucius to get intell for the order and we discover he's the one who sent her back in time. There's a scene where she wears a gold dress and loads of scars on show, I think for a birthday dinner? Think all use potter manor as order training house and Lily sleeps with James to get pregnant?

Horrible feeling it might be an old one from Granger enchanted, but could have been Ao3 or FF.net Was definitely a mature fic. Hermione/James primary pairing

Does anyone recognise it at all?
