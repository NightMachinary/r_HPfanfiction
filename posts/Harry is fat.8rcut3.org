Like, Dudley fat. Can't walk fat. Walmart scooters fat. Sees himself being only mildly obese in the Mirror of Erised fat. Got stuck going down the Chamber of Secrets fat. Broke Buckbeak's back fat. Couldn't enter the maze fat. Broke the Hall of Prophecies just by walking in fat. Ginny has to use a GPS to find his mouth to kiss fat. Sits on Voldemort and kills him fat.

I'm sorry for any images this may have conjured up in your head.

When I first searched out weirdass pairings, that was the only fic if you filter by Ginny W. and Basilisk on ffnet. Now there's a couple more, but this fic is still the only one with smut involved.

You're welcome.

** If the Dursleys were smart they could have done that to him. Just overfed and spoiled him until he's just like Dudley, completely unable to function as an adult in any society. “Boarding school for wizards? Like I have to walk places? And there's no video games? I'll pass.”

remember the death eaters came to capture him but couldn't push him out of the door, and some got crushed under him or something. I'll try to find it, but damn I'm pretty sure it isn't on my favourites.
