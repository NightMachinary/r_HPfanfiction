** That the muggleborns who got the Hogwarts letter and decided to attend more or less had to leave their old lives behind. Their old friends and siblings would go to different schools and as they got older they would have less and less common interests. With the extended family, they would have to lie all the time. Their parents will be outside of their new society. No connections to help them out in magical world other than classmates and teachers.

Also, as a kid I dreamed of attending Hogwarts, as an adult I realised I'd hate the absolute lack of privacy.

**** It's important to look at the differences though.

1. Magical vs Muggle isn't like race in that it is made up, if a muggle-born person casts accidental magic it can go bad. Obvi there isn't a difference between muggle-born and pure blood.

2. It's not black and white about which party are the colonisers. Muggle society isn't being wiped out and Muggle-borns can stay in touch with them as much as they like outside of Hogwarts. IMO the fear that all the wizarding ways will get wiped by muggles matches the analogy better (which again doesn't excuse the hatred).

Though I agree in some ways, I like the fics that let the kids bring along some muggle things like music and toys.

People forget that the function of the world building was to create a wonderous and magical world, not a utopia.

*** I still don't beleive that Severus was bullied relentlessly like many assume/accept from the books. We have one memory that Snape left out so Harry could see how "bad" his father was. You know, the kind of clever and sly thing that Slytherins pride themselves on.

Sirius admitted they were hard on Snape, but also said that Snape gave as good as he got. And Snape was admitted by many to be good at Dark arts. Sounds like he used some nasty curses on them, and probably ambushed them when they were alone kind of thing to me.

And there was a war on at the time. If Draco was any indication (you know, Snape's godson Draco) then a lot of Dark families were mocking the light siders about the deaths that were happening and telling them they would be next. Draco told Harry that if he didn't be careful, he would go the way of his family. Sounds like a death threat to me.

Besides which, when Snape turned into a bullying git as an adult, I lost all sympathy for his "poor troubled past". He's an adult in the books, there's no call for his behavior.

You might think I'm excusing bullying, but with the unreliable narration going on in the books, I'm thinking that the truth is a bit more complicated than that Snape was a poor bullied victim.

But judging by how the teachers hardly did anything to stop the fighting between students, it is highly likely that the halls of hogwarts resembled the island of Lord of the Flies more than a little bit. Very darwinian.

******** One can argue that he considers it the worst memory because it's the final nail in the coffin for Snape's early choices and destiny. He probably believes that had he not uttered those fateful words and severed his friendship with Lily, he might have been able to make better choices and get a better future. Mind you, while I suppose it's /possible/ (this was shortly before summer, and it's theoretically possible that another summer of reprieve from House politics and tensions might have changed his mind and allowed him to repair the friendship and distance himself from junior DEs), I find it very unlikely. At most it would probably just have delayed the inevitable.

***** They also forget the whole him joining a hate group that wanted to eradicate his best friend and the woman he loved whole class (i want to say race but muggleborn is not a race) .

Snape wasn't this lonely kid with no friends except Lilly who was driven to the death eaters because of bullying.

You find out in I think the last book you see his memories of him trying to applogize to Lilly. She points out that he hangs out with and is supportive of the blood supremacists and this is prior to joining voldemort. He's here to applogize for calling her a slur but he sees nothing wrong with the word or the mindset behind it. He has no problems using it on a muggleborn who isnt Lilly so she essentially tells him to shove that applogy up his ass and rightfully so.

And when he joins Dumbledore its for Lilly not for stopping the carnage or having a change of heart about his bigotry.

I do personally think he learned to stop being bigot over time. I think by book 7 he genuinely cared he was killing innocent people and gave a shit bout that. But it took him a long time to get there and it didnt stop him for being vindinctive petty and spiteful.

Sirius and Remus may have bullied him as a kid but he was about to let Sirius be executed and the actual killer go free because of his grudge. He also outed Remus and got him fired seriously hurting future chances for stable employment due to the stigma for being a werewolf.

And of course dumping all his past baggage on unsuspecting kids that had nothing to do with it.

So yes the marauders were awful to Snape and I do think Sirius is biased but I dont think he is right in saying he was awful right back and showing Snape as becoming radicalized soley because the marauders were bullies is super inaccurate. Its a murky situation at best and there is much more going on than both James and Snape liking Lilly and like nerd jock dynamic.

**** Sirius tried to get Severus killed in a “prank” that was the event that makes me realise it's not slytherin cunning or slyness or whatever, it is real. And even as an accomplished Occlumence or however u spell the word since autocorrect sucks, there's no way for him to defend against a counter attack from Potter. First he didn't realise or acknowledged the possibility that potter can strike back, second he did not consciously defend his mind thus his mind was open or maybe that memory is to temporarily distract his opponents. Anyway,the memory is real, the feelings is real and he is bullied.

And the memories of him n lily during their first year when James knocked Lily's books to the ground and smirking at Severus? That was not what I say bullying but it's at least what I define as a acknowledgement of their mutual hatred or dislike for each other.

Severus May be a bully later on but he was in some way shaped by his experience on the hands of bullies and the inaction of the teachers around him. When dumbledore forced him to shut up about the werewolf incident, that's what I think triggers a whole series of him going darker and darker.

Teachers r important. And their inaction or bias or just blind ignorance shape a kid, a valuable clay that can be molded by their perspective of the world. In some way, I blame the teacher for not doing anything, of the result of how Severus is as a person later on.

I understand how the lack of teachers in such a large environment may contribute to them not really see every bullying in the school but isn't that what perfects and head boys are for?

I refuse to believe bullying is ok and the consequences are equal to none in Hogwarts.

**** thing is normally crime happens like it just does and any society crime is always a constant. now the differences would be the rate of crime happening sure but given the reason that they are in fact people who commit crime specifically because it's a cost benefit analysis of what are The pros and cons of committing this crime.

Now we can talk forever about the reasons for people to commit crime. But I believe in situations where you have memory charms and love potions and various other forms of manipulating individuals I don't believe you would actually either I believe it would increase crime significantly if there wasn't a control for it. Now the main reason I find this problematic is because love potions are readily available to literal children and it's seen as like mild pranking to love potion somebody and you're basically obsessed with the person you give this love potion to. Like the amount of things you're willing to do while on a love potion or even worse than the things you're willing to do while on like roofies.

not to mention there's the issue that you know rapists don't rape people because of the sexual aspect of it it's more of a power control dynamic so given the supremacy ideology of pure blood wizards I would not put it past some of these individuals to be prevalent rapists especially if they could just erase the memories of whomever they rape.

All this to say I don't believe there was ever a confirmed counter charm or counter spell to the memory charms mentioned.

So we have to asume that every other object is thought seperatly (students from other houses don't have canon appearences in other classes). So Year 1-5 are 20 classes in itself. Even if all Newt classes are joint classes that are two extra classes. When you subtract the three classes that are joint classes of two houses you still have 19 parallel classes - but only 12 teachers and one of them only teaches at night.

Yeah, a teacher is not going to read that. The teachers are already vastly outnumbered, they aren't going to spend hours more reading Hermione's work. If a teacher asks for two feet on something and you give them four feet? You instantly failed because you didn't follow basic instructions.

---

That not ONCE did the DMLE get involved at Hogwarts. Hogwarts, a place that is packed with children. A place that has Draco "My Father will hear about this!" Malfoy. Someone HAD to be potioning the population or mass confunding or obliviating. When Malfoy Senior DID show up in second year, that was obviously part of his plan, and not because of any news getting out.

---

The fact that Harry did not look or act in a way that supports his abused past? Between the overworked/jammed in a cupboard for ten years/malnutrition, that should show obvious signs. Add in the oversized clothing. How did nobody comment on this.

Some authors add a /dash/ of abuse to add "character". JKR dumped the whole sack in, opened up another and dumped that in too.

---

The Epilogue was a pile of crap.

No seriously, it was.

- Hogwarts was in tatters from the battle.
- You have hundreds to thousands of people killed from the camps, the snatchers, DE attacks, and the final battle itself. And this is the magical side too.
- Ollivanders' merchandise is gone.
- Government in tatters
- Economy is dead because of raided stores, prices raised from fear, and other things.
- Government is effectively a skeleton crew.
- Goblins are pissed off because of the break-in

How were they not conquered by the purebloods, another country, the muggles, the ICW, or another magical country?

Forget nineteen years, they were STILL recovering from Grindelwald when Voldemort first showed up. They would be recovering for DECADES after Voldemort finally died, and the Voldemort war 2.0 had a bigger effect on Magical Britain.

Also, I just came out of a similar situation with my own mother recently, and upon reading the series again, I've come to realise "jeez, despite being told all that shit like I should die, I act EXACTLY like Harry."

I don't moan or groan about my situation, I was taught not to. I have angry spurts when people don't listen to me, particularly adults. I go from 0 to 100 within a second. I am still finding out about things like "Hey, having your mother have a go at you about your weight (when you are as skinny as a rake), as well as telling you that you should die, isn't really normal.

*** I thought the second Voldemort war was relatively short compared to the first. He had one year to prepare which was wasted mostly on the prophecy, one year more openly against the ministry, and one year in power. Given that it's been experienced before, people probably left earlier once he was known to be active. Especially people who run businesses and are high profile. They could have returned easily enough and brought back supply for places like Diagon.

Doesn't Ginny ask what people will do about wands after Ollivander is taken? She is told that other makers will have to do. Clearly Ollivander was the best, but there are others.

For physical rebuilding, think of how fast Europe rebuilt post WWII and apply magic. Even magical France helping a bit could speed it up for Britain. The only area to really be truly devastated was probably Hogwarts. The ministry wasn't destroyed, nor was Magical London.

Voldemort never had the focus on mass terror that he did in the first war because of Harry.

Magical Britain effectively became WW2 Nazi Germany, where people were gathered up and put in camps based on arbitrary facts. This messes with the morale of the people, and makes them really distrustful of their fellow neighbors. Selling people out for reward or over an argument. Outright lying to get rid of an enemy. Etc. This sort of thing alone took decades to get over.

People won't come back after something like this just because the war is "over". They were already treated like crap before, and why would they come back on a risk of maybe. Especially if they are coming back to an effectively dead country.

Voldemort did not order Malfoy anything related to the attack on Katie Bell, and if you condemn Voldemort for pressing Malfoy, congratulations, Malfoy did the same thing to Katie Bell, with the added distinction that she was a civilian from the opposite side, which makes it a worse offence.

the only one in that family i could see possibly getting a lighter sentence than life is Narcissa.

Since Crucio is an Unforgivable, I'm sure lethal magic is allowed in self defense. Malfoy would be heading to jail for decades/life, both for starting the fight and for attempting an Unforgivable.

But that all said, justice is as rare as hen's teeth in Harry Potter. There are more adults that deserve at least some jail time or a suspended sentence than those who don't.

But in canon, he acts like he's spying on *Voldemort* on *Dumbledore*'s orders. Snape is just the worst spy ever who has the best luck to be a better Occlumens than Voldemort.

  “She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o'clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.”

  “But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort's back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is ---”

  “For heaven's sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort's name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It's about keeping your head down and your temper under control!”

That's an interesting question, but for all we know their teaching style and progress is terrible and maybe the Hogwarts curriculum could be taught in 2 years? We lack any kind of comparison what modern teaching methods could accomplish. I'm certainly not impressed how kids are handled who underperform (like Neville or Hermione in broom flying)

I mean, we can see in Arthur that people can manage to graduate Hogwarts being barely literate (he's their expert for muggles and doesn't know how to spell Electricity or know much of anything else about muggles).

I guess it can be argued that I as a muggle can't judge how good their magical education is, maybe it's brilliant, but the things that I can judge (muggle studies, general teaching style and demeanor, actually teaching someone how to write an essay or how to research something --- is everyone just supposed to pick that up on their own?) are in a sad state.

******* These are all really good points - magical pedagogy is actually really interesting but there is SO little detail about it in HP canon. How to the teachers become accredited? How does /anyone/ become accredited? There are no wizarding unis mentioned in the books (let alone teaching colleges), so I suppose we're to assume that a combo of less than 15 NEWTs determines someone's aptitude for any and every wizarding career? How are healers trained? How about upper-level ministry workers? Dragon handlers? I guess it can be argued that the books are about a child and sort of through his POV - and Harry is not that interested in academics and wouldn't be that interested in learning about the finer details of post-secondary education and vocational training.

(As an aside, I really enjoy when fics try to answer these questions, even with just throw-away sentences about x person completing a potions internship or moving abroad to get additional training.)

#+end_quote

100% agree - though I think this can serve to show that muggle culture is shunned to an extreme degree by wizarding society (despite the population of half-bloods and muggle-borns clearly outnumbering purebloods?); so much so that not even the ministry “experts” really understand the basics. There is no interest (read: funding) to develop the department any further than it is. I think AW's incompetence was also meant to showcase his characteristic as sort of a loveable buffoon, though it was semi-retconned in later books.

Doesn't really hold up to scrutiny, though - I mean, such a lack of understanding of muggle culture would create HUGE issues for the ministry. How would DMLE employees know how to obliviate muggle witnesses appropriately without knowing what was ordinary in the muggle world? How would the MoM know how to liaise with the British PM? How would any curse-breaker be able to work with muggle items that had been cursed? Etc etc. Tbh it's just another example of JKR building the world around the characters (Arthur Weasley) rather than building the world and placing characters in it.

** As a whole, the universe is pretty incomplete. JK Rowling wrote a really complex story but didnt bother to create a complex universe in which the stories existed. If you consider the way she laid out the school administration, the ministry, the magical world as a whole you see there are a million holes and incomplete ideas. I think thats why its such a popular choice for fanfiction- there is a lot left to the imagination that fanfiction writer can play with.

to pick one item - i was always surprised by how prepared Hermione was in the last book. All of a sudden she's reased her parents memories, created a magical bag, packed up everything they need to go on the run for months, learns wards that make the whole tent disappear and has enough potion/dittany to heal splinches and all manner of injuries that could happen. Did she learn all of this just by reading extra books in the library?

Neither Harry or Ron thought to even have a go-bag packed and she was this prepared? I know she is a Mary-Sue but i always thought there needed to be a mention of her having extra training to prepare for the coming year. It always came off as a little unbelievable to me.

** Looking back its awful how Practically no one faced any consequences.

Harry Lived in a cupboard. Was locked in sometimes. Often hit by his aunt and uncle. Forced to do all chores and tasks without reprise. Starved. Verbally and emotionally abused. Probably Physically too. Nothing happens to them. Nothing at all. So child abuse is forgiven and has no consequences. After all Tom Riddle had the same exact childhood, but he was 'born' evil I'm sure.

Students regularly bullied and attacked each other in hogwarts. Teachers stood by and did nothing. I get that name callling can't really be helped with or stopped. But luna's stuff gets stolen all the time. She's locked out of the dorm room too? That never really was addressed.

Teachers and adults are for all intents completely unreliable in times of crisis and its shown that its Okay.

Law enforcement should have been involved multiple times through out the books. But such things were inconvenient for Both Dumbledore and the Ministry so that was thrown out.

The sheer scope of the ministry's power. I mean it's basically a authoritarian dictatorship. People shoved in prison with no trial. Executions with no trial (Crouch Jr). State propaganda in the form of the Daily prophet.

Memory charms on muggles left and right. How many people thought their relatives died in a accident. When really they were murdered. Or were tortured to death. Hell maybe muggles got kidnaped and enslaved.

Hermione erases her parents memory. Because they would not understand or approve of their daughter fighting a war at 17.

Then there's the fact that I'm sure that most death eaters never went to prison after both wars.

Those books had a whole lot wrong with them.

Now? Not so much. Yeah, there's always a risk when you play game. Sometimes accident happen from which one player recovers and some other player with the same accident doesn't and then it's the end of your gaming career.

It's illogical, too. The game goes on and on until the snitch is caught. And the point for that is 150. And in majority of matches it the the team who catches wins the game. They rarely loose. Because there's only 10 for every quaffle in hoop.

And there is no protection if a person falls of their broom from up high in the sky. And as advanced as wizarding medical science is shown. It's of no use if the person is already dead. Or had their bones broken and splinters embedded in organs.

In first book, we could see how easy it is to jynx a broom during match and people would pass it off as malfunction or foolishness done by rider.

In PoA, when Harry fell of his broom, he was only alive because of Albus' quick spell casting. Because others were too busy gasping and seeing him fall.

** Just how shit the canon pairings were and how badly some characters ended up because of it.

- Ginny/Harry - It felt extremely forced in the last couple of books and Ginny's character went from being a starstruck girl to suddenly becoming Harry's ideal woman; it just made her character feel less real. She essentially became a Mary-Sue who offered a rather boring relationship for Harry.

- Hermione/Ron - They had next to nothing in common when Harry wasn't involved, they had frequent arguments that could get rather vicious and they had extremely different personalities; Hermione being academic and driven (to the point of losing focus on everything else) and Ron was laid back to the point of laziness and had clear jealousy issues.

- Bill/Fleur - God, Fleur was such a wasted character. A powerful witch who was able to solely entrance a dragon that would have taken a dozen wizards to down; she was also strong-willed but still had a soft spot for the people she cared for. And so Rowling decided to make her a character that essentially existed to make people see how cool Bill was to marry her, a Molly 2.0 that went from being a snob to being a housewife in a cottage.

- Remus/Tonks - A clearly unhealthy relationship that started because....reasons? Tonks started as a fun and bubbly woman who had a childish sense of humour. But for some reason, she ended up as a clinically depressed and unstable woman who would do anything to be with a man who clearly wasn't fully in love with her.

There are probably others and I'm sure that fans of these pairings will strongly disagree but from where I stand these canon relationships are either unhealthy or just don't make any sense.

*** I think Remus was in love with her, but had too much self-hate to build any kind of heathly relationship.

As much as I love the pairing in fanfictions where Remus work on himself and overcome his confidence issues, in the books it really really isn't good.

Remus clearly wasn't ready for any relationship, was strongarmed in it by peer pressure, and just lost the last two people he knew well and cared about (Sirius and Dumbledore). But None wanted to hear about that, and I don't think he had the mental strenght at the moment to still say no. He caved, not because he was ready, but because other relentlessy told him to.

I mean, I don't care how much you love someone, and how much they love you, don't start a relationship with a self-hating person, who is deeply grieving and in the middle of a war in top of that. I have a hard time seeing how it could become heathly.

I'm pretty sure the /only/ reason Rowling hooked them up (other than to """prove""" that Lupin was straight) was to give Harry a godson who was somehow special, even by wizarding standards (is a metamorphmagus), and could be orphaned without it feeling contrived (parents are active combatants in a war). Next to that, that he's old enough to be her father, never expresses any attraction to or interest in her at any point, and has lost two of the most important people in his life in as many years, doesn't really matter, I guess.

Additionally, we don't know what Fleur's values are or what her plans were post-Beaubatons, so it's not a leap to think she'd be interested in having a family and settling down. There were no real indicators that she'd choose to assist with a foreign war, either - why would we assume that she'd take charge in a civil war she has no personal stake in prior to her marriage? Tbh it would be most realistic for her to travel back to France after the triwizard tournament and never feature in the books again.

To be honest I do find it a fairly accurate description of her and could see some of people's dislike for her, even in canon being because of it. Sure some things in the wizarding world need to be changed but Hermione is literally the type to say everyone is wrong just because she doesn't agree with it and she also seems to have an issue with anyone being better than her at anything and in the areas she has no chance of competing on the first try, she decides to have no interest in it at all instead of attempting to become better. Flying a broom/quidditch being an example. Hell just look at the way she treats Luna. I get it, Luna is different but Hermione is so caught up on it basically having to be written down by a reputable source to believe it that she thinks Luna is crazy despite seeming to have no doubts about magic otherwise. The same Hermione that was blinded by Lockhart because of his books which likely cemented her interest in him.

She gets better with age in a believable way.

Their war was literally fought and won by teenagers while adults sat with their fingers up their butts. Most were groomed for it (at least two generations). This is what members of the Order of the Phoenix were saying about the importance of a seventeen year old in a war.

** Just how fucked up Snapes life was. He grew up in a dirt poor household, his parents might have been abusive (I think canon only alludes to Snape hating his father and all muggles, but doesn't outright state why; and he knew dark magic before his first year), then he gets bullied in school (even if the marauders were a "mutual" thing I doubt the slitherins were nice too a poor half-blood from a disowned mother).\\
He leaves school becomes a death eater, repents (for questionable reasons), is then forced to teach and made a head of house at 20 or 21years old after he had been out of school for just a few years, with no experience in teaching what so ever (nevermind that his first students would have known how he used to be a death eater and some of them went to school with him!).\\
Now being a teacher he always has the weight of Dumbledores warnings that Voldemort will return hanging over his head, and once Harry Potter enters school the signs point to that more and more. Eventually he does return, Snape is once again a spy, has to kill Dumbledore, gets even more hated by everyone than before and in the end he gets murdered over nothing.

In light of his biography it's not even that weird he had this creepy fixation with Lily, he had a normal teenaged crush on her and hadn't gotten over that when she died and since then the women in is immediate surroundings where students and professors neither group was his age or appropriate to have a relationship with. And it's similar with many other issues around him, he was a weird kid but in a normal environment would probably have grown out of it he just never got the chance being stuck in school.

I think the one really big issue with them movies is that they chose actors that are too old to play the adults, the potters died at 21, Sirius at 35, Snape and Remus at 37 but all of them were portrayed by actors 10-20 years older, which to me at least takes a lot of the tragedy from the story. Because with the older actors it feels like they had a life somewhere in between school and Halloween '81 when in "reality" they didn't.

** Hogwarts is a sacrilege on the name of school. Yeah, there's a giant historical castle with a deep and diverse history. Yeah, it's a magical castle with enchanted ceilings, moving staircases, gothic towers, walls lined with thousands of talking portraits, residential ghosts, a deep dark forest, secret passages, exotic scenic views and all that. But those aren't what makes aschool. But by the 19th century it was in serious neee of restoration. It would not have been bad had it been some minor school but it's seriously Ivy league (You think Lucius Malfoy and all those prejudiced purebloods are going to have their children get in something less than the most prestigious/famed school that Britain Wizardry had to offer).

•It's bland. The only recreational activity the school offers for year is a weekend Hogsmade trip, Quidditch, a Choir, Dueling Club that was started by Lockhart, of all people (and didn't even lasted a year), and DA(which was illegal under Dolores' rule). Don't even count Slug Club. There are no clubs that we know off (as ignorant as Harry can be, there gotta be mention of some in whole 7 books). No club for games or even magical clubs.

•Staff needed to be changed. Not everyone, mind you. But some.

Horace Slughorn was biased. He favoured those with fortune and riches and connections.

Rubeus Hagrid (I love the guy, and he's great with creatures but he's not a teacher material) with his deep brogue (nearly illegible) and disregard of safety.

Binns is a ghost, for everything holy, a ghost. Children sleep in his class and chat and mygod, who I don't even want to know which Era's history this man teaches.

Sybil Trelewany because I don't think you can teach how to divine future. You can train those with inner eye, but can't give them inner eye. You can teach them how to interpret it, what symbolizes what, how to tell frauds from real.

Severus Snape (Somedays I like him and other days I do not)- Brilliant, a genius but too sarcastic, too callous, too impatient to be around children. He never wanted to be a teacher.

Do I need to even say anything about DADA teachers? I don't anything about others to comment.

• It's prejudiced. All Slytherins are labelled as Voldemort supporters, sympathisers to his cause, mini Death Eaters. Yes, there are some who will one day have unforgivables on their wands and Dark Mark on their arms. But whose fault is it? There will always be some who will join him but if a little help was given just how many would not had joined the dark side. And, yes, some Slytherin are bigoted, they sneer '𝑀𝑢𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑', '𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑡𝑦𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑', '𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠'. But is this not what they're taught. Since they could toddle on. Since they start understanding. That they're superior. And blood is everything. The purer the better.

But what I am saying is he just did enough to come as winner no matter who won. If Voldemort won he was safe at Hogwarts and If Harry won we saw what happened. The only reason he died was because he didn't took into consideration the ownership of Elder wand.

The first time he compares Flint to a troll ("Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him") is during the first Quidditch game, just after Harry got a very up close and personal look at a troll, I don't think it's meant to be a derogatory statement on his heritage as much as "this guy looks like that monster that nearly killed me last week". He sticks with the comparison in the next book, so I think the takeaway here is that Flint actually does look like a troll.

Nah dude that's a love potion.

4) Snape being ultr victim good guy (gag). He's a Slytherin playing both sides. End of story.

✓ I mean, Hogwarts is a boarding school. Children stay there for months. And you're telling me they don't have dorm/hostel in-charge? WTF.

How much Lady Rowling thought that teachers work.

Back to the point, teachers acting as Head of Houses teach main courses. McGonagall - Transfiguration; Mrs. Sprouts- Herbology; Flitwick- Charms; Snape- Potions. Theses four subjects are taught from 1st year onwards and nearly every student takes two or three as elected subject for their NEWTS.

✓Also, McGonagall on top of all this is Deputy Headmistress.

And we know, that teachers also do patrols at night, to ensure that students are in their respected dormitories.

✓And, do Hogwarts Faculty members have no families? All teachers dine in Great Hall for breakfast and dinner. It's rare that teachers aren't up there in their seats. Ok, there are some teachers over 80. They don't have close families. Weird, but.. I guess alright. Now there are some teachers in their 30s,40, and they have no families. No.. fucking way. Not everyone is Snape.

No wonder, students get away with so much shit. Hogwarts is so freaking understaffed.

Anyways, I end my rant.
