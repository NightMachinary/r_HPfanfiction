It can be a main part of the story or a minor part.

Maybe Harry's injured or captured currently, or for other various reasons, someone has to pretend to be him, and realizes that Harry's life isn't what they had previously thought.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new, would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine. Anyone can be the main character.

Note not looking for self inserts. Looking for book characters pretending to be Harry


** The most famous one is our classic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), in which Voldemort (at least he thinks he's Voldemort) pretends to be Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9541467/1/The-Heir-Of][The Heir Of]], linkffn(9541467): Voldemort killed Harry in the Graveyard, and the Horcrux wakes up. They decide to work together, for now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13195996/1/Harry-Potter-Self-Insert][Harry Potter, Self-Insert]], linkffn(13195996): Our sub regular [[/u/15_Redstones][u/15_Redstones]] replaces canon Harry Potter and is freaked out. He's still pretending to be Harry Potter though.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

** linkffn(Created, Harry Potter by JBean210). Harry leaves after year one to study Sinanju with Remo & Chiun along with being tutored in magic by Remus. Albus expects it to only last one year before Harry returns, as required by the grand plan, and arranges for polyjuiced body doubles. Harry has other ideas.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after first year and is immediately banished to his room without his wand or books. Things look bleak until two men arrive-Remo and Chiun-to take him from the Dursleys to teach him Sinanju in fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. But what will this do to Dumbledore's carefully-laid plans? Harry Potter/The Destroyer series crossover.
