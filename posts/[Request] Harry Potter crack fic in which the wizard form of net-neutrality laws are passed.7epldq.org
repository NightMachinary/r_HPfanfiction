** You mean like the 'apparation lisence'? Only for all magic?

Like, pay to use 'Wingardium Leviosa', 4 galleons gives unlimited use for 7 years.

Wanna use the Floo? Can only be used if you pay 10 galleons per year plus 6 knuts per use.

I don't like this idea...

*** Like the Unforgivables being the Potters' IP and the Death Eaters getting hit with lawyers for using them without a licence.

Or Voldemort embarrassing himself in front of his cronies and lackeys when all he gets out of a Killing Curse is "The spell you have chosen is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.

No, nothing so crude. Just, if you want to have your fireplace connected to the Floo network then you will have to pay an annual Network Maintenance Charge. And that one actually goes into maintenance of the network too. For the most part. The Floo Network Surveillance Office is covered in that too.\\
Per-use is on the other hand charged via a tax on the price of Floo Powder and goes straight into the minister's coffers. That's why the market for bootleg powder is so big. Though, I would advise against trying to get your powder cheaper from some Knockturn Alley mixer. They tend to be of dubious quality with whatever filler they have at hand, making for a decidedly unpleasant ride. And most of the mixers are known to the LEPers anyway.\\
If you want to save a couple of galleons, go over to the continent and buy your powder in France or Austria. It is just as good as ours, regardless of what the Prophet may want to tell you when they run another scare story about someone being splinched by not using the Ministry's over-taxed crap.\\
As for myself, I use Russian Cold War surplus powder. It is quite a bit stronger than most people are used to, so a pinch really should be just a pinch and not the fistful you see people throw around.

** Linkffn(triumphant, the dreamer) purebloods create IPs for marketable spells not on the spell but on the outcome. So if you invent a spell that does the same thing as another one, you can't sell your spell as direct competition isn't allowed.

(At least I think this is the fic.)

  Heather's not exactly sure how she got here, but at least the role of 'older sister' is a familiar one.
