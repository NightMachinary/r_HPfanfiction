  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

#+begin_quote
  Born two years before the prophecy, Tom Riddle does not mark Harry as his equal, but life has never been easy for Potters. How will an intelligent, and independent Harry, fit into the two dimensional wizarding world? Will he conform to the prescribed paths or will he resist the manipulations of the powers that be? Harry/Fleur eventually. OCs major part of the story. More inside.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

**** What's going on with this one? I just started reading it, but after the into theres no mention of the dementor attack whatsoever....its like it never happened. Am I missing something? Because I expected a story where Harry slowly recovers from the effects of a dementors kiss and it doesnt seem anything like that so far tbh.

***** Well, he didn't have his soul sucked out. He had the horcrux sucked out. And he does recover. Keep reading. He has a hard time performing magic in the mornings. And the story isn't really about the dementor attack. It barely got mentioned in OotP anyway.

*** Well, this one has Hermione saying "damn" the whole time, but a second later chiding Ron for "Language". Everyone says "Jeez", "Damn" and stuff like that all the time, it's really obviously american.

Hermione, even when American, wouldn't say "Jeez". If anything, she'd say "Jesus". Also, chapters 2-5 alone have 30 (!) instances of someone saying "Mate". Maybe that's how people talk, but I wouldn't write like that...

It has some great ideas, but the poor language overall makes me flinch constantly and not enjoy the story too much :(

** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) fits, and if you like that story also try linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter by nonjon).

Otherwise I can recommend linkffn(Oh god not again!)
