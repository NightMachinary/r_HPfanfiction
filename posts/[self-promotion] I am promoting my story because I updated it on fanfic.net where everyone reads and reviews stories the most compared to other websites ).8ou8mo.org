I guess I need to "SELL" my story, like Achille said in another thread. So here I go, I'm going to try to do that. I'm sorry if it's bad. I think I'm better at actually writing a story than trying to talk about it.

My story is an adventure style story, it takes place entirely post-Hogwarts, and in a substantial sort of AU - I said "SORT OF" because the only things I flat out CHANGED were a few minor details here and there, and a single major one, which is that Voldemort stayed stuck in Albania as a wraith throughout the entirety of the Hogwarts years! I don't know if I do consider it an AU, because I consciously try to keep everything canon, the magic system and everything, but I am making EXPANSIONS to the lore, in areas and places that were never talked about in the books - ie, how vampires work, what life is like in magical america, and how nonhuman magical societies work and just how many there are. But the things we ALREADY KNOW ABOUT from the books, I haven't actively altered except two or three minor things. :)

I started this story because I was very tired of reading canon rehashes. So I made this as my base so I can do entirely original stories out in the world after Hogwarts, with lots of different people and places involved. :)

I have seven chapters so far, most of them are the same general length, except the first chapter and the seventh chapter, which is 100 pages long. A good sized chapter, and a very big event that I've always wanted to see done in a story. So I did it myself, like Thanos would say! :) How I've been updating this story is that I'll write several chapters ahead, and then post them all at once. So it gets updated in batches. I don't know if that's okay for some of you or not?

I also really, really wanted to focus on nonhuman characters, so that's kind of a reason why I wrote this story too. :) Most of the main cast are nonhumans!

Also I love worldbuilding so I do a looooot of it in this story. I'm sorry if it's too much, if I go overboard or something! I just really love making a world. :)

But even though my story is an adventure, it's also a story of life and consequences. Things that happen affect people, in different ways and in a lot of ways. Things that happen don't get hit with a reset button, or get swept away like it didn't matter to begin with. Things that happen in the plot tend to overlap - because in real life things don't WAIT for the end of a school year to happen, like conveniently happens in canon for Harry all the time. Things jumble, things overlap, and things overwhelm you. Other people have lives that continue on and change when the main character isn't around. That's a big part of my story, and it's going to have a few timejumps every now and again because of it. Life keeps going, it doesn't stop or wait for any one person.

Mostly, some of the things that affect people in the story, how they're affected, how that shows up in them, and what they do about it, that comes from my own life and my experiences. And I wanted to really at least try and get that right in the story too.

So yes, this was important for me when I started writing this, and I'm still writing it. A story about the chaos of life and everything that happens in it, and how it affects everyone. I guess I wanted it to be realistic like that. Though, of course in real life there are some things that just never get solved, or answered, and that's going to happen a few times too. And it's going to frustrate the characters, like it should.

I do try to ask and answer some maybe difficult questions, about governments and morals and laws, and how things work, how they change, and maybe how they should or shouldn't even change. Sorry, it's spoilers here so I can't get into it. But I am trying as best I can to raise questions I think would be raised by...certain events.

I also do try to do some foreshadowing sometimes, and I've tried leaving most things not spelled out to the reader, so they can maybe figure things out themselves. But I don't know if I did this in any good way, because Achille said one of the mysteries was confusing after it was resolved. But I'm going to keep trying it anyway.

i guess about characterization and characters, I could say this: they're just people. This was also important to me, because I hate bashing, I hate caricatures and cardboard cutouts. I just wanted a story where people are people. Not evil for evil's sake, or like "the comic relief" character. People...are just people, in my story.

As for the main character, she's a female Harry, and she's bisexual - and I know a lot of people here don't like that, but sorry I can't change it now. :)

She's...a leader, most of all. She's strong, and she's compassionate, and determined, but also very, very far from perfect or even unbeatable - there are any of a dozen characters who could easily beat her, and she gets beaten a few times already in the first seven chapters, to a point where she takes permanent damages. She screws up a lot, she gets things wrong, and the things that she does have as much negative consequences as positive for herself and everyone around her. And she's not too good socially - at least, not with other humans. I put a fair bit of myself into her, not just her experiences or reactions, but the fact that she is on the autism spectrum.

If you are at all interested, please take your time to read it in your own time. Maybe even review it? I like hearing my friend Achille's thoughts on my story, so I think i would like to hear other writer's thoughts on it too. :)

*** That's a very valid opinion and a very good point! And I did think about that, BUT I went with a female Harry because of a few reasons, one being that her background was already there to result in the kind of person I wanted her to be in her adult life, and two, because I do still PLAN to bring Voldemort back into things later in the story, and I couldn't just have her be some OC because she wouldn't be "destined" to beat Voldemort and so the conflict could never actually end. And that would take the world into a dark direction that I don't want it to go in. Because the world has to be at peace and okay in the end. :) And also three, I guess, because it was easy to tie in dragonspeak with parseltongue and explain that away as them being sister languages that she inherited from Voldemort's horcrux. Also her above average dueling skills.

But you're right that, for the stories I am and want to tell here, I probably could have or even should have gone with an OC.

** So I read it over and it's interesting, but also confusing. It feels like what you're doing is relying a bit too much on your readers' knowledge of Harry Potter as I didn't really find any attempt to introduce the characters or the settings. The story is about fighting for the rights of magical creatures, but why? What is the impetus for Annabelle's quest?

In your first chapter, you have Annabelle in the cupboard, but there you rely on the reader already knowing about Harry in the cupboard and the reasons for it with no attempt to develop it in your own way. In your summary above, you say she's bisexual and autistic, but none of that is really shown in the introduction to the character. In what ways does her autism manifest? Repetitive gestures and tics? Emotional distance? Inability to sense the emotions of others? Could that have been a reason why the Durselys shunted her to the cupboard?

Dudley's treatment of Harry is huge in the books, but here there's only a passing mention. You've changed Harry into a girl--how does that affect the relationship between Annabelle and Dudley? Does he still beat her up? What about as they age and become more aware of the boy/girl dynamic?

And then we're flung into adult Annabelle apparently done with Hogwarts and there's Daphne and Hermione and Norberta, but not really any explanation or development of how we got there. And then later on there's Sirius and a ... centaur? It feels like this is a sequel to another work and I've missed something--missed where all of these characters were introduced.

Your settings seem very naive. "Africa". "South America". "North America". Be specific. The idea of a single Ministry of Magic for the entire African continent perpetuates the view that Africa is a single thing when it is very much not. The Sahara Desert covers several distinct, individual countries and it's a little insulting that you just kind of skip over that. Same thing for South America--where is that action taking place? Brazil is a very different place geographically and culturally than Argentina. If you're going to have exotic settings, you need to approach them in a much more accurate way.

I like your dialog--it seems to flow naturally and I like the mechanism you've used to differentiate the spider and dragon speak, but I did see inconsistencies--I saw the * for the dragon when before there were [] and then it switched back. Make sure you're consistent with that to avoid confusion.

The other thing I noticed that is common to all new writers is telling rather than showing. The scene with Daphne has almost no build-up and it's very dry. "This thing happened and then there was a fight, the end." This is obviously a very emotional thing that happens and it's even referenced in later chapters, but in the moment there's not really any emotion at all. Your reader is experiencing the story through the Annabelle character, but there's almost nothing to actually experience. It's more like you're simply relating a series of events that happened to someone else.

So, an interesting premise, but I think you lean on your readers' prior knowledge far too much. Take your time and develop your characters personalities and motives. Be specific in the reasons they have for acting the way they do. Don't skimp on the settings--you want to create a rich world where it's like your readers are watching a movie in their heads. Your dialog is good--take the next step into showing rather than telling and your stories will be a lot more interesting and satisfying.

*** Hello! Alma's more-or-less beta here. You make a good point about the location, which I hadn't actually considered. But I /will/ defend a couple of things. First, she may have been a bit rambly in her reply below, but her defence of the "relying too much on the books" bit is quite valid; this is fanfiction. It's aimed at people who /have/ read the books, and are in fact /very/ familiar with them. Personally, hearing about the Dursleys for the nth time sounds boring, and as she said, Alma included the scene in Privet Drive not to talk about the Dursleys, but to show how Annabelle discovers her gift.

Speaking of which, it seems pretty clear that her initial experience learning that spiders are sentient, and yet treated as literal vermin by unaware humans like the Dursleys, is what first drove her to the nonhumans' cause. That felt pretty self-explanatory.

I made similar criticism to yours concerning the Daphne scene, and Alma answered with the justification (which she hasn't retyped here, that I can see) that it's a function of Annabelle being our viewpoint character: she's not experiencing clear emotions right then because she's just /stunned/. In shock. As utterly flabbergasted as you or I would be if our best childhood friend, with no warning nor explanation, suddenly tried to rape us. The issue isn't so much about Annabelle expressing her emotions /there/, as it is establishing that she was best friends with Daphne /before/, and, yeah, /that/ would be a fair criticism which she couldn't really answer for.

As to "autistic"... the way you describe how she could be written as autistic is how us healthy people would attempt to write an autistic character. However, here's the thing --- /Alma/ is autistic. She's writing Annabelle as something of a self-insert personality-wise; all she says and does in the way of social interaction are things could Alma imagine herself saying and doing; so like it or not it's very much a realistic depiction of autism.

As to Annabelle's being bisexual, or should I perhaps say pansexual, it sort of becomes clear when she's an adult, with all her past flings who feature in the story, but of /course/ it wouldn't be in the first chapter. In the first chapter, Annabelle is eleven. Few girls figure out their sexuality so early on, or are sexual at all.

#+end_quote

I'm going to disagree here. What about people that are looking for something new or like to read fandom-blind? That's a lot of readers you're missing right there. It's disingenuous as a writer, even a fan fiction writer, to assume that everyone is very familiar with the source material.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's fine, but we don't really get the sense of that. We're told it's unwanted and then they're suddenly wailing on each other. Where's the sense of shock? Fear? What does Annabelle think?

/Daphne crawled on top of her and for a moment, Annabelle thought she was joking and was about to pull her up from the bed, cajoling her to go out and see the sights. Those thoughts fled the moment Daphne's lips touched hers and she froze in shock. 'This isn't right, this isn't what ... what is going on?' Her thoughts were in a whirl and her heart started to beat faster, flooding her body with adrenaline as she tried to push her best friend off of her./

This is just an illustration of how Annabelle's reaction can be actively /shown/ rather than passively /told/. We have an interaction that Annabelle (and the reader) at first thinks is going to be light-hearted and fun in the vein of their past interactions and then it turns on a dime into something strange and terrible. All we get of Daphne in the initial introduction is some bit in paragraphs which is the definition of telling rather than showing in that it breaks the fourth wall between the reader and the story. I did like the description of Daphne coming into the room like she owned it--this gives a tiny glimpse at her personality and then that's it. More like that would have been great. Annabelle is exhausted and here comes Daphne--here's an opportunity for Annabelle to think that she's going to drag her out on the town. This give us clues that maybe Daphne is social and likes to go out where Annabelle would rather stay in, but we don't get any of that.

Fair enough. As a writer though, one does need to set expectations and if the autistic personality is important to the story, then it needs to be made clear and it needs to impact the story in some way, such as The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. If it's not, then don't mention it.

#+end_quote

Again, fair enough. Some kids know, some don't. "Sort of becomes clear" though? That makes me leery that this is another aspect of characterization that will be cut short. It doesn't need to be a big deal. Annabelle doesn't need to shout from the rooftops because I understand that that's not what this story is about and that it's merely an aspect of the character, but dropping it on the reader all at once will be confusing and awkward. Why not have little thoughts and flashbacks to when she first felt attracted to women? Or the times she was attracted to a man? It can be a simple conversation:

/Hermione leaned forward, checking to make sure no one was listening. "I've been dying to know. When you first saw me, did you think I was cute?"/

/Annabelle frowned at her friend and snorted. "No. You are so not my type." She nodded to the dark-haired young man leaning against the bar as he waited for his Guinness. "Him, on the other hand."/

/Hermione's mouth dropped open in shock. "I thought you were gay!" she hissed, sounding like an outraged cat./

/"I'm all about the equal opportunities, I guess. Did I ever tell you about my first kiss?"/

And there you go. You've introduced the concept in a kind of fun way without any drama in a way that serves the story.

None of this should be construed as a personal attack. I think the story itself has very interesting concepts, but there are a lot of opportunities for learning and improvement. Alma is a new writer and I certainly hope this doesn't discourage her from continuing to write.

***** Most of this is indeed fair criticism. (My "sort of" in the bisexuality argument was, however, sarcastic.) I'll forward it to Alma.

I'm sort of stunned that people might read fanfiction "fandom-blind", though. It's sort of in the name that fanfiction is made by, and for, fans (in most cases, and HP fanfiction is usually one of those cases). If people want to read fandom-blind to up the excitement, that's fine, but it's akin to watching a sequel before the original movie it follows up on: perhaps an interesting experiment, but very much not how you're /supposed/ to experience it. The core audience is still HP fans, and discussion here on HPfanfiction proves that that audience finds repeats of well-known canon info to be boring dredge that can ruin a fic for them.

But, my main problem in this particular story with relying on the reader's existing knowledge of the Harry Potter world is that so much is different with not a lot of explanation. In my HP knowledge, Sirius is dead as a doorknob and Harry is a boy. Alma doesn't have to rehash everything, but some clues as to why Sirius is alive and well and living with a centaur could go a long way. Think about how awesome the rescue scene could have been. /Bang! Pow! Eff you, Voldemort! Fading motorcycle noises.../

*** Oh. Okay. Thank you so much for a very helpful review! :)

Why is it a bad thing to "Rely too much on people's harry potter knowledge?" :( It is fanfiction and people are supposed to have read the books and stuff already or they wouldn't be reading fanfiction, right? I do not see why I should have to go cram in a thousand references to things everyone already knows. I specifically DIDN'T do that because I HATE IT when I read a fanfic and they start off all like "Harry had green eyes, he had a dream about a motorcycle, the Dursleys were perfectly normal thank you." I freaking hate that, because everyone's read it a million times!

Also because I didn't want to cram my intro chapter with a bunch of crap. I only put in what I needed to get MY STORY rolling. Not a bunch of useless Harry Potter repeat scenes or references.

I didn't get into "HOw Dudley treated her" or anything because my GOAL isn't to tell a story about her CHILDHOOD, or HOW SHE RELATED TO HER RELATIVES. They don't matter, they don't play into the story whatsoever. So I am not going to waste time adding useless facts about them. It's NOT RELEVANT to the story I'm telling here.

Also yes, I didn't put in anything about her bisexuality or her autism into the first chapter, because I didn't want to cram the intro chapter. But as the story goes on I do explore these things about her a little. But they're just parts of her, not some overwhelming thing that needs specific dedication. Just like for me, they're just parts of me that don't overwhelm everything else. I thought it was important to show that.

Thank you for commenting on my settings and they are "naive." But that is deliberate worldbuilding. Magical Africa is one huge society, like "Magical Britain" is in canon. The borders aren't drawn the same as muggle societies.

About "TELLING BUT NOT SHOWING" I know I did that, I know I DO THAT, Achille already told me that too. But as the chapters go on, I have TRIED to improve and not just spell things out to readers. Like about mysteries and relationships, and just SHOWING some character tics instead of saying WHY THEY HAVE THEM. But I don't think it's so bad a thing to just give ONE LINE OR TWO about something and then move on. Showing not telling shouldn't be some END ALL BE ALL, right? Like "absolutely never ever do this EVER". I don't really get bothered by it anyway.

In this case, you are changing an awful lot and asking the reader to make a lot of assumptions. I understand that you don't want to go through all of the canon rehash, but you need to introduce things to the reader in a way that makes sense. Think of someone you don't even know grabbing your hand and asking you to jump into a puddle with them. Would you want to do that? If you're a very adventurous sort, maybe. But most people are going to have questions. Who are you? Why do you want me to jump into this puddle? How deep is the puddle? What is the puddle made out of? Will there be appropriate protective footwear? What is my reward for jumping into this puddle? How can I tell if jumping in this puddle will be fun? Now, I am a person who has jumped into a lot of puddles and I generally know what they're like, but that doesn't mean I know the first thing about the puddle you're asking me to jump into. You can't expect me to blindly rely on my prior knowledge of puddles (or Harry Potter in this case) without giving me some information to go on.

I can understand that you don't want to make those two features of the character dominate her and they don't have to--but again, it's a change you're making to the known character of Harry Potter and they deserve to be explained in the context of the Annabelle character. How have these aspects of her character affected her life and made her different from the canon Harry that you're using as a framework? You can't take it for granted that your readers, who are very familiar with Harry, will accept the changes you make for Annabelle with no explanation or development.

Where is this shown? Do you make any attempt to explain this to the reader at all? When you look at the United Kingdom from a cultural and ethnic perspective, it's pretty homogenous and a lot smaller geographically. Africa on the other hand is enormous and has a vast variety of cultures and ethnicities--how do you mold all of these peoples into one magical group? What about the white South Africans? What about the northern African Arabs? The Hutus, the Tutsis, the Zulus? We've all heard about the terrible tribal wars and genocides that happen in the African continent--is that limited to Muggles? How did the Magical community avoid that calamity? This is a huge opportunity to flesh out your world and make it outstanding.

I am going to disagree, here. Showing /is/ the end all be all. Telling is passive and boring. Showing is active and exciting. Show what's going on in the story by your character's actions, thoughts and dialog. Here is an example from my story, Uninvited:

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor started to drift toward the trio and Harry saw sweat breaking out on the foreheads of the Unspeakables, even though the temperature had dipped down even more. They let go of him and took several steps back; Harry was astonished that McGinn didn't simply collapse then and there. The Dementor came closer and Harry was soon chilled through, his stomach trembling and his breath coming out thick and white.

  Horrified, yet helpless to look away, Harry could only stare as the Dementor came closer, moving its head like a dog trying to pin down an interesting scent. He devoured half of his remaining chocolate in one bite, desperately hoping to banish the sounds of his parents dying over and over in his mind. Eyes wide, he watched as the Dementor lowered its ragged hood, revealing a mottled-gray face completely featureless save for a leech-like mouth that seemed to quiver in anticipation.

  Finally, McGinn showed something other than hatred. His blue eyes seemed to ice over with fear and he trembled, nearly falling over where he stood. The Supreme Mugwump calmly extended his wand, keeping him upright to receive his punishment. Extending its long-fingered hands, the Dementor cradled McGinn's face, almost like that of a lover and slowly, inexorably brought its face to his. There was a sound almost like a sigh and Harry's ears popped.
#+end_quote

All of the action is being relayed through Harry's experience of it. Harry is /showing/ us what's happening, not just passively telling us. It's a thing all writers work on and I have to watch it myself. I'm currently working on getting rid of the word "feel". "Harry felt astonished" is passively telling whereas "Harry was astonished" is active--the astonishment is being experienced by Harry as opposed to him simply telling us that he was astonished.

Your story has interesting ideas and I think as you mature as a writer, you will attract more sophisticated readers.

****** That's not my intent at all! Your story is interesting and has a lot of potential, but you haven't yet developed the tools. Writing, like doing anything well, takes a TON of practice. You've written a lot and managed to convey your story, but there's always room for improvement. It's a very rare writer who is good "out of the box".

I used to work with an aspiring writer who has since done very well (he's half of team that writes the Expanse Sci-Fi series that has since been turned into a TV show) and I saw first hand how hard he worked at getting better. Constant feedback from writers groups, taking classes, attending workshops--all to improve at what most of us already thought he was pretty good at.

Mistakes happen. You learn from them--what worked, what didn't--and then you move on. You have the story in your head and it's up to you to deliver it the best you can to someone else. Sometimes you'll be more successful and sometimes not. You didn't do anything wrong, just maybe less effectively than you could have. :D

I just had the experience of a reader go through my 39-chapter work and give me his thoughts on each chapter and it was a very interesting experience to see the work through someone else's perceptions and he made me look at my characters and motivations in ways that I hadn't because I had them all in my head a certain way. Did I do anything wrong? No. Could I have written some things more effectively? Certainly.

I have found when someone gives me feedback like, "I liked it!" I need to ask specific questions. What did you like about it? What did you like about the part where Harry found baby Moses in the rushes? What did you think about the part where Ron swallowed a goldfish whole? Don't be afraid to ask for more specific feedback on stuff. It's the only way you can improve! :D

******** Keep on writing and learning! Read a lot of different things. I love fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, biographies, adventure stories, comic books, essays. They all have something to learn from. Don't be afraid of suggestions and don't be afraid to ask questions. Putting your writing out for others to read is very scary and very brave. Most of my closest friends don't know I write fan fiction--I'm too scared to tell them!

*** I'm very sorry you missed the entire point of my first chapter. Which was to SHOW THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THAT ANNABELLE LEARNED SHE COULD TALK TO SPIDERS! I didn't write that with the intent to showcase every usual same old Dursley bullshit "GET THE MAIL" or "DO YOUR CHORES GIRL OR WE'LL ABUSE YOU MORE" bullshit. That wasn't the POINT of the chapter or the scene.

The POINT was to show exactly when and how Annabelle first found out her ability, and how it led to the relationship with Ycu, and how that impacted her even as an adult. Nothing else. Nothing more. That was the whole point of the intro.

**** One thing you might keep in mind is that on the Internet, putting things in all caps is generally regarded as shouting.

I would have liked to see some character development for Annabelle here. There's a series of books, The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson. The first book in the series, The Gardens of the Moon, dumps the reader into the middle of a war. No ramp up, no initial character introduction, no information as to who is fighting whom and why they're fighting. It's very confusing and disorienting and a common complaint about the book is that it's too much for readers to take in. I've tried. I have the book and even knowing that about it going in, I haven't been able to get past the first chapter. Contrast that with The Eye Of The World series by Robert Jordan. There are 14 books in the series and I devoured them. The first book is a fantastic introduction to the world and the characters and sets up the action going forward. I understand that the Malazan books are excellent, but getting through that first book is a chore for most. Right now, your introduction is more Malazan and less Eye Of The World.

In your previous comment, you said, "Why is it a bad thing to "Rely too much on people's harry potter knowledge?" This is precisely why. You throw your readers into this situation where Harry is a girl and talks to spiders and give no explanation, yet you expect them to apply their existing Harry Potter knowledge to this completely new scenario. Again, what is this puddle made of and why do I want to jump into it with you? It's a lot to ask from a reader.

One thing I find I have trouble with when trying to introduce new concepts in a story is I feel like the story gets bogged down if I try and explain things too directly and just do an exposition dump. I find I have better success if I kind of sneak up on the concept and tell it through a flashback or a conversation with another character. There could have been a conversation between Annabelle and another character, maybe Daphne about the first time she spoke with a spider, for instance. Then you have a more interesting interaction between two characters and you introduce a new element to your story in one fell swoop. This also gives you an opportunity to develop the friendship between Annabelle and Daphne--Daphne can be the reader surrogate and ask Annabelle why she's so committed to the rights of magical creatures.

****** It doesn't have to be all flashbacks, but it's a way you can develop the adult Annabelle by making reference to events that shaped her in childhood. You can have conversations between characters or even dream sequences. Try not to dump information on readers all at once. They are shy and timid like deer--you don't want to spook them back into the forest! Coax them out gently.

***** Jenora originally I did PLAN on doing several flashbacks per chapter, or at least one per chapter, like one of my favorite superhero shows called ARROW does in each episode, where it tells past and present concurrently to each other, but then I kind of dropped the idea and I didn't do that... :( :( :( :( I should have stuck with that though right? Because then like you said you could know all the past stuff and the present stuff too!

****** You don't want to overuse flashbacks because that can get predictable and boring, but slow down and think about how you might introduce a new concept about the world. Maybe a flashback, maybe a conversation or an action sequence. There are lots of different ways and it's up to you to find the one that works best for the story you want to tell.

*** And also, yes, it's supposed to just jump to adulthood. Because the entire story is meant to be about her adulthood. About her life, and what she does in it. It's not some canon Hogwarts rehash. That's not the point of this story. It's to get out and explore the world and tell stories with ADULTS.

And yes, Sirius is there, because it's an AU. I SHOWED and didn't TELL about that in the chapter, where I have Annabelle tell him that he chose revenge over family before, which is when he went after Peter instead of protecting her when she was a baby in 1981, and how he didn't do that AGAIN when she was a teenager. Which means you can INFER that Sirius and Lupin and them went up to Hogwarts and Peter didn't escape like in canon. So he got to be a free man again.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that. I prefer telling my HP stories with adults as well. If I want to read about them in school, I'll read the books. But, you do your readers a disservice by not providing any background at all. Who is Annabelle? What's her motivation? Why is she so committed to magical creature rights? Who is Daphne? Why are they BFFs?

Again, this expects way too much from readers. Never expect readers to just figure something out because most often they won't and then they'll be confused and frustrated and click away from your story. Especially when it's such a big change from canon. If you're going to make that big of a change, you need to have a well thought out, plausible reason. You want your readers to continue to suspend their disbelief and keep jumping into those puddles with you and something like this just takes them out of the story.

My husband reads all of my stuff even before my beta and he's really great at pointing out things that seem to come out of nowhere. One of the things I need to work on in my own writing is realizing that just because I have the whole story in my head doesn't mean I'm telepathic and therefore everyone else will know as well. My job as a writer is to clearly communicate what's going on in the story.

Exactly. You have Annabelle give exposition--why not show this in a flashback? You could have a "storytime with Sirius" scene where he relates the events of saving Annabelle in 1981 full of exciting action and swoops down from the air on a magically enchanted motorbike. This could be a bonding scene between Annabelle and her protector, Sirius. Instead, I'm like, "Wait, Sirius is alive? Wuuuuut?"
