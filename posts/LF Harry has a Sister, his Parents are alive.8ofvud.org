so his parents are alive and Voldemort doesnt happen, but if possible...Canon still happens (if that is even possible). Well, basically i want them to visit Hogwarts and absolve their grades. There are certain Points that i will List. It doesnt have to be all of them in one, but atleast one Point additionally would be good:

1. Ginny is either Lesbian or bi and falls for his sister (they will have sex definetely during the Years...possible accidental Voyeurism by hearing or witnessing their intercourse would provide humorous moments).

2. Ron has a Crush on her and dates her (after he breaks up with Hermione(?). Also possible overheard sex or "hints" spread by Ron leaving her Room just in shorts, while Harry is on the way to the Kitchen....or whatever.

3. Harry and Hermione are dating and at some point might sleep with each other.

4. Harry and Ginny have sex, but without serious feelings. Just the hormonal teenagers.

5. Harry might be attracted by Ginny and she teases him occasionally.

6. Whether Harrys Sister is a rather shy girl or a Hormonal driven Girl, its up to the Author.


** Forgive me, but I'm confused. Are you looking for an existing fanfiction ie a fic you've read. or trying to find one that fits most of your criteria?

*** I honestly dont know, why i get asked every time i post something "detailed" as the above. There are the "Request" and the "Fic Search" options to flair the Post. I would use Fic search, if im looking for a certain Fic. I read my Post and from the 2nd sentence onward i think, i made it clear what i want the Fic to contain. So, yes, i want to know if such Fics exist.
