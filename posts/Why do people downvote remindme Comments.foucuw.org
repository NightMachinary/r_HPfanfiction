** I don't personally, but I think they do it to get them “out of the way” so to speak; to make room near the top for relevant comments.

** The entire point of the downvote is to say 'this does not contribute to the discussion.' I think people are using it correctly when they downvote a comment with nothing but that. It does add nothing. People need to care less about the score.

** Because for a while people spammed them all over the place. Just look at these threads.

It's very annoying to click on a post that interests you just to see most of the comments are remindmes.

** Mostly because there only needs to be 1 remindme post, as you can click on it to get a notification yourself, there is no need to get more than one. -so any extras gets downvoted for ignorance :P

And secondly to move the remindme posts down to the bottom/turned invisible, so they don't clutter up the top area for the real posts.

** Just to ask, how can you tell that they are being downvoted? I've been using Reddit for a few months now but can't figure out how you can tell when that happened.
