basically in strange reflections a harry from another universe whos parents survived and became Lockheart like celebrities and harry becomes the cool guy/bully with Ron to Hermione/Nevil/luna and his little sister. Also, harry has PTSD/flashbacks from the war with nazi style concentration camps. are there and fics where the good harry goes to another universe with dick harry and befriends Hermione, Nevil and luna? also h/hr


** So, what do you mean opposite (by the way, the proper link is “Strange Reflections by LeQuin” linkffn(12307886))? Our Harry turns out to be a Lockhart-style bastard and the arriving Potters are fixing the situation?
