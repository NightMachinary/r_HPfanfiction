:END:
I remember reading this but I can't seem to find it anymore.

Basically Voldemort won/the war was going very badly so Draco and Hermione perform a spell to send them back to the Marauder Era. Hermione becomes James' sister and I think Draco is his mother's cousin. They work together to stop Voldemort. I don't remember the pairings but I think it was Hermione/sirius ?? I might be wrong

Help me out, does anyone know what fic I'm talking about??


** I think you might be talking about [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13232688/chapters/30268506][Rewriting Destiny]] by mayawrites95. It's a time travel fic where Hermione becomes James' sister and Draco Narcissa's brother. The pairing is Dramione, but the rest sounds a lot like what you described.
