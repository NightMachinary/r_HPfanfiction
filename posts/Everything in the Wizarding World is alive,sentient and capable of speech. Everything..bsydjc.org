*** And the water in the bowl. And the log you just dropped into it. And the sheets you're wiping your arse with. All while your underpants are having an animated argument with your shoes, your hitched-up robe is flirting with the soap and the taps are demanding you do something about the horrible drip they are developing in this weather. The door is yelling at someone or something on the other side and the only reason the light fixture is not joining in on the cacophony is because it is still silenced from the last time it mocked you while watching you masturbate.

** I think legitimately this might be something that happens. It's my headcanon that the mirrors we see speak weren't purposefully made to do that, rather being used by wizards day after day do themselves up rubs off. So one day they speak back and comment on messed hair, or whatever they've learned is wrong with a person.

We've seen this sort of spontaneous awakening with the Weasley's car, and no one treated that as an extraordinary thing. They just accepted that the car was going to live it's life in the woods now.

So it's very reasonable this thing happens with toilets too. I'd think a toilet commenting on the quality of the offering would be a bit less pleasant than a talking mirror. So probably they receive maintenance so that doesn't happen.

** Oh gods. Your bed tells you that you snore. The books attack when you mark or dog-ear the pages. The flore comments on the state of your shoes. Oh gods the underclothes gossiping. ‚ÄúHey mark how was your day?‚Äù ‚ÄòYa it was good. I could not be leave the dirty mouth that lingerie at the pub had.' The wands talking to the other person in a duel. ‚ÄúHe really just wants to go home, not fight you‚Äù ‚ÄòNo matter what he says he doesn't hate you. He does yoga on Monday morning.'
