** A lot of Ravenclaw!Harry fics have this, for obvious reasons:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; The Mind Arts)

Although they are rarely if ever 'bookworm' like Hermione would be called.

Also linkffn(The Accidental Animagus): author makes him a fantasy book enthusiast, among other things.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

** Harry as a bookworm is also common in Slytherin!Harry fics. After all, knowledge is power. Here's one of my favorites:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - (An ongoing series which starts before year 1 and is currently nearing the end of year 4) Harry grows up with the Dursleys, never knowing that his father is actually still alive or that he has a twin brother who is the celebrated "Boy-Who-Lived." After surviving a decade of the Dursleys' abuse, these revelations leave Harry understandably bitter. linkao3(863648)
