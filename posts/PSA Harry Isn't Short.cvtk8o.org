Canonically, Harry at 17 was the same height as his dad at 21. Quoth Deathly Hallows, when Harry summoned the shades of his parents and 'uncles': "James was exactly the same height as Harry."

While actual measurements are never given, there's no indication that James Potter was unusually short; and this is textual evidence that Harry's childhood neglect and deprivation didn't diminish his adult growth.

*** Yes, this. He's still short for his age in book 3, and bothered in book 4 about being so much shorter than the other champions (who were of course all older than he was).

But he has a growth spurt at the start of book 5, and then the huge growth spurt at the start of book 6.

So basically a short kid who was a late bloomer and wound up average-tall.

If so they failed atrociously, considering that he appears downright awkwardly short in all the scenes where he's close to Hermione or Ginny.

Then again there's not much they could to about it, considering he's barely Emma Watson's height and a full inch shorter than Bonnie Wright.

Furthermore, he has a thin build, but isn't emaciated and canon suggests he was initially short and thin from living in a dark cupboard. The Dursleys fed him. Just not as much as Vernon and Dudley.

***** The issue tends to be one of consistency. In reality, a family who keeps a prepubescent child in a tiny cupboard under the stairs, makes them do all the chores, had vicious dogs set on them, has violent reactions to a natural part of their very being (think homophobes with a gay nephew), installs prison bars and dog flaps to prohibit freedom of movement and food, is not a family that otherwise just treats someone like a relatable poor parental situation would. I suppose it's a matter of what /should/ have been due to what we're given, not what factually happened.

In any case, the Dursley's would still be rotting in prison for what they did had it come to light.

****** 'Should' have been is an odd way to put it. Happy families are all alike, but unhappy families are all unhappy in their own way, and the same holds true for abusive families. Adults who abuse children are still people with internal logic, and that logic usually finds some way to make themselves out to be good people. My impression is that the Dursleys feel like they're good people because they feed, clothe, and shelter Harry, knowing that he will probably be murdered if they don't and knowing that he might be a danger to them in the future. That internal idea of being good would, I think, be threatened by the more extreme exaggerations you see in fanfiction, like belting or starving.

But either way, I think you're vastly overestimating child welfare laws at any rate. As far as we know, Harry has never been directly and visibly injured by Petunia or Vernon, and his life has never been in danger under their care. Most of their abuse is neglectful or emotional. If things came to light, they'd certainly have Harry taken away and possibly Dudley as well, but if they did get a prison sentence, it'd probably be a light one.

*** Yes, but the context clues that we can grasp from the Dursley's throughout the books suggest that they did criminally underfeed him, and greatly over work him. As I said above, I think the seven years in Hogwarts with three large meals a day, and a medi-witch that he saw yearly did a lot to counteract the years of neglect, and abuse, and there was abuse. The frypan anyone, context clues people. If Petunia was willing to do that easily, than it stands to reason that physically harming him was a regular "punishment."

Even if it is emotional neglect only, more murderers, and psychopaths have come about due to psychological abuse than physical. It's such a stupid argument, especially when within the forst 20ish minutes of the story, we see. Vernon physically shove Harry in the cupboard with what seems to be the intention of a long time.

Pretty sure it was the beginning of CoS, when Dudley mocked him for nobody contacting him on his birthday and he faked using magic to scare him. She took a swing, but didn't connect.

Canonically, Harry's treatment was more emotional abuse and neglect than physical abuse, but there are absolutely indications of physical harm as well - Vernon attempts to choke him at one point, and there's a telling comment in HBP about learning to stay out of Vernon's reach. A lot of things were humorized or dialed down for the sake of "kid's literature."

Fanon, however, would have you believe that he was scourged until nearly every inch of him is a lattice of scars; could only eat the vomit Dudley and Vernon produced when they binge ate and purged themselves to eat some more; and was kept, not in a cupboard, but a coffin and gimp suit when not being worked half to death. He's also a literal pygmy. The exaggeration is ridiculous.

I hate when people are like, "no it was just mental abuse, that's all," and don't seem to understand what context clues mean. If Harry has had at least attempts of physical harm done to him, especially when he's both older, and has other magicals keeping an eye on him, then that sets a dangerous tone for his younger years.

I would never see rape for example as a believable scene in HP stories, but I can definetly see Vernon using things like his belt on him very regularly, or Petunia using the frypan, or them ignoring when Dudley does things like push Harry down the stairs. These are all quite possible, and even probable.

All of that to say that he was occasionally deprived of adequate food to the point of starvation to punish him, and that there are big chances that it affected his health.

Heck, each time we had mention of Harry's life as a young child, there were references to him lacking food. And that's just for the food depriving part, there are multiple mention of Vernon having difficulties controlling himself while facing Harry, mention of Harry being beaten "good", the part were Harry had to dodge a "Heavy blow" from Petunia's frying pan, him being dragged by Vernon, without even speaking of the beating h took in Order of the Phoenix, and far more.

There is no denying abuse when they've been written so clearly. JKR may have tried to reduce the heaviness of it in later books but it was already far too late for that. Canon has an abuse Harry Potter.

** Seeing as he was severely malnourished, I'm surprised he grew at all :S

But imho, James wasn't tall, and I don't see Harry as being tall.

He's not "unusually" short, he's just below average, there's a difference to me. But, I mean, fanon rewrites everything else, why not height XD

Edit: True to the sub, ya'll downvoting just because we have a difference in opinion. Yeesh. It's not like I was being rude or racist or something.

Edit 2: Wow, I went from negative to positive votes. Holy crap. This sub is a rollercoaster ride.

*** I think the downvotes are just people trying to push back against fanon when it's wrong. Soooo many fics, especially Indy!Harry fics have some sort of "nutrient potion" that "fixes his malnutrition and short stature". While yes he was skinny and underfed, he spent 9 months every year at Hogwarts since he was 11, eating all the roasts and treacle tart his heart desired. He was not described as unusually short by his 5th year.

It's just the movies casting their pall over canon. Harry and Ron's actors should have been much taller and a bit better looking.

**** This is the thing, FANon can't be wrong. It's fanon, it's up to the writer. We all tweak our fics to be what *we* want, not what is canon.

But, really, people here downvote because they don't like something, not because something deserves it. And lately, the downvoting has been INSANE, and not just on comments.

And let's not even talk about the amount of butthurt that people have when it comes to slash fiction.

***** You're being downvoted because you're wrong. This isn't a discussion of what happens in fanon or personal headcanons. It's about /canon/ facts.

Harry wasn't malnourished /in the books/.

/Canon/ Harry was only short for 3 books.

James Potter was described as tall twice in the books.

Especially Ron's, which I feel is the cause of so much Ron-bashing and Dramione shipping. Then again, no one knows how kids will look like when they're all grown up at 9-11 years old.

***** They also gave all Ron's awesome moments to Hermione while letting him keep his crap moments, and Ron's performance was always a lot more comical and bumbling than Harry or Hermione's. Which is most likely the writer or director's doing, as going in Rupert Grint was the most impressive actor of the three. Emma Watson is lucky she's so beautiful because she isn't the best actor.

Yeah, Harry totally wasn't malnourished. Now, that was punishment and that was under the, falsely, perceived threat of magic being used against the Durselys. Imagine how they treated him with only the slight bouts of accidental magic before he was shipped off to Hogwarts.
