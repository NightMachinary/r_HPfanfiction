I'm currently extremely bored and I want to read something but everything I try to read is currently at a stage where they are mind-numbingly /boring/. Recommend me some fics where the beginning gets you interested. (That means I can understand what's going on, I don't want the beginning to he a mystery to me.) It doesn't need to be action-packed, I just don't want to be bored.


** linkffn(8501689) is a fun ride. Well known so you might have read it before, but if you're feeling a tad brain-dead then rereads can be good.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

*** I've already read this, but I might give it another try. After chapter 1 until he gets HK-47 is boring but I know what happens so I'll probably skip.

This was exactly the kind of thing I was hoping for btw. The first chapter is really good.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

I found it an interesting start that the main character happens to be a dragon.

** Divided and Entwined has the first murder in chapter one, the first battle in chapter two and a whole lot of people you'd expect to stay around for the story die in chapter three. After that it only gets more intense. The first half of chapter one is a bit slow though.
