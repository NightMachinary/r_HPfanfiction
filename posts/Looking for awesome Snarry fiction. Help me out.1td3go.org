Hello Reddit!

I recently got into Snarry but it seems kind of hard to find really good stories. Maybe someone here knows something I would like. Any recommendation is welcome.

What I would like:

1. For the story not to have been abandond (anything that isn't complete and hasn't been updated in more than 1.5 years counts as abandoned IMO)

2. Grammar and spelling should be at readable levels.

3. The age issue must be adressed somehow. I don't care how. It could even be eradicated completely though timetravel or never have been there at all though AU but it must at least be mentioned.

4. A relationship with both partners as equals would be nice (no assinged 'dominant'/'submisive'-personalities).

5. No MPreg. No Catboys.

Other than that I don't care about the setting, the timeline, or much of anything else. AU stories are just as welcome as semi-canon.

Thank you!

*(spot saved for= need help finding links to )*

[spot saved for after war story where harry uses polyjuice to pretend to be snape, who is supposed to be dead- and ends up finding the real snape, who secretly kills death eaters.]

[spot saved for a creature fic where snape is a creature that plays an instrument like the violin, and whoever hears his music ends up really liking it or something, and harry courts snape.]

[spot for harry is a parrot animagus or other kind of bird and crashes into snape and draco's backyard. threesome.]

[spot saved for one where harry somehow looses his magic or something, and so snape cums in him every few hours so he has magic stuff in him that way harry can see howgwarts. has to do with the military and harry being treated by muggles for nerve damage. Sounds silly, but was really good]

*Almost mpreg stories, but otherwise match your description* I couldn't find them anyways haha.

[spot for almost mpreg but thankfully not, time traveling story with harry/draco/snape. Sad/happy ending]

[spot saved for harry/snape where snape leaves harry and goes and has sex with others, only to realize he made a mistake and try to take harry back. unbeknownst to him, harry was pregnant when he left, and he had a miscarriage, and harry is depressed because of this and also doesn't want to risk taking a man back who left him. ]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3818539/1/Property-of-the-HalfBlood-Prince][Property of the HalfBlood Prince- put here because I don't think I liked this story as much but viewed it as unrealistic and because I think they start having sexual relations when harry isn't yet 18]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4124611/1/Foolish-Gryffindor][Foolish Gryffindor- put here because I think harry is in his 6th year in this one]]

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][And of course the Sacrifices Arc, starting with saving connor, the longest fanfic series out there that is three times longer than the original 7 books. It starts with Saving connor and is eventual snape mentor and draco relationship. I haven't finished it. YOU WILL CRY MORE THAN YOU HAVE EVER CRIED BEFORe. I am 50% she won't kill harry off at the end]]*

** [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][Mirror of Maybe]] Abandoned WIP, but so freaking good.

And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1226706/1/The-Paradox-of-Existence][The Paradox of Existence]], similar to Mirror but COMPLETE and the best time-travel thing I have ever experienced (except Back to the Future).

I love Snarry *so much* and it's entirely due to these two stories.

P.S. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7048220/1/Coffeehouse-Jazz-MULTIPLE-CHAPTER-FORMAT][Coffeehouse Jazz]] is good too.
