Just curious to hear of fics you may have read that completely changed your attitude about certain ships. For example, I've never ever been a drarry fan but Running on Air absolutely shattered me and put me back together and now I would die for drarry ðŸ˜… im also not a bit dramione fan though I love Break for Me on wattpad. Curious to know if anyone else has had this experience!


** I know this doesn't exactly answer the question.

But ever since I read A Cadmean victory, I've always wanted more Harry/Katie.

*** It"s crazy to me how much traction Daphne has made in the FF world. She's hardly a blip in the books but fan fiction make her and like Theo and Blaise seem SO much more involved lmao. I'll look into them! It"s a bit hard for me to get into fics with characters like that because then it feels like an OC, but I know they're not, and I want to be able to draw on references of the type of character they are and can't.

**** That makes sense. I really wanted to include it because of how it changed my perspective from Daphne Greengrass being some Ice Queen, to a much less charged romance. I don't like the true love trope. Love is love, take it where you can get it.

Not to say I like the, emotionally damaged people find their own broken form of love, because I don't. I mean just, love being nice. Like you meet someone, you talk, and you go get coffee. Not just a couple of crazed rabbits seeing how many times they can not make children.

***** I think the reason people hate on dramione is the reason I had trouble getting into dramione fics for a while. Book hermione especially would potentially forgive draco in their adult years, but I can never ever see her forgiving him enough to fall in love with him. BUT I did see a tik tok where someone put it into perspective. You can hate book characters all you want (I don't hate draco at all though just think Dramione was unrealistic for a while) but the thing about fic characters is they can be whoever you want them to be. So I was like okay. It let me open my mind to it more

****** Yeah I think the problem behind it is that it was hugely popular. As such a lot of a bad fics were written where they're just lovey dovey perfect and it really falls flat.

People also don't like the idea of her ending up with her childhood bully. Mostly because we like to think those shitty evil bullies never change and end up sad miserable adults. It's hard to accept that people grow and mature past their shitiness and can get better. (But you do have to write that in which is hard lol)

******* I totally believe that people can change from their past prejudices! In fact I hold onto that so dearly for draco especially with all the subtext in the books about him really regretting his choices and forming his own views towards the end. I just always believed hermione might be the type of person too stuck in ways to look at him and not feel trauma. But i do think there's definitely a very right and very wrong way to write them as lovers.

** The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie made me ship Sirius and Hermione. They are so perfect in it. And I love Remus and Hermione in it as well. It's probably my favorite fic of all time.

Manacled by Senlinyu made me a dramione fan. I always avoided Draco/Hermione fics but it kept getting recommended to me so I gave it a go and i was hooked. Its completely different from the style I usually go for. I usually go for very happy fics and over the top happy endings, but this one is very dark. But if you are okay with dark, it is worth the read.

*** I actually just started Manacled! I've never been a big dramione shipper either, as I said. But I actually watched this tik tok the other day (and it's the reason I finally read the drarry fic) where she said "I hate book/movie draco but love fic draco bc fic Draco can be anything or anyone he wants to and doesnt NEED to rely on his back story". And I like book/movie draco to a degree but always told myself that there was no way hermione would ever fall in lovs with draco. Forgive him maybe bit nothing more, but that tik tok made me realize I was missing out on so much great writing bc I couldn't get out of my head.

I actually go for more darker fics (not as dark as this one but still). I actually wrote a generally happy fic one time with a very sad/bittersweet ending because I don't always like sap ðŸ˜‚ so think once I get used to the harshness of Manacled, I'll probably really enjoy it

**** O I dont hate hinny and yes I read the books haven't fully watched movies actually but could you explain it to me maybe because I don't truly understand harry ginny making sense since all I saw was leaving fangirl stage becoming friend and then I dont think she ever got over HARRY POTTER while they were dating I cant quote it but something like you would only be happy chasing/fighting him(voldermort)if you really knew harry you would know he doesnt like it at all I personally feel it was just jk Rowling bad writing that led to love potion theory and the reason it doesnt make sense to me but that's mei just feel like this ginny and hermione were the only real romance options for harry if we go by canon to book 6 but then we have book 6 where hermione becomes ooc(unrational)vehemently denounces what information comes out a book and calls it cheating for following a books instruction of course she was right in the end because jk Rowling seems unable to write her as being in the wrong but let's look at hermione before close minded(lowkey sociopathic book 3 birches)(birches in replace of bitches)and let me remind you what happened in book 3 hermione was right once again no matter how much of an asshole hermione is jk rowling cant write(I'm pretty sure it wrote write as right earlier on sorry) her as being wrong(sorry for long post btw) and I genuinely dislike hermione I however don't have a real opinion of ginny besides quidditch player fangirl who(as I explained earlier)went away from fangirl but still isnt over HARRY POTTER(the caps are supposed to be dramatic slayer of Voldemort bs) back to what I was saying I still think hermione makes more sense because she was Harry's friend for 7 years she knows harry like really knows harry(while ginny doesnt make sense to me I firmly believe it was just jk rowling bad writing that's Just me I firmly respect your opinion btw

***** Those are all totally valid points and I respect your views as well! The reason I dont like hermione with harry is strictly that I think their friendship is so wholesome and healthy and I hated that people ran with that in the movies and shipped them. Like just let people/characters be friends! Not everything is romantic. Of course I understand people writing FF about it, thats a different story.

As far as ginny, I think at first she WAS very fan boy of him, but she drops that after a few years, which is when harry actually starts to really notice her. I think out of all the characters in the book, her sass is the only one that can match harrys (besides maybe Ron actually). She's also got this level of rightful humbling with harry. Harry in either Order or HBP (I don't remember which book tbh) is like venting and yelling about voldemort constantly penetrating his mind, how he took so much from him, how there's NO one who understands what harrys been through and ginny is basically like hey fuck you dude I was controlles by his diary for a whole year and almost died because of it. Because it's so tone deaf of harry to act like he's alone in his struggles and to not open his eyes to how many others it's effected. I also love their breakup in HPB because she doesn't cry, she doesnt fight it or pout. She just accepts it because she loves him so much. She knows he might go off and die or come back not be with her, but she knows he needs to do what he has to and the full on support and adoration for his journey is miles and miles beyond mature for her age at just 15. I agree that JK isn't the best writer but I do think we get a lot of special moments that show how powerful ginny is in her own right, not just when it comes to magic, and idk thats how I think it is.

****** That's the same reason I don't like Harmony that much. My issue with Hinny isn't the fangirling or anything like that, but because Ginny doesn't get to be there. We get one book where they have an interesting relationship, with sarcasm, witty banter, and legitimately caring for each other. We get to see Ginny as a pretty cool person. Then they break up. Then we get an epilogue with them being happy together. To me, offscreen romance isn't worth caring about. But that's more of an epilogue issue. With post-canon stuff, Ginny just ceases to be good, and so does Harry. She's too perfect, none of the spitfire that she was in book 6. She's like this weird, virtuous saint. Ginny from book 6 doesn't except Harry back with a big kiss after Voldemort. She hexes him. And then they go hold hands and be insufferable somewhere. It's less the pairing itself, more the works that it features in. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain

You have point A (actually, the last time Ginny really shows up is at the end of the book six, then she is just briefly mentioned in the background), and then because chapter 37 is missing, we don't know anything until the epilogue (WHAT?). Yes, both Ginny by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Mrs Granger]] made a great job to bridge this chasm and to make Ginny into a believable person.
