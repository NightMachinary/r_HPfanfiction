So I'm writing a fic and I actually broke 20k words. This is an achievement for me. It's kinda crackly but there will be serious moments in places. Linkffn(12946300)


** :( I just read chapter 6 and while I like the story very much PLEASE WHY DID YOU LITERALLY MAKE HALF THE CHAPTER'S PAGE FULL OF "OMAKE" AND REVIEW ANSWERING?! :( :( :( :( Are you trying to hit a content quota or something? Come up with more stuff to actually put in the chapters before you upload them! Or just upload them on their own and deal with them being short! Don't literally make half the freaking chapter random crap!

*** I... I actually hadn't noticed. Sorry about that.

Thing is, I kinda like doin Omakes. I /could/ hop up the word count per chapter, but that would make it longer between updates and I don't really want to do that either.

But it is getting near the point where I'd have to anyways so... fair point.

(PS: its actually more of like an eighth of the page.)

**** Doing omake is alright. Not everyone likes them, but they are /content/.

Review replies, however ... well, if a review made you edit something for the better then let it be a footnote so that people know to go back for a re-read of whatever you edited, but if it's basically people asking you questions and answering then get yourself a forum.

  "To the well-organized mind, Death is but the next great adventure." When Harry wakes up in the world of Remnant, he quickly comes to the conclusion that he's either really bad at dying, or the best there ever was.

** Really enjoying the fic so far. It doesn't have much going for it storywise since it's mostly just gotten started, but I like your fun writing style.
