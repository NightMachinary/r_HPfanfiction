Any well written fics where Hogwarts is more like high schools are today? I'm referring to parties, drinking, relationships. Don't really mind if the story changes a bit but I prefer the characters being close to cannon just not being as innocent as cannon.


** Clash on HarryPotterFanfiction come to mind. It's next generation though, which I don't mind, but some do. On mobile right now, so I can't link it, sorry.

** A potter in slytherin - lily luna potter ends up in slytherin. The link is mobile but you can google it easily enough.
