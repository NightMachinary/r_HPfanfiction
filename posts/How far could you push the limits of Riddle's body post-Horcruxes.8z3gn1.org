Let's say he was decapitated. Would he still be conscious in that brain, unable to see or speak? Obviously an entire disintegration of his body a la the backfired AK renders him a spirit. So where's the cutoff point?


** He's still mortal in a human form, however he isn't truly dead. Like anything normal could kill him (unless he magically improved his body but that's a whole other prospect) but he just wouldn't fully move on to the next great adventure.

** He'd die just like a normal person.

Assuming he didn't have any other separate protections/rituals/spells on himself, which there is some evidence may have happened from his own statements but is tepid at best.

** Why do authors keep focusing on inventive ways of killing or destroying Voldy? If people used the same amount of creativity on capturing him we'd have more fanfics where he's just pumped full of Draught of the Living Death, hidden in a secret location and fed intravenously (after hacking off his arms and legs and cauterizing the wounds). Maybe add in an overpowered Obliviate for good measure, or as many as is necessary until his brain is mush (incidentally: does he gain his memories back if/when he dies and has horcruxes?).

It's not clear how Memory Erasure/Modification Charms affect an Occlumens. We know Occlumency can protect you from both Legilimency and Veritaserum and has been described as the magic of defending the mind. It would be odd, I think, if it couldn't defend you from being Obliviated.

**** We also know that successful Occlumency requires a calm,clear and focused mind. If all the gloves come off this pre-requiste could be defeated. Can you still employ Occlumency while on LSD? What about bath salts and or shrooms?

***** Yes, and it'd be so easy to understand and navigate the mind of someone on LSD.

However, I do get where you're coming from. Perhaps a potion that induces rage?

You forget I was talking about a catch-all obliviate, not legilimency. Something like what happened to Lockhart. As we see it doesn't require any understanding or navigation on the caster's side or he would have pulled back when the spell rebounded.

******* Well, my understanding of Obliviate was that you sift through an individual's memories and wipe them out. Or, it could just wipe out memory from a certain period of time.

However, I don't think that there is a “catch-all” Obliviate that just wipes out everything. The Obliviation of Lockhart was accidental, a backfired spell out of a malfunctioning wand - you can't use that to determine how the spell normally behaves.

A better example would be from Goblet of Fire, where the Ministry Obliviators wipe the memories of Mr. Roberts (at the Quidditch World Cup).

******** That doesn't make any sense to me. What you're saying is like saying that kicking a ball into a chess set accidentally results in a valid arrangement where black wins by check-mate.

Of course it has to be *more* difficult to only delete selective memories, making sure to not mess up the brain, not less. The more incompetent the spellcaster the more dangerous to let him cast Obliviate on you. But, even when done by professionals from the ministry, repeated obliviations can cause serious damage to the mind, as seen in Mr. Roberts during the Quidditch World Cup.

The text specifically notes that he'll be fine - the spell only leaves you disoriented in its immediate aftermath. Long term it causes no damage.

  The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy."

  ...

  "They all Disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right now.”

  ...

  Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague “Merry Christmas.”

  “He'll be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.”
