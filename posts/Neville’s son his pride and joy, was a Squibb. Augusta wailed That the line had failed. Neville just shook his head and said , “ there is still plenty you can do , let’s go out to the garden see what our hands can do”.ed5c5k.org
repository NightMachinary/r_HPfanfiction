20 years later, Neville looked on with pride, As he was guided through the brand new London botanical gardens , by the newly minted Director Andrew Longbottom.

His whole career Botanists Had sung his praises And Andrew could only grin. He was a Longbottom after all , botany was in his blood. His dad taught him everything he knew.

Edit: wow! This blew up!

For any one that wants more detail, I am imagining Augusta Longbottom being Distraught for a while, but eventually getting over it and deciding her grandchild might not be a Wizard but he is still a Longbottom and deserves to live as one. Augusta while Neville spent time teaching his son spent her time tracking down a distant squib relative If Molly's that could help him in the muggle world.

She finds Sir Marcus Prewett, chief accountant to the Crown, And a willing ally. Augusta Arranges for Andrew to attend Gordonstons in Scotland. A Prestigious institution that is close enough To Hogwarts for Neville to visit . Augusta takes pride in boasting that her Squibb grandson goes to the insistution as the grandchildren of the Muggle Queen.

Andrew and Neville just go with it , Andrew loves the outdoors and it's close to his dad.

I am just picturing Andrew during his years there every October finding one or two Hogwarts students On runway broomsticks stuck in Trees until his 4 th year when he finds a familiar face in on of the old weeping willows, Lily Luna Potter fighting to get herself and her broom free. I can picture climbing up to help her, tell her to stop Thashing around that it's not a whomping willow But a weeping one. Lily saying “ I didn't know trees could cry.” And she is surprised to see Andrew. The flying professor come to retrieve her and Andrew and Lily keep in touch via owl. Andrew at school quickly Comes that love sick bastard that trained an owl to carry message to his girlfriend because he could mail for the post like the rest of them.


** Nice!

Any plans to expand it. The idea seems really nice, good for fluff as well as a bit of Augusta bashing.

**** No worries, my tastes are ridiculously fickle, probably change a few times over the next month even.

edit - I mean to say, my taste in mood and ships changes. I /always/ like clever and fun ideas like you have above.
