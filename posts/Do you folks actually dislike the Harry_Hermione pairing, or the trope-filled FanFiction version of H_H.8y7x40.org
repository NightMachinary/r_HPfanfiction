***** I didn't exactly like eliminating her from the fic, but definitely as a love interest. In A Road not Taken (the one with Harry not getting on the Knight Bus before year 3) for instance, Hermione is kind of a /w/itch to Harry and Ginny. (And Cho Chang is also rather awful.)

Of course, a great portion of Hinny fics are interpolating the final battle and 1 September 2017. Postwar epilogue-compliant fics tend not to be bashifcs (i.e. the worst of the worst)...

Oh, and he got his Runes/Potions/Arithmancy/Alchemy/literally everything masteries at 11 so he's just going to Hogwarts for connections to use later on in his career beating the Wizengamot into shape as Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peverell-Flamel-Huffle-fuck me I feel dirty after typing this.

***** Hmm, I wouldn't go so far as to say "just a ritual" and a potion, like it's repeatedly stressed how difficult it is to accomplish. Uagadou seems to view this sort of magic as its specialty, but there's afaik no reliable information about exactly how common it is, it's also famous for alchemy for example but I doubt that every student is a master of alchemy by default so to speak.

Ragedless, as I stated above my objections are about "natural" animagus transformations, i.e when it "just happens" (usually explained by some contrived "because their bond was so strong", they're Merlin and Morgana incarnate/generally OP and so on). There are good animagi fics by contrast. Basically what bothers me about stuff like this specifically is that in my mind it detracts from the /weight/ of the magic. Basically, if it's just a snap-your-fingers type deal it has no meaning, weight or importance and it all just goes... bland. Similar to a Mary-Sue issue

Did I say that it was, or that people don't? I find the trope to be childish and lazy (as I do with all "predestination" type concepts) personally, but of course "people actually like to write/read about" it, it wouldn't be so popular otherwise.

You certainly implied it was a bad thing, which you still do in this reply.

Though you're kind of switching messages from "People use soul bonds to do x bad thing" to "soul bonds are lazy and bad writing" so I don't really have anything left to say to you.

no he outright says it's trash, which it is. a soul bond by it's nature should be a long slow arduous process(you only get one soul after all) but fan fic writers usually jump the shark and show people bonded over a random event and then the bond does nothing but good things and makes the people involved akin to gods and the deus ex machina hovering over every aspect of their story.\\

Clearly you misunderstand the genre(at least, the version of it that HP fanfiction writers usually use) if you actually think this is true.

I agree that a lot of fics in this category are done badly though. You listed a lot of the problems that people fall into with it, but that part is the actual bad writing-- it's not really the fault of the genre that people fall into common pitfalls.

You don't have to like soul bond fics. I'm not a huge fan of them myself due to how rare an actually good story is that includes them, but those good stories do exist, and being insulting towards good authors by saying <x type of fic is trash> is annoying.

It's kind of annoying having to defend a genre of stories that I'm mostly ambivalent to just because people in a Harry Potter fanfiction community of all places is being elitist about what writing tropes are acceptable or not, so I'm probably not going to bother with this any longer. I just wanted to make the point that soul bonds in general aren't just to force a pairing-- people can agree with that or not I guess.

***** Well... First it depends on whether or not sperm/ovum are produced otherwise no breeding will happen period. You see zygote is what we call a fertilized ovum. Now if the animagus transformation is actually a biological transformation than regardless the product will be of the animal species. However, a wizard did it so animagus transformations could just be really complicated msotly corporeal illussions in other words does an animagus bleed? If yes than Babies! If no than Infertility! do you got that morty? this is impiortant now so pay attention morty. Evidence form canon supports the idea of transformations being physical and biological as shown by dementors treating dogmeat!sirius different from manmeat!sirius and the breeding habists of werewolves. Following such animagi would likely produce sperm/eggs if after a menstrual cycle as their species. Further, the specific workings of childbirth likely depend more on Rowling's religios views and views on abortion than any sort of logic and the product again religious and abortion views but with the added factor of the difference between a werewolf and animagus. Now listen cllose morty because I'm running out of shits to give. I'm going to run on the assumption that werewolves are effectively parasites and that animagi are transformations basically into versions of animals with brain space for developed minds and soul space for human souls because magic is a thing and nobody gives a shit about hinduism or buddhism. Allright morty is that cool? No? complain later we have SCIENCE! to do. Now following this assumption the most logical outcome is intelligent and ensouled upgraded animals. However religiona nd abortion are involved so fuck the notion of logic. but I unexpectadly ran out of shits to give so I'll leave you to figure out what kind of stupid ass narnia ass eclipse phase ass crazy shit i was about to pull out of my ass.

I've got nothing on hand, unfortunately.

You're right that so many Harmony stories are bashfests or suffer from these other tropes. It sucks how much of the ship is just a glut of these same story ideas over and over. The easiest choice is when Ron leaves during the Horcrux hunt, but it's also too easy to make that a Ron bashing.

** In the books we see Harry get crushes on both Cho and Ginny. They weren't hidden from us, as we read the books from Harry's perspective. We know how he's feeling. We've never seen him think about Hermione in any other way other than as a best friend, not even at the Yule Ball when he was more surprised by Hermione actually being pretty than anything else. So it bothers me when people say it was obvious in the books until the end that he was going to end up with her, and that they felt cheated by JKR for not giving them their "obviously canon" ship. It was obvious that it was going to at least start out with Ron and Hermione getting together at some point before anything.

People like to hate on Ron for being dumb, or not sensitive, or not at all Hermione's type or whatever. People don't have to be exactly alike for relationships to work, sometimes like attracts like, and sometimes opposites attract. Every single relationship is unique. Their reasoning is absurd and built on this fantasy perfect relationship between Harry and Hermione.

So I don't hate the pairing. I've just never seen it done well. If it's not making Ron out to be a bad guy, which is most of H/Hr fics, it's making Hermione out to be this perfect woman, which she isn't. She's actually really vicious and petty, incredibly stubborn, and refuses to admit when she's wrong. But that's good. Characters should have flaws. It's what makes them interesting to read about.

And lastly, but most importantly, she's not Emma Watson. She actively has to try and spend hours to look incredibly attractive.

I avoid H/Hr fics for these reasons. Show me one that has a good length and grammar and plot etc, doesn't bash characters (Ron and Dumbledore especially), and doesn't have muggle-wanking, and I'd love to give it a shot.

*** I wonder how many of the people here were actually reading the books as they came out?

A large reason that the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Hermione ships still have such acrimony is because of how JKR /and/ fans handled the two years between /Order of the Phoenix/ and /Half Blood Prince/.

Obviously, canon ships weren't completely obvious until HBP. After OotP was released, the ship-wars between fans got particularly vicious. The largest fansite at that time was Mugglenet, and the second largest was The Leaky Cauldron, both of which were run exclusively by Ron/Hermione fans. They purposely fostered a hostile environment over a disagreement that is truly a matter of taste, not one of dogma.

This wasn't helped at all by the fact that OotP set up a situation in which you could easily "turn left" and dive directly into H/Hr very easily. Hermione had been the only one to believe Harry immediately in /Goblet/, and then in OotP followed that up by basically breaking every rule she had to in order to make sure Harry was okay.

She organized the DA to learn defense, but also to give Harry confidence and something to focus on besides Umbridge to try and keep him out of trouble. She canceled her Christmas vacation and was the only character who was actually able to pull Harry out of his self-loathing at Grimmauld Place over the attack on Arthur. She /purposely led a teacher into a situation that could easily kill the teacher making her guilty of at least manslaughter/. She followed Harry to the Ministry despite the fact that she was still obviously completely certain it was a trap.

The books could have very easily "turned left" after OotP and given some very good justifications for Harry finally being interested in Hermione romantically.

However, HBP was such a DRAMATIC shift in tone from OotP that it felt, at least to me, like /it/ was more of a left turn. OotP was dark, and it was gritty, and it was emotional. It had powerful moments of characterization and emotion, and it showed incredible depth to many characters in the books.

HBP simplified a lot of things. Sure, it's teenage romance which isn't exactly suave, but the descriptions of Harry's "feelings" were gag inducing. (Christ, please keep the dragon inside Harry.) After the incredible depth and emotion of OotP, HBP which started only a few weeks after Sirius' death showed Harry essentially shrugging it off. He had none of the expected inner turmoil over losing Sirius that people expected, and the only real inner emotions the book went into was the awfully written romance between him and Ginny.

It also kind of dulled what was supposed to be the emotional fulcrum of the whole series: Dumbledore's death. The rest of the book had been so childish and annoying that reading the last few chapters it just didn't feel like I was actually invested in the story in the same way. I read Dumbledore's death in a much more detached way than I did Sirius', and basically thought "Oh, well I suppose that will make Book 7 a bit different."

JKR didn't take any time to give Ginny the proper depth either. She essentially played the part of the uterus for the stories. If JKR had wanted to make that work better, some of the roles she gave to Hermione she should have given to Ginny, like the Christmas scene in OotP. In fact, after Hermione cancels her vacation and makes sure Harry is okay, Ginny basically tells Harry, "hey, I'm one of the only people in the world that can uniquely relate to your fears of being possessed by Voldemort, and I wanted to explain this to you all along, but I was annoyed that you were being broody and ignoring me".

Like... seriously?

As you can tell, there were some serious reasons beyond "I prefer the other girl" that Harry/Hermione fans were disappointed with HBP. What happened after though (because HBP didn't EXPLICITLY state what the ending ships were) is that Mugglenet and TLC scored a joint interview with JKR herself shortly after the book was released. They asked her point blank about Ron/Hermione, JKR confirmed that Ron/Hermione was canon to them, and then they proceeded to /ban anyone on the fansites who discussed non-canon pairings/.

That fractured the fan community quite heavily. Fanfic authors of H/Hr fics migrated almost completely to portkey.org because of this, and the two groups perceptions of tropes, and which fics and ideas they were exposed to, got almost completely separated.

That's why you have such a distinct corner of fandom now that writes these monstrously over the top "evil dumbledore, evil weasleys" fics. The fandom was forced apart because the people that ran Mugglenet and TLC were smug assholes who wanted to gloat about "being right", and so all the people who would have looked at that trope early on and gone "wtf is this bullshit" weren't around to call it what it was: an annoying and formulaic trope that makes the story much worse.

There are /plenty/ of good H/Hr fics out there, and plenty that don't dive into the whole "fuck Ron, fuck Dumbledore, Hermione is Emma Watson" thing. Those stories tend to focus on the more emotional connection between Harry and Hermione that seemed to be present in Book 5 than on Hermione being pretty. (Although, regardless of looks you would expect Harry to find Hermione attractive if he was attracted to her. Eye of the beholder and all that.)

But it's 2018 now, and a significant part of the people who are still in the fandom weren't alive/reading the books when they were first coming out. The historical reasons for the fucked up situation with ships in HP fandom is mostly lost to the annals of a history that few people remember or care about.

EDIT:

And for the record, the Emma Watson made the H/Hr ship happen idea is complete bullshit. The H/Hr ship really started to gain some steam after the ride to save Sirius at the end of PoA, which was before the movies had even been announced as a thing. Additionally, even after the movies came out, Ron/Hermione was always the ship which had more fans in the fandom, despite whatever effect Emma Watson may have had.

EDIT 2:

None of this was helped by the fact that prior to HBP being released, JKR had stated in an interview that she originally modeled Ron after her ex-husband, and Hermione after herself.

EDIT 3:

JKR in 2014

#+begin_quote
  [I] wrote the Hermione-Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfilment ... for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron

Those reasons were what I detailed here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8y7x40/do_you_folks_actually_dislike_the_harryhermione/e2a846b/]]

I didn't pull this rant out of my ass people, this isn't even as much opinion as you think it is. JKR definitively fucked up canon pairings, even in her own mind.

She's /allowed/ to make mistakes like that, the series is still absolutely amazing! Romance is such a small and unimportant part of the series as written. But that's why it makes so little sense for /anyone/ to shit on someones favorite pairing.

I've been in this fandom since 1999 when PoA was released and waited in line for GoF on release day in 2000 (because that was actually a thing back in those days). I've been having fandom discussions with other people on the internet since 2001 which is three years before GMail existed.

That doesn't make my opinions more important, but it does mean that I have a lot more things to draw on to make these arguments than most and I also have probably been thinking about them longer.

If anyone is interested or has a question, I can probably answer more questions about HP fandom history.

They originated in H/Hr fans being justifiably pissed at Emerson and casting /him/ as Ron in their fanfics. That depiction of Ron had already been turned into a trope by the time the movies started fucking up Ron's character by giving his best lines to Hermione.

At least going off of HBP.

Another example of the laziness you mentioned. Harry should really have discovered other reasons why he wants to be with Ginny besides her being convenient, pretty, sporty and "fun". The Harry we see in the books is a pretty damaged boy, with no real childhood or sense of self-worth trying to distract himself with relationships to girls. He never gets to grow out of that, which is a shame and we're supposed to believe that it wouldn't all come crashing down when he realizes how he got to be with Ginny.

***** I never said that Harry couldn't be attracted to her because she's not pretty. If I did, please show me where. In fact, I literally pointed out that Harry was more surprised that Hermione could be pretty than actually caring that she was pretty.

When I said Hermione wasn't Emma Watson, that was following a line of thought which was "Hermione isn't perfect, she isn't supposed to be perfect, and that's a good thing." Her attractiveness falls within this. When you, in your stories, make her out to be beautiful without trying (recall that it took 3 hours of work /with/ magic to make herself look stunning), you are implying that she has to be beautiful in order for Harry to fall in love with her.

This is, of course, incredibly sexist. Doubly so, because canon Hermione doesn't give a rat's ass about her appearance like society dictates she must. She looks presentable, and that's good enough for her. She is comfortable with her body, even if she isn't classically beautiful like you and other sexist fanfic authors like yourself make her out to be.

**** This was so articulated so well. All the depth and development of OotP was essentially disregarded in HBP. I agree that it was such a drastic shift in tone that it didn't really feel like part of the same series honestly.

And yes OotP developed Harry and Hermione's relationship so well that before the next book, it wasn't completely out of the question that maybe it could still happen. They were odds with each other a lot but it was more "marriage of the minds" type strategic sparring instead of incompatibility. They both had the same objective and same goals but didn't agree on a lot of the execution, which is normal. They worked well together and their strengths made up for the other's weaknesses. My favorite moment of between of them was when they were arguing about what to do about his vision about Sirius. Everyone else just watched the two of them have this argument in the heat of the calamity and nobody else could articulate what should be done. Nobody else was on their level.

And then in the thick of Harry's mad irrationationality, he finds himself recognizing her "solidarity" that she would join him if he just agreed to check Grimmauld Place first. In the blindness of his anger he was able to step back and realize that she may have a point and she is on his side. He also finds himself "disarmed" in the same scene that she had at one point memorized his words like one of her text books. These shared passions, mutual understandings, mutual admiration and respect is what made me a Harry/Hermione shipper in cannon.

***** In my mind the main reason for the dramatic shift in tone from OotP to HBP was how JKR had been writing the series.

When JKR first came up with the idea she started making copious notes and outlines. By her own admission though, the */very first thing she wrote narratively/* was the epilogue. It's one of the reasons the epilogue is so cringe worthy.

Props to her for knowing where she wanted to go with it and end up, a lot of authors don't.

She knew the main plot elements of the books before writing it all out, however JKR's real talent always was and always will be character-driven stories. For the first five books, it seems obvious to me that she was hitting all the plot points she needed to, but inbetween the plot how she handled the characters was much more "what works best" and "what would this character do or say right now".

But she finished OotP, looked at all that she had written, and had a moment where she realized that she was now getting rather far from the epilogue she had written in the mid 90s. The characters had taken on a life of their own and they didn't /want/ to fit the ending place she was headed. (Not just in pairings, in other ways also.)

She could, of course, have thrown the epilogue away at that moment. But instead she decided that she needed to "correct" the direction things were headed in. It's why HBP is so ham-fisted. She was for the first time really /forcing/ characters that she had been mostly giving freedom to in the previous 5 books.

Several years after the series was complete, JKR was interviewed (by Emma Watson no less), and was asked about Harry/Hermione. She admitted in that interview that looking back on it now, she thinks that Harry/Hermione would have been better, but she had been so set on what she wanted to do at the time.

I don't really have a problem with Ron or with the Ron/Hermione ship to be honest. I am /confused/ about why Hermione ever really liked Ron in that way, but then we don't see into their inner monologues the way that we do Harry's.

But to me, Ron/Hermione will always be the lazy choice, and Harry/Hermione the right one. Writing Harry/Hermione isn't /easy/. Look at all the complaints about common tropes in those stories in this thread. But writing Ron/Hermione is extremely lazy. It boils down to fiat. "They are just together, that's just what happens".

Harry/Hermione stories sometimes fail to give a good justification for the emotions expressed by the characters, but most Ron/Hermione stories don't bother with a justification /at all/. Which is absurd. I could have been happy with Ron/Hermione being canon even though I preferred Harry/Hermione if I had been given any kind of explanation for why Hermione liked him.

But it was never given.

The Ron/Hermione pairing is in my opinion the product and expression of laziness, and really there's a certain irony to that considering how much Hermione hates laziness.

And the shipping wars continue. How dare I express a different opinion, right? Just downvote and move on. I've been having this kind of discussion with other HP fans for 17 years now, I assure you I give zero fucks about your downvotes.

**** interesting. the new Joy about Harry/Hermione was one of the reasons, why i was interested in the media for almost after a century. After after finishing the Books i wanted (and still do) read Fics that contain the Pair but stay as close as Canon as possible (i cant stand them or one of them become an animagus, because it 1. seems senseless and 2. would take more time for education than the Canon would last). Do you have some Fics to offer? you can send a PM to avoid filling this Thread with "trash" (in the sense of off-topic and "request" ask)

Oh and yeah, while we see Harry thoughts and learn that he finds Ginny and Cho attractive, we dont see this concerning Hermione. But their Chemistry is more emotional, than "material". One of the Reasons Harry/Luna exist is because she was the only one who could comfort Harry after Sirius death and for this i gave her a Point, but it doesnt make me think that she and him would be a Pair.

What angers me is that Harry seems to think in Book 6, that he is the master of Romantic Relationships (underlined by the "monster in the chest" thing, urgh....), after his failed attraction of Cho (he only saw her stunning attraction, but not her personality and character as he witnessed after Umbridge performed a "Crackdown" on the DA) he absolutely know that Ginny is the one...the one with who he wants to live his whole life. The only obstacle: she is rons sister.

It doesn't matter if she had reasons for doing what she did. She still did these things which were vicious and petty and never showed signs of remorse. Like I said, sometimes it was understandable, but it doesn't change the fact that she did these things.

#+begin_quote
  “‘Slug Club,'” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It's pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug ---”

  “We're allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!”

  Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.

  “You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely different voice.

  “Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you'd rather I hooked up with McLaggen . . .”

  There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.

  “No, I wouldn't,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
#+end_quote

If you go on further in the chapter, Harry fakes putting the luck potion in Ron's pumpkin juice, they go on to win the Quidditch match with Ron being a hero for all his saves, and Lavender jumps him and makes out with him heavily in front of everyone -- which was what set Hermione off. Before this point, they were not together.

  In the books we see Harry get crushes on both Cho and Ginny. They weren't hidden from us, as we read the books from Harry's perspective. We know how he's feeling. We've never seen him think about Hermione in any other way other than as a best friend, not even at the Yule Ball when he was more surprised by Hermione actually being pretty than anything else.
#+end_quote

What is the point of this literary analysis? H/Hr fics aren't about "Was Harry secretly in love with Hermione all along?". JKR claims she had her stupid pairings in mind from the beginning and therefore obviously didn't drop any secret hints that Harry might pine after Hermione, because that wasn't in the plan. We're talking about fanfiction here. Or do you only consider fanfiction with canon pairings to be valid (which for me is the worst)?

I feel like you are arguing with shippers who were still hopeful for a H/Hr outcome after HBP - even though it was blatantly obvious that it wasn't going to happen. That ship has sailed long ago...

#+begin_quote
  So it bothers me when people say it was obvious in the books until the end that he was going to end up with her
#+end_quote

Well it's certainly more obvious to me than any of the main pairings we got in canon. Okay since we've all been here for a while we know all the arguments for or against Ron/Hermione, but to me (and many many other people who prefer HHr), H/Hr is about a million times more obvious than Ron/Hermione, who are as incompatible as oil and water.

So we can at least agree that nothing seems to be obvious in regards to these pairings, when looking at all those widely separated opinions. And if some people believe that the intended, foreshadowed pairings are terrible and the opposite of "should be" I would wager the guess that an unintended (and therefore non-explicitly obvious in the text) pairing might seem more appealing.

#+begin_quote
  Their reasoning is absurd and built on this fantasy perfect relationship between Harry and Hermione.
#+end_quote

It's fiction. People constantly complain about angst on this subreddit and I usually agree. I don't want to see a terrible couple settle for each other because of reasons. Especially when it isn't even realistically portrayed and they don't have constant angst + codependency and never need relationships counseling.

#+begin_quote
  I've just never seen it done well
#+end_quote

Well and I've never seen R/Hr seen done well. And that includes canon. So... there... I guess?

#+begin_quote
  And lastly, but most importantly, she's not Emma Watson. She actively has to try and spend hours to look incredibly attractive.
#+end_quote

Yeah sure, Emma Watson turned out to be extraordinarily pretty, but this backlash in the opposite direction, implying that Hermione is supposed to be some kind of ugly duckling (because she has bushy hair and buck teeth) is utterly ridiculous and counter-indicated by canon.

Edit: I forgot one thing:

#+begin_quote
  and sometimes opposites attract.
#+end_quote

It really irks me is when Romione shippers defend their ship with: "But opposites attract! They complement each other!". No, that's not how complementary relationships work. Here's a typical example for complementary attributes:

One person likes to talk, the other likes to listen.

Wonderful!

But Ron and Hermione both like to talk. They just like to talk about entirely different things and both kinda hate each other's favorite subjects. Another example:

One likes to cook, the other likes to eat.

Great!

Yeah, except that, Ron likes to eat and Hermione? Not really that much into cooking and not a fan of Ron's table manners either. I can totally see them living together in a flat and Ron wanting to have a big meal while Hermione just wants to order take-out, because she doesn't want to waste time. We can do this all day: Hermione likes to lecture people about perceived wrongs. Ron *HATES* that more than anything. He wants to just forget it and move on. Ron like's irresponsible fun and frivulous spending. Hermione *HATES* that. Hermione wants to finish all her work early, so that she can have free time later, Ron wants to do it as late as possible (I sympathize, me too). These are not complementary attributes, they are opposites and opposites don't attract, they repell.

Maybe that would be fine if Ron ever showed a single shred of respect and understanding towards many of the things Hermione valued. It was always just, "can't she give it a rest and why does she care?." It's not a detriment to Ron, I just don't think they really would have the same outlook on life in their adulthood.

For me opposites attract only works if the traits complement each other. Harry is an impassioned man of action and Hermione is the strategic planner. That works because both traits would naturally complement each other.

Right. He'd be perfectly fine with Hermione planning all the menial details of their lives. Also he's not so fond of the spotlight and wouldn't be totally jealous if Hermione made a big political career. Him being referenced as the husband of Hermione Granger-Potter instead of his own hyphenated moniker would make him ecstatic. With his sense of family he'd be totally fine being the "homemaker" husband, caring for the kids and maybe running a small and exclusive wand-maker business from his hobby shop or tutoring Hogwarts graduates and young Aurors in DADA.

It might be one of the most well written H/Hr fics period (unfortunately this isn't as high of praise as it seems; we all seem aware in this thread that the writing for this pairing is abysmal even though the ship has been around forever). THAT BEING SAID, this fic still features a Hermione that has "Holier than thou" type attitude which can be extremely off putting. That being said, it also captures her personality perfectly. That's just who Hermione is, she's head strong and is stubborn as all can be.

*** I like StarFox's H/Hr relationship in her latest Harry Potter and the Lady Thief. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5). I think her Harry in the story is weird, and he does this pervy thing with these special magical glasses, but their relationship itself avoids most of the pitfalls you describe. She is described as attractive which I know you don't like, but she also grows up differently with different training which includes physical training, which does affect one's attractiveness. My main thing is avoiding bashing, and it does that by having Ron fall for his true opposite, Luna. It doesn't bash Dumbledore, in fact he's more of a hero than ever. It does maybe fall into the trap of making Hermione a bit too perfect, but not so much that it's worth abandoning the fic.

It's usual for his stories.

#+begin_quote
  but not so much that it's worth abandoning
#+end_quote

Yes, it is so much.

Basically his story doesn't show any meaningful relationships between Harry and Hermione up to 40+ chapters. For the whole time she is lying and deceiving Harry and still consider herself his friend.

He tried to show some teenager's mistakes in the relationships, but totally ignored that environment around them should react to actions of the heroes (like parents of 14 year old girl won't ignore that she's having sex with 16 year old boy). In his story everyone (especially adults) just support any stupid actions of MCs.

I dropped the story before they got together, but I'm sure that his Harry will be a pitiful emo, when it comes to Hermione, and the latter will play with him for some time and then will just decide to accept him, because the tags require it. All her wrongdoings towards him (or anybody) will be ignored, because... she is Hermione.

tl;dr: his romances are very good examples how they shouldn't be written and one of the reasons why some fanfic readers hate HHr.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

With that in mind I've always been able to get behind Harry, he tolerates Hermione and she tolerates his moody git tenancies. Ron always seemed the most laid back and so it made sense he could flex and bend around Hermione's relative inflexibility. Harry and Hermione is two people who are too intense as far as I am concerned. I also dislike reading it because I want to get behind Harry and I find Hermione's presence annoying. An important bit of story telling is making you be sympathetic to the protagonist, a major issue for a lot of dark Harry stories. I lose all sympathy for a Harry that gets paired with Hermione. The tropey version is even worse.

To suggest it could have gone that way flies in the face of everything we have learned in that actual text about the nature of Harry, Hermione and their relationship. They never showed any romantic interest in each other, for one. And more importantly, both have enough moral fortitude to never even consider doing that to Ron and Ginny.

I hope that what Rowling really meant was that for many people in the same situation as them, something could have happened. But Harry and Hermione are moral people and have always just been tremendous friends so it never truly was a path they would take.

The idea is just that the two had become so close by that point, and in a long term situation where they could only rely on each other for literally everything, that it was feasible that they might take it further. It's not that those situations were romantic, but that they were intended to show how close they were. Most people throughout to hey I me have hooked up over far less.

Purely platonic friends don't have that desire or draw to pursue a romantic relationship with each other. She is implying that there was some romantic/sexual draw between Harry and Hermione while on the hunt and perhaps if one made a move, the other would have reciprocated and they would've been together. And I'm arguing that goes against the very canon description of their relationship.

This could just be a difference of opinion as to what constitutes a platonic friendship.

Regarding your last point about there being nothing immortal about them hooking up, I can understand the point but ultimately disagree. But I think that just comes down to a difference of perspective, not something where either of us would be wrong.

You and I have had very different life experiences. For one thing, there's absolutely a time element--you can be purely platonic friends at certain points in your relationship and at other points be teetering on the edge of romance. It can even evolve from "almost romance" to "totally platonic". From what I can tell, it's sort of like a less-extreme version of falling out of love.

It is indeed common for people to start out as platonic friends and then change. And it's common for two people to date but realize they aren't actually into each other romantically but vibe well as friends. I would argue that once that line is crossed either way (from friend to lover or lover to friend) it's nearly impossible to go back.

My point is that Rowling set up over the course of 6 1/2 books a certain dynamic that Harry and Hermione were simply not attracted to each other and had a very sibling-like relationship, especially from Hermione's side. For Rowling to suggest that they could be more felt like undermining all that development and also going against what I feel is a very positive message about opposite sexes being able to be friends.

******* I don't really get this. It wasn't like it was set up as a law of sorts that "I, Harry, am only and forever unattracted to my best friend." The point is just that it's very plausible things could have gone differently, especially when they were alone for, what, a few months? It's not even that there's was a substantial sexual draw between them (although I'd argue being alone in a tent for a long time with a girl of the same age isn't likely to prevent less than innocent thoughts from the mind).

I mean, I guess I'm just confused because while Rowling settled on a strong platonic friendship, that's after Ron comes back. They were just friends before, but I'll repeat, people have hooked up throughout time (yes, even those who intended to remain friends) in far less stressful situations and between friends that were nowhere near as close as Harry and Hermione were.

******** But then those friendships aren't platonic anymore, are they? And I guess that's my point, that for Rowling to say their was a romantic pull between Harry and Hermione in that moment and it could've happened undermines the idea they are completely platonic. This is simply my opinion.

I suppose I can concede that perhaps this pull was simply in Rowling's head based entirely on the situation. But the fact that it didn't happen, nor was it even a thought in Harry's brain, does prove that ultimately Rowling did view them as completely platonic.

Perhaps Rowling may have been trying to make a deep point about the pair, but in reality all she is really saying is that when a man and woman who are close find themselves in isolating and dangerous situations, anything can happen. But hopefully she isn't actually saying that the characters canonically were very close to hooking up but just didn't at the last second.

It proves Rowling decided to leave them that way, yes. But not because going further was unthinkable but, in her own words, "for personal reasons not because it was credible to her", going further to say it was what she planned from the beginning so she in hindsight thinks it was stubbornness on her part.

It's hard to say which she meant. Either is believable, that they were close to hooking up or simply that she was close to writing that. For me, I'm just saying I don't personally see it as an issue.

I honestly don't think the Weasleys would be an issue. Since he'd already broken up with Ginny, I don't think she'd lose her mind with anger the way some write her to do. Upset and angry yes, but not blind with rage and actually attacking Hermione type of rage.

Ron... Hm hard to say for one big reason: DH was a huge regression for Ron's character in my opinion. After GoF, having Ron leave again, at the worst time, just felt so wrong. In a crossover I'm drafting, I decided to use that as a time for Ron to actually grow (as opposed to random unexplained growths we got at the end of DH), realizing how much Hermione was willing to give up when she refused to leave with him.

************ You don't think it would've destroyed Harry and Hermione's relationship with at least Ron and Ginny?

Yes, Harry and Ginny were on a break but the kiss on his birthday showed that they clearly still cared for/loved each other. Plus Hermione and Ginny were great friends and Hermione basically coached Ginny on how to get Harry and was one of their biggest supporters. It would've been a tremendous stab in the back to Ginny for Hermione to hook up with Harry, break up or not. I don't think she physically attacks anyone, but I would imagine her friendship with both is over.

Ron's biggest insecurity and fear, as demonstrated when the locket Horcrux opens, is Hermione picking Harry over him. Ron is also a very jealous man and I can't possibly imagine him being ok with Harry and Hermione dating. He couldn't deal with them coming over for Sunday lunches at the Burrow. The entire relationship with the Trio, the thing the entire story is anchored to for 7 books, would be utterly destroyed in that moment.

This is why I don't think Rowling was actually ever considering it. I think he felt the pull as we both sorta described just from the situation being what it was. But doing so would fly in the face of 6 1/2 books of character development.

***** I don't think Rowling was on some sort of mission to prove a purely platonic friendship between a man and a woman in literature. The heightened "noble" ideal of this is something fans have projected onto Harry and Hermione's relationship, not something that Rowling sought out to do. So I think it's a little unfair to say that undermined their relationship with that comment. I think she just planned that Ron and Hermione would end up and Harry and Ginny would also end up, and it's really as simple as that. Upon further reflection she considered that indeed, they may have made a better fit. She's completely within her own rights to do this.

She has also said that guys like Ron are fun to date but not so fun to marry. She said that she was in a relationship with a Ron like character where she was herself a Hermione. Very serious and studious, and he was less serious and made her laugh. Unfortunately the relationship didn't work out, and she said that she ended up with a Harry. I think that gives some context to those statement and should show people that it wasn't really out of the blue.

****** I agree that she didn't have a specific goal with their relationship to above all else show that a platonic relationship is possible. I'm merely saying it was one aspect of their relationship that she pushed. And regardless of whether it was a deliberate attempt, the fact does remain that it was how it was set up. For Rowling to then imply it was possibly more simply has no basis in canon. And is a (potential) shame because a lot of readers, myself included, appreciated the nature of Harry and Hermione's friendship. That a boy and a girl can form an incredibly close bond without it needing to be romantic. It also has implications for their future relationships with their respective partners, who both operate under the belief that Harry and Hermione are purely platonic, like siblings, when in fact they are not. I fully admit I'm taking this way beyond what Rowling was probably intending but am just trying to illustrate the actual impact of such a statement. Of course, it really doesn't mean anything and to be honest, I never even really thought about this until I responded to that initial comment. Fun!

******* If people feel let down because they viewed Harry and Hermione's relationship to be purely platonic, that's not really JKR's fault. A lot of authors claim to lose control over their characters a bit once they put them on the page. She's well within her rights to claim that a moment ended up different than what she previously thought possible. Also, from what JKR seemed to imply its really just two friends who had a potentially charged moment after having an intense experience together. She's a girl and he's a guy. It's possible and I'm sure it's happened to many real life friends. That one moment doesn't mean that they can't be platonic anymore, especially since neither of them took it any further. Relationships aren't ever so cut and dry in either platonic or non-platonic categories. It's a spectrum. Harry and Hermione are not siblings despite claiming that they feel that way, so it's not out of the question to have a moment like that.

As far as the interview guys, I am saying Rowling admitted that in some ways Harry and Hermione are a better fit than Ron and Hermione. I don't believe she mentioned Ginny.

  I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility.

Who shares your interests, who makes you laugh, who are you attracted to. Hermione is like a big sister to Harry. She isn't someone that Harry would choose to hang out with above many other options, but she loves him and has his back like a family member would. And he relies on her tremendously for a certain type of support. But actual romantic relationships are very different from familial relationships (thank god).

My sister is not someone I would get along with as a friend. She's a great person but we have different interests and personalities. But if I ever got seriously hurt, or had a bad breakup, she would be right there for me and be one of the best people to bring me back around. And I'm not discounting the fact that Harry and Hermione are legitimately friends who enjoy each other's company to a degree.

** I used to like H/Hr pairings, but after reading so many bashing fics and just reading different POV about several of the issues that Hermione harps on, it just soured her for me. These days, the only type of Hermione I can endure is a veteran or completely different Hermione, like from Stages of Hope. Curiously, I never liked Ron much from Canon, I thought him abandoning during book 7 was horrible. After reading so many bashing fics where they extrapolate Ron's jealousy, I ended up wanting to defend him, and so now I really like when Ron stays as Harry's friend in some fanfics. I particularly liked him in The Sum of our Parts and HP and the Magic of Life. If you haven't read HP and the MoF, Ron has a big argument with Harry over the GoF, but they actually talk and the author manages to convey all of Ron's issues and make him relatable to Harry. It isn't "i want fame and gold and you're trash Harry for not gibe me monies" and Harry goes "I forgive you because reasons" like it is in canon.

Bit of a tangent there, but what can I say, I like Ron.

** I really only dislike the pairing because its (usually) one of three things:

1. The whole “Hermione-is-greatest-witch-evar” has ruined her character for me.

2. It's usually really forced. Like, for example, i was reading this fic and after Harry met Hermione it was pretty much just Hermione and Harry's relationship and nothing else.

3. A fic may be Hermione centric, and i almost never read one that's not Harry centric.

More often than not, its a mix of 1 and 2.

"Is this a potentially good Harry/Fleur fic? Nope, Chuck Hermione" "Is this an interesting Crossover premise where Harry lands the Crossover girl? Nope, Chuck Hermione" always ending in screwy Tri pairings that end up seeming so forced that you just want to stop reading

  "He felt a certain pull between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when [Harry and Hermione] touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hilltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and [two] the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other. Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very intense with Harry. So I think it could have gone that way."

** I loath the fanon version of perfect, super-smart Hermione. I already find her to be an incredibly lazy SI in canon, as her whole character doesn't make sense to me, but there she at least has redeeming features as well as less focus put on her. I have found most H/Hr shine a very bright spotlight on her.

Regarding the H/Hr pairing in canon, where does this even come from? I think that Ginny's character was horribly mistreated but Hermione is basically not even relevant as a romantic interest and there is a clear build-up for Ron/Hermione.

**** I don't think he's saying Hermione is lazy, more how's she's written. JKR has said in the past that at times Hermione was a SI of sorts. As with all SIs they have flaws but in the end they're almost always right. Hermione has more plot armour than almost anyone else. Her actions rarely have negative consequences, even when she's got no reason to be correct it turns out she was right all along. Book 3 is one of my least favourite for that reason. Hermione has no reason to be right about Crookshanks not killing Scabbers. Harry goes as far as to not pick sides but thinks Ron's arguement makes sense. Turns out she's right. Not only did Crookshanks not kill Scabbers but Scabbers was a villain. Harry and the Broom, strange broom without a note is suspicious but to jump to Sirius Black buying it is extreme. She has no reason to think its possible for him to buy it. He's the most wanted person in the country. Turns out Crookshanks and owl orders make all things possible but still, its a bit contrived but what do you know, she's right in the end. The only time I can think where she's really wrong is book 6 with the Malfoy thing but I think most people agree that book 6 was a character assassination on both Ron and Hermione.

*** Part of the reason for H/Hr vs H/G shipping is that we see the story from Harry's point of view. This means we do NOT see all of the time H/R spend together away from him, or the times Ron was very sweet to her etc. This also means we see a LOT of interaction between Harry and Hermione.

As opposed to Ginny who disappears (in relationship building type ways) for most of 4 books, and is suddenly the center of his hormonal world.

My FFN name is GinnyMyLove because I started off very much a Ginny Shipper... but over time I've decided Hermione would have been a better match.... I can no longer say if that is because of Fanon or canon...

I have read so much fanfiction that I'll take almost any M/F ship or harem to get my romance or smut fix. But H/G and H/Hr have special places for me...I almost can't stand to see Hermione end up with anyone but Harry. ...unless they make Ron more awesome and sweet to her than in the books.

**** I feel like it has to be fanon that pushed you there because canon is quite deliberate to show that Harry and Hermione have a younger brother/older sister dynamic. Which would be quite unhealthy in an actual relationship. Hermione is awesome, but she is absolutely a nag and Harry can appreciate that in the dynamic they do have, but would absolutely hate that in an actual partner. The thing about Hermione is she the one you want in battle with you, as evidence by how reliable she was on the Horcrux hunt but not the one you want to hang out with on a day to day level in a normal life.

And this is ultimately the big problem with the pairing; it does not factor in how these two people would interact one-on-one on a daily basis. While obviously Harry and Hermione get along, canon frequently points out that it typically is when Ron is also around. In Goblet of Fire, Harry even mentions directly how much less fun it is hanging out with just Hermione.

Ginny works very well with Harry because she simply knows how to handle him better and shares far more interests and a sense of humor. Humor and the ability to have fun are extremely important attributes Harry seeks in a partner, and Ginny has that in spades, while Hermione is sorely lacking.

***** The problem is really reading this as an adult vs as a kid. Or possibly the third or fourth re-reading of it. There are leaps of logic that are very easy to make which turn Ginny or Molly into amortentia rapists, Dumbledore into a manipulative chessmaster, Harry is holding himself back because he had to do so to avoid getting in trouble for beating Dudley in tests / doesn't want to lose Ron or Hermione as friends because he's better than they are, and Ron would drive Hermione just as crazy as she could Harry

Basically... it works great as a kids series... the problem is the kids grew up before the characters did thanks to the publishing schedule.

In either case, I'm not an anti-shipper (unless it is Molly, or Draco, or Snape) and I can enjoy H/G as much as H/Hr... I went through my shipping phase, and through basically every named female character in the books plus plenty of OC's and crossover characters.

To me, it takes much less work to make H/Hr work than to make R/Hr work in a more mature plot. Ron has more "growing up" to do than Harry to make a relationship with Hermione work...

But that's like... just my opinion man.

That's not really a leap in logic. Canon states this very explicitly, at least twice (Dumbledore+Harry at the end of OotP and Dumbledore+Snape at the end of DH).

I don't understand why there are people who pretend that Dumbledore being manipulative is some kind of Dumbledore bashing fanon theory.

I agree. If you're looking for a good "will they get together?" romance, most H/Hr authors lack the imagination to address both of their obvious issues with intimacy. There's lots of potential there to make it less than easy, but it's never done.
