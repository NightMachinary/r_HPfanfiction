So I have this huge problem. I think up this amazing fanfic idea. I'm full of enthusiasm and excitement. I start immediately writing down plot points and ideas so I don't forget. Turn on some nice soothing music, put pen to paper and get out about 1000 words and realize this is bloody difficult and I'm not going to be able to get it down... Even as a one shot.

Eventually I just wonder if it's worth posting it as a fix idea for someone else to write.

Anyone else? Or just me.


** I tend to write such things down, then save them and come back to them at a later date to actually write the story. Sometimes I even post a snippet to get feedback.

I'd suggest trying to write 1K words every day, no matter what. Sit down and force yourself to write a scene.

*** Very good feedback. Many thanks. I have written a bit already. Will try adding to it tomorrow and see how I get on

** I've found that a lot of writers have a 'Pile of unfinished story beginnings' type fic, where they just post ideas or partial chapters they've had but couldn't complete themselves for others to borrow. Most just sit there, but there's always a chance someone would be inspired to pick it up. And I've enjoyed reading through these sort of idea-collection fics too, you get a wide range of an author's thoughts.

** I think we all write the things we want to read but can't find, and we all have more ideas than we know what to do with. Don't expect anyone else to write your story for you or even to think your idea is particularly interesting. Ideas are worth nothing, it's the execution that counts.

Writing is hard work. If you want to see the finished product you have to put the work in. And the more you do it the easier it gets.

** This probably happens to just about everyone.

Don't rely on motivation. Make a daily goal and stick to it. Something easily achievable, like writing 500 words a day, or else just writing for 30 minutes without distractions. It will get easier.

** Like some of the other commenters have said, I have dozens of fics that are just a snippet of a larger story I want to write some day. I use Scriviner for writing and have four folders. Published, in progress, thoughts, and abandoned. The fics shift between the folders (particularly thoughts and in progress) frequently.

I find it helpful to write out the part of the story I'm most interested in at the moment, even if it's not the beginning, and then come back. When I start to get overwhelmed I draft out the dialogue and come back later and fill in the rest.

***** Now it makes sense. I thought you did all that during one drunken night. I was simultaneously horrified and impressed.
