Sorry if I used the wrong flair - feel free to correct me

I was just wondering if anyone would read a completely standalone fic set in Ilvermorny with only a few references to the original series (obviously the war has to be mentioned for history reasons, but I mean no interaction from any currently living characters)

I ask because I'm nervous that this sort of fic is almost not fanfic due to the separation there, so I feel like no one would want to read it even if I pour my heart and soul into it.

I hope that was clear enough for you to understand what I'm asking! I can try to clarify if need be!


** For me, personally, I'm interested in most original stories that aren't simply re-works of the main books.

Too many fics are just the same story as the books with Harry dating a different witch.

If you've got a proper story set up, with original and interesting characters, I'm fairly certain you'll have a good audience.

** There is an audience for that kind of thing, as the Alexandra Quick series has shown. There's some inherent problems, such as how disconnected such a story is from canon. If you're separating the story from 95% of canon, why not just go 100% and make an original story? When every character is an OC, it's kind of hard to invest in the story (though not impossible).

Some of the problem is the actual content of Ilvermorny. JKR has already done some of that arbitrary connections to canon with all the Slytherin stuff, and the way she went about it was pretty awful. It was quite forced, and it still doesn't sit well with me, since it's 100% fan pandering.

*** Yeah that's one of the reasons that I'm so hesitant to write it, but at the same time, I don't want to reinvent a whole world of magic including all of its laws. I don't know that I agree with your idea of the Ilvermorny canon, but to each their own. I personally like it, and I didn't think it was too forced. That may be because I'm super excited about there actually being a wizard of school in the US...

I haven't read the Alexandra Quick series, but I'll take your word for it having an audience.

** I'd read it. You won't get as many reviews at first, but as long as its good and comes out consistently you'll slowly build up a readership. I personally thought that the Ilvemorny story and background was really interesting.

** On FFnet there's probably an audience; ditto on Ao3.

I wouldn't read it, but there's always an audience, you just need to reach 'em.

** I'd love that! I imagine it would be harder to write, though, without the structure that a story in hogwarts provides.

** I'll be honest, personaly I'd probably not read it, there's too little connection to the Canon that must likely I won't find it interesting. I'm sure that many people would read it.

And as [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] said before, if the story will be 95 % oringinal content, make the jump and make it an original story. Ironically I would read a 100% original story about a magical school im America than a very loosely based HP Fanfic

** Why not? Depends on who the characters are, when it's taking place, what the plot is like...

** If it's well-written, sure! I would probably stop reading sooner than I would with a more canon-related fic if it wasn't to my liking though, just because I'm not attached to the characters yet. But I love expansions of the world we see in canon.

** I would love it! I was actually planning on writing a fic myself centered around 1950s america and the repeal of rappaports law, so I've been looking for some other fanfics exploring america's wizarding world for inspiration.

** I might read it, if the OCs were really interesting. Granted, OCs in fanfiction usually aren't interesting... but there's always the odd exception.

I've read stories from other parts of the HP world before that were really good... everyone knows the Alexandra Quick series, of course, but there's also been a few others that I really liked, with interesting set-ups and engaging characters, that focused on worldbuilding and character development, not just "this place/country is much cooler than Hogwarts!"
