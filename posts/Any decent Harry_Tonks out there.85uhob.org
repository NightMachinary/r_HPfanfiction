**** Hi, author here.

Being totally honest, the first 3/4-ish chapters aren't great, and I'm a little embarrassed to go back and read them because of the enormous discrepancy in quality between the earlier and later chapters. It's the first piece of fiction I've ever wrote and it shows in the earlier parts.

As the story goes on, the prose is far less stilted and the dialogue sounds better.

** I'd throw in my own "Dawn of Darkness", which is a Harry/Tonks story beginning at Slughorn's Christmas party and then disregarding the HBP plot entirely in favour of an original one while avoiding as many tropes as possible. I have to admit that the early chapters are a little heavy on the fluff, but the later ones are more plot-driven, something that will continue in the future.

So, I have not yet read grains of sand yet, but I have heard some good things about it.

Summer of change is old as hell and read rough even when I first found is some years ago. However, it was also what interested me in this pairing. Just be aware that it has not aged super well, and I shall leave the rest up to your judgement.

A little death between friends is of Kathryn518's writing and is pretty much like her other fics, long, and infrequent updates. There is currently seventy some thousand words available to read if you so wish it. They are both adults in this and I do believe there is some smut in parts of it.

Jamie Evans and fates fool is probably one of my favourites, definitely give it a go if you think you can handle the premise.

The Merging is also one of my better liked fics, mostly due to the characterisation of the characters. Or at least that is what i remember liking about it. Not completely Harry/Tonks, but a relationship does develop near the middle i think.

I feel like had it been completed, Ectomancer would have been headed into that general direction, sadly it is dead. However, the interactions between Harry and Tonks are enjoyable enough to read. Just be aware that the story is hardly centric on the pairing.

Perhaps to the greatest shame known to the world, Chelseyb deleted all of her fics. She was one of the more prolific Harry/Tonks writers in that particular niche. Her stories may not have been of the highest caliber, but they were enjoyable enough to me. Some good news though, many people have saved them and I am sure with enough prodding you could find them floating around too.

There are probably quite a few decent one that I have forgot to mention, but this should be a good start. Good luck in your search.

** Grains of Sand in the hourglass is awesome. Tonks gets sent back in time, infiltrates Hogwarts linkffn(12188150)

I recall liking Old Friends, New Friends, but I haven't read it in a while so it is hard to say much about it. linkffn(8295633)

Disorder of the Phoenix is... different. Think this is a love it or hate it one. In this one, Future!Resigned!Father Harry gets sent back in time to the Hogwarts Era linkffn(12813755)

As for ongoing fics, I'm liking how Dark Hearted Auror is going but WARNING: Author is doing the stupid "I won't post the next chapter till x reviews' ugh. linkffn(12857609)

Edit: went back and looked at Old Friends, it is a pretty rough read. Then again I think I have developed a distaste for deaged!Tonks since first reading it.

It's worse than that- this is a plagiarist reposting [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4308508/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Black-Hearted-Auror][the same story originally written by Darth Cious]].

Everything they've posted is someone else's work.

**** Ugh. It was obvious they had a completed manuscript by their posting pattern, and I had a sneaking thought that this might be the case. Plus the fact they were demanding reviews on all chapters but the last one ugh.

And I thought it felt familiar reading it, must of seen the old one at some point.... :/

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.

*** In "Disorder of the Phoenix", I feel like Harry is overly protected by the author. He can't seem to do wrong, at all. Dialogue that would feel like massive breaks between characters is wiped away if it could emotionally hurt Harry too much. Its getting rather frustrating after a while.

**** It certainly felt like the author had developed the character backstory and intro a lot more than the plot his character was living. This was even before the random two chapter backstory entry, felt it was meandering a bit too much about when he got arrested.

Like most fics, probably would have been better edited down to half it's length.

My rec is certainly grains of sand first as the awesome alpha material, and these others that are good beta material
