** Poor Luna. She's an amazing character, but she's Flanderized into the fandom's favourite Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

*** I like canon Luna. Great character, who is this sweet girl whose flaw is that she adores her insane father.

***** I don't mind that she has high grades in fanfiction, she's a ravenclaw and Rowling herself mentioned her as really smart. It's just... her character isn't even her you know.

******* The issue is that when Luna is a super genius, she becomes a bad plot device and it almost always involves heavy Hermione bashing as a side effect.

Don't get me wrong, Hermione isn't my favorite character, I just prefer valid criticism of her character in fics.
