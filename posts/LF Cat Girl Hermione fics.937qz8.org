Basically Hermione being stuck as part cat after the polyjuice potion accident. Kinda like Hermione's furry little problem but without all the smut/sex. I've tried looking for one myself and haven't had much luck, so I'm hoping someone knows of a fanfic that has what I've described above. Please no M ratings, I really do not want any smut/sex in any fanfics I read.

Thanks!

Though I gotta say, its a bit... weird, this one. I'm not sure the author fully realizes which school year they were in while describing Hermione's body. /Second Year/... if you're wondering. They were 12/13 at that point. I found it a bit uncomfortable to read.

Plus its bashing Ron quite severely for no apparent reason but, I assume, the authors dislike of him.

Includes fanon spells like glamours,...

You know... the works.
