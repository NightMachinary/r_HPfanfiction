With the year ending in a few days, I thought it'd be nice to see what fanfictions we as a community have found this year. Meaning, fanfiction that BEGAN this year is continuing or finished.


** I think this belongs to linkffn(The sum of their parts) without question.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Not sure which one is the best, but these are some I've favored this year:

*Rise of the Phoenix*\\
Still in the early chapters, but has a good mystery going on so far.

*Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much*\\
Short story about a grown up Dursley and his family.

*False Gods and Magic*\\
A rare SG1 crossover with decent writing.

*Full Circle*\\
Crackfic, Harry & Tom are soulmates and keep reincarnating together.

*The Aurors*\\
An adult Harry working as an auror, this is a good detective story.

*Gothic*\\
Another adult Harry story, with Ginny as the protagonist. Not everything is as it seems.

*Ground Hog Day*\\
A short story about the classic time travel loop.

**** Do you want more time travel in general, or specific time loop ones?\\
My favorite time loop one is *Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon* (linkffn(6517567)). It's unfinished and probably abandoned, but what's there is a good read.

There's a ton of time travel stories out there, you can find loads of suggestion threads in this subreddit by searching for "time travel". Here are some more I've bookmarked:\\
*A Long Journey Home*\\
My all time favorite story, a female Harry gets thrown back in time.\\
*Potter vs. Paradox*\\
Time travel with a slighty overpowered female Harry.\\
*A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story*\\
Mix of time travel and alternate universe.\\
*Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time*\\
Written in first person style, this can be a hard one to get into. Also a /bad boy/ Harry who drinks and smokes, but actually just comes off as juvenile. Very interesting magic and world building though.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

** This started out as normal post but quickly turned into summary of my experiences with this year fics. Many ratings tentative, "D" is for fics I've dropped too quickly to properly rate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary by Yakage]] - The "pureblood culture is being destroyed" fic with serious school politics that actually makes sense. Lot of effort put into world-building, none into having decent pacing. Harry is in Slytherin and as far as we know there is no BWL. (7/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544][The Aurors by Floreat Castellum]] - Good procedural that suffers due to author not even trying to maintain mystery. You probably should read Not For Others before that as there seem to be numerous references to its plot. (7/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140][Phoenix Corrupted by iamneverwhere]] - Ariana survives and everything ripples out from there. The fic doesn't really live up to its potential, but you can clearly see that author is still learning. (5/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11767424][Butterfly Wings by SilverCookieDust]] - Cool first half with crazy stuff happening one after another, boring second half. Ending delivers, use of special power that Harry gets at the beginning doesn't. (5/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12123765][Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts by Seraph Li Casta]] - Non!WBL Harry in Ravenclaw. The fic wants to focus more on exploring the setting, but it sadly meanders, has terrible duels and generally weirdly rebalanced magic. (5/10)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3764659][The Serpent's Gaze: Hatching Snakes by LocalDictionary]] - Bad canon rehash where most of changes change nothing, and half of them don't even make sense. (2.5/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11829846][Child of Hogwarts, Part I: The Lion, the Snake, and the Chamber by AimeretVivre]] - The art of things not happening, I've read through 1/3 of this fic and the story didn't move forward, Harry didn't do anything interesting and the only character progress was theassholing of snape. (2.5/10)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8374798][The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie]] - The Dumbledore is evil and Mary Sue fixes everything fic with all of the usual bad cliches. Also author moderates out negative reviews. (2/10)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125943][Where Loyalties Lie by AelysAlthea]] - Cedric escapes from graveyard, Harry doesn't and so Voldemort wins. Despite many years passing Cedric (now Auror) still hope that Harry is alive and wants to find him. Interesting premise but couldn't stand the bloated writing (D).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12046790][HP & The Jade Dragon by Cragglerock82]] - Harry goes into Mahoutokoro. Sadly writing was so bad that I was unable to read it. (D)

What I want to read: Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux by the Imaginizer, Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much by Casscade, The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer, The Colour of Everything by Floreat Castellum, Fortuna Favet Callidus by NachtofWalpurgis, The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl, Knowledge Comes At A Price by slayst, Witch Killers by BolteAltamont, The Lesser Kindness by Zeitgeist84, A Rise and Fall by DeathandJunkfood, Measuring Mortality by KiwiinLondon, Canto Alla Vita by SoundofInsurrection, Ilvermorny Year One: The Lost Witch by kadarriusjames, Taken by TheeStoryTeller, Wrong Choice by AreYouAWitchOrNot, Always: The Tale of Half-Blood Prince, Cult Potter by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas, Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra, The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5, Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff by LemonsWillSeeYou and Let Perpetual Light by teh tarik.

Which is actually quite a lot of promising (in some case promising to be trashy but fun) fics.

**** because in fanfiction, especially now adays, unless its a holiday or an author note is given, the story will probably not be updated, and thats just experience. The Boy Who Lived, by Santi hasn't been updated in a year. Its abandoned. I personally say 5 months and its abandoned.

"12/4/2016

Thanks to an unfortunate accident, my laptop is no longer working. I have lost all progress from the next chapter of 'When Harry met Wednesday,' to pages of notes and half-written scenes. I still have some notes in dead tree format, but most of that has already found its way into the story, or is no longer relevant.

Considering the mess that the rest of my life is in at the moment, I'm reluctantly throwing in the towel for the foreseeable future. I really hate that I'm leaving not one, but two stories unfinished; unfortunately it is what it is, and there is little I can do at this point.

Thank you to everyone who supported my writing, and hopefully I will be able to come back someday and finish what I started.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

** You can [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&t=15][filter FanFiction.net's results]] to those published within a year. linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion) is on the first page sorted by favorites, and I've seen it mentioned repeatedly here though I haven't read it yet.

As for personal favorites, I'm seconding linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday) (abandoned) and linkao3(6177703). Both have original concepts and well-written characters.
