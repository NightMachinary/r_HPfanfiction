It was a fic that started with baby Harry right after his mother sacrificed herself for him with Snape in the room holding Lily crying. He does some weird dissaparition in a gold flash to the past of his parents at Hogwarts. Later in the story he's playing by the lake and throws a rock in and Lily jumps in thinking its him and has to be saved by I think Snape. Theres also an obsession with hats and a robe with trains around the rim billowing smoke. I think. Any help would be appreciated.
