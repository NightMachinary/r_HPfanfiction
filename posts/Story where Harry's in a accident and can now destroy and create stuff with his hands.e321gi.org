Looking for a story where harry is at the quidditch\\
World cup and something happens to him and he helps fleur so the delacours take him to France and find out he can destroy stuff with one hand and create stuff with the other and then enrolls him in buexbatons and then go to the triwizard tournament at Hogwarts there's more to it then that but that's all I remember of it thanks


** Any chance that fix was inspired by Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood? There's a character with a plot point about the "one hand creates the other destroys" thing but it's arms (and hands by proxy) instead.

** I remember something similar where he is a mercenary, and gets hired to protect Fleur, but the Delacours don't know it is Harry Potter at first. But then his name comes out of the Goblet and it is revealed.

edit--

At some point he defends Fleur from snatchers.

I think he might have been anti-Dumbles....
