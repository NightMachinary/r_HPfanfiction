I'm looking for fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9788639/1/Of-Darkening-Souls][Of Darkening Souls]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] where Harry and Hermione are platonic best friends and find themselves going through a situation together, for instance, deciding to separate themselves from the light or being ostracized/singled out, but having the other there going through the same thing together.

I'm open to any pairings, slash, gen, or het. In fact, I'm pretty open to anything in a fic as long as it has what i'm looking for! *Complete fics only* please!

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Harry Potter grows up on Privet Drive, where he is neither loved nor hated; rather, he is treated with indifference. Will his relentless pursuit of knowledge allow him to defeat the Dark Lord? Will he ever be able to live the life he desires?

** So basically: Canon? They are platonic friends ("sister"), they go through the 'crux hunt together (even Ron leaves for a time) and the singled out thing happens when she remains friends with "the heir of Slytherin" (which Harry isn't, but people do believe it!)

*** No, In canon, Harry goes through something and she sticks by him. the focus is on him and she's the support. I'm looking for stories where they both go through something, or make a life changing decision and go through it together. for instance, in one of the stories I gave as an example, they overhear information and together decide to distance themselves from the Order. they are both going through the same things with only each other to lean on. does that make it more clear?
