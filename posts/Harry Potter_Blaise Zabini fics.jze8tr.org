I'd like them to have or be

1. complete, updated frequently, or abandoned and above 40,000 words
2. not just smut or porn-without-plot (meaning, I don't care if there's sex in it, but I'd prefer for there to be at least /some/ plot)
3. dark or grey harry, though not evil
4. harry in gryffindor or slytherin
5. harry to be independent or at least magically gifted

The latter three are more suggestions than requirements though I'd prefer for the fics to have at least one of them.
