I can't really think of many off the top of my head...

HPMOR: Magic is a fundamental force of the universe, every living thing was capable of magic until some wizards figured out how to make muggles out of them because it was a little scary when every 11 year old in the world had a nuke.

Some fic I can't remember the name of: The [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods][four saint beasts]] from Chinese mythology just kinda imbue magic in those who live nearby, and they can pass it on.

Not HP, but could work for HP:

Dragon Age: The Fade is a chaotic world of the dead and the world of dreams, it's kinda overlaid over the regular world and certain people (descendants of elves?) can bring bits of it into the real world to do things (and to get murdered by the demons who live there)


** In Mischief's heir series, harry and tom find out that magic was introduced on earth artificially, when supposedly their native world became inhabitable. I like this idea to introduce the wix to earth.

My favorite origin story though is that humans being the descendants of the lanteans have potential to access ZPM. This potential manifests itself as magic. This sets up quite nicely for a crossover with Stargate series. Problem with this idea is it doesn't quite explain the creatures .

In revenge of the wizard by Darth marrs, lots of magical creatures/beings (veela, giant,centaurs etc) were part of an gene enhancement attempt by a sect of Jedi which are condemned for it by the high council and about to be destroyed. Many of these new children are transported to safety to protect them (guess what the destination was). Eventually over time they changed where they could no longer access the force but built up an internal reservoir( magic core).

  ZPM

that makes no sense, ZPM is merely an ancient power source like a massive battery

wizards being closer to ascension would make far more sense Considering what we have seen charcters who are close to ascension do abilitiy wise

**** I don't know much about lore but the point was that the energy in zpm is similar to the energy used as magic which is obtained after accessing a different dimension ...... I know my explanation might sound convoluted but the fanfic explains it much better

** My interpretation is that magic evolved with humans. Humans learned how to bend nature to their will at first using means that Muggles nowadays are capable of too. Humans would domesticate animals, women would use seduction to receive protection from men, men would use charisma to get others to follow them, they understood the properties of plants and used them to brew ailments and poisons, later they learned how to grow them. All these actions indicate that people, unlike other creatures, were capable to control nature. Some were more in touch with nature and realized that if they willed something strongly enough, they could protect or harm others or even change weather. At first these people were reveared as gods or as shamans, priests but then resentment from the less prone to such acts grew, but so did these people's powers grow.

Dumbledore says that words are an inexhaustible source of magic and that love and sacrifice are some of the most powerful forms of magic. Muggles say that someone has charm when they make the others around them feel good and call curses either an ill desires against someone or something, or words that cause revulsion and discomfort. This would indicate that even Muggles are capable of some rudimentary magic according to its description in canon and this would indicate that all humans have the same origin but some people's will has evolved so much that they learned to bend some aspects of nature to their will. This would indicate that early humans would have been some sort of magical beast. Just like if you allowed basilisks to grow in numbers maybe not all of them would have had such a murderous gaze or potent venom.

** My headcanon is a hodgepodge mixture of elements from fics like Blindness, With Strength of Steel Wings, Prince of Slytherin, other stories like The Dresden Files, and some of my own thoughts. Here goes...

Magic comes from seven external sources of power (thus, most powerful magical number), which are termed as the Origins. These are the Sun, Earth, Moon, Stars, Death, Faerie and Void.

*Sun:* The Sun is the source of all life on Earth, of life giving heat, fire and energy. It empowers the magic of both the Earth and Moon. Worshipped in ancient times as the Father, Creator, Judge and eventual Destroyer of all life, it is the primary origin of all fire, heat and light based magic, most inanimate conjuring, vanishing, and almost all destructive magic not touched by the Void.

*Earth:* Where the Sun is called the Father, the Earth is the Mother in whose womb life was nurtured. It is also the solid strength of mountains, the crushing depths of the oceans, the fury of storms and thus another source of destructive magic untouched by the Void. All weather based magic, animate conjuring, healing, defensive magic is primarily tied to the Earth. With the possible exception of Death, it is usually the most powerful Origin.

*Moon:* The Moon is touched both by light and darkness (not to be confused with good and evil) and represents /change/ in the magical world. Where the Sun is the harsh and blinding fire, the Moon is calm light; the inevitability of change and peace with it. It is the primary source of some light based magic, most transfiguration, and magic related to the mind and memory. The animagus transformation and its Fae perversion, the werewolf, are all tied to the Moon.

*Stars:* Though the Stars usually have the weakest influence on magic on earth, overshadowed as they are by both the Sun and the Moon, in certain cases they are just as, if not more, powerful. They represent magic that is foreign, sourced from life that is not native to our planet, and the presence of such life on Earth greatly empowers such magic. The most powerful amongst these are those Stars which have life on their own planets. On Earth, the strongest of this is any magic which uses, or is influenced by dragons.

*Death:* Death, which could also be called Life, or Cradle, is the place where souls are born and will eventually return to, to be cleansed and be reborn again. It is humankind's ultimate /destiny/, death being an intrinsic part of life, and the cradle and resting place of unshattered souls. Unfortunately misrepresented as "dark" magic sometimes, Death is actually the primary source of magic based on souls, love, happiness, and yes, both the creation and destruction of life.

*Faerie:* The Fae are myths and legends in modern times but in times long past, they walked among mortals and their magic remains still, touching everything, even though physical access to their realm was closed millennia ago. Very few Fae, such as poltergeists, ever manifest or walk the mortal world these days. The Fae are biologically immortal and unchanging and yet, are cut off from Death. They embody, to the extreme, aspects of life of their own choosing and eventually become restricted to them. Faerie is the source of prophecies, divination, and magic based on time, probability and /luck/.

*Void:* The Void is the eventual destination of lost and shattered souls, and deceased Fae, and the birthplace of Dementors. It embodies unending and unquenchable hunger, mindless greed and singular hate without /any/ context to give it meaning. All truly vile and "dark" magic is actually Voidic magic. It affects both wielder and victim and the Void is why the three curses are Unforgivable. Only rare souls have ever escaped after falling into it; using the border where the fires of the Sun touch the Void, to be remade in the flames. We know them as phoenixes.

Most magic is sourced from multiple Origins, though some use only a single one (the last is especially true of the Void).

It is also why wands are made of wood and the core of a magical creature. The wood ties the wand to the Earth and the magical creature ties it to atleast one other Origin (which explains both the name and power of the Elder Wand).

It is both body and soul together that makes a person able to wield magic, since both together tie them to the Origins.

** Humans gained the ability to use magic after cross breeding with magical creatures. Canonically at leadt Veela and giants can breed with humans.

Magic itself is an external force that can be channeled by magic users.

Spoiler of Orders of Magnitude: Orders of Magnitude also ends with something like this. Some people consider OOM to be a good story except that the ending was disappointing. I like the parts that I've read so far.
