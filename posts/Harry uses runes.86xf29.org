Looking for a fic where Harry goes against Slytherinâ€˜s monster and puts a tune of reflection on his glasses then has dumbles and snaps attempt to read his mind but they are revealed as the glasses repelled the mental probe. Can't remember anything else in the fic. Thanks ahead of time.


** Rune Stone Path is what you're looking for.
