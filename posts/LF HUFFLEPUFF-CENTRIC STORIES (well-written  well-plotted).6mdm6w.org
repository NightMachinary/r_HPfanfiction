I've never heard any stories that are hufflepuff-centric, well I don't mind a Hermione x Cedric fanfic but I'm mostly up to the plot of the story, I don't mind having the Golden Trio and the other Weasleys and the DA in stories but I was hoping that you could recommend me some Hufflepuff-centric stories, Cedric Diggory or completely OC is accepted, any genre would do really, just not comedy ;) I've never even seen any Hufflepuff character that are with the main characters mostly, I want to experience those fanfics :) Your recommendations are highly appreciated :)

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  When Voldemort had Cedric Diggory killed, he said this: kill the spare. Hannah heard it whispered in the hallways, too, right behind "sheep" and "not smart/not brave/not cunning" and simply "Puff." Potions with Snape was always a treat. He hated Harry Potter, but the black and yellow earned his disdain. Even Flitwick sometimes sighed when Justin Finch-Fletchley just couldn't quite figure out a charm. And Hannah, in her quiet, accustomed, burning way, fumed. We are not spare parts.You think we're your cast offs. You think we're the kids no other House wanted to take.Well, here's a clue for you, suckers. This is a story about choice. The wand chooses the wizard but the wizard chooses the House. When that Hat goes on your head, it doesn't forbid you things, it offers them to you.We are not your castoffs. We're just the kids who didn't choose you.

**** I've started reading this one and its GREAT. Draco's horror at being sorted into Hufflepuff is hilarious. The author doesn't make him 'woobie' Draco either. He's in character; super bratty, bigoted, but not irredeemably evil.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
