...who is just few years older than Harry and raised as a potential Death Eater by his grandparents, but later, after his mother and father's escape from Azkaban, he got sick of that bloodlust and become a spy inside Death Eaters?

** I feel you.

Also, would read, but I think something more/other than just 'sick of the bloodlust' would be needed. Whenever I read fics where characters raised a certain way rebel against an upbringing or ingrained worldview I feel justice isn't done to the enormity of that internal struggle.

Kinda sorta not really speaking from experience?

**** Hmmm. Yes. Social shaming from some of the children of 'cleared' death eaters too, probably. Can't be seen associating with the unrepentant baddies. Progeny of, whatevs.

Questioning beliefs certainly, but people can have remarkable cognitive dissonance, see Snape and Lily friendship.

I'd like to see him reject both 'sides' perhaps, not wanting to be a death eater but feeling lile a fish out water with Dumbledore's lot.

****** This depends on the character and what he had been through since his childhood. I believe it is more likely that after he become an outcast for both sides, he would chose his own way. I also think that since his parents treat him like just a meat who should serve the Dark Lord (remember what Bella said to Cissy), he might develop some vengeance against them, especially to the Dark Lord, who taken away his parents from him. I dont know, just a thought, but I am open to all ideas!

***** Yes, having the most terrifying Death Eaters as parents, especially if you are not sorted in Slytherin(don't get me wrong, not all Slytherins are Death Eater lovers, but because they are more 'tolerant' to upper class ideas) definitely leave some mark.

Actually I was thinking to add Rufus Scrimgeour to the story, rather than Order of the Phoenix. I like his Machiavellian side more than Dumbledore's actions.

I didn't know that ethnic cleansings is an upper class ideal. Just look at Malfoy asking for just that in CoS and no one even bats an eye. The "tolerance" was pretty widespread in Slytherin, if not all of Hogwarts.

******* All I am saying is world is world is not divided into two like one side is Death Eathers and an the others are purely good. I don't like Rowling's portrayal of Slytherins as Nazis, Gryffindors as protector of good and Hufflepuff and Ravenclaws as in middle between those two.

******** The thing is, the founders split up on the matter of blood purity, with only Slytherin supporting the concept. It is therefore pretty logical IMO that basically everyone who believes that shit due to their family can only end up in Slytherin since no other would want that kind of mindset.

There is certainly all kinds of other bad behaviour to be found in the other three houses, but not blood purity outside of the occasional late radicalisation. The only confirmed non-Slytherin death eater is Pettigrew, who joined out of fear and not conviction.

The only truly good Slytherin in the series was Andromeda Black/Tonks, who got disowned for being who she was.

I get what you are saying, but given that Slytherin was both the origin and main recruiting pool for the magical Nazis, it is difficult to find an alternative depiction because it seems pretty institutionalised.

Don't get me wrong, I'll read the two dimensional characters too, haha, there's good plot-driven fic, character-driven fic, even setting driven fic! I love me some crack.

But... it's particularly pleasing to read complex characters. Especially in the case of an OC.

Just imagine Bellatrix swearing bloody vengeance and then turning it into mother-daughter "bonding" with such wholesome activities as "sending severed body parts together with ransom demands" or "getting payback with a few old tricks".
