I'm just in a mood for "Lord Potter" stuff, but I also can't really stand harems, so I'd like a fic where lord Potter-Black-Hogwarts (encompassing all four founders of course)-Azkaban-Whatever can and does take only one person to love, if he takes one at all. Serious or crack, I don't care.

Bashing, dark!Harry, slash and crossovers are fine. Please no genderbending, mpreg, romance/smut-driven plot or pottercest. Thank you!


** Harry isn't a lord with access to lots of power, but lords and heirs play a huge part in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Well my favorite one of those is ffnlink(9067051).

Its a dark!harry, HP/TMR, with Dumbledore and Ginny/Molly bashing fic. Harry is Lord Potter/Black/Peverell/Gryffindor and Ron and Hermione also have titles and obscene amount of money they like to revel in and attend political balls in fancy robes. It's not the best written but these fics rarely are, I've enjoyed it nonetheless and have read it several times. It does have the romance plot and a good deal of smut but there's also a bigger plot revolving around the war, I can't imagine 200,000+ words of pure romance/smut, hah.

*** I can't remember the name, but there's a Harry/every girl ever fic where apparently he's so powerful just sexing near other girls turns their legs to jelly. It's basically him saving the world through sex and bashing. It's like a trainwreck, I couldn't stop reading.

Also Tracy Davis is a Jamaican dominatrix and Hermione has a slutty split personality.

**** Holy shit, "train wreck" doesn't even begin to describe it. I feel like I'm witnessing some sort of major natural disaster reading this fic. It's like when you're watching the projected path of a hurricane, and you know it'll be awful if it hits a populated area, but part of you kind of wants to see what happens if it does.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH

For a fluffy version, I read linkffn(summer of independence by redfrog) when I'm in a bad mood and need low-conflict wishfulfillment.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
