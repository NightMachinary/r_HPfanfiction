Hi everyone! Pony checking in here with information on the future of the Book Club. I posted a comment on the previous thread, but I want to make sure everyone who wishes to be involved gets a chance to see it.

* Rules
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: rules
  :END:

1. Spoilers are allowed! This is a book club, after all.

2. As per *Subreddit Rule 5*, fics containing sexual or suggestive content involving minors *cannot* be recommended. This is due to reddit's [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][site-wide policy]].

3. Please submit fics to be considered using [[https://goo.gl/forms/y60X6vHRLwFTFfYq2][this form]].

4. All stories submitted must be *complete*.

5. 300k+ fics will span two months of discussion. 100k-300k will last one month. Anything under 100k will have two fics in one month.

* Going Forward
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: going-forward
  :END:
Periodically, I might decide on a theme for the Book Club. Otherwise, we'll go with whatever fics get recommended.

The next fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment by PuzzleSB]]. It is set in Grindelwald's time and follows Tom Riddle. The discussion will go live on *October 1, 2018.*

Do you have any suggestions for the future of the Book Club? Questions? Please let me know below! Don't forget to make suggestions using *Rule 3*!

** I'm shamelessly stealing this idea from SIYE, but we could make it a "buried gems" sort of thing instead of a book club. It feels a bit unnecessary to discuss fics that already get recommended from time to time on this subreddit. They are already being discussed. And there are hundreds of fics that are pretty good, if not miles better than the status quo in hpfanfic, but that will not get a lot of exposure.

Alternatively, if you want to make it really fun, make it a 50/50 sort of thing, where you allow both excellent as well as terrible fics into the club. That way you never know what it's going to be like, but now you can share the joys of slogging through Hadrian Potter-Black's 20k words long Diagon Alley shopping trip with other members of this subreddit.

*** agreed. There should be a rule that the fic has to have less than x number of reviews or favorites.

*** I don't see why we couldn't do multiple books a month. One being the "big name" one, one hidden gem, and another a 50/50. That way you have three options to choose from, because personally I don't care for every single book chosen.

Maybe try proposing fics that aren't so well known? Hard to get interested when you've already read the fic.

Also maybe try picking up the pace? Nobody with time to waste reading fanfiction needs a month to read 150k words.

***** The main problem is that I have never seen a book-club thread with more than 5 or so comments after a week, and never with more than 1 or 2 comments after two weeks.

It just feels super dead, esp. as only mods see "this thread has unread comments" by default.

****** Do you think that it might help to change the posting schedule? For example:

October's post will only mention "Realignment". In November, we'll announce the next book and people will have the whole month to read /and/ discuss.

******* I think it would be better to have the discussion/announcement of a fic within the same post. Rather than announcing a fic on 1st of October but not discussing it until a post on 1st November; I think it would be better to have it announced on 1st October and have discussion about it within that thread.

​

Allows people who start reading it when it is announced to discuss it immediately, and may generate more discussion than if they are required to wait until next month, when they might have forgotten some of the points they wanted to make.

​

This increases the likelihood of people coming upon spoilers, but I think it would increase discussion. For those who prefer to read it and then start discussing it when the next fic is announced; the thread will still be open but there should already be comments and discussion for which they can participate in, instead of feeling like they are posting in a thread with no discussion.

*** I disagree about unknown fics - I'm more likely to chime in on a fic I already read than a fic I have to read (especially if it has a theme or plot for which I don't care). Given how many requests threads threaten to turn into discussions, that might also get more discussions going.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Are crossovers allowed, assuming all the rules fit?

I also feel the time frame is a little long myself. I can read a 300k+ story in a week or two, let alone two whole months.
