I just want a fic where Harry enjoys magical creatures. I've seen fics where he is a prodigy in transfiguration or potions, but I'm looking for that except for care of magical creatures.

I don't care about much else except I Don't want Harry/Draco,Severus, or riddle. I just don't really like those ships, but other than that I don't care.

Thanks for any help in advance!

Good series. Author updates semi regularly.

  Harry finds a better life with the basilisk, but that doesn't mean it's easy. From inter-being feuds, to bloody prophecies, to elven unrest, Harry is in the eye of a hurricane that will change the wizarding world forever.

  Edit-series is called "ever upward"

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.
