LF fics with this type of relationship. They aren't friends, nor are they enemies, but rivals that respect each other. Ideally this would involve a more magically gifted draco than he is usually portrayed as. And no slash please.


** I'm only about halfway through myself, but so far Harry and Draco are best frenemies. It gets kinda complicated as Draco gets older and Voldy becomes an issue. But the relationship between Harry and Draco is really great I think. (I'm relatively new here so I'm not exactly sure how to do the fancy link thingy correctly) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste]]

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
