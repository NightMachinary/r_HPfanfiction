** Grey magic - repeated use slowly alters the person's personality, making them more neutral, ambivalent and apathetic. Belonging to neither side and suspicious of both, the user vacillates in their leanings like a morality metronome until paranoia wins out, and they plunge the rest of the way into madness

Air users have an unfortunate tendency to ill-timed flatulence. With extended use the user's head steadily swells until they achieve liftoff and float away into space

Mind magic - excessive thought-magic exercises gradually turn the practitioner into a mute philosopher who does nothing but lounge around and daydream until they fall into a coma, which often goes unnoticed until they starve to death

** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/a-second-chance-at-life-series-by-miranda-flairgold-t-m.191/page-49#post-222500][Gum magic]] - Promotes tooth decay. Except in vampires.

  "You've come far, Rakhesh. You've almost mastered Blood Magic and your facility with Soul Magic is unparalleled for an Arken student. Your Metal Magic is coming along as well, which is important for someone in such a unique position, you being a Human/Basalisk/Thunderbird/Dragon/Phoenix hybrid and all. However I fear that with your injury progressing as it is, I must expose you now to the most potent of all ancient magicks: Gum Magic."

  Lightning flared about Rakhesh's body as his Thunderbird screeched and his Dragon's blood roiled. "Gum Magic? That's a myth." His voice was a dagger of ice.

  "Settle yourself," the Vampire hissed, amplifying his will with a powerful psionic whip. Rakhesh winced and returned the Vampire's gaze, defiant. Namach pulled the wad of gum from his mouth and said in a low, but terrifying voice, "Come here, Rakhesh. This will sting only a little bit."

** This neat-o indeed-o!

Illusion Magic - Reality and other falsehoods are unmasked for you. You see that Magical Cores are the source of all power and that you are in fact Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin.

** And what is Light magic, anyway? Since this is non-canon, I'd assume that it's spells that involve purification or something?

*** In my mind I've always thought of Light spells being stuff to directly combat the darkest evils. Powerful stuff like conjuring a cloud of holy fire to cleanse and destroy a dementor. Super powerful Light Spells require self sacrifice, i.e. Lily's Protection.

** So where does transfiguration/comjuration fall in that?

*** /Transfiguration: masters are able to manipulate themselves to become shapeshifting entities, however they also lose their personal identity in the process and become increasingly paranoid of others. Continuing use of this leads to the user eventually turning into a boggart./

From what I get reading the wikis and with a bit of theorycrafting/headcanon, conjuration is a subset of transfiguration that serves as the opposing force to vanishing spells. Following that logic,

/Conjuration: expert conjurers are warned to practice equal amounts of vanishing, for if they take too much from magic without giving back, their peers will find the conjurers will eventually vanish entirely/
