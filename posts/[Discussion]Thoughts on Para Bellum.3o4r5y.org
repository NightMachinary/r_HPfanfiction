I just finished Delenda Est and was wondering how Para Bellum holds up to it?


** Delenda Est is one of my favorites (and I doubt that there will ever be a better Harry/Bellatrix pairing - there are some parts where I absolutely /adore/ here in that story), but I honestly have had trouble getting into the sequel. A big part of that is structural, I think - it's alternating between two different dimensions, and that inherently makes things confusing. Creating a comprehensible structure out of that would be challenging for any writer.

I want to like it - when I first read about the "Black Triplets" at the end of Delenda Est, I was hoping very much for a sequel because I found the idea so appealing. But... as interesting as they are, I just couldn't get into it.

It's possible that if it were finished, it would in the end be easier to understand. So I haven't entirely given up on it; however, my hopes for it are not nearly what they were when the first chapter appeared.

** It's quite awful. Like, the first half of Delende Est (up through chapter 20), was a fairly serious fic, and it was quite good. Then, it's like it was shifted into a parody, or the author really couldn't resist putting in all the shit that turned Earl of the North into a mess. And then the sequel... is just a bunch of Mary Sue that are neither funny or witty or interesting. It's disappointing, because Delende Est had soooo much potential.

** Honestly, I think Delenda Est is far superior. Para Bellum always felt a little disorganized. Not to mention it's unfinished and likely to remain so.

** I got a couple chapters into it and didn't enjoy it. Feels more like the second half of Delenda Est.

** I like them both, and think the sequel is a bit more entertaining, thanks to the new generation.
