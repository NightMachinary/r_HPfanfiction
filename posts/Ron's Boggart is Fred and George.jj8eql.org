**** Really? Wow, I have no recollection of this... In any case I imagine them to be quite resistant because, at least in hphm they like being thrown around... Sure, being hit by a club must be something else.. I love Fred and George because they were my favourite characters growing up, but now I cringe reading some of the stuff they do in the books... Well, I cringe at many things that happen in the story that we're supposed to find harmless or funny... What's actually funny is how the same things look completely different after a few years.
