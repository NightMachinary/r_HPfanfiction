Ok, so I want to start off by saying that I have the upmost respect and appreciation for the author. She wrote and rewrote an epic that has spawned its own fan base, fan art, and spin-offs. I'm only up to chapter 51 at this point so I know I'm operating without the whole picture. But I still don't get it. There seems to be a lot of non sequiturs. Developments often feel very disjointed. Like how Adolonda seems to care about Adrian but then teams up with Crouch in the destruction of Adrian's self-esteem. How during the dueling club Malfoy mentions that Snape wouldn't put Adrian up against Skylar because he knows he'd demolish him but then Adrian laments to Luna that he's not good enough to beat Skylar or Krum in a duel. One minute it seems like everyone thinks he's a prodigy and the next everyone thinks he's mediocre. And then everything that happened with Barty and this potion he just drinks blindly and Adolonda cajoles him into. And now he's suddenly sleeping all the time but everyone's acting casual about it. And he's with Remus then Bellatrix then Remus. I just feel like I'm missing something! Everyone loves it, even if it was too rough for them to get all the way through, they still leave positive reviews!So I know it has to be me. But I can't consolidate all the characters and behaviors and plot and actions into something cohesive in my head. Is it avant-garde? I've gathered that the MC is a bit mad so maybe it's his perspective making everything feel so surreal. I don't know. Like I said, this is not a review of the work. I just need help getting it sorted.


** Oh this is one of my favourite stories!!! Ok, first off, it's extremely complex and dwells into human psychology and behaviour more than most stories, both original work and fanfics, it's really not feasible to go that deep. Readers often find the behaviour of the characters to be inconsistent or hard to explain. Anti-thesis ignores that.

At the heart of it, Harry has a major identity crisis throughout the story and that's made worse the environment, position and circumstances he finds himself to be surrounded by. He hates his former family, but he doesn't like the new one he has, not as much as he thinks he does or wants to. It's a conflict between what a person hates, what a person wants and what a person really is.

The most consistent bit in the story is his love for animals.

The rest is a huge overlap of human tendencies and emotions which result in conflicting actions.

Now with respect to the power thing, it was very confusing to me as well. It really didn't make sense because until year 4, we had the sense that Harry was super powerful, but suddenly he has a crisis regarding his ability and that he isn't good enough. I don't really remember nearly enough as to understand why that occurs, but i think it's a result of him comparing himself to Voldemort, an adult with years of experience against himself, a child of 14. I think it's a result of trying to take short cuts and reach the pinnacle. He always wants to be on top and in a position of undisputed power.

Now Adolonda... See I love the portrayal of the basilisk in this because of the fact that the story takes into account the conniving, cunning and malicious nature of the basilisk. See most fanfics make the bloody snake a soft, warm hearted creature that cares for humans. When it isn't really in their nature. It makes little to no sense as to why the big bloody snake that kills with a look would be kind and submissive.

She is nice to Harry at the beginning to establish trust and a relationship. After crouch enters, she goes to push him towards doing stupid shit and takes advantage of the trust he placed in her, and attacked his insecurities - along the lines an abusive mother would do - see Elton John.

Why did she do it? Easy. She is cruel. She had her own agenda. She was never a nice or good person.

Crouch made Harry harm himself to further his own selfish agenda.

Harry was a victim on multiple fronts. I love the story because it really depicts the vulnerability of child to external factors who really don't care about him at all.

When Harry dies, you can count on one hand the number of people that legitimately care for him. It's a sad story, but it hits really close to home.

*** Ahhhhh so relieving! The power thing was making me crazy! And you're too right about the Basilisks!!! I was like ‘why are you doing this Ado! You're supposed to be his quasi-surrogate mum!'. Thanks for forcing me to take a look at my head cannon. Why would a reptile, designed to kill first and never ask questions, be a cuddle plushie?

And you're definitely right about the psychology. It keeps reminding me of psychological movies/books (Pi, Clockwork Orange, OFOtCCN, etc) and yet I hadn't really allowed it to become a primary theme in my head. So thank you for that wake up as well.

** The first thing I want to stress, Antithesis was *never* intended to become what it did in terms of popularity and following. The story originally was written with the intention of being a self-indulgent project, which subsequently exploded somewhere around the late 30-40's chapter count if I had to guess.

That means there are a /lot/ of unexplained plot holes or gaps that never were filled or corrected. The story had a flaw, which evidently became a dozen flaws when the story continued, and they were never corrected or thought through all the way because- well, who was going to read it? (In retrospect, karma really kicked me there).

[[/u/Snoo-31074][u/Snoo-31074]] is absolutely right in their synopsis and analysis of the work. There are a few other things, mostly why I decided to write a certain way or what I was intending to do behind certain actions, but for the majority, it's just as they said. /"It's a conflict between what a person hates, what a person wants, and what a person really is."/

Some actions don't make sense because (if you're referring to early chapters prior to my moment of /'oh no, people actually like this story')/ it may have been that I genuinely hadn't cared much or thought much about it, beyond 'wow wouldn't this aspect be cool?'

But, once I really started to recognize the impact the story had and how much people enjoyed it, I buckled down and really /tried. Everything from the scene involving drinking the potion in the chamber was calculated and intentional./

If you don't understand something- then that's alright. If the story confuses you, that's perfectly fine. If you can't understand why Adrian would make a certain decision, that doesn't make you less of a reader.

One of my favourite jokes I had while writing the story is "Antithesis is a story where I think /'hmm, this can't possibly get any worse,'/ and then proceeds to get worse," because that's the exact point. I tried to subject the characters (mainly the protagonist) to every category of trauma or angst I could possibly write. It's totally alright that you can't relate or understand one of the many many aspects that I wrote- nobody is expected to understand or relate to everything.

The reason Antithesis has touched so many people is that the trauma or angst that you don't understand is something someone may relate to completely. Someone may be struggling with a condition beyond their control and find it mirrored in my work. Someone may understand how to keep walking forward because they see their habits or routines mimicked within the work.

The story is confusing, I totally agree, but it has a purpose and helps those who need it. With that being said- message me, /let me know/ how I can help you, and I'll see what I can do for explaining both the characters and plotline, or letting you know /why/ I made characters act a certain way.

Life isn't easy, but I've learned sometimes I can make it a little easier for those who need it. :)

** Ok so! Here's the thing, I'm the same as you, I read Antithesis and was mostly lost a lot of the time but enjoyed the fic overall. I learned to... Not really pay too much attention to the motivationd and just enjoy the characters and overall story.

Essentially:: -Aidan loves Lutain and would do anything for him.

-Aidan really wants to feel useful. This need to be useful causes him to gravitate to the people who make him feel most loved. This causes him to switch sides (sometimes he's good, sometimes hes evil, overall he just wants to be seen and will go to the people most likely to do that.) He doesn't have loyalties like we usually expect from characters.

-This need for acceptance makes him very easily manipulated. By Crouch and others.

-The tiredness and potion is explained later if it hasn't been already.

-No one likes Aidan apart from Remus. Even Skylar who respects him often doesn't necessarily like him. The vice versa is also true though for the most part, Aidan harbours a grudge against Skyler so hates him on princeple.

-Overall, people do think he's powerful and a prodigy. The problem is he's also insane and very niave and easily controlled. Powerful and determined but so very childish in a way.

The main thing with Antithesis is important self worth can be. Aidan has none. He is beaten to the ground time and time again. No matter how hard he tries to be good and please others, they don't see him. And every time he tries to do what he thinks is the 'right thing' it ends up hurting him and everyone around him. And it's painful to watch.

I think around chapter 60ish... Yeah... I felt the plot kinda got a little lost? There were random jumps and unexplained motivations. He was working with Skyler all of a sudden for no real reason?

But it's worth it to stick with it. Just smile and nod and go with it rather than ask too many questions, that's what I did and I enjoyed it.

*** It's not just me! Thank you! I was starting to worry there. You also confirmed a lot of points that I had been trying to coalesce from vague feelings I had about the story. Especially the flip flopping allegiance.\\
And just articulating the fact that no one really likes him. Like. Just simplified so much in my mind. “Just go with it” sounds like a great plan. Thank you!

** Adolonda seems to care about Adrian but then teams up with Crouch in the destruction of Adrian's self-esteem. I apologize for the spoiler, but all of the parts related to Adalonda will make sense in about 3-5 chapters.
