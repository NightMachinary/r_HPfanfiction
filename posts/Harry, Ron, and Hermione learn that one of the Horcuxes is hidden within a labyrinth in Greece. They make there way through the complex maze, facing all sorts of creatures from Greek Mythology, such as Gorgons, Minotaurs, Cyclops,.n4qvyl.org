** You could probably draw some like with Herpo being a Greek and inventor of the Horcrux, so that is why Voldemort felt it was appropriate to put it there.

On a different note, JKR seems to have just said that magical creatures tend to originate from where their myths started, which means magical Greece must be horrifying. Just from the entries on the wiki alone it has cerberi, manticores and chimeras, let alone some of the other monsters you have mentioned and everyting else from the Greek myths. In my head canon, there is no Greek magical community because it is just too dangerous for anyone except monster hunters with a death wish or Dark Lords. Incidently, if you allow these creatures to have ranges that extend a bit beyond the modern boarders of Greece, it is an excellent explanation as to why Albania is such a good place for Voldemort to hide.

*** An interesting thing with Greek mythology (that Harry Potter seems to ignore, but I'll get to that later) is that most the monsters are one off. There was only one Chimera, only one Manticore, and Cerberus was literally the guard dog of the underworld (which is where the books diverge for the mythology with the existence of Fluffy).

So yeah, apparently there might be a whole race worth of gorgons (Medusas) running around the wizarding world. That's... terrifying.

** "I'm sure glad Hogwarts has such a robust Care of Magical Creatures curriculum."

"What are you talking about? Hagrid never went over any of these."

"We got hands-on experience with monsters that petrifying sight, magically-resistant skin, absurd physical strength, flight, magic, and poison, all before 3rd year. If I didn't know better, I'd say it was planned out beforehand."

"That's very nice, but can you two stop playing with the Cerebi? We can't keep them, no matter how much Fluffy would like it."
