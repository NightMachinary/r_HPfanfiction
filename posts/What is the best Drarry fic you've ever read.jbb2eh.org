I want to get into a new story, but I've been really disappointed by the ones I've read/tried to read recently. I've read all of the most well known and well loved classics, things like Temptation on the Warfront, Tea and No Sympathy, Turn (anything by Saras Girl, honestly), so something a little less well known would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

/Edit: shout out to those great people who are downvoting the post and every comment in it, you're very helpful and mature, I appreciate you c;/


** I can't remember the name, but it was a time travel fic in which an unspeakable who was friends with Draco gave him a time turner that sent him back to his Hogwarts years, but Draco started to lose his memories as time went on. But thankfully he decided to choose Harry's side.

The chemistry was well written, the characterization was on point.

My favourites are linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare; Running on Air; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption; Timeshare by astolat; Reparatio by astolat; Unseen by astolat; Slithering by astolat)

I haven't read these but I see them recommended a lot: linkao3(Away Childish Things; The Boy Who Lived Twice; Azoth by zeitgeistic; Stately Homes of Wiltshire; What We Pretend We Can't See)

  Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there.

  In Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy gives Draco lessons in how to manipulate people into loving him. When Draco is released on the condition that he is bonded to Harry as his prisoner, he finally has a chance to put his newfound skills into practice. Forced bonding, eighth year (eventually), a Draco driven slightly mad by grief, a furious, self-destructive Harry, a whole lot of angst and a proportionate amount of comfort.Inspired by an excellent story called Unexpected Consequences by Lauren3210.

This is my ultimate favourite fic. It's very well written, and the characterisation is great. (57k words)

There are many more, but lots of people have already recommended the ones I wanted to include.

Also, Someone else has already mentioned this, but try checking out/posting in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. There are lots of threads where people have asked for good recs, and I've found several good fics through there.
