Hey, I was motivated by AQ and other fanfics to post my own

Constructive Criticism needed or a Beta


** Ok, interesting premise from what I can make out so far. I like the idea of a grown up, changed Draco adopting a child.

The chapter reads a bit like a summary of events coupled with info dump and not like a story. If it was fleshed out it might take up more space but also flow better. It also may make the reader more interested in Francis as a person.

I cannot help chuckling a bit at Draco's chosen name being Drake Mallen, but that is mo fault of yours. It 's just that Drake Mallen sounds awefully close to Drake Mallard, aka Darkwing Duck, and the image of Draco Malfoy in a purple cape screaming "I am the terror that flaps in the night..." is just hilarious to me. - The name change honestly makes sense, it 's just my personal association with it that doesn't. Also, why did Draco change his name if he, at the leasr, stayed in contact with the Goyles? A name change would be more appropriate if Draco had tried to break completely with his past.

Keep going with this. It may need some work, but as said, there is something there that could make for an interesting story.
