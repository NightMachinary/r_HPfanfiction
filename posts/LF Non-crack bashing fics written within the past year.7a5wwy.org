I don't care who it bashes. Ron and Hermione, Dumbledore, literally everyone but Harry, whatever. As long as there's bashing, the story takes itself seriously, and it was published within the year.

Please no harems, smut/romance-centric plots, pottercest, mpreg or genderbending. Thank you!

Edit: To clarify. Romance is fine as long as the main point of the plot isn't setting up two people


** Uh, sorry to say with that last line you pretty much excluded nearly every bashing fic written in the Harry Potter Universe ever. Interested to see if there are any.

*** I mean, the reason I've asked for ones in the last year is I've read all the non-smut, non-mpreg, non-genderbending, non-pottercest, non-harem bashing fics published before then. They exist.

** One of bashing's primary functions is to act as a convoluted way to set up a romance. With you excluding romances, the number of fics left over is next to nil. Most of the ones left over involve bashing his parents and his siblings (or what essentially is a sibling). Strange Reflections does have romance, but it isn't quite the central focus, at least based on what I remember. Linkffn(9057950) linkffn(12307886) linkffn(5785108)

Edit: Didn't notice that you said this year. Only Strange Reflections is that recent, and just barely.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  Lily and James Potter come out of hiding so their son Alexander could fulfill the prophesy and defeat Voldemort. Things don't go as planned though, as they returned to the Wizarding World in 1999.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
