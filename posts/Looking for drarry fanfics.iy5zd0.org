I have never read a drarry FanFiction.Net but I have always wanted to. If any one has any suggestions I would really appreciate it. I would prefer longer fics and fics that happen during the timeline of the books. Other than that I don't really care what it's about.


** My favourites are

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13538612/1/][Where The Falcons Fly]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2721089/1/][Draco's Boy]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9800924/1/][The Printed Press]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]]

And theres loads more on [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6639397/PheonixNights][PheonixNights]] page that I really enjoy!

** its more worth it to just search the subreddit instead of asking, you'll find more fics, esp because this is a popular question

** My recommendation would be A Brother to Basilisks By Lomonaaeren it's very long but well written and this is coming from someone who's not even the biggest Drarry fan [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2435531/chapters/5393471?view_adult=true]]

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

#+begin_quote
  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love. Also indebted to You've Got The Antidote For Me by Kandakicksass and IDK My BFF Hermione? by lettered

  A fuck-or-die fairytale in which Draco Malfoy lives a despicable and unapologetic life --- that is, until he's cursed to die unless he can fall in love with and fuck Harry Potter.
