Last time I posted this I was downvoted a lot and I don't know why.

In the fic Remus is sent to a sort of Werewolf summer camp with other werewolves his age (the name of the camp sounded like some sort of retirement home, like /Willow Tree/ or some thing similar) while his parents go on vacation. It's there as a safe place for them to transform, but it didn't get much funding from the ministry. When the rest of the Marauders find out, they hatch a plan to /break/ him out find disguising themselves as his parents.

*** Sorry, but nothing is showing. I remember reading it on FNet... So maybe if you gave me the name...

Edit: Oh, it's /The Story of Four Friends/! Thanks! I remember that name!
