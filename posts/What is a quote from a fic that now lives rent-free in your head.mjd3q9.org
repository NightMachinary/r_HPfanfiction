  "So, even if I asked, you wouldn't return?" Harry asked as he stared at his hands.

  Hermione sighed heavily and turned to face him. "I'd choose you," she said, not without bitterness. "Just as I always do, Harry. But don't make me choose. I've thought about this, considered what I'd do if I did go back and found Ron married to someone else. Found someone else heading our team, saw how I'd been /replaced/. And I'm not a big enough person to take that gracefully."

** "A lesbian is a girl who fancies other girls?" Ron asked, face scrunched up.

"Yes," Professor Flitwick confirmed.

"Thought lesbian was a type of spider," Ron muttered to Harry. "Who knew?"

** For Death was not an envious being, nor was he possessive. How could he be, when men like Albus Dumbledore were permitted to bend time and history to their will so long as they walked the earth? The boy himself continued to live long past his time, and Death could not hold that against him. Would not hold that against him. Death did not suffer the trivialities of greed. Of selfishness.

But while Death could appreciate a skillful hand, he had never learned to like a cheater. And a man who need be destroyed eight times to be his? Who challenged his authority as though Death himself did not know the rules?

Well.

Death had come to personally collect.

  Dumbledore looked pretty happy, considering his current DADA teacher was dead at his feet. Perhaps he was just relieved that this one lasted the term. "That was your mother's love, dear boy. It protects you."

  He chuckled, "Something like that."

#+begin_quote
  The house was quieter with them gone. With no one to talk to, Harry found himself leaving his refuge more and more. More often than not Harry found himself at George's shop, helping him restock and finish the formulas that had always been in his head. Angelina was there before him most days and her laughter made the room feel brighter.

  “Talking helps,” Angelina told him when she caught him staring at a picture of the Weasley family they had taken while at the Quidditch World Cup. “It makes them feel alive.”

  Harry didn't quite think it would be polite to tell her he was more interested in realizing what he had lost than making it feel like they were still there. Ginny had returned from her last year at Hogwarts with offers to play for a dozen teams.

  “Mum says you still leave the room whenever someone mentions Ron's name,” Ginny said matter of fact while they sat in the garden.

  Harry felt the urge to stand at once, to run away, but forced himself to stay in his seat. “I'm the one who got him killed,” Harry finally managed, forcing himself to name the feelings he'd been ignoring. “I don't think I have a right to talk about him.”

  Ginny made a noise that was a mixture of disbelief and pity. Harry couldn't bring himself to meet her eyes and instead began picking at a thread on his jeans.

  “Harry,” Ginny said firmly, reaching over her hands to grip his and forcing him to look up at her. “No one but yourself blames you for what happened. You were his best friend. No one doubts how much the three of you loved one another.”

  Harry found tears in his eyes and wished to look away but found her round eyes enchanting and couldn't bring himself to.

  “They would have wanted you to find happiness Harry,” Ginny murmured. “They wouldn't have wanted for you to suffer alone.”

  The lump in his throat was making it difficult to breathe. “If they hadn't been my friends they wouldn't have died.”

  “Oh Harry,” Ginny whispered, “That's not it, that's not it at all. You didn't ask to be apart of the war, the war came to you when you were just a child. They didn't die because they were your friends, they died because they were brave and smart and there was an evil wizard who was hell-bent on destroying our way of life.”

  Harry didn't try to hide his wet eyes from her. “Will you stay with me?”

  “For as long as you want me.”

  Vow thus delivered, Muirgen pulled on the reins of her horse, turning around, uninterested in whatever the others might have yet to say. With the witch of Avalon a few paces away, Morgause regained some of her bluster. "And if I kill you?"

  "Then you will have my gratitude," Muirgen replied over her shoulder without pausing.

  Their places switched, the green witch carefully circled the blonde, her staff held at the ready. Her body still trembled from the magical torture, but the end of her staff never wavered. "You ridiculous child," she rasped, her voice raw, "I've been using Apparition since before the pyramids were built! You think, in all that time, I never considered a Disapparition jinx, and how to disrupt it?" Blood dripped from her mouth from where she'd bitten her lip, but her eyes were clear. "I've had time to learn many things. Like how to deal with pain. Like how to lure a would-be dark lord in close: by being broken!”

  She stepped to the door but hesitated as she laid a hand on the latch, turning to look at him. "Simon, there is one last thing you can do for me."

  "Anything, my Lady."

  "Am I not brave?" Snape bellowed, unable to temper his emotions. "Am I not clever? Am I not /loyal/? Why am I still Slytherin?"

  Silence met his ears for the longest time, until finally that small voice returned. "Why is it, Severus Snape, that you think a Slytherin cannot be all of those?"

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a free remastered version is coming to my website!

** The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black was, like the fragments of the Dark Lord's soul, ripped apart on the night of Hallowe'en, 1981.

Children were left behind, their parents dead or in Azkaban. Siblings were torn apart, lost to each other through love and war. Widowed dowagers and spinster sisters locked themselves away in bitter and gilded prisons of their own making.

So this is the story of the House of Black.

This is a story of lies.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981?

#+begin_quote
  "Once upon a time," she said slowly, with real weight behind the words, and Remus wanted to groan in frustration. He didn't have /time/ for fairy tales! He needed to find out more about their visitors. But when had any of the dimension travellers ever cared for their needs?

  "Once upon a time, there were four children. One boy that had only a toad as a friend. One boy that had grown up in an ocean of red hair and never really learned to swim. One boy that had been hidden away in a cupboard. And one girl that spent all her time in an enchanted castle made out of books. When their chest cavities were ready to release their hearts into the wild, they met on a journey. It was, of course, a magical journey."

  She stopped, and looked at him invitingly. He stared back. What the hell was she talking about?

  "The magical journey would take them to a magical castle, where they would find their true family, and of course they were excited. But what they didn't know was that it was also taking them towards a monster that had been lying in wait for years, hiding in the woods and sniffing for tender young hearts it could devour. And that while their journey was carrying them closer and closer to the magical place, the monster was scenting for them, closing in.

  "On their journey, the four children met two other girls, one that was the seventh daughter of a seventh son, and one that could see things no one else could. Both had been laughed at and so very lonely, but their chest cavities, too, were straining to release the hearts they'd grown, and so when they met the three boys and the girl, they were not afraid. They did not know that all hearts must break, you see?"

  Luna smiled at him, again, but there was something in her eyes that made Remus' own chest cavity ache surprisingly, and suddenly he didn't mind so much that he was standing in the middle of a corridor, listening to a nonsensical tale.

  "But then the monster came, and it roared and roared, and huffed and puffed until the magical castle was blown all to pieces, and all the boys and girls were tumbling helter-skelter and lying on the grass like dolls without their strings. And the monster stomped up to the three boys and the three girls, and in a terrible voice it shouted: 'I am the Great, Evil Monster, and you six will not stand against me! I have eaten your fathers and mothers, I have eaten your brothers and sisters, I have eaten your friends, and you can do nothing to stop me! Your power is not great enough!'"

  Luna's smile had vanished.

  Remus wondered who had told her this story and what it meant to her. He wondered if he should end this. But then she tilted up her face, and he could see her eyes, fierce and proud, and somehow he knew it was important to listen quietly.

  "But the boy who'd only had a toad as friend stood firm, and he released his heart, and it was a heart of strength. 'I will stand against you, even though I'm just a small boy,' he said.

  "And the boy who'd grown up in a sea of red hair stood firm, and he released his heart, and it was a loyal heart. 'I will never leave my friends,' he said.

  "And the girl who was the seventh daughter of a seventh son stood firm, and she released her heart, and it was a heart of courage. 'I will fight you till the end of the world,' she said."

  Luna swallowed, hard.

  "And the girl that could see things others couldn't stood firm, and she released her heart, and it was a heart of vision. 'I see you,' she said, 'And I'll never forget what you did to us'.

  "And the girl that had lived in an enchanted castle made out of books stood firm, and she released her heart, and it was a heart of wisdom. 'I'll trick you,' she said. 'All your power is no match for cleverness.'

  "But the monster laughed at them, and it reached out for all their hearts and crushed two of them, and would have crushed them all, when the last boy stepped forward.

  "'No,' he said, and stood firm. And he released his heart, and it was made of the greatest love the world had ever seen. 'This love is your death, monster' he said. 'And we will die together.' And he embraced the monster, despite its terrible teeth and claws, and his love burnt hotter than the sun, and together they died."

  As abruptly as the story had begun, it ended. Luna stood silently, the basket in her hand swinging forward and back absently, like a forgotten toy. She didn't appear to be distressed, or even bothered, and Remus wondered how her story could have touched him so and yet left her entirely serene.

  "What are you trying to tell me, Luna?" Remus asked carefully, hoping that for once she'd give him a clear, meaningful answer.

  A hope that, of course, was in vain.

  "That it's a good thing I'm not Little Red Riding Hood," she answered calmly, turned away from him and started her examination of the corridor. "Or we'd be in real trouble, Big Bad Wolf!"

"Luna!"

"Which is just as well, because she has neither the intelligence nor the drive to succeed at anything worthwhile and hides behind her bitchiness to deflect criticism of her own numerous failings."

"Luna, why are you doing this?" asked Harry, desperate for a way to stop her.

Luna stopped, mouth open as Harry's question, enforced by the trace amounts of Veritaserum still in her blood, made her pause.

"Because I came to Hogwarts expecting to be free, to have friends and wonderful new experiences, but all I found was closed, petty minded and arrogant people who torment me for believing in my dad. Instead of helping me and encouraging me, I found people like Marietta belittling and walking over me with her assumed and quite imaginary superiority. I want her to feel how she made me feel, I want her to despair the way I despair, I want her to suffer.

"Why Harry? Because I can," she added, blinking as if surprised at her own words. "Because I want to, and because she and this whole rotten world deserve it for what their neglect does to me."

Not for the first time, Harry realised just how screwed up the truth really was.

  “No.” Harry inched back towards the door. “You can't ask him to.”

  “Harry, there are some things I cannot tell you yet, but it will work out...” Dumbledore rose, managing to make himself still look slightly shameful.

  “NO! Don't tell me that! Don't tell me I will understand some day, I don't want to hear it.” Harry backed up against the door and pointed his finger at Dumbledore, baring it like a wand. “It wasn't enough that you took Sirius away from me last year. Now you want to take him too?”

  “Harry, no one is taking Professor Snape from you.” Dumbledore replied, his voice strong as he stood still. “The curse in my hand is slowly killing me. When the time comes, if Draco chooses the light, I need someone who will show mercy to an old man.”

  Harry stared at the blackened shrivelled hand, and then at the objects on the table he now had a name for. Horcruxes. He looked back at the man he used to regard as his hero, and was reminded of people too lost in the details to see the bigger picture anymore.

  “Will you deserve it?” Harry asked quietly, feeling like a complete arse. He didn't dare meet the headmaster's eyes as he left the office.
