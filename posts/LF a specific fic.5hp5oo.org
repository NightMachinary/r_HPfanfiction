It's a WBWL fic where Harry disappears after his OWLS. His brother dies and everyone realizes that Harry is the actual boy who lived. Lily knew all along and created a fake child to grow up because she didn't want Harry to suffer from the fame or something like that. The only other thing I remember is that Harry created a group of misfits at Hogwarts before he disappeared.


** I know what it is but I can't remember.
