I wanted to express how odd it is that Ron could feel the trace on Voldemort's name. This in conjunction with his divination prophecies gives Ron a really weird power. He can be right with absolutely no evidence.

​

Ron, by book seven, was comfortable with Voldemort's name. Harry uses it in conversation with him and it doesn't seem to faze Ron at all.

​

#+begin_quote
  “Who's Gregorovitch?”

  “I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.”

  Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he could not think where.

  *“I think Voldemort's looking for him.”*

  *“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently.* (Chapter 7 “The Will of Albus Dumbledore")
#+end_quote

​

Ron even uses the word himself.

​

#+begin_quote
  “The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.”

  *“Why didn't Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked Ron.*

  Lupin laughed.

  “He doesn't need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. (Ch.11 “The Bribe")
#+end_quote

​

However, after the trio's escape from the Ministry where Ron is splinched this happens:

​

#+begin_quote
  *“That's as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know they're coming, I can't guarantee it will keep out Vol ---”*

  *“Don't say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. Harry and Hermione looked at each other.*

  *“I'm sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, “but it feels like a --- a jinx or something. Can't we call him You-Know-Who --- please?”*

  “Dumbledore said fear of a name ---” began Harry.

  “In case you hadn't noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn't do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped back. “Just --- just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?”

  “Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. (Ch.14 “The Thief")
#+end_quote

​

This isn't a one-off situation either. Ron has to stop Harry from saying it again a chapter later.

​

#+begin_quote
  Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory.

  *“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts's secrets. I'm telling you, if there was one place Vol ---”*

  *“Oi!”*

  *“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!”* Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If there was one place that was really important to You- Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!” (Ch.15 “The Goblin's Revenge")
#+end_quote

​

Ron confirms the trace on Voldemort's name in chapter 20 when he returns to the Horcrux Hunt. So, Ron knows(kinda) about the trace six chapters and possibly a month or two before Harry and Hermione do. It's an odd thing that Ron does that never really gets addressed by any of the characters. It doesn't really get addressed by any of the readers either. So I took it upon myself to post this here.

Edit: Spelling

*** Yeah, that's very likely. Still, It's canon and it actually happens in text. So I'm just going to attribute it to Ron's character. Hermione being used for exposition purposes doesn't take away from her being smart. I'm just going to apply that same reasoning to ole' Ronald Billus.

You've skipped a line break here. Harry is the one who says the first sentence.

** Yeah, it'd be good, and it should totally be canon, but unfortunately I suspect JK didn't put that much thought into it. She just needed the hints without making it too obvious. Hermione would have logically figured it out and been taken seriously, and Harry's always been a big promoter of using the name, so for him to get a bad feeling, would be taken seriously. No one pays attention to Ron, he always delivers either red herrings, or subtle hints.

** Maybe it just has to do with his upbringing? I could see how growing up in a magical home, surrounded by magic and the feel of magic would allow a wizard or witch to understand the way magic around them feels in a more comprehensive way. They would know how to differentiate between types of spells and possibly even discern the intent of a spell just from the feel of it around them. Growing up in a non-magical environment, where the only magic present is your own and occasionally that of a curious magical creature, wouldn't produce the same understanding and instinctual knowledge of what different magic feels like.

That it it's just for plot purposes, which I'm thinking is more likely given the track record here.

** Another example; the first time Harry and Ron find the diary, Ron immediately distrusts it and tells Harry to leave it alone.

** By the time Ron's Snatcher-elongated 5 minute smoke break ends, he also knows how to tune into Potterwatch. I'm assuming during his absence Bill taught him how to listen in on the Twin's pirate radio station and the Taboo was announced there once the good guys figured it out (likely through Shacklebolt).

Not that complicated.

*** What you're referring to is Chapter 20(The Xeno Lovegood chapter). This is when Ron comes back and *confirms* that there is a trace. However, Ron asks Harry and Hermione to not use his name all the way back in chapter 14. Ron hasn't left yet by this point.

** Very interesting. Or we could believe Ron's explanation that saying the name didn't work out so well for Dumbledore, and Ron learned from Dumbledore's mistake. Either explanation works.

I'm a bit more inclined to believe that Ron's psychic than that he's sensible.
