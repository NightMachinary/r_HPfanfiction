I'm looking for an old H/Hr fic that was one of the first ones I read. I don't remember a lot about it, except that the epilogue had them as co-headmasters of Hogwarts and when they were ready to move on to the next great adventure they went to Hogwarts' ward stone and gave their magic to the school. I know it's vague, but that's the part that really stuck with me.


** Doesn't ring any bells.
