** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11957732][this one]] wins on sheer WTF factor. It's an original novel, The Legend of Sarkkus: Part 1 By Grant Dykeman, copied and pasted word-for-word into fanfiction.net's Harry Potter section. They didn't even bother changing any of the characters' names or anything.

*** Ahahahaha, wow. Crazy.

Though I still think someone plagiarising a jbern fic by claiming to be joe6991 is hilarious.

** Is there any context to this? I mean, is he a well known plagiarist or am I missing something?

*** Bungle in the jungle is the name of a very well known fic, 150k+.... I assume he finds it funny because the plagiarist couldn't find another name?

**** It's funny because joe ducie is the uncapitalized form of Joe Ducie, also known as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][joe6991]]. Used the name of one popular author to plagiarise a different one.

****** I probably only did because I check out his official website occasionally. Been thinking about buying some of his books, but I'm between employment right now, so I don't really have spare cash lying around.

**** Ah! Now it makes sense. Thanks for clearing it up.

I probably should've done some Googling.
