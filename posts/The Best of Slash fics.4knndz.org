I normally dislike Slash, being a straight male (I dislike femslash as well, but that's another story). But I think good stories can come out of Slash, given that Harry's change in sexuality is gradual and well-developed. However, while I'm willing to give Slash stories a try, I do not want to go through all the crap fics, which is why I'm turning to you guys. What would be the some of the best slash fics in the fandom? I would also like a brief (or not so brief) explanation of how it is developed, so that I can see whether it's worth giving a try or not.


** linkffn(Turn by Sara's Girl). Really great writing, and I really, really liked how Harry and Ginny's failing marriage was portrayed. The ending was slightly meh, but a great story nonetheless.

***** Personally I'd give it at least through the end of chapter 2, if you're still iffy but not totally turned away yet, go through chapter 3. I think that's about where I got totally sucked in. (I'm going by how it's split in AO3, but I think it's the same on FFN).

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

** Linkao3(Cartographer's Craft) Easily one of, if not the best slash stories in the fandom. It's not an over night, "omg I'm super gay and in love with my friend" but a gradual discovery.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is another great one.

** The only slash fic I read and finished and liked was Maya's Underwater Light, but nostalgia factor is likely clouding my recollection of it. There are still pdfs of it around, Google is your friend.

The Sacrifices Arc is reasonably well known. I got to the halfway point of the 4th book and kinda dropped it in favor of something else, but it's been on my reading list for a while. Slash doesn't show up until book 4 IIRC. This is the first one: linkffn(Saving Connor)

*** I second The Sacrifices Arc. It was actually the first Slash I ever read, and I almost didn't read the series because I never considered Harry/Draco to be a believable pairing. Draco is a really annoying Prat for the first bit, but he grows up and gets better, and the whole relationship is believable and brilliant, and the rest of the plot is just insanely good. By far one of my favorite fics.

** I don't generally read epic-length stories, so my suggestions are all shorter one-shots. If you require 100K words of plot development to make slash palatable, you may or may not be able to accept the sexual orientation of these characters, since the fics take it as a given. However, the writers are good and the stories are strong. You'll just have to put up with the fact that Snape is my favorite character and turns up in several places. ;)

linkao3 ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1104139]])

Written in 2004, I think? So not remotely canon-compliant, even setting aside the pairing. But half the pleasure is watching how Julad maneuvers Neville and Snape into a plausible relationship forced on them by wartime circumstances. The other half of the pleasure lies in the inventiveness and energy of the plot. Even though the focus is on the two strange bedfellows, lots of characters scramble about, getting things done. There's a war on, after all. Great pacing, vivid writing, a wonderful Neville voice, and a quiet, moving ending. (Note: it was written as a tribute and prequel to Resonant's "Transfigurations," recced elsewhere in this thread.)

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/36645]])

Nothing deep here, and not claiming "best" status, but this is charming and humorous and teasingly affectionate. Albus is young, gay, unshagged, and not out to anyone but his roommate Scorpius. He's totally crap at losing his virginity until he ends up in the pub of a 40-something barkeep who scowls fiercely and reads books at the bar counter. Great Albus Potter narrative voice, just funny and callow and irreverent enough to make for a lighthearted romance.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/317755]])

Another fic by one of my favorite authors. Young Professor Snape, about a year into his teaching career, botches a Dark spell meant to summon Lily out of the past, and ends up pulling his 5-year-old self into the present. Filch catches him trying to hide the half-drowned evidence. An awkward relationship between (working class) caretaker and (formerly working class) professor unfolds, and meanwhile the question of how to deal with his child self drives Snape 1) spare, 2) to the library, and 3) into paroxysms of self-loathing. If you think Snape is bad with other kids, watch how he treats himself. A fantastic character study, great voices, humor, insight, and an upbeat ending.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1007306/chapters/1997581]])

Tom Riddle lurks in the locket, and Harry takes it upon himself to outwit him on his own, thus opening the door to seduction by darkness. Great deadpan sardonic narrative, gradual creepiness, an intelligent version of Riddle, and a fascinating dynamic with Tom/Harry/Snape.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/358691]])

Mostly a portrait of Sirius and his bleakness and fuck-ups and the way the nihilism of the first war brings out his own issues, not least through his erotic collisions with Snape. This is a complex, smoke-darkened look at a doomed character, with great dialogue and a spare, gorgeous style. The hate!sex between Sirius and Snape is tense and compelling and shows how conflicted and self-destructive Sirius is.

[[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/57770.html][The Ministry's Man]] by musamihi 11,300 words. Pairings: John Dawlish/Bartemious Crouch, Sr. (unrequited), John Dawlish/Rufus Scrimgeour

Beautifully written. Not a character I ever gave a fig about, but Dawlish becomes a lens through which to view how a decent but weak person with a rigid belief system becomes corrupted by his own imperfect moral compass and need for authority. Really powerful and sad, and the slash isn't graphic. (I linked to its original posting on hp_beholder in case you want to read what the comments say about it.)

** One of my favorite believable SS/HP slash where Harry's sexuality is slow to develop is Cambiare Podentes by Jordan a Grant. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936]]).

This is a Harry/Snape fic where there is a prophecy that in order to kill voldermort, harry must bind to snape in an ancient spell as his permanent slave. I was really really expecting not to like this fic - not least because I think slave fics as well as cross gen fic are really creepy in most stories, totally OOC and also not at all well explained. This story is totally different. First of all, it is a 600K-ish word series and so the characters and their motivations are fully explained. Second, snape and harry are both in character - especially snape.

I loved this fic and would highly recommend it to anyone who is okay with slash (even if not usually Harry/Snape) and likes really well written long fics. You will definitely like this.

For another slow build with great character development, Eclipse by Mijan. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164/chapters/527529]])

In this fic, Draco abducts Harry from school and takes him to the dungeon at Malfoy Manor to wait for voldermort. He undergoes a huge (and very understandable and well written) character change and decides to betray the Death Eaters and escapes with Harry. They go on a long camping trip to try to walk back to hogwarts and slowly become friends and then even more slowly, develop feelings for one-another. This fic was such an emotional rollercoaster! I loved so much about it - the slow build, the believable character development, the fairy circles, the really good potions and Old Magic descriptions, the loyalty of Harry after he gets back to hogwarts - just everything. I am really sad that there was not a completed sequel because I made the mistake of reading the one chapter of the sequel and it is just so heartbreaking without more that I wish I hadn't read it (actually, with the crazy popularity of this fic in the fandom, I am surprised someone else hadn't picked it up and finished it!). But regardless, great fic and I highly recommend it.

Another believable and almost canon-compliant fic is Twist of Fate by oakstone730. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506]])

In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Draco has to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This fic is the perfect example of a story that could only work in the HP universe - it is so woven into the fabric of canon. Canon knowledge just enriches this - it almost feels like it could be head cannon (EWE). Part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but what happened to Harry and Draco is just so tragic that it makes me sad to imagine it. The slash is very well explained and character driven and Harry's relationship with Ginny is also well developed and explained (not hand waived away).

Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this fic. It didn't come all that highly recommended on different fic lists I saw, but I loved it so much.

Finally, literally anything by Saras_girl is well done, plotty and has a slow build. TURN is one of the best and already recommended, but Helix is a favorite for an 8th year fic and All of Life is Yours to Miss is a great "Harry and Draco teach at hogwarts" fic.

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.

  A new prophecy comes to light, one that promises death for Harry Potter and enslavement for the wizarding world, unless Harry himself consents to being sexually enslaved--irrevocably and for life--to Severus Snape.

** Seconding [[/u/NaughtyGaymer]]'s mention of Sam Starbuck/Sam Storyteller/Copperbadge, a reliable author of exceptional fiction. One of my favorite stories in the fandom (and like the OP, I rarely read slash) is [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]].

** Drop Dead Gorgeous by Maya is hilarious all the way through. Harry/Draco, they are aurors working together after the war, when Harry discovers that he is half veela. played for laughs. It isn't too hard to find a pdf of all Maya's stuff, and its worth your time. Underwater Light is another of hers, but it hasn't aged quite as well IMO, though it still holds up.

** I feel like all my comments here are about Athey, but her fics fit your criteria, especially linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7560462]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11654689]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8116678]]). They're all TMR/HP, except one HP/DM. The progression of Harry figuring out his sexuality is slow, especially in the DM one.

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7748339/]]), Harry meets his new next door neighbour John during the summer between 6th and 7th year. But John is also mutant terrorist Pyro, posing as Mystique's brother and Magneto's son, while they try to find a mutant living in Little Whinging, Surrey. The progression is not slow, but Harry is still initially confused about his sexuality.

If you want some time-traveling romance you can read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712904]]). Salazar saves Harry's life when he's hurled back through time and they become confidants. Fluffy, not a lot of action.

A Bill/Harry medium length story starting after 5th year. Alternative career path for Harry too. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5498452]])

A short story romance between Harry and Viktor during the Tri-Wizard tournament (has a bit of smut in the hospital scene, you can skip it). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8947271/1/His-Hands]])

I'm sure there are more in my favorites list, but this are just a sample.
