I was reading "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" by BrilliantLady on ff.net when I read this amazing explanation for why floo powder was invented. To my knowledge this is entirely her idea, and not canon.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

In this one scene Hermione and her demon friends explain why so many witches and wizards were unable to escape being burned at the stake.

/"Some witches did escape," said Camio. "Did you never wonder why 'Floo powder' was invented? Jumping into fires isn't an intuitive method of travel, and a dangerous thing to experiment with. It was a desperate plan, for desperate times. Not all witches and wizards could Apparate, especially the young. So one bright Swedish alchemist -- one of our allies, not Flamel of course -- invented a powder to help their people escape. You kept a pouch of Flöja Powder in your pocket, so when it was dropped in the flames, or failing that when the flames reached you and started burning your clothes, it'd turn the fire green and you could travel instantaneously to a safe house, such as Hogwarts, where a fire was kept constantly burning in the Great Hall to aid travel."/

I've never seen this explanation before and was impressed. It makes A LOT of sense and shines some light on an otherwise mundane item.

INSTANT adoption into headcanon right there.


** The nice thing about headcanon is that it doesn't have to align perfectly with canon. The books do mention the floo network specifically, but it doesn't matter if you don't want it to, it works perfectly fine as a developing system.

You could have an eternally burning emerald flame in the Great Hall of Hogwarts to which all instances of floo travel are brought. As the magic was refined further, enchantments could be placed on various fireplaces to create alternate exit points and assign them names by which they were accessed. They are now managed by the ministry.

Or you could have early floo being a more unstructured and dangerous magic, users spinning through a realm of fire and ash searching through the glimpses they get out of various fires for a safe place to exit. Later enchantments give the realm of fire more structure in the form of a network in order to make it more direct and usable. The network falling into the hands of the ministry to manage.

​

I personally will always be partial to the fanon that the floo network was invented by St. Nick and that the proto-ministry coopted the network from him some time Statute of Secrecy was enacted in order to close connections to muggle homes and stop his violations. Though this interpretation is certainly up there too.

**** I imagine a lot of wizarding "invention" was along these lines.

Apparition, for example, would have been chaotic and deadly once first discovered. You're missing /parts/ while figuring it out! Parts are necessary!

I imagine Floo works more like a method of transition rather than a method of travel. The Floo Network puts those destinations on a map so you can form a network. Floo travel is a transition from corporeal to flame-based existence that allows the witch or wizard to be somewhere else quickly.

As others have pointed out, it's kind of like a DNS. The Internet is just packets of information going from computer to computer, but once you have a network of addresses, you can link them all together and form a communications network.

** I think there's a bit of a plot hole to the story of witches using freezing charms on the fire when they were getting burned. Likely, their hands would be tied, so I wonder how they would be able to get their wand, especially since the executioners would have searched for it before the burning. Also, if they had their wand at the burning, they would have had the wand in prison before execution, and could have just broken out.

*** Yeah, and what if you were a kid? Too young to know the charm or even have a wand?

And if you somehow miraculously smuggled your wand with you, you could accidentally drop it into the flames.

And if you actually managed to cast the spell, all that would do would save you from the flames. The mob would then untie you, take away your wand and then try drowning or hanging next.

That fic was very attentive to detail. Everything I just said is from it, and the scene where they explain the creation of floo isn't ranty or anything like a lot of authors do when they find a plot hole in canon. It's very well done in my opinion.

** No one's going to stop you from adopting it as a headcanon, but it does strongly contradict canon, both the excerpt in PoA and additions in Tales of Beedle the Bard and Pottermore.

Simply put, Beedle tells us witch hunts were mostly dangerous for children as they didn't have wands. PoA tells us adults used a flame freezing charm and allowed themselves to be tickled by flames. And Pottermore has the powder invented before witch hunts.

I think the idea that people who were able to overpower witches and wizards for long enough to tie them to a pyre would leave them with wands is insane. Probably a few got away with having wands on them, or some madlads/ladies got off on tricking the crazy muggles, but if magicals weren't actually dying in large numbers at the hands of muggles, I don't see why they would've hidden at all.

The above headcanon would probably apply for children too. Also, wand magic appears to depend far too much on individual ability to be a consistent life saving measure in the middle of a genocide, so the idea that all adult witches and wizards just magicked their way out of pyres seems kind of ridiculous.

Because of the children. In the main books we have a very good example of a magical child performing magic leading to an attack. We also know children cannot control their magic and are prone to doing it when they're emotional.

Which is why /I/ said mostly dangerous for children. Of course, some adults were caught. Nick is one of them, but he was literally caught with his wand in his hand. And PoA explicitly tells us they rarely caught an actual magical person.

Because magicals lived openly among muggles prior to the statute of secrecy. Why wouldn't they?

We are muggles and we know about wands. Wands and staves have been a part of witchcraft related lore in several cultures since forever. For this argument to be valid, this history would've had to have happened in an alternate universe where nobody had ever heard of wands.

  Because of the children.

If the threat were only to children, they would've hidden as many as they could and gone to war. Instead, they hid all magic, including magical locations and magical creatures and magical history and probably magical natural phenomena.

After all can't have muggles being able to harm a superior pureblood now can we?

So it is dramatically downplayed in history book and instead stuff like Wendelin the Weird is made popular.

Suddenly it was less an escape from genocide and more a leaving the muggle world behind.

More ivory tower enlightened peoples looking down on the common man.

Less the frantic escape from slaughter it likely was.

** - A much more down-to-Earth explanation is in linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia), which is BTW the brilliant piece of writing, and one very few (unfortunately) really good historic HP fanfictions. Highly recommended!
- Also, the Czech group around the server [[http://budec.net]], which writes about the Czech magical school located and hidden from Muggles at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]) (real, historical, and very magical place), considered [[http://budec.net/node/375][the idea]] that there are five elements, where some wizards are able to travell in cooperation with each. Some of them are impractical (travelling through /earth/ is really slow, /æther/ is too difficult), so what remains is travelling through /air/ (Apparition); travelling through /fire/ (most commonly used as Floo network; but there are other less frequently used networks like connection through everlasting lights in churches, used only by religious wizards in some countries); and most commonly used on the European continent (where it is not common to have fireplace in most households) is travel by /water/: transfer between springs, wells, some of them located even inside of the house.

*** Loved the five elements concept! I'm working on my local Wizarding Government (Argentinian Council of Magic) and I developed a network like the floo but based on Water, since fireplaces are uncommon in Mediterranean Europe and Latin America, but wells are quite common instead. Because of that, each Wizarding house holds an internal Atrium with a central well (based on the Roman /Domus/), this design was also quite common in the colonial latinamerica.

** Yeah, I honestly love that headcannon. I find the canonical explanation to be weird and suspicious - it seems like the kind of thing you'd teach using the "lying to children" methodology of education (you know, the one that starts off with, like, first grade history is all "and the pilgrims and native Americans lived in harmony together" and then slowly adds in the genocide later). After all, there does seem to be a concerted effort to portray muggles as stupid and incompetent and I'm pretty sure muggles would notice someone wasn't burning and proceed to other suppression methods if the canonical explanation was actually correct.

***** I think it's only really been established that you can only /exit/ fireplaces that are on the Flu Network. If a travel fire was always lit, it would be the only place anyone went. Or maybe the flu network is an automated travel system, and an early iteration of flu powder was self-guided rather than speech activated, and you had to bring yourself out of an existing fire. It could still be cannon compliant. And if it isn't, it's an AU where demons exist, it's still a neat idea.

***** This would also be the earliest iteration of it, to be used in the most desperate circumstance.honestly once it became popular the would have added measures to be safer and most people if they had fire as a mode of travel would put it in a fireplace Instead of in a firepit on their livingroom floor. Fire places are just easier when inside a house.

Eventually they could have added measure to link only certain fireplaces together, for regulation, safety, or even speed, but most likely this was not the original design because who thinks "let's jump in a fire for transport" especially when their are people who could teleport. Portkeys are a logical evolution to apperation but not floo travel. It makes more sense that it was a risky last ditch effort.
