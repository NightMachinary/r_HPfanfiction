I've been debating on posting a link to my Potterverse Fanfiction here for the longest time because I didn't wanna intrude on anything or be annoying, but I've decided that I wanna show people the pilot chapter of a brand new character I've been working on.

May I present to you, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13349059/1/Chip-Dangerstone-Dragon-Zoologist][Chip Dangerstone, Dragon Zoologist!]]

This is set years after epilogue and has nothing to do with Harry himself whatsoever, but does feature a hint of Charlie Weasley and Hagrid.

Please feel free to review it!

Sincerely Ignis (aka Thoth's Quill)


** It's really good. I am always a proponent of Wizarding world fics. There is so much to explore and develop besides Harry's stories . Really great.
