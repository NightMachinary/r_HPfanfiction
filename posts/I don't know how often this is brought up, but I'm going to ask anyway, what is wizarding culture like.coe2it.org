Honestly, I love reading fics where they explore the culture but they often examine the pure blood high society culture, and while some of it makes sense, I just don't see how it often ties in unless it's a super political harry fic.

I got to thinking, what is the magical workds culture like in the wizarding world? did it have it's own foods? was the only transportation besides apparition available floo, portkeys, or the knight bus? I know it touches broom and flying carpets but those are very visible to muggles so I don't see them used as an every day transport option. for that matter, does having those basic instant transportation option limit the society? I mean for the love of magic, they have instant transportation and use owls for post, but stick their head in the fireplace for instant communication?

What about the arts beyond painting like theatre, sculpture....what about the music? how do you envision your wizarding world?

It's a set of weird thoughts to post, but it's been on my brain because I am sick of reading the same old fandom tropey options on it.


** It seems to me to be like the 1990s UK, only without the TV if you look at purely canon facts and statements.

Arthur doesn't understand electricity, but can enchant a car, as magic substitutes very well.

kinda, we know they definitely had their own drinks, like pumpkin juice being as common as orange juice, and they had their own alternatives for alcohol like elven wine, butter beer or fire whiskey. They also have heir own sweets like chocolate frogs or acid pops. The regular foods seems to more normal though.

there are also magical mounts like Hippogrifs or Aethonans(British winged horses), though by law they have to be charmed invisible, Pottermore also mentions that cars are quite common among wizards and we see the ministry use cars in the books.

It depends what you mean with limits, it certainly reduced the need for more advanced forms of communication, but it certainly has advantages in general being able to travel to any part of the country in seconds. It defnitly made the statute of secrecy much more possible since wizards could now live spread out over the country and still visit and trade with each other as if they were living in the same town.

We know they have their own fairy tales like the Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Lockharts Books seem to have been more literature then textbooks. We do now that they have quite a bit of musicians though, like Celestina Warbeck or Lorcan d'Eath and bands like the Weird Sisters or the Hobgoblins.
