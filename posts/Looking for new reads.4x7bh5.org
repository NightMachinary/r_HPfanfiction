Hey guys and galls im a pretty avid reader and im looking for some new stories if they arnt complete then atleast make sure they are active, nothing worse then getting 3/4 of the way through and they havnt been updated in 3 years, mature and darker/grayer fics please and not methods or rationality or fics like that ive heard good things about them but i got like 14 chaps in after forcing myself and i just didnt like it and no Snape or Malfoy centered,i hope that narrows it down and cheers if you know one that might fit this criteria im abit fussy and i really hate stories that seem good and then suddenly chuck in out of nowhere some stupid fact or piece of info that just make the whole thing seem like a waste of time


** It'd be helpful if you posted some fics you have read recently, so we know what sort of thing you like and don't rec you the same thing?

*** Seconded, because right now it's just easier to point you to the sidebar. Also, your post gave me lymphoma.

** First: punctuation is your friend. Paragraphs are your friend. Not using either makes them and me sad.

Second: Since you give such a vague description of what you like, here is a general list of great fics: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][Taure's ff list]]

** I have to agree with FloreatCastellum and ScottPress.

OP - What pairings do you like? Plot elements? Relationships with certain characters?

** *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2&_c1=6][This Link]]* lists all completed fics without Draco Malfoy as a main character, ranked by the Number of Favorites. It should give you some ideas.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2&_c1=9][This Link]]* uses similar filter criteria other than excluding Snape as a main character.
