Just a random thought I had just now; what if those two had their places swapped for a fic?

Amelia Bones is the trusted Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, dutifully helping to process the mounds and mounds of paperwork that comes with the job and speaking candidly about her observations to the Wizengamot.

A fair-minded, logical woman, she tends to demand proof before she takes any action, a modus operandi that has seen many people (like Arthur Weasley) get well-deserved promotions and pay raises, but at the same time hinders her in revealing the corruption of the likes of Fudge, Umbridge, Malfoy, and so on.

Dolores Umbridge is the twisted Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, a position she took by no small amount of cheating, blackmail, and sometimes violence.

On the surface she's obnoxiously sweet and gets all the paperwork done on time, but rumor has it that she and a cadre of corrupt MLES members are engaged in extortion and racketeering on a massive level, and Dolores herself doesn't hesitate to use her control over the Aurors and Dementors to arrange 'accidents' for anyone who opposes her, in the Ministry or out.

What happens when these two roles are swapped over? What happens with Hagrid's arrest in 2nd year, or Sirius Black's escape in the 3rd? Or Barty Crouch's secretly imperius'd and alive son?

How would Amelia fight against Voldemort in the position of Undersecretary with access to all the data? How would Umbridge push her agenda against half-breeds given the full power of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement?


** Voldemort no longer has a pet cause to rally the purebloods around, because Umbitch will have genocided all the non-purebloods.

*** The South African way: "Z committed suicide by strangling himself in his cell using only his hands"\\
"Z' slipped and fell while being transferred to another cell"

Or my favorite: "Z'' was found dead in his cell"

**** Shot himself twice in the back of the head. Suicide.

Found locked in a trunk in the attic. Accidental death.

Polonium tea.

It just goes on and on.

We just don't understand yet what he did with the gun afterward.

The ones in my precedent com are actual registered causes of deaths of black activists in prison during the apartheid in South Africa. Though quoted from memory.

There's Fran√ßois de Grossouvre, a French politician, who committed suicide by shooting himself twice in the back in the middle of the Elysee Palace.

I've never understood how people (powerful people, anyway) can get away with things like that...

** Dementor "accidents" rise significantly. Might even get a dementor vs werewolf war as Umbridge tries to wipe all the werewolves out. I'd like a story where Umbridge decides Bones isn't doing a good enough job capturing Sirius Black and so convinces Fudge to give her Bone's position, much as she did in regards to Hogwarts.
