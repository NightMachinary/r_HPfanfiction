**** It just keeps piling on the awful to an outrageous degree. I understand the use of tragedy and such in storytelling, but he just starts at 60 and brings it up to 100 very quickly, and it stays there for a long time, if not the whole story.

For me and a lot of readers, it feels like too much at times. Forcing children, /children,/ to have sex, his overuse of sexual assault (particularly in this series), and his general focus around depravity with nothing to buffer it in between just serves to make most people feel more ill than enthralled.

** As a deconstruction of harems, I enjoyed it. As for everything else about it: it got weaker as the trilogy went on.

** The discussion happened a few times already.

​

And I cannot agree more with people when they say it is overrated, perverse, sexist, anti-human rights, and glorifying and not condemning enough of the abuse of human freedom.

Especially the apparent need to have children fuck, made me want to throw up.

**** I mean, Darth Maars is a skilled writer compared to some other fanfiction authors out there, but his stories have a tendency to revolve around the same topics, and they are admittedly not for everyone.

****** I can assure you, you are not alone with that opinion.

I myself cannot read stories that try to establish a dramatic (anti)-hero, above and beyond any law. Especially the set-up that "love" (Hermione and Luna) are capable of "calming" the MC. Its too forced, too set up and made me stop reading when it happend. I returned eventually to read but skipped any and all vomit inducing "romance"-scenes.

******* My Main issue is harry acting the way he did whne he was a "sith" (he fucking wasn't a sith get that shit out of here) He was a juiced up Dark Sider that failed to control himself, A Rabbid dog that any Sith Master other than Palpatine would have put down on the spot. A Sith who lets the dark side control him is no sith at all and it annoys me that Harry acts the way he does.

******** Indeed, it was for plot-convenience, most assuredly. It was a boring excuse to (again) drop ethos and let pathos evolve into warmongery, allowing to establish a dominion of terror and sovereignity that lays solely with the MCs.

********* It's stupid, because again, very few sith act like that, and the ones who do end up dead. Even when Harry is "sane" he still acts like a mad dog at points and it doesn't make any sense and it shows he has no mastery over the Dark Side at all, it's just to drive the plot forward for no reason.

********** I agree completely, although my knowledge of Star Wars and consequently the Sith, is rather limited.

It's an enabler, this part of the story I mean. It enables the author to ignore moral, ethics and realistic human rights for sake of making it a power-jerk story. By adding supposedly "moral" Hermione and Luna into the story, the author then tries to build up a illusion of "but here, look: they are trying to guide him to do better.", which ends up with murder, totalitarism and genocide. Well done girls. :D

*********** See, I am honestly fine with the end result of Hermione and Luna trying and failing to turn him away from his dark urges, its incredibly hard to do that even in star wars. But the Dark Side is corrupting and controlling and it takes a strong will (witch we know Harry has even if his mind has been erased)

Hell other sith even point out the flaws in Harry's mindset in this book

“Killing without reason or gain was a petty pleasure of sadistic fools.” ― Drew Karpyshyn, Darth Bane: Star Wars 3-Book Bundle: Path of Destruction, Rule of Two, Dynasty of Evil

“The Force tries to resist the callings of ravenous spirits; therefore it must be broken and made a beast of burden. It must be made to answer to one's will.” Darth Plagueis

** Mixed feelings.

It was an astonishingly creative AU take on the HP 'verse, inverting several tropes (the origin of Dumbledore's wand, Harry's being especially susceptible to Fleur's allure as opposed to what we see in canon and throughout fanfiction, Molly being venerated for her ability to bear sons, etc.), though many plot elements seemed needlessly cruel or grim.

I thought the story went downhill once Harry and Luna got it on. It just had a dismal vibe to it, particularly by the end, to the point that it became a chore to read. I stopped reading it partway through the third book (I read the regular installments while it was being written--DM is nothing if not diligent with putting out chapters) and I hear the ending was not worth the wait.

** I'd probably give it a 5/10, but I wouldn't describe it as mediocre. More like a very mixed bag of some great stuff and some... significantly less great stuff. The writing is good. That's the first thing I look for in a fanfic, or any piece of writing. The characters are mostly well developed and compelling, even if many of them have basically nothing to do with their canon counterparts. The worldbuilding is certainly original.

On the other hand, I just can't move passed the fact that the basic premise is essentially, "What if we actually lived in the world that MRA's think we live in?" I said most of the characters are well developed, but the ones that aren't are really cringe-inducing. There's a lot of unnecessary squickiness in the story, and it's justified in some really absurd ways, both in terms of the worldbuilding and the actions of characters. In some ways I enjoyed it, but it also left kind of a bad taste in my mouth.

** Did NOT like it. I found it it was a horrible, misogynistic piece of trash that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a male wank-fantasy or a display on how all women are evil and repress men.... it did have some interesting idea and tried to explore a world where harems were common and men were oppressed, but it had barely any likeable characters and the worldbuilding made no bloody sense.

I started skimming through it cause I wanted to see what it did with Luna; Luna's my fave character and the first story in the trilogy made such a BIG deal out of her even though she never avtually appeared, so I wanted to see what she was like.,,, and it turned out that this was a Luna that I just want to STRANGLE.

** It's been a long time since I read the series. I remember being impressed at how believable the AU was and loving the story as a whole. Then utterly detesting the ending.

Looks like I'll have to reread it, given that some of the comments here seem to suggest it's awful.
