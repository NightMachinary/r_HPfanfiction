Where he doesn't fall through the veil, he doesn't die from other means.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to be focused on pairings).

No! Weasley bashing where they use Harry for his fame and fortune or are against him.


** Try this one. Heavily focused on Harry and Sirius. linkffn(8045114)

  The bond between a Godfather and his Godson is a phenomenal one. Through the years, if there's anything that can be known with certainty, it's that Sirius Black will stay, no matter what, with his Godson. No slash, godfather-godson bonding fic. AU, Sirius doesn't die, and he raises Harry. T for slight language.

**** your welcome. I know you said about no Weasley bashing, but it's what I have. I'm actually working on a Mystic Force and Harry Potter crossover where James and Lily throws Harry (Squib) away and Sirius and Amelia adopted him and move to Briarwood after Susan leaves for Hogwarts. Ron will be the only weasley bashed, and James and Lily will ber bashed as well

** I'm not a Harry, Harry Potter and the lighting curse, and A New Life Down Under are all good but you said no Weasley Bashing. A lot of 'Harry get married in Vegas because Padfoot faked his death' are pretty good. I remember a PRMM and HP crossover where Moony, Padfoot, and Harry moved to Angel Grove and They became their own team of Rangers and it was a Kimmie and Harry Pairring.

  Severus was raised Roman Catholic by his mother. As he laid dying in the Shrieking Shack, he portkeys to Father Patrick McKinney's for his Last Rites. Can Patrick keep his friend alive? Can Severus claim Sanctuary if he does survive? Will the British Ministry of Magic accept the claim?
