** I remember Patron being like that with Harry giving up most of his money to save Hermonie. It's a decent fic and updates regularly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]

*** It's not exactly like that. Harry didn't have much money in first year (and spent too much on it on a gift, leaving just enough to pay for Hogwarts for both), but by the time the story starts (in 4th year), he's already past the "starting over with nothing" part.

** How on earth does someone give up half their magic? What does 'half his magic' mean, anyway?

*** It's when you have a blood magic ritual processed by the Goblins (who love you and declare complete allegiance to you because you didn't spew insults at them) to inexorably link your souls together and transfer half of your 12 magical animagus forms and half of your magical core to the intended recipient, who also happens to become part of your Most Ancient and Noble House.

/s, god, there's way too much terrible fanfiction

**** Oh did you explain this to the very cool and contained Draco malfoy, your best friend who is totally OK with mudbloods now that you actually accepted his friendship. Now that you, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny and Draco started a big harem you don't need jerkronald weasley.

**** If you haven't read Patron, I think you'd really like it. Not /exactly/ what you're looking for, but I think it might match the /feel/ of what you're looking for.

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen) has a very throttled Harry as the result of a few rituals that conflict.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

**** In canon there isn't any 'magical capacity' and potential to be successful in magic is clearly mental - knowlegde, willpower, repetition etc. So the ritual you mentioned would... make Harry dumber and more idle?

That could work, but I don't think it's what you have on mind.

** Not...quite what you're describing, but the 'Harry and Hermione start over with almost nothing' fits the plot of 'Resistance' fairly well, and its very good story overall(as is most of lorien's stuff)

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.
