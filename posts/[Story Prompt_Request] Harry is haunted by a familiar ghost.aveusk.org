The summer after the fourth year, Harry Potter is ready for a year filled with angst and hardship, when suddenly, Cedric's ghost comes to haunt him. Maybe the ghost is only visible to Harry [like a hallucination]. Or maybe ghost!Cedric takes it upon himself to be Harry's life coach.

It'd be cool if the story focuses comedic elements. Ghost!Cedric acts as a love guru and helps Harry to woo Cho much the mortification of both. He also goes "This is what I died for?", "I died for you, Harry" whenever Harry gets into too much angst/whine territory. Have the ghost talk shit to Umbridge and Snape's face and actually get away with it. Dumbledore doesn't do anything because it's quite an amusing thing for him to watch.


** Harry: *angsts*

Cedric: but did you die?

** For some reason, I imagine Cedric watching Harry while he sleeps like Edward (the sparkly vampire) did with Bella in the Twilight movie. Hey, same actor!

*** And then he beats up Umbridge and force-feeds her LSD like he did in Good Time.
