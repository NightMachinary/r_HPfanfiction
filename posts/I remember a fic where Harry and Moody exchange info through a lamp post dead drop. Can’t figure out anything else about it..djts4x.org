*** That is the one where Harry time travels into the past then the future again? That seems like it would fit the situation.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I've been reading it for a bit now since I got the replies for it. If you enjoy the past part you may enjoy linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence)

Somewhat the same vibe but of course it's not for everyone.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
