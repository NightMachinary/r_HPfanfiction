** It's pretty good and I'd definitely like to see more. You have a lot of characters, and this makes it a bit confusing for the reader. Also--this is personal preference--but it's a little odd to read about the HP world written in non-British English.

*** Thank you for the feedback. I am trying my best to get the "british" flavor, and have a beta from the UK who is trying to point out flubs, but I always appreciate any additional brit-picking. I will try to adopt it in the future, and also to correct previous chapters as possible.

There are a lot of characters, I know. Before I started writing, I made a handbook of all forty first years, with bios and pictures, as well as older students and teachers. Hopefully, they'll become clearer in time. I wanted to leave the door open for sequels, if this particular story goes well.

I will keep in mind that, for the time being, I need to focus more closely on a smaller circle of characters.

**** LOL I have the same problem, too! My stories (set in my own imaginary country, no magic unfortunately) need some pruning as to which characters are important for the story at hand and which ones aren't necessary. I try to keep in mind that someone might have a cool story (and I have background on each one), but they don't really fit with /this/ story. That person can stay the random shy girl in class or whatever, then maybe later I'll write a story on them.

Definitely let us know when you have more! I'm really curious as to what happens next. :)

***** I will definitely let you know when it's updated, which will hopefully be soon. :-) Once again, as this is my first long fanfic, there are bound to be some rough edges, but hopefully they won't be /too/ rough.

** I'm far too impatient to read WIPs... Now I want chapter 10! (:

I did enjoy this story, though. I think your Scorpius is dealing with a lot of what he would have had to deal with in canon. Please continue!

*** Well, I will take that as a compliment! This is my first long fanfic, plus the post-War Draco one, and I think in the future I will make sure to have the /entire/ thing written before I start to post just so that people don't get too impatient for updates. I've got a plot outline, so moving forward/not getting stuck should not be a problem.

A lot of people are finding Scorpius's situation sad, but I am afraid I think it is realistic. :-(

** Story Summary: "Scorpius resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry"-DH, 756. As the children of the leading figures of the last Wizarding War enter their first year at Hogwarts, they struggle to come to terms with their identities in relationship to their famous or notorious parents. At the same time, a shocking political shift forces wizards everywhere to reconsider their beliefs.
