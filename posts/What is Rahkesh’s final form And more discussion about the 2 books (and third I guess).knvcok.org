Miranda Flairgold wrote, imo, one of the most interesting series's of all time. Since it isn't completed, I still have some questions. Mainly, what is Rahkesh's (Harry) final form, and (What I've heard from some people), Why isn't Namach real. Linkffn(Second Chances In Life by Miranda Flairgold) Linkffn(Changes in a time of war by Miranda Flairgold) Linkffn(A Magical World by Miranda Flairgold)


** Fam, I have been wondering this for a LONG ASS TIME. My best guess is hes turning into an Elf, or possibly some dragon/snake/thunderbird/elf hybrid of unlimited rage and powert

**** Its pretty well sprinkled in even from his first interaction with Namach. He is skilled in large scale magical construction (like the elves), he is extremely sensitive to soul magics (like the elves). Its also clear that it isnt a death dragon like mentioned else where in the thread, for the reasons covered in that response. The only other option that the elves would kill him for is if he was becoming a demon, but thats clearly not it as the elves would not be "over reacting" as is said in the text.

** I am so glad to know that im not the only one still wondering. Every few years i go back to read it again, in some kind of fain hope that Miranda has decided to finish it and every time i google all related myths in hopes of determining what the final form was supposed to be. I have never been able to find anything that has convinced.

******** Just found what I was thinking of in chapter 27 of changes in a time of war. I assume that would mean chapter 26 that the comment was posted. I pasted it below:

I was going to reply to reviews, but then I realized that it would take a whole chapter in and of itself! Just know that I read all reviews multiple times and appreciate them all. Though reviews don't influence my plot any so you can beg for your favorite pairing, it won't happen, sorry. Still, I like hearing what readers are thinking.

A bit of technical information -- each bloodmagic ritual is also called a "piece". Groups of rituals with the same purpose that build off each other to create an eventual full effect are all pieces. The final result is called a "set". For example; the lowest level stamina improvement "set" contains three "pieces"(or individual rituals). They build off each other and are very similar. The second level of stamina enhancing bloodmagics is another "set" containing four "pieces"(rituals) that build off each other but are different from the lower level stamina set, though they do link because the purposes are related.

Woohoo! Someone guessed what Rahkesh is turning into! The hints are all there, have been for a long time, it's good it was finally guessed by a few people.

** Uh, it is indicated quite strongly what his finale animagus form is when you read between the lines. Think about the conversation with the elven commanders and Namach.\\
In the end it can only be the Deathdragon.\\
Harry reaction, the reaction of the elves and Namach etc., when Namach later ponders, why necromancy is quite easy for Harry.\\
There are a lot of little corner points like he can't knot (sorry don't know how Name of the skill) because nobody (except the one vampire who is dead) knows what kind of material to use. Namach doesn't exist ... uh that news to me. :)

I find that interesting because the belief was that the thunderbird was pushed forward because of the dragon's blood so therefore if he was a death dragon that would have been the first animagus form that came to being.

I honestly thought he was a prior evolution of an elf. Like one first kinds of elves that came into being.

*** I didn't count death dragon as an option as I thought I recalled in an AN they said it wouldn't be a dragon. And there are a lot of reviews they restate that comment, and list quetzalcoatl or elf for various different reasons. I also recall someone suggesting he was turning into, or something similar to, the previous advanced earth reptilian like race on each that elves got close to.

Quetzalcoatl was listed as it being tied to death and rebirth and being bird and serpent. Elf was listed for a couple different reasons but the one I recall best was how Miranda made many story points about harry always following his instincts, even if he doesn't know why, being very similar to the elven form of prediction where she said they could look at the future to see doing /blank/ would result in /desired result/ even if they didn't know the why. There was also a reasoning that since the elves seeded human life.on earth after the last civilizations died out why wouldn't they seed life that could evolve into themselves or something similar. They backed this up with Namach's statement that what the elf's wanted more than anything was basically not to be alone in the universe. The previous advanced reptilian race was back up with effects of the dragon blood and the idea that of course the elves would basically attack on sight since they basically had to genocide that race 🤷‍♂️

These are the main conversations I can recall.
