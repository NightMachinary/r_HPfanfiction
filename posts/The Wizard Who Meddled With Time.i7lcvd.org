The Wizard Who Meddled With Time by Team Ozone

It's about a version of Harry who invents chronomancy - time magic that can be cast with a wand. He goes back in time and fuses with his younger self after a brief conversation. Then he sends Hedwig slightly back in time to more quickly send a message to Dumbledore. Dumbledore arrives and Harry is fondly frustrated by how quickly he figures out what's going on. Harry quickly makes his own wand - for the core, he gets a centaur to willingly give him one of their optic nerves in exchange for... something.

The fic is no longer on ffn. Does anybody know it has been posted or archived anywhere? Or does anybody have a copy saved that they'd be willing to send me?
