** Harry and the others stepped out of the doorway. As they looked around, several other doorways were visible all around them. There were several people in various costumes coming out of the portals. As he turned towards his right, Harry spotted a Hagrid sized man with purple skin and a sword the size of a helicopter blade standing at the head of an army looking utterly flummoxed.

In which Paarthurnax and the Greybeards are utterly bewildered when a magical portal appears and disgorges over two dozen teenagers, all wielders of a dialect of the thu'um they've never heard before, into the halls of High Hrothgar.

In which both Miraak and Hermaeus Mora are left speechless when the Inquisitorial Squad, attempting to pursue the DA, are dumped into Apocrypha.

*** A good one would be Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice and Fire. BUT, instead of getting involved with the plot, they just try their hardest to survive and find a way home. It would be a different take on the premise of most crossovers.

Plus, since they are just teens, they would probably lack the knowledge and maturity to go through with it unscathed. I believe there was one story where they got stranded on an island and had to figure out how to survive.
