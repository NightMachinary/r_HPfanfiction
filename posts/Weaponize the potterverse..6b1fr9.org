How do you go about weaponizing the spells and artifacts in the potterverse? Such as turning a tungsten pole with modified broom charms into a kinetic kill vehicle to using gemino to crush an enemy via sand to using gillyweed to make someone 'drown' in the air.

*** A snitch at 2000 feet/sec wouldn't have much more energy than your average assault rifle bullet, except with a larger cross-sectional area, meaning less pressure, and thus less penetration.

I know from the Harry Potter wiki that snitches are walnut sized. Walnuts weigh from 10 to 20 grams. Snitches are made of gold and silver, which is more dense than walnut meat, but they're also hollow. So I'm going to assume the snitch weighs about 20 grams, or .02 kilograms.

2000 feet per second is a bit less than 610 meters per second.

The equation for kinetic energy is 1/2 * m * v^{2} .

.02 kilograms * (610 meters/second)^{2} / 2 = 3721 joules.

7.62x51mm NATO rounds have about 3800 joules of kinetic energy.

Further, as I've already established, snitches are hollow, and thus not likely to hold up well under pressure, and would just crumple.

It would be better to have Dobby's homing bludgers en masse. Even better if the charms could be applied to bombs, or grenades, or chunks of C4, or vials of chemical/biological agent, etc. Banishing a beehive-type round would probably also work well, but be less targetable.

Also, I doubt any sort of sound would shatter bones, that are inside someone's body. Meat is too good of an insulator. Vibrating organs? Maybe. Breaking eardrums? Probably. But shattering bones? Unlikely.

***** 1) "The most lethal variant possible" ? Then it isn't a snitch anymore. Why not just say, "use magic to enchant a flechette to behave like the arrow from GotG," because that's what you really want.

2) But you talked specifically about shattering bones. A 200 db sound is fatal because it vibrates things that shouldn't be vibrated, like your brain. It's hard to shatter bone with actual physical force, it's even harder to do so when the applicator of that force is just the air. Eardrums are thin membranes, and the ear is designed to funnel sound into them. A 150 db sound might rip your eardrums, yes. And the decibel scale is a logarithmic one, yes. So a 200 db sound is 100000 times as powerful as a 150 db one, but we're also talking about comparing the force it takes to punch a hole through a sheet of tissue paper to the force it takes to break a hardwood plank.

******* Is that not true? If I took your iPhone from you and replaced the screen with clear jello, and replaced iOS with Android, would it still be a phone? Perhaps. But it wouldn't be an iPhone. And if you want a homing ball that follows your commands, and is made out of solid lead, then you don't have a Snitch. You have a lead ball. And if you're going to do that, why use a lead ball? Use something that's actually efficient. Either you're going to use what you have available, which would be an actual Nnitch, or you're going to make something new, in which case it should be something suited to the task.

If you're going to talk about applications of magic as tools of war, then it pays to actually make sense. Maybe the fanfics you write are full-on Mary Sues, where Harry can just snap his fingers and the Snitch just zooms down Voldemort's throat and chokes him to death, but I prefer a bit of realism in my stories, where possible plot holes are actually addressed in-universe.

Further, your ad hominem doesn't exactly lend credence to your argument.

Nope. Everyone would call it a snitch and it would be recognized as such for basically everything except perhaps legal play in an actual game. They aren't going to call it a golden ball with wings, they aren't going to call it a small bludger, they aren't going to call it a non-snitch. If any witch or wizard was attacked by that weapon you know what they would tell the aurors if they survived? That they were attacked by a snitch.

Also, it's magic. You can put up any amount of counter argument bullshit but ultimately when the writer writes it into a story and it happens you have to accept that there is some reason that it worked that way and that reason is going to be magic.

Seriously guy, you and people like you seems to be unable to grasp the "It's magic" part of being magic in fiction.

If you can't explain it in-universe beyond "well it's magic, we can't explain it" then I'm not going to be holding that suspension of disbelief. Things have to be internally consistent, and actually make sense. If you want to completely rewrite how physics works in your universe, fine. You don't even have to tell me how you rewrote it. But you have to keep consistency with it. Like Mass Effect. The one big lie there is element zero. Everything in the universe can be brought back to relate to that plot device. Lowering mass, raising mass, altering gravity. Same with magic. It needs limits on what it can do, the characters need limits on what they can do, or you just have a Mary Sue, and generally people don't like reading those.

Take the animation charms Arthur Weasley put on the mini cooper. Put them on a tank. Or an artillery battery. Or anything military that has an engine, big guns and a set of wheels/treads on it.

Picture your average ICBM. Now shrink it. Then set it off. Then have it unshrink just before detonation. There, a nigh-on undetectable nuke that cannot be shot down.

Bludgers can be charmed to pick out fast-moving airborne targets in a highly discriminatory manner. Stick some Semtex on them, enchant them to attack a specific guy and watch them go boom.

Neville's attempts at potions would make for great chemical weapons. Aerosolizing the attempts at the boils-curing concoction would produce similar effects to mustard gas.

A bone-vanishing curse that doesn't require the victim's consent? Headshot the Death Eater with one and watch their brains flop to the ground. /Splat/

Need to kill a city in a hurry? Transfigure the water supply into hydrogen peroxide and watch that baby burn.

Need to kill a group of wizards without invoking collateral damage in an urban area? Animate the surrounding cars.

There's tons of ways that you can basically combine everyday spells with everyday household items an watch the resulting fireworks. The most promising route you can take for that is potions. It's also the most problematic to pair with technology. How would a slow cooker affect wolfsbane? What happens when you try and whip up a potion using a cake mixer? Can you put together a bag of dried up potions and activate them by cooking them in a microwave? There's tons of unresolved questions that need to be adressed before you can get down to properly weaponising simple spells or poitons.

*** You also have to keep in mind that magic doesn't work well with electricity. Anything that has to do with using magic on electronic devices is going to be iffy, especially something as precise as an ICBM.

You can magic away (pun intended) the interaction of regular old electric devices and magic (like a toaster, or electric lights), but anything that employs transistors cannot be shrunk without irreversibly damaging the device. There is a minimum possible size for transistors, so if you shrink it past that point, upon unshrinking it will have all stored data wiped.

Of course, if you don't need the guidance systems included in ICBMs, because you'll use whatever owl-magic lets them find people, or whatever, then that's fine. You can use mechanical triggers/arming mechanisms. But then, why bother using the rocket for propulsion, either? You can fly it with magic. It's at this point that it ceases to really be an ICBM. You've just made a missile with magic.

Maybe that's what you were going for, and you were just using the "shrink an ICBM" to better illustrate it.

Anyway, all of this talk of using muggle contraptions to do work is just narrow-minded, I think. Magic is virtually limitless. There's no reason to enchant muggle technology when you have to capability to completely remake it, using magic from the ground up.

**** It really depends on how lazy the caster is. Modifying a tool to use magic does make more sense and takes less time than building a completely magical replica of said tool from the ground up-if there ae enough tools to go around of course.

Making tools from the ground up does make more sense if you're building something like a lightsaber or a sonic screwdriver. But if you're just making a magically enhanced sword or screwdriver, then using a bog-standard example of the tool in question would be easier, faster and cheaper than magicking one up.

***** Ah, true enough. I just thought directly applied magic tended to fizzle out electronics, or areas of high ambient-magic saturation like Hogwarts, and depending on how shrinking spells work, I think my transistor point stands. If they just kinda push the real object into some sort of pocket dimension and present a smaller facsimile to make it appear the object has shrunk, then electronics would remain intact. If it's something like a compression algorithm in 7zip, then I'm not sure how that would work, and if it's just removing space inside the atoms or something then that's where the physics of the thing break down.

Does a miniature car run just like a normal one? If you take two identical cars, put a full tank of gas in each, and shrink one, then turn both on, will they run for the same period of time? Does shrinking fuel give it a higher energy density? Could you fill a 55 gallon drum with gas, shrink it, pour into another drum, unshrink the first, and fill and shrink and repeat until you have 55 gallons of extremely concentrated fuel? Can you shrink that one and repeat?

How about fission bombs? The smallest critical mass for a plutonium bomb is about 15 kg. If you take two 8 kg hemispheres and shrink them, then push them together will it have the force of a regular 15 kg plutonium bomb?

Could you take 100 hydrogen bombs, shrink them, and put them in a case together to have a bomb with a yield of 100x your average nuclear device? Shrinking spells have a lot of weaponization potential, depending on how they work.

** I can think of a few things. You could use a color changing charm on the eyes of your enemies to effectively blind them. Human transfiguration is dangerous, because it is really easy to botch up. What better way to kill than to transfigure someone half way between a fish and a table ? You can also transfigure their clothes into something deadly like Devil Snare. Or the very air around them. Then take the accio spell. Non targeted, just say accio brain.

Potions can also do the trick, especially failed ones. Just find the more dangerous failed recipe or the more explosive mix between ingredients and you just created a nice magical bomb.

You can enchant object, muggle or magical ones. Like an enchanted assault rifle, you enchant it to have unlimited ammo, and enchant the bullets to be able to go through magical shields. Or I can think about Fred and George magical fireworks, which follow their victim, and duplicate when you try to dispel it. Make it deadly instead of harmless.

** Have a person spray a ridiculous amount of alcohol (I think there is a canon charm/spell for that) at the enemy. Then ignite with fire (incendio will do the trick or an enchanted match/lighter).

Do the thing in Bellatrix's vault, but with something else (like a time bomb). Geminio and flagrante are the spells.

Dragons... And Basilisks (or not, 'cause you said spells and artifacts)

Time-Turner Bombs (just chuck Time-Turners at them). Non-lethal, but has a psychological effect on remanding enemies.

Animate weapons, automated snipers and machine guns.

Engorgio acromantulas and setting them on the enemy.

step one: go down into a subway station and cast Fiendfyre

step two: portkey away leaving uncontrolled Fiendfyre

step three : go to another subway station and repeat step one and two

by the time anyone from the ministry of magic finds out about the Fiendfyre the fire would be so out of control that even the whole ministry of magic working together would not be able to stop it.

If the death eaters were to do a coordinated attack on multi citys it would be devastating.

It would repeat the spell you've just cast several times very quickly after the first is cast, only stopping when told to do so. Unsuspecting teachers would panic, and malicious maniacs would have an Avada Kedavra AK (if it isn't blocked against certain spells, but I'm sure someone smart enough could figure that out.)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
