I'm thinking of writing a short fic on the idea but I'm not sure what direction I want to take the summer. The only requirement is that he somehow manages to leave the Dursleys and reach Hogwarts. Maybe he used accidental magic. Maybe he was let out by authorities. I don't know. I haven't gotten to that part.


** Like Molly said, eventually they would have come to check up on him:

  ‚ÄúI don't blame you, dear,‚Äù she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. ‚ÄúArthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,‚Äù (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) ‚Äúflying an illegal car halfway across the country---anyone could have seen you---‚Äù

I think you can simply generalise this: /Someone/ eventually would have gotten him out. Of course, whether that works for your story is another matter.

** I remember reading a fic where harry waiting until all 3 dursleys had left the house and then he smashed through one of the walls connecting his and Dudley's room, climbed through, got some bolt cutters from Vernons toolkit and used that to cut the bars on hedwigs cage and padlock on the cupboard under the stairs for his stuff, threw the essentials in a rucksack and flew away while wearing his invisibility clock.

Alternatively as someone else mentioned Molly and Arthur did say the were thinking of getting Harry themselves at the weekend.

Or Mrs Figg could've been like "hmm not seen him in a while" (but doubtless to be honest.....)

Although I could totally imagine Minerva "visiting" under the guise of being one of Figgs many cats. If she saw the bars on the window I bet she would be curious and probably climb in an open window when no one was looking and investigate

** - Harry pulls something like he did in Primary School and apparates out of there. Then he breaks in from the outside to get his stuff and go.

- Harry uses accidental magic that makes him pretty much unnoticeable (not invisible, like a notice-me-not type), and slips out the cat-flap in his door (imagine it's a big one.)

- Harry finds a way to make some sort of sign, it gets reported to the police, the Dursleys get arrested and Harry gets put into the British equivalent of CPS. Let's imagine Dumbledore is powerless here, or just doesn't want to intervene once he learns what happened in the Dursley household.

- Dumbledore finds out from Mrs. Figg what's happening, and extracts Harry.

- Hermione puts the pieces together about Harry's home life and comes to get him (but then again she'd probably just report him to the British equivalent of CPS too.)

- Some random neighbor (Wizard or Muggle or anything in between) notices what's going on in the Dursley household and offers that he could stay at their house.

Just some ideas.

**** With the time setting that sort of thing would've been considered 'in house' for the most part.

Even orgs didn't really care too much unless it was truly awful, well less that they didn't care but if you're overworked and underpaid even if you were called at some point you wouldn't look too closely at some of it. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Baby_P][See The Baby P case from 2007 for an example of the sort of thing that happened.]] It's not a pleasant read, but shows that even when people are aware there is an issue sometimes nothing/not enough is done.

**** Muggles are shown to ignore anything and everything odd related to magic.

As for Harry, thematically, the point is that Little Whinging is full of Dursleys und Dudleys. Hence there's nothing to expect from any of them; it's a juxtaposition of Harry and the world of Little Whinging where he simply does not fit. Rescue must come from the outside (Ron & co) and Harry must escape this world, he can't exist in it.

And there is no further purpose to Harry's life at the Dursleys than this, which is why the books never make it a point to expand on it (from the boxroom under the stairs to school life to local authorities).

‚Äá

In a perhaps curious bottomline, this is very much a conservative, Malfoy-esque point the books make -- for one, about the only thing they and the Dursleys would agree on is that the worlds are best kept very, very far apart and should never mix, and for another, that a wizard belongs into the magical world, and being in the Muggle world is an unhappy existence of being misunderstood and having to hide what you are.

If that fear is high enough, they probably would let him out only when he has to return to Hogwarts. If not, then he would miss the train, not arrive at Hogwarts, and then either McGonagall or Dumbledore would go to retrieve him.

I think option 2 is the real interesting one, especially if it's Dumbledore. You can go in several directions with the story.

** Molly felt out of place at Saint Mungo's. Usually her and Arthur's roles were reversed; she was fire and brimstone and he was the calm and rational.

The fact that he had rushed off to Hogwarts, red as his own hair, had not been a good sign.

Not for Albus anyways.

With a sigh she looked towards the door where the healers were working. Magic could fix the boy up in a jiffy, but it still took time, time that made Molly worry and think.

It started on Friday. She and Arthur had begun to worry about Ron's best friend, Harry. Earlier in the week she had caught Ron, Fred, and George trying to steal Arthurs car to go and 'rescue Harry from the Muggles.' Even thinking about it Molly felt shame for how she had berated the boys. By Friday night, when they still hadn't received a letter from the boy she had promised Ron that she would hop over and check on him.

Saturday had bloomed a beautiful August morning and Molly had taken her nice sweet time getting the animals taken care of and preparing breakfast. Ron kept giving her doe eyes; so she sent him to de-gnome the garden.

She had Flooed over Arabella Fig's house and shared a nice cuppa with the old girl. The pair had talked and as she was about to make her way Arabella asked her, "Why did you pop over Molly? I know it's been a pleasure, but is there business?"

Oh how she had laughed and joked, "My boys are worried about their friend Harry over at number 4, I'm just doing a welfare check." Immediately Old Miss Figg looked alarmed. She told Molly to not let the Dursley's see her and taking her over to point at the house.

It took Molly a second to realize what was wrong with the house. A nice car, a well maintained garden bed, freshly painted siding, and then she saw the bars on the second floor window.

"I've written my concerns to Albus, but he assures me that there is likely a good explanation, such as an animal's room or a room for valuables. But I swear that I have seen Harry and his owl in that room!"

That had put some fire in Molly. A quick disillusionment and a knock on the door by Arabella with some biscuits for the family and Molly was exploring the upstairs. She hadn't needed to investigate hard, there was one door with a n exterior bolt lock and a cat flap. Quietly she undid the lock and stepped in, tripping over the cans of weak soup. In the cage across the room there was a ball of white at the bottom of the cage before she turned and looked at the bed where-

"Mrs. Weasley?" came a voice from the present. "Mr. Potter's check-up is done. I do hope you keep him away from where ever he was staying. Dehydration was setting in and we did have to treat him for heat exhaustion. The long-term malnutrition is of a bigger concern. The head healer has a few questions they would like to ask someone...."

Molly just nodded and told them a story, putting aside her own worries.

We know the window's out front, towards the street, so people would have noticed Vernon putting them on there, and certainly the neighbourhood runs on gossip, so everyone would have known, too, but just like they came up with an excuse for why Harry wasn't in the local school (St Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys), they would have come up with a reason here.

Perhaps even playing on the same theme -- the criminal nephew needs a strict curfew, or he's gonna go out at night to rob people blind. And even for reasonable, non-Dursley people, it's not odd -- no one knows it's a bedroom, so it could be a study with a safe that needs better protection.

As for Mrs Figg -- she seems to be absolutely useless and with an intelligence of an empty kettle, so of all the proposed ways here, I'd think she's about the /last/ person to notice anything that hasn't got to do with Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty.

Usually we run that through a filter (some use ROs) and store it in bottles.

This is mostly because while we do have access to potable water, there isnt enough that we can use it for every purpose.

It might help to understand why exactly we have this system if I add that I'm from India, though.

Additionally: We call it "khaara paani" which means something like saline water. So I guess its something like drinking sea water. This kind of water is also incredibly corrosive afaik and can rust metals easily, which lends credit to the salt part

It was a very unpleasant experience, fucked me up well into adulthood even though I now have a BMI of 23 (the same as when the semi-starvation started). I go through periods of normal eating.

I felt awful, so hungry I could barely sleep or think especially late at night with no distractions. Otherwise, I lost a normal sense of hunger and had to relearn signals. Emotions were fucked up.

That said, I lived. It was cruel and abusive but not deadly over the time period. (I voluntarily moved in with grandparents). 3 cans of soup a day would keep a boy alive, it just wouldn't be an acceptsble standard of care in the context.

So while not as tall as Ron (and the Weasleys seem to be in the fag end of the bell curve for height) he wasn't exactly short

*** I was very surprised to see how this story absolutely did not click with me. Despite being based on such an appealing topic, the way this story is presented just had me scrolling through pages and pages without anything captivating my interest.

And I really can't say why that is. The quality of English is suitable, no numerous grammatical errors. The speech pattern of the children appears a bit same-ish and too mature for some but I've definitely read, and enjoyed, worse stories than this.

It's quite puzzling what element in this story is so off-putting.

**** I mean, 10 chapters in and he JUST gets to Hogwarts, so it could be some kind of pacing issue. And it was mainly 10 chapters of angst. Like the story was just spinning its wheels waiting for the plot to catch up with the prologue.

I also hated how there was no kind of delineation between the different POV shifts - by my count we saw things from the perspectives of Harry, Ron, Dudley, Percy, Fred, George, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Petunia, McGonagall and Snape. Which is just WAY too much, especially because seemingly the only thing these characters seem to think about is Harry, what's Harry doing, is he alright, I feel so guilty, that Freak with his Freakishness etc., etc.,. It's focused and oddly unfocused at the same time, like there's a ton of unnecessary plot points side-perspectives that could be removed easily without harming the story at all.

‚Äã

Maybe one of these is your issue?

‚Äã

Quick note, I know I make it sound like I hated this fic or something but that's not the case either, I think it did some interesting things with the various characters. Like I really enjoyed Dudley's character arc - starting with the fact that he /had/ a character arc at all. It was realistically done, from his backstory of starting out at Smeltings to his friendship with the owl. It was also satisfying to see various characters finding out the truth and having to rethink their preconceptions - like Snape or Percy. Ron and Hermione coming to grips with being friends with each other without Harry there to mediate between them.

And now that the story seems to have caught up with the prologue it seems to finally be headed somewhere interesting, so I'm definitely going to read the next chapter when it comes out.

Yeah, I think I can see your point about it being too focused and unfocused simultaneously. Now that you've mentioned it, it's looking at the same thing from too many POVs. We're going over already visited ground. Like those way too many flashback episodes in Lost.

And yes, the lack of distinction between POV changes is an annoyance I forgot to mention. Really hampers the skimming too when you don't realize you're in a new place right now.

****** Ya'll need to define what "it" is :P

From where I'm standing, it's half of one and half of the other: For one thing, the standard in the books is such that Harry's treatment is kinda-sorta bad, but not /bad/ bad -- hence Dumbledore wagging his finger at Petunia in HBP -- and for another, as I said, I wouldn't trust Figg to notice whether it's Wednesday or Thursday, nevermind what happens with Harry. She's utterly useless.

In sum, from what I see, Dumbledore hoped for a normal childhood, is of the opinion he actually got a hard childhood, and doesn't know the full extent of the actual childhood -- not that it'd matter either way, cuz as long as Harry turned up alive, his plan worked. That's the only bar the Dursleys had to clear.

But leaving aside out-of-book reasoning, she is presented as /so/ dim that I could actually buy her not noticing anything. Which makes her useless for keeping an eye on Harry, of course, but that's just stating what factually happens in the books, so it's not wrong.
