** Is this a specific fic you're looking for or is it a request for recommendations?

**** No it's just the flairing. "Recommendation" is when you recommend, "Fic Search" is when you're looking for one specific fic (usually one that you heard about or read some time before but don't remember the title, only events or part of the plot) and "Request" when you're looking for one or more fics that fit your criteria. Like here.

So that's why you were asked if you were looking for a specific fic.
