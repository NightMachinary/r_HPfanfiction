Hi, So I was reading 'Pranking the Tournament' and 'Of a linear Circle' recently and in both of them Harry adopts people, in the first he adopts luna as a little sister and in the second he is adopted as a little brother and later adopts children.

So here I am asking for fanfics where Harry or fem Harry adopts people.

Thanks for your help!


** Well, the adoption of Teddy is completely canonical, isn't it?

Also, “Dudley's Memories” by Paganaidd linkao3(601542) and its sequel.

Harry also semi-adopts Holly (a magical Dudley's daughter) in the “Holly at Hogwarts” series (starting with linkao3(1048010)). Not really, because although the relationship is sometime tense, her parents are generally doing The Right Thing™ (sometime with disastrous results, true).

I think Violet Malfoy is adopted in “Hogwarts Houses Divided” by Inverarity linkffn(3979062), but I don't remember the story that well.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Oh boy, sorry if there is a lot of Tom and Harry one (all platonic dw)

1. linkao3(26090572) I'm usually a bit cautious w fem Harry ff but this is such a good one. I love the relationship that Harry and regulus is starting to develop in this one

2. linkao3(14033559) Voldemort got turned into a baby in the battle of hogwarts and got adopted by Harry. This is the first part of a series. The second one is the opposite where Harry got turned into a baby and Voldemort adopted him, but I don't rlly like it as much

3. linkao3(10547350) Angst. Just angst

4. linkao3(19050562) not rlly adopt but Harry is Voldemort bio parent. I just couldn't resist recommending this one

  Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.

  Return to the start. Do not pass Go. Do not collect 200 dollars. Harry and pals' ultimate spell goes awry, and Voldemort is reverted to a baby, brain and all. Everyone deserves a second chance, and this time, Harry's making sure Voldemort gets it.

  Voldemort remembered his killing curse backfiring and shooting the Potter boy one last utterly betrayed look before he... awoke. In a small dark space.And if Voldemort was right and this was indeed pregnancy... he didn't know how he'd suffer another 9 months of this.(AKA, Voldemort finds out what exactly it's like to have a person love him, and finds himself perhaps returning the sentiment.)
