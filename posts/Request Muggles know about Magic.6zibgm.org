Any stories where Muggles somehow find out about magic and there's some kind of backlash/war/fight?

Or anything interesting that goes on because the Muggles know about magic.

Any rating is fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly]], linkffn(11913447): The war with Voldemort spilled over into the Muggle world, and at great cost to themselves, the Muggles destroyed the Magical world, forcing a desperate Harry to attempt a time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): Harry actively enlisted help from the UK government in his war against Voldemort and Goblins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): At the end of the first war, the PM of UK was disgusted about what went on in Magical Britain, and she initiated a top secret program to infiltrate and enlist support from Magicals. Their first target: Harry Potter. This fic is the first installment of a series, and ended with [[/spoiler][a disorderly collapse of the SoS and the Ministry declaring its allegiance to Voldemort]]. The next story in the story will be called "Nymphodora Tonks, the Last Auror".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Hermione's revolution and systematic liquidation of Magical Britain's pureblood establishment enraged other European pureblood regimes. To even the odds, she used a loophole to enlist large number of Muggle special force soldiers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): The UK government paid more attention to what went on in the Magical world, and they intervened in several decisive events. Chapter 5 and 6 are a lot fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): The Muggles had enough of Magicals hurting them with impunity, so after decades of top secret preparations, they surprised and killed off most Magicals. Harry led only one thousand wizards and witches left to a new planet. This story held lots of promise, and the author had some really great ideas, but suffered from poor execution.

--------------

FInally, there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), where the SoS collapsed in 2009 and chaos broke out all over the world. Harry used this opportunity to make his bid for power. Voldemort abandoned his Death Eaters, adopted the identity of 'Mentor', and established a much larger power base in Germany.

** I really liked NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series. It's 7 different fics about his Hogwarts years, and it introduces a lot of concepts and storylines i haven't seen done anywhere else. (mild spoilers) In the end of the first book the SoS is removed. If you can get past that part, which is mainly setting up plot points(it's also the shortest) the rest is pretty dang good. linkffn(8417562)

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

**** I recommend it too although, sadly, it isn't really focused on the muggles finding out about wizards. It's the main one in the first book but after that it's not that prominent, IMO. The overall plot is absolutely amazing though and I'd give it a shot.

** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HogwartsExposedTimeline]] A work by one acgoldis of AlternateHistory.com, not to be confused with another fanfic by the name of Hogwarts Exposed. Can be found here if you're a member of said site. It focuses on what happens when Harry Potter is seen by a Muggle camera flying by on a broomstick, which starts off a chain of events leading to his his secret wizarding world getting exposed. Stuff happens.
