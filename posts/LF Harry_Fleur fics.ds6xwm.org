Hi all, it's me looking for fics again! This time I'm delving into 'Arry/Fleur. I've checked what usually gets recommended in here and read linkffn(a cadmean victory) already but stopped halfway through. Couldn't get into it, even if it's considered one of the best H/F fics. Idk, the 'ancestor-portrait and timeturner make Harry badass'-thing turned me off quite a bit. I did enjoy linkffn(letters) though.

What I am generally looking for are fics with:

• Little to no bashing • Harry does not 'steal' Fleur from Bill (made me stop reading like 2 or 3 fics) • no love triangle, cheating, harem, etc

I'm open to recently started promising fics too. Originality and creativity is more than welcome. Thanks in advance.


** Not to put too fine a point on it, but not many people consider A Cadmean Victory "one of the best" H/F fics. Sure, it is recced in every request thread simply because it is well known, but with the uncountable amount of overdone tropes that fic uses, the H/F part of it is very much insignificant and not a big part of the story.

Anyways, as I'm sure the usual H/F fics will get recced soon enough, here are just two I like:

linkffn(13132670) Very sweet post-war story. The only bad thing I can come up is that it updates so slowly. But it was updated just yesterday.

linkffn(8848598) One-shot with an interesting premise.

  but not many people consider A Cadmean Victory "one of the best" H/F fics. Yeah, it just seemed that way in most of the H/F posts. As I said, I couldn't go past the halfway point because of the tropes. Not gonna lie, in hindsight, I was surprised to see it recommended as many times as it is.
#+end_quote

Anyways, thank you for your recs!

**** I couldn't read past a few chapters myself - it just seemed so out of character, and taking the Fleur chapters seriously would have made me hate that interpretation of the character and world.

It's probably more telling of the dearth of good H/F fics that it's recommended, but it's also long, completed, and includes a powerful Harry - that will get some readers.

** I don't know how this fic doesn't get mentioned more often in the weekly H/F threads, but linkffn(11534019) is probably the baseline/standard for good H/F fics. It doesn't really try to do anything innovative or special. Instead, it's just a solid romance (and story in general) taking place in GoF that avoids a lot of the common cliches. I think it's a good entry point to the ship.

** linkffn(12792189)

This is a very solid H/F. It's not purely a H/F romance fic, but that's obviously where it's heading and it does a lot of relationship building outside of it.

It's an all together well-written story imo. It does a good take on a HBP canon compliant rewrite before diverging and turning into something much bigger. The story seems to be just about heading into it's final, climactic, arc too so I'm excited to see where it goes.

** I gotta ask; have you looked through previous request threads? Requests for Harry/Fleur come in very frequently it seems.

I'm a fan of the pairing myself and I don't think that any particularly notable new ones have been started recently, though I'd be happy to be wrong.

*** Yeah, that's how I found Cadmean Victory and Letters. I even looked through that one post that has this huge list of H/F fics. I figured I'd ask if there's something new or different which doesn't usually get recommended.
