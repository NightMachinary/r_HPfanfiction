** That would be Cassandra Claire's /Draco Trilogy/. It's no longer online, since she published original works, but I have a copy saved. If you'd like it, PM me with your email address and whether you'd like it as a pdf, mobi, epub, doc, rtf, or some other file type.

*** Why would she remove the fic just for that?

**** I think it's a legal thing, that her editors or agent or whatever might have said she had to, especially as her published books are under the exact same name (except she took the i out of Claire). Or I might be wrong, I'm not totally sure; it could have just be her decision, but going pro was her reason for taking all her fics down.
