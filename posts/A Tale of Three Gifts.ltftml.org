I'd like to see a fanfic where a Harry Potter character meets a tinker, an old woman, or a beggar along the following lines.

 Everyone knows that if you meet one of the road's chosen to treat them fairly, treat them well, and, if you strike a fair deal for what they offer, you'll do well. Just as well that everyone knows that if you treat them poorly, turn them out, or try to cheat them, you'll come to regret it.

In essence, Harry (or another character, have fun with it) meets one of these characters, treats them politely, and either trades for (in typical tale-telling terms) or is gifted three items. I leave you to determine what they are, but the more mundane they seem the better. Pick any year you want, but use the three items to solve problems, whether Horcruxes, yearly plots, or a severe lack of a way to slice a loaf of bread.


** Harry meets her when he is five, and gives her some pocket change and an old book, one he was brought to the Dursley's with and has a strange name and even stranger stories: The Tales of Beedle the Bard.

​

1) A watch that always tells the current moon phase, its hands made of pure silver.

​

2) A ring made of pure silver, with a strange spiked gem inset. Later, he finds it acts like a Goblin forged weapon, and absorbs the powers of his defeated foes.

​

3) An ever refilling box of cat treats. Potter makes friends with Mrs. Norris, and shenanigans ensue.
