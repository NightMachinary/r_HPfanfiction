So in ~1k words, write a different first task that still uses the dragons.

Ideas:

- incapacitate the thing
- making an Atlanean Omelette
- extreme ironing
- dragon racing, but the dragons also want their riders dead
- arm wrestling

Can't wait to see what you guys do!

EDIT: Changed wording


** I propose that the first and second tasks be combined. After all, are dragons not known for kidnapping princesses and locking them in towers?

The task: evade the dragon, scale the tower, free the “one you'd sorely miss” within, and escape together---all without getting burned to death. A donkey sidekick is optional.

** Cinnamon challenge, with a tablespoonful for the champion and a garden-spadeful for the dragon. While blinded by tears and unable to draw a breath, the champion must continue to avoid spouts of flame from a coughing and sneezing dragon.

** - heal a dragon. But dragon still attacks you.
- make dragon do some simple(or not) task, like a couple of dog tricks
- play tag with one
- or hide-and-seek
