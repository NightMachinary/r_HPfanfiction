Fanfiction is home to many different Harry's. Canon compliant Harry, Dark Harry, Smart & Intelligent Harry, Womanizer flirty Harry, Lord Slytherin Ravenclaw Hufflepuff Gryffindor Uchiha Goku Merlin Potter Because-I'm-Batman- Black Harry. They come in all different shapes and sizes, what's your favorite kind of Harry characterization?


** Harry who is a funny asshole. A bit selfish and kind of a jerk. Think nonjon's Black Comedy and such.

*** Harry being fairly sarcastic is pretty inline with canon. Nowhere near the same level as a Black Comedy though.

** I really like the "don't really care Harry Potter" characterisation that you see in thief!Harry stories or the fic 'now you see me'.

Although I would really like to see a happy-go-lucky and larger than life Harry Potter. For example: Harry has just discovered the wizarding world and he now has a place to get away from his relatives. Nothing can get his spirits down and he is absolutely ecstatic about learning magic. A Harry that actually embraces the wizarding world, but not in the way that he finds out that he is heir to everything but rather a more fun Harry that explores magic.

*** That sounds so so amazing. Such a shame that I don't know of even one fic with such characterisation.

***** I'd like to read that kind of fanfic if there isn't a Ravenclaw!Harry included. I want him to be Gryffindor's smart kid who comes up as smart because he actually likes studying magic. And without fights with Hermione (don't like her, but there are many fics with them fighting over grades).

** Funny asshole Harry seconded. I feel like even writers who try to write canon Harry don't get this aspect across quite enough. When he was in first year, though, he was very naive and unconfident in the beginning. That makes me love him even more. He only grew into his funny stuff once he had strong social support, aside from his brave jabs at the Dursleys.

Smartypants Harry is annoying because I just remember him slacking off with Ron. If Harry is studious, he needs a compelling reason. Womanizer Harry will make me close a fic. I just find it tiresome for some reason. I guess I just don't read much het.

** I like a Dark Harry, who disdains romance, and is somewhat self destructive as and is reasonably competent, but still fails because his problems are complex and not easily solved.

** I like when his personality is an exaggerated form of what it was in the books. I've always felt he was lacking in terms of characterization, especially compared to most other characters that had a lot of depth. So I like him being made a larger than life character or in other words, a hyperbole of himself. I like when people acknowledge Harry's flaws, his emotional volatility, his bad decision making, his single-mindedness, his messiah complex.

Something I absolutely hate is when people dehumanize him for wish fulfillment. I like real characters with real flaws, and omnipotent, omniscient Harry is anathema. Also dark, torture-porn Harry is about as far from canon as you can get.

** I enjoy reading about insane but magically competent Harry, such as in linkffn(Worthy of Magic) .
