** Why, though? Idk if you're just trying to flex that you know how Latin nouns decline, but that's not how those words are pluralised in the books.

*** I don't know or care how Latin nouns decline. My mental rule for English noun plurals is that all words that end in _us always pluralize as _i or _ii and words that end in _x always pluralize as _ces. May have an origin in Latin, I don't know. Was just reading a fic where "patronuses" got cast and it irked me.

**** They don't, though. Off the top of my head: box (pl. boxes), annex (annexes), fax (faxes), virus (viruses), bus (buses). And even if /all/ words did that, horcrux isn't a real word, JKR invented it. And in the books, horcruxes is the plural of horcrux
