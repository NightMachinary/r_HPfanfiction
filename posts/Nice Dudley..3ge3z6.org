I'm floating this idea of Dudley disagreeing with his parent's treatment of Harry but beings unable to openly oppose them. So he helps Harry subtly, sneaking him food and such, maybe eventually growing in to a protective big brother role.

Anything around like that?

Thanks.

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept)

It's also a Severitus challenge fanfic which ... doesn't happen for quite a long time but it does eventually happen. I actually really dislike that bit of the fanfic and think it would be better without it, but there you go.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
