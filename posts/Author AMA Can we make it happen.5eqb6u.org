** This is an awesome idea! I think we should try to group authors who write about similar topics together... The questions we might ask the author of HPMoR (for example) may be different than the ones we would ask the author of Grow Young With Me, because they are fics with completely different focuses and purposes. And I wouldn't want some of the authors to feel like they can't answer half the questions because it doesn't apply. Unless I'm overthinking it.

*** That's an excellent point. Hopefully if enough writers agree we could make this happen.

** We may have a list of authors to start with:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/authors]]

(seriously, anyone who is an author and not listed... come on!)

** I'm a writer but given like maybe 10 people have read my stories I'm not sure any AMA of mine would be a big draw.

For starter questions I think the most basic universal one is 'what motivated you to write about x?'

** I know a few people in the Reddit read my fanfic, The Serpent's Gaze, so I'd be cool doing an AMA if people were up for my being involved.

Obviously I'd love to see like, [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] and [[/u/Taure]] doing the thing. ;)

*** Unfortunately [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] isn't open for a group AMA. But we do have you and [[/u/FloreatCastellum][u/FloreatCastellum]] on board, so that's awesome.

Edit: [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] is on board as well.

*** I think [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] would be an excellent choice, but I think we should limit the AMAs to authors who complete at least half the fics they start.

Then I don't understand what the purpose of the AMA would be. Shouldn't we be asking experienced, successful authors questions of how they design and execute their fanfics from start to finish? Floreat has completed almost every story she's started. The other author you mentioned hasn't finished one since 2009. The fandom is awash in abandoned stories. Let's give our attention to the ones who see their fics through to the end.

Encouraging new authors is and should always be a vitally important part of this subreddit. I'm just not certain that an AMA would be the best way to go about that.

** I'd be happy to do it too, especially as my fic, The Betrothal Situation, has gained 100K views!
