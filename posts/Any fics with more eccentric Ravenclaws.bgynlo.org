After retaking the Pottermore quiz and getting placed in Ravenclaw I've been craving some more eccentric 'Claws. Most of the time they seem to be just super studious and basically Hermione clones and ultimately boring. I don't mean the Luna kind of quirkiness but rather Ravenclaws that are focused on particular areas of magic or on certain creatures or objects than their marks.

â€‹

I just feel like if I was at Hogwarts, especially as a muggleborn, I'd be obsessed with learning everything I could, I can totally see my marks slipping because I was reading about how floo powder is made or something random like that. Sorry if this post got a bit rambling, it's probably too early to be coherent.


** I read something like that recently... Harry was a Slytherin, I think, and the mood was pretty light.. let's see if I can remember!

Edit: I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem to come to me. The Ravenclaws had more or less mediocre marks because they always got lost in their independent research, sometimes they would spend days sequestered in their tower. They lost quite some points because they didn't turn homework in on time because of getting sidetracked. Cannot remember anything specific about the doc though, only that Harry and his friends had a lot of house unity going on.

*** Was it linkffn(magical relations by evansentranced)? Harry's ravenclaw friend definitely has some interesting independent studies! And the tone is light and fun.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** That would be great, I shouldn't have focused on Ravenclaw so much, really I'm looking for eccentricity in general and Ravenclaw seemed like the obvious place to find it.

*** Bummer that sounds pretty much perfect. Thanks anyway, I'll try finding it and maybe someone else has read it. Do you remember what site it was on?

There's no specific character, though, just Ravenclaw as a whole.

**** Might be. I did read that one recently. I remember the plot but not completely sure that's the one. Could be though

** I admit the lack of wonder and interest in exploring magic the characters in canon seem to have has always bothered me, just my mindset I suppose. I've always empathized with Hermione's attitude of preferring death to being ejected from the magical world.

** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

The entire fanfic is Harry raised by a scientist exploring magic with curiosity while in Ravenclaw

Cheers!

*** Thanks for the recommendation.

I admit HPMOR and Wizard of the Kaleidoscope are in a category of fics wherein the plot and/or characters are frustrating but the magic systems in them and the exploration of them get me through it.

***** It's probably my favourite expansion of the magical world and system. And the duels in it are pretty epic.
