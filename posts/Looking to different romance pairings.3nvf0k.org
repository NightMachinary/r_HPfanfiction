I'm looking for the not so common pairings in fics. I love slash and will read non slash By uncommon pairings I mean still like Harry/flint Harry/victor...etc


** *Harry/Viktor Krum* [[http://xylodemon.livejournal.com/311522.html][Cannons at dawn]] /"Vartime is bad time for girls, and love," Viktor says quietly. "But is perfect time for this."/

*Bellatrix/Hermione* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]] /During the battle for Hogwarts, Hermione accepts to do the Unbreakable Vow with Bellatrix to protect the people she loves. But binding herself to the dark witch has more consequences than she could ever have anticipated./

*Snarry* [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548?view_adult=true][The Boy Who Died a Lot]] /Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)/

*Snape/Lily* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/2/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone][A Dream Carved in Stone]] /When an unmarried Lily Evans joins the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore gives her a simple mission: meet with the Death Eater Severus Snape and tell him what she's done. AU./

*Sirius/Harry* [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographer's Craft]] /In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks./

*Sirius/Ron* [[http://xylodemon.livejournal.com/387191.html][In the Shade of Sunlight]] /There wasn't a trial before, and why should this be any different?/

** linkffn(A Summer's day by Sa-kun) is a one-shot featuring Harry alone with Charlie in the burrow, Charlie who's known to 'turn' straight guys at least bi curious and Ron worryingly explaining to Hermione about that aforementioned two.

linkffn(Finding Mr Right by Nia Rivers) is an AU one-shot where James and Lily are alive, fem!Harry gets set up on multiple dates by Ginny, Lily and Hermione's matchmaking charts and Theodore Nott owns a perfect first date restaurant.

linkffn(A Lack of Color) is a GoF AU where Harry and Cedric hooks up.

  COMPLETE. Wherein Ginny thinks Heidi needs to get laid, Hermione make so many charts, Lily wants grandbabies, the romantic prospects sometimes verge on the horrifying, and James Potter just wants to know what's so wrong with Heidi joining a convent! Heidi never knew husband-hunting could be so perilous. (Fem!Harry/Theo, Potters-live-AU, oneshot)
