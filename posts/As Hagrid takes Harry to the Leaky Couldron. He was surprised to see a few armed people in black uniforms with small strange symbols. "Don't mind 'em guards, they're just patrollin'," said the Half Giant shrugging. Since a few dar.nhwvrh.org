Later on, when Harry goes to find the Platform 9 3/4. He notice that he's being watched. He spots a few people looking at him from afar and yet they are acting like they're not.

A man in a labcoat suddenly shows up to him and whispered the directions on where the platform is and how to enter.

"Ah thank you," said Harry awkwardly.

"You're welcome," he said and Harry notices he is talking to a small device as he disappears in the crowd.

"It's interesting that most people don't appear to notice them going through that portal..." whispered the guard.

"As you know it's been charmed for nonmagic people to never notice it," said the scientist in a bored tone.

~

After Percy talked about Professor Snape, Harry then asked.

"Who's that man in the orange jumpsuit?" asked Harry looking at the d-class personnel with the same symbol on his uniform like those guards earlier and he seems very nervous.

"That's the new muggle studies teacher the Foundation sent...he's really more of an experiment for that organization like the others in those jumpsuits," said Percy with both disapproval and pity in his tone.

** Item #: SCP-8076

Object Class: +Keter+ +Euclid+ Keter

Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-8076 is largely self-containing and much more extensive than first predicted, containment and/or neutralization is considered unfeasible at this time. Diplomatic contact with the governing bodies of SCP-8076's population, designated SCP-8076-A, is to be maintained. Locations of importance to instances of SCP-8076-A, designated SCP-8076-B, are to be monitored at all times. In the event of a breach in containment, SCP-8076-A authorities are to be notified immediately, and the closest MTF Theta-17 ("Aurors") operatives are to be deployed.

Description: SCP-8076 is the designation given to a population of anomalous energy wielders, and all anomalies related to them.

There would be some hullabaloo about muggleborn and how they differ from other natural reality benders, and eventually it would (hopefully) become Thaumiel as they forge alliances and work together to combat some more esotheric anomalies that need more than human science can achieve to contain.

**** *Threat ID*: KTE-9129 Green-Blackwood-Carcassfather "Lord Voldemort"

*Authorized Response Level*: 5 (Immediate Threat)

*Description*: Lord Voldemort is a humanoid threat entity (formerly a Type Blue british human), apparently in its late sixties, approximately 2m tall, weighing approximately 70kg. Subject normally dresses in a black robes. In addition to some standard superhuman abilities (Strength and Regeneration, at Class 1) Subject possesses the ability to use Thaumaturgy on an extremely advanced level to the point of being catalogued as a Phase 4 Type Green. Subject posses an enormous array of knowledge regarding many types of Thaumaturgy, can create thaumaturgical artifacts, Extranormal anomalies, Type Grey reanimated entities known as "Inferius", use psychic powers on it's victims and appears to be well verse on thaumaturgical combat arts.

Psychological profile indicates that Subject is primarily motivated by pride, wrath and the desire to rule above everyone else, whom it deems "inferior", the subject demostrates megalomania, sadism and extreme machiavelian as well as sociopathic and narcisitic tendencies.

KTE-9129 is the founder and current leader of group codenamed *CARCASS*, officially known as the *"Death Eaters"*. CARCASS is a Thaumaturgical terrorist organization currently devoted to taking over the magical government of the British Islands and pursue a genocidal campaign against several groups including non-thaumaturgical users. Members are parathreats themselves, and the organization is currently at war with several groups within the British islands. Response Level 4, 5 if deemed necessary.

*Rules of Engagement*: KTE-9129 Green-Blackwood-Carcassfather (hereafter referred to as Subject V) is to be engaged with extreme caution: entity is a highly lethal combatant and has caused the deaths of an unknown number of Type Blues and normal people to date. Subject V is never to be engaged at close range, but from as great a distance as possible. Headshot by sniper is the preferred method of termination. Subject V is expected to be accompanied at all times by CARCASS agents, therefore, heavy supressive meassures are to be deployed following the strike on Subject V.

Upon termination, Subject V will continue to exist as an Type Beige-Goodrick (Wraith) entity, returning to full threat efficacy if allowed to perform an unknown ritual by it's Death Eaters using Kapala type Thaumaturgical artifacts (classified as *KTE-9130 Green-Kapala*) known as *"Horcruxes"*. For this reason, locating and destroying each and every KTE-9130 Green-Kapala artifact is necessary for complete liquidation of Subject V. Operatives who have information leading to the discovery of the location of KTE-9130 Green-Kapala are to immediately report said information to GOC High Command.

#+begin_quote
  The SCP Foundation[note 3] is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs). The real-world website is community-based and includes elements of many genres such as horror, science fiction, and urban fantasy.

  On the SCP Foundation wiki, the majority of works consist of "special containment procedures", structured internal documentation that describes an SCP object and the means of keeping it contained. The website also contains thousands of "Foundation Tales", short stories that take place within the SCP Foundation setting. The series has been praised for its ability to convey horror through its scientific and academic writing style, as well as for its high standards of quality.

  The Foundation has inspired numerous spin-off works, including the horror indie video games SCP -- Containment Breach and SCP: Secret Laboratory.

*** A multiverse in the top five worst places to live, in all of fiction.

The creepy pasta version of Warehouse 13; in which there are dozens upon dozens of fates worse than death; from old gods aiming to destroy all of existence, though a literal Vore Hole, to a world where nobody can die no matter how much their bodies break down. Though if you want just death, there are also pictures that kill you to look at them.

Example: [[https://imgur.com/gallery/zUitJGI]]

There's a bit of good, too; but it's almost always with a catch. A book that lets you live a wonderful fantasy life in your dreams, but may sour you to reality. Pills that can cure any ill, but not an unlimited number of them. An unlimited role of toilet paper that may occasionally, randomly explode with the force of a large nuke. And so on.

*** If you've ever seen the TV show Warehouse 13, picture that as a horror/creepy pasta.

Now picture that spanning multiple timelines and dimensions; with threats that would fit in fine in Warhammer 40k.

***** The SCP Foundation fandom is in the top five worst fictions to live in. It contains hundreds upon hundreds of fates worse than death, and plenty of easy ways to die, aswell. (Warhammer 40k is the #1 slot, worst place to live in all of fiction; atleast as a baseline human.)

It's mostly based around the “SCP Foundation”, a sort of secret illuminati-like organization that catalogs effects and items. Ranging from a teddy bear that will nit stuffed organs for people that have defective ones; through a phone number you can call to order human slaves; to a universe filled with demonic monsters the size of planets, that eat all of the stars except our sun and two others, held at bay by magic runes.

The SCP Foundation calls these anomalies “SCP's”, and their main aim is to hide the existence of them from the every day man, and maintain normalcy.

The fandom is comprised of thousands of short stories, most in a report format, with no real rhyme or reason connecting most of them, and no real coherent canon. Multiple timelines, multiple dimensions, and threats big and small. It's /rare/ to see an SCP that /isn't/ somehow horrible, or creepy in the least, but there are a few out there like that. I'd estimate less than fifty that are actively good, with no down sides.

Here's a link to the forum: [[http://www.scpwiki.com/]]

Here's a youtube video introduction to the fandom: [[https://youtu.be/R9hv6NsWndM]]

And here's a youtube video read through of one of the more recent, big important story arcs, in which everthing is turned on it's head: [[https://youtu.be/dramCTIPxKg]]

*** It's a fictional secret organization that contains anomalies. SCP stands for secure, contain, and protect. There's a website with various anomalies each with a different number.

*** Here's the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation][Wikipedia article]] on it, and here's the [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/][site itself]].

​

It's a massive collaborative fiction thing where people detail the actions of The SCP Foundation, a fictional organization dedicated to protecting "normalcy" by hiding all anomalies - things that break from the normal laws of reality - from the public eye. Due to its collaborative nature and huge size, there is no one consistent canon, though there are elements common in many of the stories. A large part of the content is a part of the horror genre, but not all of it is.

​

The site itself can mainly be broken down into two types of pages - "Special Containment Procedures" (SCP) files, which each detail one anomaly and how it is contained, and "Tales", which are basically short stories set in the universe.

​

Aside from the site, there are a number of fangames (like SCP: Containment Breach and SCP: Secret Laboratory) and there are numerous related youtube channels (I'd definitely recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVolgun][The Volgun]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZj3q_2pHasvlILdU1huHA][SCP Illustrated]] for individual SCPs/tales, and [[https://www.youtube.com/c/LordBung/videos][Lord Bung]] for his original animated series "Confinement").

​

If you decide you want to try to read some of the stuff on the wiki itself, I'd recommend finding a thread on [[/r/SCP][r/SCP]] with recommendations for beginners. There's a lot to take in, and just reading up from 001 isn't a great idea.

***** But still idea of either SCP or GOC or any other organization from SCP-verse simply stumbling upon wizards is ridiculous. The very nature of all of those organizations and GOC's and SCP's definition of baseline normal would be very different from what you see in vanilla SCP-verse. GOC and ICW would be one and the same organization, while SCP would be it more muggle science favoring counter-part. And that is putting aside all other players on anomalous field. Voldemort can't hold a candle in terms of danger to some random douchebag from AWCY? who compensates lack of artistic abilities with murderous anomality.
