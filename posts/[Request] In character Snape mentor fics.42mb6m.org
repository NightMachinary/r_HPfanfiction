I'm looking for fics where Snape trains or mentors Harry. I've tried several, but so many are too far out of character for me (if Snape becomes all kind and comforting 2 chapters in, it's not in character). I like Snape a lot--but I love his snark and grumpiness and I don't like when fics cut that.

The best I've found was The Best Revenge. Something similar to that would be good.


** linkffn(8615605) has perhaps the best characterized Snape I've ever seen.

I hate the idea of a female Harry, I hate the idea of a Snape/Harry pairing. I started reading the story out a morbid curiosity of how bad it was going to be. The author has written the story so well and the characters are so believable that I'm still reading the story and even recommending it.

It also has one of the best characterizations of Dumbledore I've seen. He's a good man who can be manipulative if he has to be. Every character in the story is complex, in character, and believable, including Snape as a snarky asshole. Give it a shot even if you think you'll hate it. It's worth reading.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet.

** In character Snape "mentoring" would be his attempt at teaching Harry occlumency.

If Snape isn't wildly OOC, that's exactly what's going to happen.

*** I think what a lot of people forget is that canon Snape is NOT a good teacher. He has no business being in a school. Snape is a good potioneer or occlumens but that's different than being good at teaching it.

He's likely even aware of that himself. He's there because he has to be, not because he wants to be, and the students suffer for it.

*** All fanfiction has small twists to it. I actually disagree with Snape being a terrible teacher--I had a teacher somewhat similar to him (snarky, sarcastic, caustic, could be quite harsh with students). Took me forever to get used to him, but when I did, I learned a ton and he was my favorite teacher. I think sometimes Harry takes things too personally and he goes into Occlumency determined to hate Snape and refuses to try. Snape for his part only sees Harry's arrogance (sometimes real, sometimes perceived) and disrespect and can't see past that. And yes, other times he's just an ass for no reason.

I actually think that small changes to Harry's or Snape's situations or behavior could lead them to a but of an understanding.

** linkffn(6500900)

One of my all time favorite series. It's mostly canon compliant, but ends up with Severus in a mentor/parental relationship for Severus and Harry, without losing all of Snape's character. He's never going to be warm and cuddly and affectionate, but a reserved sort of deep caring is more realistic to me.

The author also has several sequels.
