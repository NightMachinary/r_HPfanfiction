****** If you havent read it yet Im going to do it and see if I can finish it. Ill report back with my findings

Edit: Haven't finished it yet but the first chapter is really good. Harry seems more studious, quiet, and observing of people. That's all I'll say.

Edit 2: Completely done now. I think this might be one of my favorite stories. Harry is basically super interested in adventuring the world. Lots of rune stuff. It ended a little abruptly but I would 100% recommend it to anyone. 9/10. Would be 10/10 if it were longer.

******* I've not finished it yet, but I feel like 9/10 is being generous. It feels fairly tropey, with a moderately sueish HP and some questionable plot choices, namely the forced [[#s][spoiler]], and the pacing is kinda weird.

All that said, it /is/ an enjoyable fic. Solid dialogue, fun characters, mostly reasonable explanations for why Wizarding Britain seems to be collectively braindead and reasonable attempts to fix it. I give it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. I'd rank it higher except the pacing makes it hard for me to really get into the fic.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off.
