:END:
I don't remember a lot about this fic except that it's longer and Kate Middleton is a werewolf, at some point she meets William and the British Royal Family goes into hiding

This doesn't happen until later in the fic. She's an interesting but very much side character

They go into hiding as part of a coup, Kate gets involved in the main story because the main characters are trying to court the werewolf packs This fic is at least 2 years old I think maybe even 5


** interesting! would not expect that in a fic! (then again, this fandom writes many things)

*** I'm following one where Sirius Black is dating Princess Di, after her separation. At least I think it's Princess Di. It's been a bit since I've read it.
