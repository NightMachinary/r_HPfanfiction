Looking for any fics about the kids of the golden trio! I don't think there's a whole lot out there, but what are your favorites?

Can be any main character, any pairing.


** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] series, starting with linkao3(7737991) - Albus/Scorpius, /Cursed Child/-compliant

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** The best next gen series you will ever read is easily [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation]]

It is completely planned, with all 7 books written and finished. Everything ties in and nothing is trivial- it honestly competes with the original books- 100000% recommend. The plot is incredible and the ideas it has are just amazing. And the author is still working on the universe with prequels and sequels to the 7 book series. Definitely definitely read.
