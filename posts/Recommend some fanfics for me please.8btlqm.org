I've looked a little bit on my own for some good HP fics but so many have the same old tropes/cliches and bashing which I dislike so I'm reaching out to the fandom for some recommendations. Here's what I'm looking for:

Sites I read on:

Fanfiction.net

archiveofourown.org

But feel free to suggest other sites for me to try

Pairings I like:

Harry/Ginny

Harry/Hermione

Hermione/Percy

Hermione/Neville

Ron/Luna

I'm also fine with Stories that have no pairings at all

Please no slash pairings

Pairings I dislike:

Ron/Hermione (though I can tolerate in small doses)

Draco/Hermione

Snape/Hermione

Voldemort/anyone

No Bashing please:

Not of the Weasleys or Dumbledore or Hermione (though Snape and Draco bashing I am ok with if not extreme)

Ratings I'm comfortable with:

Anything that isn't M or a smut filled T

I'm okay with kissing and stuff but anything more than that or sexual content just doesn't work for me

Cliches I can't stand:

Soulbond

Marriage Law

Goblin fics

Other: Preferably taking place before years 5-7

I'm okay with canon or au

Please not a pure romance fic I'd like an actual plot with like adventures or something

Thank you!


** What genres? For such a broad request, I think first go through the sidebar recommended lists, there are a ton of amazing fics there.
