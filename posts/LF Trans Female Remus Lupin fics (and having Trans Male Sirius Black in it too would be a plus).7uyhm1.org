*** Didn't realize this sub was okay with this stupid shit. I'd have figured, with some of your guys' preferences in pairings and smut, and how you all go on about how you're so accepting of others preferences, that you wouldn't be assholes.

  â€œWe thought you might be a werewolf," said Sirius."What?" Remus almost laughed at the absurdity."Last year. James and I thought --- but the dates didn't quite match up. With the full moons, I mean.""Well, I'm not.""I know. All I meant was, we thought you might be, and we still wanted to be friends. Whatever you're not telling us --- how much worse can it be?"

  One of Remus Lupin's three jobs happens to be working maintenance for their flat building. He gets to meet all sorts, most of whom he would rather have nothing to do with. Until James Potter and Sirius Black move in across the hall. Engineering students and self-proclaimed geniuses, the pair set out to make their neighbours new best friends, and everyone's life is turned upside down, but in the best way possible.
