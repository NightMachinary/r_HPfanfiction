As in, someone tries to get them to break up but they resist it. It's a really common sub genre in Percy Jackson fanfiction so I'm curious if there's any HP ones.


** There's "Lord Hermione", in which she only befriends Harry before the Yule Ball and is way more assertive than in canon. Ron tries to break them up because he's scared shitless of Hermione and worried for Harry.

It updated yesterday and I'd love to link it but I can't get on FFN.
