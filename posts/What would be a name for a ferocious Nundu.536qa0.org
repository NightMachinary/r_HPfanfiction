** Fernundu? For the Sweet [[http://youtu.be/dQsjAbZDx-4][ABBA reference possibilities.]]

Bad Poosay... for the Game of Thrones.

Or Peepsie, for me, after my my adopted(with the name) bastard of a cat who has taken years of coaxing to let me pet him without fear of mauling, but only ever on his terms. He takes ferocious naps, ferocious craps, and more recently has taken to ferocious head rubbins' while sitting on my stomach regally, his dominance utterly established. He is afraid of thunderstorms and delivery people however. Also crinkly sounding things, and diesel engines outside. And sneezing.

But he isn't afraid to ferociously bite your fucking hand that's for sure. His breath is fine though, so you might stick with ABBA.

There was something in the air that night

The stars were bright, Fernundu

They were shining there for you and me

For liberty, Fernundu...

*Edit for link, Fernundu

***** No, it's actually my mistake. Exploited has Mr. Tibbles the Destroyer.

Still, go read it. Linkffn (Harry Potter: The Video Game, Exploited)
