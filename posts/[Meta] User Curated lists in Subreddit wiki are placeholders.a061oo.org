[[https://imgur.com/a/YE82vvn][As this screencap shows]] the links to User Curated lists in the wiki are placeholders. As someone new to the fanfic, I would greatly appreciate it if this was updated so I can find more fics. Thank you!


** [[/u/the-phony-pony]], who is currently in charge or redesigning the wiki hasn't really had the opportunity to get around to it yet.

However, on the bottom of the wiki page there should be a link to the old wiki that contains links to all of the lists you're mentioning.

*** Thanks Micro!

[[/u/shpeez][u/shpeez]], he's got the right of it. The wiki is an ever-growing, ever-changing WIP that I poke at (sometimes very slowly). Think of it as slow-roasting over an open fire so that all the meat gets properly cooked! If you ever catch anything that needs to be fixed, just PM me!
