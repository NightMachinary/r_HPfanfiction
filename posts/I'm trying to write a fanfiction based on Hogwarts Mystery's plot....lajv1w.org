  Who is in the same house as Jacob's sibling? As far as I know, it's Jacob, Rowan Khanna, who is their best friend, and Skye Parkin, who loses its spot in the quidditch team, and apparently Jacob's sibling replaces her. Is there anyone else? Are any of those incorrect?
#+end_quote

Not only Skye, but two other "Quidditch characters:" Orion Amari and Murphy McNully.

#+begin_quote
  What house and gender do you think fits best the characters? It seems like Badeea Ali takes a while to acknowledge Jacob's sibling, so them being a Ravenclaw girl wouldn't be very realistic. I know the Quidditch Cup might give an indication of how to agree with canon, but JK herself messed with canon in this part, so I was planning on choosing who wins the cup every year by myself.

  Apart from that, can you think of another detail that strongly indicates which house and gender Jacob's sibling is or isn't?
#+end_quote

I think the game does a decent job of making all of the options equally viable.

Ravenclaw makes sense because Rowan fits best as a Ravenclaw. Slytherin makes sense because of all the cup-winning. Hufflepuff makes sense because of Penny's prominence, especially in the Quidditch story. Gryffindor makes sense because the main character goes to Potions with Slytherins and Herbology with Hufflepuffs just like Harry does.

Many of the same-age characters who show up later make it seem like the main character couldn't have been in that house. It's not just Badeea, who you mentioned. A Gryffindor main character doesn't know what house Jae is in in fifth year? A Slytherin main character doesn't know who Liz is by fifth year? A Hufflepuff doesn't know about Diego and his dueling obsession until fifth year? And don't forget that a Gryffindor boy gets to be prefect even though Charlie is also a Gryffindor boy prefect.

I think the Merula subplot plays better if Jacob's Sibling is male, but that Rowan makes more sense as a female, and that Barnaby's friendship-dynamic with Jacob's Sibling makes more sense if Jacob's Sib is female.

And there are probably people who would argue all of these points with me. I think you are 100% safe choosing the house and gender you think fits your story best.

(I see Jacob's sib as a Gryffindor girl. Partially because we don't meet any Gryffindor girls for the first five years... so maybe it's the main character who fills that slot? And of course Jacob's Sib has that Gryffindor reckless bravery. But if I were writing, I think I'd write Jacob and Sibling as Hufflepuffs. Because Hufflepuffs raising that much hell amuses me.)

*** Thank you! I have been reading more about the story and writing down the ways I can think of merging it to my own plot. I thought this would be easier, but it's a whole lot of work lol still, it's entertaining and makes me want to play the game.

Now that you mentioned, it made me realise that there will be big inaccuracies no matter the house and gender I choose. As you said, all options have to be equally viable. So, I'll take your word for it and feel more comfortable choosing which house to put them in, rather than looking for clues in the game.

When I first started reading about it, I thought Rowan was a girl too until I realised her gender is undefined. Now, I'm thinking that they don't have to be the same gender, and this could even influence on the sibling's relationships with other characters.

These are good arguments. As I read about Jacob's time in Hogwarts, I thought of him as a Gryffindor, but of course his behaviour changed due to R's threats. Still, his sibling seems to have the same behaviour, as you said.

Though, I've seen people say the sibling should be a Slytherin because they spend most of the time manipulating other characters. To be honest, I have three main characters, one in each house - the only house missing so far is Slytherin, so I'm taking that in consideration.

Tonks is definitely getting in trouble in my story (and getting poor Charlie and my Ravenclaw OC in trouble as well), but I like this idea. She might as well bring her two best friends into this mess to help a fellow Hufflepuff.

Well, I have a lot of work to do, but thank you for the insight! It helped me understand this confusing this confusing game some more.

You can choose your House!

If you choose Gryffindor, you will have Bill Weasley (prefect then headboy, powerful duellist, future curse breaker, local handsome boi), Charlie Weasley (knows the Forbidden Forest like the back of his hand, he personally knows some of the Centaurs that live in it, some people think he has a crush on MC including myself but they can't make him a potential date because that would be messing with canon, it's my hc that MC dies young and charlie never marries because he'll only ever love MC), Jae Kim (a cool guy that can sneak anything whether its a rare or cursed object to Hogwarts, knows Knockturn Alley, love his relationship with MC, makes me wanna cheat on Talbott), Ben Copper (gifted at charms, bullied for being a muggleborn, afraid of everything, one of MC's first friends and is devoted to her no matter what he's accused of, he is important to the plot, i can see him having unrequited feelings for MC, id love to read a fic with MC being the only one who believes him and tries to save him when everyone thinks he's a dark wizard and dissapears after graduating), and later Percy Weasley (you can't befriend him but what's interesting is that you meet Scabbers) and the Twins (I didn't meet them yet) in your House. Your Prefect will be Angelica Cole.

If you choose Huffelpuff, you will have Penny Haywood (most popular girl in her year, knows all the gossip, supremely gifted at Potions and favored by Snape, he won't admit it but she's his fav student, i'd definitely have a crush on her if she was real), and her sister Beatrice (important to the plot), Tonks (a close friend of MC, is the reason why Filch hates his life, she could get away with her pranks if she transformed into dumbledore before getting caught by filch, but she loses braincells everytime she trips on air), Diego Caplan (supposed to be the best duellist in your year, duelling is all about the dance, the choreography for him, talks about himself in third person, probably gave himself his own nickname, one of those guys, will flirt with you too once he's done flirting with his mirror), and Chiara Lobosca (insecure shy baby, must protect, she a wolf, she knows remus and is friends with the werewolf pack in the forbidden forest), and later Cedric Diggory (I didn't meet him yet but his father talks about him like 24/7, i heard he's a big fan of MC) in your House. Your Prefect will be Jane Court (she went to Azkaban after graduating dont mess with her)

If you choose Ravenclaw, you will have Andre Egwu (best flier in your year and literally your personal fashion designer, i hc as pan), Tulip Karasu (prankster, old friend of merula, idk why but everytime she opens her mouth, it sounds like she has a crush on MC, closeted lesbian), Badeea Ali (creative and gifted, she spends all her free time painting or creating new spells, prays to Allah everyday for you) and Talbott Winger (your own personal angsty antisocial emo orphan boy, is an unregistered animagus and will assist you become one after you begg him 19282727 times, also my boyfriend), in your House. Your Prefect will be Chester Davies (resident insomniac, handsome boi)

If you choose Slytherin, you will have Merula Snyde (“The Most Powerful Witch at Hogwarts”, during the first years she will be an annoying blood supremacist b*tch but she'll become more likeable over the years when you get to know her in depth and will eventually stop with the blood supremacy, MC's self proclaimed rival, I personally hate her cuz she makes insensitive jokes about MC's brother being dead, crazy or a death eater and thinks she's funny, everytime she jokes about that all i wanna do is make fun of her parents being locked up in azkaban for being death eaters) Ismelda Murk (local angsty emo murderous psychopath mini Snape, has dreams about killing bunnies on barnaby's abs), Barnaby Lee (our favourite himbo, was abused by his death eater father, good duellist but his fav subject is COMC) and Liz Tuttle (her fav subject is COMC, loves animals, practically lives in the hippogriff clubhouse, local antisocial misanthrope,, probably vegan, probably says things like “the DOCTOR was the real monster not Frankenstein") in you House. Your Prefect will be Felix Rosier (the only prefect that actually exists in the Harry Potter Universe).

There are also a few characters that are automatically in your House such as Rowan Khanna (MC's first friend, a bigger bookworm than hermione granger, she's great at remembering things, especially useless facts, she loves studying but isn't the best at magic that's why her best subject is History of Magic where she doesn't need to cast spells, her ambition in life is to become the youngest teacher in Hogwarts history, she's supposed to be our bestfriend and yet i can't remember the last time we interracted with her, kinda got replaced by penny, i wish we got to spend more time with her before she inevitably d words in 6th year), and the Quidditch Crew :

Skye Parkin (daughter of Edward Parkin or something like that, her entire family tree is into Quidditch, they're all like crazy famous Quidditch players, she's actually the one who gets you into the team and buys you your first broom, but what I don't like about her is that she's way too competitive and brings Qudditch conflicts to real life, like she jumps on conclusions and blames Rath for literally everything, dragging MC in the dirt with her and then we have to take the blame to be a good friend, also her whole personality revolves around Quidditch),

Orion Amari (he's the Quidditch Captain of your House, high all the time, will answer your questions by other rhetorical questions, lessons about balance and inner peace is quidditch practice for him, but even if it seems like bullshit it actually works, he can do loops while broom surfing at high speeds and never lose his balance, loves deep shit, i bet he smokes weed before every match, probably excells in divination, loves giving pre match motivational speeches, he's an orphan, the quidditch team is his family, we are one is the team's motto, you'll grow to love him),

and Murphy McNully (our favourite partially impartial quidditch commentator, probably has ADHD, his legs are paralyzed, he lives with his mum, grandma and kneazle, he's quite frankly a genius, his mind works well with numbers and statistics, he's the one who comes up with strategies for the Team, he can create a strategy for any situation in a few minutes he'd make annabeth chase froth with jealousy, creating new moves/techniques for the Team is his favourite hobby, often rambles, can always diffuse the tension no matter how thick, never challenge him at chess you will get your ass handed to you, he's brutally honest but honestly so lovable, such a charismatic guy, i wish he was one of the date options, we both hate the fact that even with all his amazing qualities, he keeps being reduced to "the wizard in the wheelchair", one of my favourite characters, i wish we got to see him more and even in the main storyline)

I personally think a female character fits the story more. And it's normal that Badeea doesn't acknowledge us until 5th year. You can't be introduced to all the characters in first year can you? You need to make new friends over the years. You befriend them when it's convenient for the plot or through special quests.

#+begin_quote

It's best if the main character is in Slytherin. Because it fits canon. During her time at Hogwarts, MC always wins the Quidditch Cup. And we know that Slytherin has won the Quidditch Cup for 7 years straight before he came to Hogwarts.

Also, even if MC could fit any House, she's supposed to be in the same House her brother was in and whenever Jacob is described, he is described with Slytherin traits, he is the perfect Slytherin. He was so ambitious and determined to find the Cursed Vaults that he accidentally caused his best friend's death. He has all the traits Slytherin values. It would also explain why so many people believed that he joined the Death Eaters after running away.
