I remember reading a fic (fear the reaper challenge by palladeus) where Harry gives luna the password to gryffindor tower so she can come and sleep there if shes locked out of ravenclaw, and she ends up in Harrys (and hermiones) bed quite often naked, wich is quite hillarius as she is so innocent. Is there any other fics where luna is naughty in an innocent way towards harry? Can be smut/lemon but doesnt have to, i just love fics with an innocent luna where harry saves her from bullies, and random silly incidents occurs.


** "An Unbelievable Adventure" by StoryPlease has some of what you're looking for. Harry and Luna are on an expedition together in the jungle, and at one point she strips down to her underwear, blissfully unaware of the suggestiveness of the situation.

  Harry finds himself waking with a broken heart and a hangover. Apparently he's put an ad in the Quibbler at some point the night before. "Wanted: Diversion. Will do anything for up to a month. Serious inquiries only. Send an owl to the Quibbler Attention: Suitor 435138."
