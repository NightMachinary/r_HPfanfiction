:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Canon compliant, takes place 7th year from Neville's perspective. We see him first interested in Hannah, He becomes really close to Ernie and Susan, who get married over the Easter holiday. Susan is pregnant maybe?


** I believe this is Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness? It's been a while since I read it, but I think I remember the marriage part being one of the few bright spots in an otherwise bleak fic.

If so, just as a heads up, this is a fairly controversial fic due to the author. There's a lot of weird stuff surrounding them, maybe including starting a cult and/or maybe being responsible for a murder? I didn't follow the discussion on it very closely, so definitely look it up on your own, but be aware that it's a polarizing fic for those reasons as well as the content itself.

***** For total transparency, the article I read is [[https://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11883/the-strange-lives-of-andrew-blake/][this one, on dailydot.]] I can't say for sure how reliable a source it is, but given bgottfried91's claims, it at least enlightened me on what kind of situation was going on.

  Apparently, one of the author's roommates shot and killed two of his other roommates (one being the author's girlfriend?), and then the author murdered the shooter (presumably). That being said, The article kind of implies that all three deaths are at least partially the author's fault due to previous actions and situations. I haven't done more research than that, and frankly I don't care to. Regardless of what happened, I think less stress and worry are probably better for most people.
