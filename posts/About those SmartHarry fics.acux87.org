Book 1: Observes that Snape had a bleeding leg probably by trying to get past the Cerberus.\\
Book 2: The kid acts cunning enough to free an elf from its owner.\\
Book 5- Chapter 1: Mrs. Figg points out how Harry was well known to be smart.

​

The kid ain't a prodigy, I get that. But those Tumblr prompts about "Lolz. Harry was as observant as a brick, that he wouldn't have known if _____ actually happened" are starting to grate my nerves.

​

Trying to reread the original series, so that I understand his character for my own ff, I found the following. He's shown to think up crazy quidditch maneuvers on the fly and actually does fine with most school work. His motivation or lack thereof is explainable as being a teenager.

In fact, he and other characters only seem to act ignorant/foolish only because plot wants it so.

Edit 2: [On the other side, we have Hermione's cerebral Rival mister Magical Stephen Hawkings who suddenly understands how isolating Electricity from Magic stops all interference with stuff. Do some of the ff authors realize how it can reduce conflicts because now Harry isn't facing overwhelming odds anymore and he can go "Logic Bitch!" on all purebloods?]

So, I guess the actual Harry Potter [without some canon's forced moments of foolishness] would be somewhere in between HPMOR Harry and canon Harry. Or am I totally off the rails crazy and Harry indeed is just a goofball?

​

Edit: I'm currently trying to grind through book 5. So, I cannot yet comment on how canon!Harry became, but I do remember forest camping with barely a plan.


** As far as I know most of those "Harry is as observant as a brick" comments don't really refer to his analytical ability and more to the fact that Harry hardly ever seems to notice anything beyond his immediate surroundings. For example you can fill about two paragraphs with the stuff he notices about students who aren't the golden/silver trio, a Weasley, or Malfoy.

Of course the real reason for this has nothing to do with Harry at all and is mostly due to JKR focusing on what's important to the plot and not making the books even longer than they already are.

In the end I think it's just people frustrated that the story focuses so much Harry and his immediate friends instead of involving people in the other houses more.

*** Narrative focus is the obvious answer. For example, Harry would have had a lot of fantasies about Hermione, Katie, Alicia, Angelina, Susan, Hannah and so on.

But we don't want to read about Harry beating his meat and including any "romantic" thoughts about the background characters would just cause more confusion than it would do good. I mean, we could tell how perky Angelina is, but her tits serve no literary purpose so it's better to simply leave them out. Even if that means Harry officially didn't notice them.

***** I mean, I wouldn't mind a spin-off where people actually have sexualities, but OOTP and HBP would be absolutely bloated otherwise. Girls pulling the naked man, countless comfort offers after Cho dumps him, Romilda might actually just proposition Harry instead of the love potion plot and so on...

Which might have the side effect that Harry might completely forget about Ginny when he's balls deep in Susan Bones. Just imagine all the bad one liners about the power of love and magic wands.

** Sure, Harry's not book smart but he's occasionally observant/insightful, probably comes from having to carefully watch the moods/habits of his relatives in a defense mechanism- if they were angry he might not get fed or worse- he had at least some cunning to survive as they tried to stamp the magic out of him.

Still, the hard part is keeping it believable- and Rationality failed at that hard- though I suppose that could be explained away by magic making kids smarter but even still...

Maybe they're environmentally friendly and hate the Muggleborn reforms of plumbing in Hogwarts? Just vanishing the poop wastes less water and space, no? or They're just idiots with irrational hate on a group of people and fear destabilization of their influence.

I've read somewhere that Ministry of Magic justifies its existence because of how ignorant the general populace is towards Muggle world. If everyone gets more inclusive of muggles in general, then pure-bloods in power would lose their power? So, they might actually be making a political stand and while claiming it's a blood thing.

Though I guess its too far from the point you were trying to make.

** I think that most people forget that Harry is a child for most of the series. If you dropped Shepard and the Squad or the Master Chief into the Battle of Hogwarts, you can bet your sweet ass that the Death Eaters would have been utterly annihilated before they could even consider apparating away. Torn apart by pinpoint accurate machine gun fire, alien space magic or a shotgun to the face... you get the idea. But Harry is not a battle-hardened soldier with decades of experience in efficiently slaughtering large quantities of enemies, as fun as those thoughts are. He is a child/teenager thrust into situations which would be above most adults, and there are often no alternatives because Dumbledore is either stupid/incompetent or manipulative (you take your pick).

His biggest weakness is that he is either too trusting towards Dumbledore or too starved for adult attention and therefore follows him blindly (depending on your interpretation). He didn't even pause to consider alternate Horcrux removal strategies when he learned that he was one, Dumbledore said he had to die so he does just that. Nevermind simply asking Hermione to use the killing curse on him for a second, or Ron to stab his scar with a basilisk fang.

*** His other biggest weakness is him being too prideful as well as quick to act. He wings as he goes along, doesn't he? Case in point, illegal potion brewing and trying to sneak into other dorms in the second year. He never had a plan for that and kept thinking up excuses and reasons as he went.

This is incorrect. In his fifth year, he's barely averaging the passing grade in Transfiguration, while outright failing Potions, History, and Divination. We see this during McGonagall's career session.

From his OWL results, he barely passes Astronomy - he passes with the minimum passing grade, while failing History and Divination.

So, that's 5 subjects out of 9 or 10 that he is shown to be really struggling with. That cannot be called, "doing fine with most school work", under any standard. I'd be horrified if I was barely passing 5 subjects out of 10 in school. Your username suggests you're Indian, so maybe this might put it in perspective - imagine getting 60-70 for the 10th board exams in five subjects.

You can complain about bad teachers, or wonky subjects - but making those complaints to a future employer will only make you look like a joke.

I hate Snape just as much as the next person, but no.

Going to a job interview, and saying that, "Well, Snape was a shite teacher," would only win you mockery. Trying to offload your own poor performance in a test conducted by a third party (this being the Ministry) on excuses (because it sounds just like an excuse) like bad teaching is a very, very big red flag. The employer would only have to look at the list of his employees who got there through Snape's teaching and actually met the required marks to show how poor your candidacy really is.

We know that Tonks graduated Hogwarts when Snape was teaching, as did Bill and Percy. Tonks became an Auror and got through Snape's supposedly bad teaching or high standards, and both Bill and Percy got 12 OWLs. Percy even gets a perfect score on his NEWTs. Hermione gets an O for her Potions OWL, and she gets into the same shitty situations as much as Harry does - she doesn't study 24x7 like ff authors like to believe.

If you want to go into a bit off proper canon and say that Goblet of Fire picks the best possible student from the three respective schools, then Cedric Diggory would also have been in NEWT Potions.

Only piss poor students rely on their teachers to get them over the finish line. A good student will study and pass exams with flying colours regardless of the ability of the teachers to teach the subject.

As someone who used to get near perfect scores in History in school, this is laughable. My history teachers weren't anything special, but you don't need to teachers to learn History. All of it is self-study.

***** Oof. As for Snape, that would also be the case, if he wasn't also involved with said student in almost every capacity in a distinctly negative fashion outside of the classroom. Whether or not Harry succeeded or failed on his own merits, with those biases in mind (that could be corroborated) I'd throw it out and have him perform potions that he would need on the job. If he failed that then no, he wouldn't be qualified. Considering that Harry had be in the Auror's for a fairly long time it's to be assumed that he could indeed do the potion work required.

This isn't taking into account his status as the Figurehead of the last war. Pulling from real life, we've seen countless Athletes with no communication degrees getting into Broadcasting and succeeding. Often being better than the ones who have communication and english degrees, if only because they have experience playing said sport at the highest level imaginable and providing insight into the sport others would'nt have.

As for History. Double Oof. A lot of what we get taught in school (In America) is the wrong history so I'll leave that alone. Unless the point is about reading what they want you to read and giving them the answers they want (in the context of a school setting).

Please tell me you're joking. They're asked questions about concepts they learn from first to fifth year. The vocational system found in Hogwarts is one that supports incremental learning, meaning that a 15 year old student would find concepts learned in his earlier years a lot more relaxed and easy compared to what they currently learn, the same way a high schooler would find middle school mathematics to be simple.

Failing a couple of subjects in spite of that shows how poor Harry is as a student.

Exactly who do they do better than? They do better than Neville, and the twins. Neville is consistently shown to be at the bottom of the class in most of their subjects for the majority of their school. Doing better than someone like that is not exactly anything to be proud of. Fred and George, well, they're not people you want to test your academic performance against either.
