Every single story has all the men in a relationship completely dominated by women and it is for every single relationship including friendships. Why is there nothing where for example, Harry is on the fromt page with a photo of him battling Voldemort and instead of every female in his life chewing him out and hexing him he stands up for himself and tells them to fuck off because it is a war and he wasn't going to stand there and let Voldemort chop him down along with everyone else in the battle field. No where does any dude actually justify his actions and stand up for what they did, they always just get trampled on by a hurricane of woman who don't like what they did.

"How dare you actively participate in a war that is destroying the country and if it isn't ended will result in the death of us all. Do you have no care for your life or how I feel if something happened to you. Yoh could have been really hurt when you were protecting those people that were in the Alley when the death eaters attacked. You should have hidden with your tail between your legs and waited for them to kill everyone in the Alley, at least you would be safe."

Piss off, there is a war going on and you gitting your tits in a twist and hexing people every time I defend myself from death eaters isn't helping.

Where's the "I don't like it but it has to be done, just be careful please." Is it not possible to have an actually understanding and realistic wife/girlfriend/female friend.

The way that every girl is made out to be some stupid doll that has no real understanding for what is going to be happening in a war and that people will be hurt and in dangerous situations a lot of the time is annoying and completely ruins most female characters in a story.


** I get what you mean. And the rant is understandable but if you have cooled down then maybe edit it to be a bit calmer.

Like "Fics where people don't constantly berate others for taking part in a war that is practically unavoidable."

*** In suppose so but it does tend to be specifically female characters and that is nothing against actual females. I posted this after reading 'honour thy blood' and Daphne, Mcgonogall and Marlene all go mad at Harry, Sirius as mad Dumbledore which is completely out of character for at least Mcgonogall and for how Daphne is portrayed. I noticed it to be a very common theme and it gets annoying how it ruins good characters.

*** He's talking about Harry being a doormat and letting women walk all over him. And not in a fun, sexy way. More of an abusive relationship way. You know the thing- Harry does something good, but dangerous like saving someone's life or retrieving a kitten from a tree or helping an old lady cross the street. And immediately several women jump down his throat because he endangered his health and life. And he just stands there and takes it instead of defending himself.

*** Everybody goes mad and loses their shit at others because they take part in an unavoidable war and put themselves in dangerous situations, it gets annoying.

** I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but in this fic Hermione actively helps Harry with the war effort and understands what he must do.

*** That's why I like the H/G pairing, because if she's complaining about something dumb he did, the rant ends with some firm of "next time bring me too, you ass".
