I absolutely love harry/hermione pairings and have read all of the major ones vox corporis, unlike a sister etc. Can anyone recommend any long good fics to sink into. As title says it can have a third partner also aslong as one of the pairings is harry/hermione. Can have lemons but certainly isnt essential either. Thank you!


** This is a short one, but I've always loved it

I love this series. Hermione and Ron are preparing for their wedding but then realise neither of them can imagine a life without Harry with them.

** linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

It has a Harry/Hermione/+pairing, though that isn't a big part of the plot. (In fact, it's actually rather small, all things considered.) Fic is mostly about Harry coming into his own, throwing off the effects of a childhood with the Durselys and the machinations of the Elder Wand and its puppet, Albus Dumbledore. (Chapter 19 has my self-contained origin story for the hallows, also a good spot to see if you like my writing style.)

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
