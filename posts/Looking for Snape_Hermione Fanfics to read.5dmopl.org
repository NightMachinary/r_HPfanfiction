I was obsessed then gave it up... until I watched and read the series again. I have now been drug back in and am looking for some good stuff to read and in need of help.

I get some of you think this ship is the worst but I find it amusing and enjoy reading the fics. That does not mean I would want it in the real thing because I thought JK Rowling did the most amazing love with Severus and Lily that I have ever seen. With that, know that if you are rude, I simply won't respond and will just delete it. There is no reason for hate here.

What I'm Looking For

-Something long (50k+) and preferably completed.

-Slow burn and progress.

-I like pre war the most but will read post war if it's good

-Snape doesn't fall too far out of character. I don't want him to suddenly become this overly lovey guy.

-I very much enjoy ones without happy endings or leaves you to let you think it could have gone either way (not mandatory, I just like these the most)

-It can have fluff but I want a story, not just fluff scenes.

-I don't want them to have kids

-Not a huge fan of time turners unless you have one that will change my life. Same with marriage fics.

/BONUS/ I have been looking for a fic I read when I first got started. I don't remember really what happen besides the ending. Severus is being tortured and he realizes that he is going to die and feels himself slipping. He whispers Hermiones name with desperation to just say it and it activates a portkey she have him before. It ends with him feeling his life leaving as he feeling the twist in his navel as it activates. It leaves you there to decide if he lives or dies.


** Have you read linkffn(Pet Project)? It's one of the more popular HGSS stories, but it's really awesome. I'm normally very wary of this ship since it seems like people love to portray both of them completely out of character, but this one is very good. It takes almost the entire story for there to be any romance and their relationship is more mentor student most of the time. It also has some great humourous scenes.

linkffn(The Professor's Discretion) is also good, there is no actual romance though if I remember correctly.

*** I just finished Pet Project... I loved it the whole time until the end. I personally would have thought it close to perfect for myself if it wouldn't have turned so dramatically fairytale, but instead stayed "true." It was like someone else wrote the last 3 chapters which was disappointing. Other than that, FANTASTIC!

Thank you very much for sharing it with me :)

** I recently read [[http://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]] from a rec on this sub and loved it. It's a body-swap fic set during 7th year in an AU where the war hadn't happened yet. I think it was written before HBP or DH so it's only canon through OOTP.

Oh it's also about 130K words, and these a sequel. But I haven't read the sequel so I can't speak to it's quality.

** I like to think that I write Severus in a pretty believable manner, but I'm not exactly sure if I can satisfy all of your requirements.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11306345/1/][Her Sanguine Heart]] is one that I'm very proud of having finished. It's long, very violent, and full of mystery. I think that it will satisfy many of your interests unless you're not a fan of vampires. They're not the nice sort, though, so maybe you will.

** linkffn(Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars) is long, angsty and has a cruel and insecure Snape (which is necessary IMO for him being in character). Furthermore, it is really masterfully written.

However it is not complete. But at least you won't know if it has a happy ending or not ;) More seriously, if you like ambiguous fics (that is not headed towards a big happy ending) and can do without fluff, I really really recommend this one despite the unfinished status.

Also it is prewar (starts in OotP).

*** I personally prefer "after the war" stories where he survives and Hermione is in their 20's-30's. I also prefer aggressive Hermione/reluctant Severus.

The whole "predator older man" trope is just gross to me.

Bonus points if a fic includes virgin Severus.

*** Thank you for asking in a respectful way. I stumbled upon one of their fan fics about 2 years ago and it had great reviews (Phantom of Hogwarts) so I figured I would give it a shot... I really enjoyed the story so I started to read more. Of course I don't read (and to my knowledge there aren't any) ones from her being in her first couple years as a little girl. I do the ones in her last 1 or 2 years of Hogwarts.

To me I read them with the age gap but I don't think about her as "underage" since the legal age is 16 in the country. Like I said, I don't like the fanfics to have a bunch of fluff or really any at all.... what appeals to me is that he is a stern, complex, hurting man in a very hard and dangerous position. I like that Hermione can give him some glimmer that the world isn't terrible and there are people who can truly care. A reason to not be haunted by the past. The fact she is young, smart, and is all in with people she cares for seems like the right person who could do that. They will clash but overall they can both take the strides of that. I will be honest though, when I read I never want it to be a "happy ending." I want him to get that glimpse of what could be happiness, but still die at the end.

*** Here's my general appeal (and I won't speak for other SSHG fans), I always loved Alan Rickman and I loved his portrayal of Snape. That voice just does things to me and I can't help it haha. So Snape/Rickman was one of my favorite characters, and I always liked Hermione also.

I personally don't enjoy OCs or slash very much (nothing against them, just not my cup of tea), so if I want to read some Snape-centered fics with some romance/angst, this pairing is my default not only because I like it, but because of the sheer number of fics.

So after that bit of rambling, you can safely assume I just don't think much about the fact he knew her when she was 11. I don't read fics about any HP character when they were that young so I guess it doesn't bother me because I don't think about any of them that young anymore. I'm probably just justifying it to myself, lol, but don't take away my crack pairing! They're both some of my favorite characters so I like reading more about them. That's really it.
