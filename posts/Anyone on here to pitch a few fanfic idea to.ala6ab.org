** Ideas are easy peasy. Writing is hard. Most ideas look rougher when you write them down than they seem in your head. But any idea can work if it's executed well and there is no short cut.

*** Alright my first idea which i plan on calling Obscure Magiks is a story where Harry becomes super in touch with the magical world after almost becoming an obscurial while be8ng abused as a kid. This leads to him being unsurpassed as a wandless magician being near telekenetic from a young age. A few scenes i have planned is when he walks into Ollivanders to buy his first wand when it gets handed to him sparks come shooting out of the end but not because it chose him but because he shorted out the core. So Ollivander has to go to a very ancient part of the store to get a staff which is what Harry ends up using.

**** But what is the actual story? You just described characters 1-2, you set the stage so to speak. But what happens next? What is the tale you are trying to tell?

***** Well he's constantly going tonstruggle with emotional control so as to not feed the obscurus further. Plus hes going to be incredibly powerful from a very young age so i think itd be fun to write how he adapts to that life

****** But that sounds more like side plots than the actual story. You have the sauce, but you need some meat to it because character centric stories with 11 year olds are doomed to either disregard their age and therefore fail their objective or be very simple and therefore rather boring.

If you want to use the canon plot, you have to think about what changes and what not. This will be the core of your story. This needs to be fleshed out.

******** Slice of Life with a completely overpowered protagonist? I mean, I write in that genre and it just seems odd to have an extremely gimmicky character, give him a special, unique tool and then go on and write about friendships and the like. And 11-year-olds in slice of life is bound to be rather boring. I mean, have you recently listened to some kids in that age, what they talk about and so on (eg by having the misfortune of being in a bus when school is out)? That is not the level of dialogue you would be interested in. Unless of course, you consider "Your mom is a fat whore!" the pinnacle of humour.

********* It's a given that /Harry Potter/ fanfictions /don't/ sound like 11-year-olds. Heck, the /canon/ 11-year-olds don't sound like 11-year-olds. It's part of the genre, rather like how Mickey Mouse isn't mouse-shaped and mouse-brained so that some interesting stories can be told with him as the protagonist.

********** But the thing is, slice of life doesn't really need such changes. If you want to write about 11 year olds lives at Hogwarts, Harry being OP either won't really change much or makes problems trivial.

*********** I wasn't asking for slice-of-life of 11-year-old-Harry at Hogwarts. I was asking for slice-of-life of 11-year-old-God-Harry at Hogwarts. OP, funny, fluffy slice-of-life can be immensely fun; stories like /Core Threads/ and /Fantastic Elves/ are at their strongest when Harry is just being wholesomely, preposterously wonderful without villains and plot contrivances to bog him down, and that's the sort of spirit I'd like to see here.

I dunno. Sometimes I like to read about delightful wish-fulfillment characters being delightful. (I think this shows very clearly in my story.) I would, for example, like the /Fantastic Beasts/ films much more if they just consisted of Newt traveling the world and finding his creatures and being awkwardly friendly with his pal Jacob, without any flashy warry Grindelwald stuff.

Not everyone has that affinity, it's a matter of tastes. But that's how I feel about it.

************ But someone abused so much that he nearly became an obscurial is pretty much the opposite of "delightful wish-fulfillment" or "wholesome". Either you delve into angst, or you handwave the whole abuse away - and then, what point did it have anyway?

************* /Core Threads/ also used a pretty dark first chapter to set up what is otherwise one of the most brilliantly angst-free stories I've ever come across. It's far from unheard of.

Heck, Roald Dahl made a dang /career/ out of introducing his child protagonists in terrible circumstances and then having the rest of the book be fun and whimsical.

***** Well he wouldn't be a sociopath but he would need to keep control of his emotions because he can still lose control of the obscurus if he becomes too enraged. Hes going to be more studious than charming and i don't think I'm foing to have him being friends with Ron

** There's a lot of discussion over the premise of the story, my question is where do you want to end up? Do you have an ending in mind? What is the time period you want to cover in your story? A lot of stories I've read have very strong starts but fizzle out as the story continues because the author doesn't have any idea of what their ending is. Another advantage to knowing your ending at the start is that you can build up to it over the course of the whole story, rather than having to make something up on the fly at the end.
