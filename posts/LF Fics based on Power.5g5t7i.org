I'm not sure if there are any but I'm looking for fic where the wizarding world is more concerned with how powerful a witch or wizard is rather than their blood.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowlege is Useful, But Power is Power]] is not be quite what you're looking for (it's not a meritocracy sort of thing with power for the most part) but if I'm remembering the fic right, the wizarding world is /very/ concerned about power.

*** I just read it, and I really liked the beginning! Really unique concept, however when the capital M appears, I think the story just tried to much and lost its footing. Either the author should not have involved the capital M, or Harry should have lost to show that his actions have consequences.
