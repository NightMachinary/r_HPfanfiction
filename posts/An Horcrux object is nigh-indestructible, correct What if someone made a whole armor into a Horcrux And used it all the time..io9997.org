** It's not the horcrux that actually grants an object indestructability. It's the enchantments that a dark wizard places on the object afterwards that grants it resistance.

The fact that they aren't used in canon suggest that their are limitations on their uses.

Even if you could protect an armor after the fashion of horcruxes, I'd assume that the killing curse would still work, it is said to be unblockable. You can still be stunned through clothes, so I'd assume spells that affect the person and not the armor would still work such as stunners or the body-bind. They just simply don't work on a horcrux because it is not alive.

** As Impossible-Poetry said, an Horcrux is not "night-indestructible" because it is an Horcrux, but because any wizard with at least some common sense would first enchant a receptacle to be sturdy before putting his soul inside.

Now, there is nothing stopping a wizard from enchanting an amor before using it all the time, but anything anything able to pass the protections made by a full grown wizard would probably make a quick work of some metal armor. So you might as well just enchant your daily robe and be done with it.

** Someone at some point would use fiendfyre and destroy the whole thing. Or the armour would have been hit by enough AK's to destroy the horcrux's

** Wearing just a locket was awful, being dwarfed by a horcrux can't be safe or healthy.

And there would be multiple horcruxes? Because armors are not one whole piece, right?

Also, you'd probably want to keep the horcrux protected, not use it when being literally attacked.

I mean, there shouldn't be a problem if it's YOUR horcrux.

The locket could read in their minds that they wanted to destroy it, of course it would fight back. Your own horcrux wouldn't fight back against you.
