Whether it was because Dumbledore could not fell him, because of his cruelty, breaking the Hogwarts protections, or that he accomplished things like breaking into Nurmengard.

Edit: I like the intelligent conversation, don't get me wrong, but this is a request thread. Remember rule 9.


** I always assumed that Harry's world was very British-centric. So, Voldie was the most feared because he was recently active and he operated mainly in Britain. Grindles didn't make it across the channel so wasn't as relevant to them. Saying Voldie was worse than Grindles is like saying Newton is smarter than Da Vinci.

I honesty believe that Dumbles was fully capable of beating Voldie, which Voldie knew so he avoided facing Dumbles whenever possible. This is shown in Book 5 when Voldie escaped their alteration as soon as he could rather than stand his ground for a long battle with Dumbles. In his early years, Grindles used many of the same strategies that Voldie did - develop a position of power with a following of rich/important/powerful wizards, sow political unrest and fear, etc. Voldie was a parselmouth, Grindles was a seer. There are many parallels between them, but Grindles was saner and didn't have the chip on his shoulder that Voldie did.

*** I think there is also the factor of freshness and proximity. Look at our world. Hitler is more harshly remembered, yet the Soviet Union and Mao's regime killed vastly more people. People talk about winners and losers, but I think it is proximal impact, East vs West. There were many other genocidal proto-states in history, murdering and and enslaving a greater percentage of the population than the Nazis, but they aren't remembered with such intensity.

In other words Grindelwald killed a lot of people over there long ago. Whereas Voldermort killed (I assume) fewer here a short while ago.

***** Backup was on the way and the objective failed.

I view Voldemort as a coward, unwilling to risk a fight with Dumbledore, unless he knew he would win. However, all out, Voldemort could possibly best him.

My headcanon is that Dumbledore didn't want him to know the rest of the prophecy, because then he'd be secure in the knowledge he could beat Dumbledore.

Sounds pretty smart to me. And there's supposedly a reason he was a Slytherin (Hogwarts house).

** Widespread use of the Imperius Charm to spread influence, leaving a glowing skull-and-snake in the sky over the homes of his victims... oh, and he'd target the homes of his victims, killing everyone inside.

His supporters were faceless and legion. Nobody knew who they were except that they were highly-placed in the government.

Aurors were regularly routed and were basically useless. Nobody knew who 'Voldemort' was, as opposed to, say, Grindelwald.

Remember that scene where Moody shows Harry a picture of the original Order of the Phoenix, and starts naming how everyone died, and Harry starts feeling queasy and overwhelmed that so many people willing to stand up and do the right thing died such tragic deaths, while Moody doesn't seem to mind or notice? That's because Moody lived through it, and such a small dose of what was happening everywhere was no big deal to him. Meanwhile, Harry had only thought about what it would have been like to live through that in abstract.

Of the main trio, who is willing to say Voldemort's name? Harry, Hermione (eventually), and... not Ron. Because Ron alone would have been familiar with the sheer horror and uncertainty, having been raised in a household where his two uncles were murdered by Voldemort and his followers (the Prewetts). When they're hunting Horcruxes in Deathly Hallows, Ron's glued to the radio 24/7, listening to the casualty list, because he knows how easy it would be to have your entire family snapped away in the blink of an eye - his family had almost had it happen to them, and that was before they joined the Order for the next War. Ron's not a fucking coward, he faces his worst fear at age 11, and deliberately sacrifices his life at age 10 to stop Voldemort. He's still, purely from secondhand accounts, quietly horrified by what Voldemort can do with a few Unforgiveable spells.

There's a reason why random wizards will drop everything they're doing just to shake Harry's hand 9 years later, the moment they recognize him, and it's not because they're just that fond of kids. Don't imagine it like killing Hitler - think of it as stopping the Columbine shooters, except you were trapped in the school with them, and you don't know what they looked like.

*** Hmmm, I don't think Ron knew all that much actually. I can't remember what it was exactly, but Mr. Weasley had to explain something to him (and all the kids) about the Death Eaters. Ron is afraid of the name because his parents are. I can't imagine Mr or Mrs. Weasley sitting around telling him stories.

*** Taking it further, Ron leaving them in the forest is far more justifiable in this context. His family was targeted once before, and are highly active frontline resistance members. It's only a matter of time before they're killed. Their only hope is for them to find some secret objects he knows exist somewhere.

He doesn't know the full plan, but he's willing to follow Harry no matter where it takes him in order to destroy the Horcruxes according to the plan Harry implied Dumbledore left behind. But then Harry drops the bombshell that there is no plan, just some vague hints and hunches- and Harry wants to leave even that behind and chase mythical artifacts from children's stories. It's like if the only person who can stop the Columbine Shooting were running around looking for Cinderella's glass slipper and the Holy Grail instead, all while your family could get shot any moment.

No wonder he got upset. Harry was gambling the lives of Ron's entire family so he could chase fairy tales. Combine that with the Locket's influence, and I think Ron could easily conclude that he could be doing more good elsewhere, and storm off- and justifiably so.

** My headcanon would be that Voldemort is essentially a terrorist engaging in guerilla warfare. Anyone openly opposing him would have their families targeted. Anyone known to say his name, specifically targeted. The grindelwald war from what I understand would be a classic war where soldiers fight on each side but the families of those soldiers wouldn't all get specifically targeted for fighting. Take linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin) for instance. It doesn't go into until later but moody specifically had his family targeted and made him beg Voldemort to kill his family quickly as opposed to slowly and drawn out

TLDR it's easier to be willing to risk your life than your family's lives.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Did anyone outside Britain and maybe France even ‘notice' him?

Plus, didn't Grindie mostly fight in continental Europe and over seas, because of his Blood Oath with Dumbles?

Terrorists are just scarier to the civies of the country they operate in than the war lords of the rest of the world.
