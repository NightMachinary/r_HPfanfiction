:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fic I read on FF.net maybe 10 years ago... I remember it was long, and I think a romance fic with Harry and Ginny, and maybe Hermione too... I remember there were riddles that the author would post at the end of each fic. I'm sorry I dont have more to go on, but any help would be appreciated.
