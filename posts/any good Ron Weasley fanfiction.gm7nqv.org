  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective.

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044]]) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24003130]]) it's a Ron becomes a vampire before 6th year fic.

Hide quoted text

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/]]) Ron and Hermione centric- set after DH

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]) Sadly will never be completed. Time traveling Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/]]) Percy centric but has a lot of Ron! What happens when the Weasley parents die and Percy has to take over?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/]]) Solstice Muse is an amazing author. Highly recommended for everything Ron!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/]]) SI merged with Ron. It's actually incredible.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1806117/1/]]) Ron-centric. Ghost Ron where he dies and has to deal with those ramifications.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/]]) Oldie but a goodie! One shot but very well written.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/]]) Incredible Ron time travel fic where the tropes are thoroughly explored and discussed in a very realistic way.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]]) The Red Knight. It's very well known, very well done. An all around great read.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4100736/1/]]) Incredible. Ron dealing with insecurities and family while taking care of an ailing Muriel.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5288841/1/]]) Ron centric, also dealing with Ron's insecurities!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3880365/1/]]) When Ron's exposure to the Horcrux exposes more than just his thoughts, they need to save him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954815/1/]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2929256/1/]]) Extreme Ron whump. What happens when Ron decides to take Harry's detention with Umbridge in his place?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2333917/1/]]) Ron and Harry have more in common than they'd thought.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10199030/1/]]) Ron gets in over his head and is faced with terrible consequences.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12120803/1/]]) Ron, Harry and Hermione relationship. Oneshot

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632772/1/]]) Ron has been missing for years. He may or may not have betrayed Harry. And why is Harry hearing his best friends voice all of a sudden in his head?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11019962/1/]]) A oneshot exploration of Ron and Molly's relationship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/]]) Stay Standing. The original Ron whump fic that if you don't know you need to.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/]]) I'm sure you have this recommended already, but a very jaded Ron and Harry go back in time!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11491514/1/]]) Another time travelling Ron fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12742123/1/]]) Ron love to get away from all the bashing! An exploration of his many achievements.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/]]) The other original Ron Slytherin fic. Choices.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868266/1/]]) An exploration of Ron and his family.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]).

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) 6th year fic where Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack. Alternating POVs.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

(SELF PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) More Hermione-critical than outright bashing. AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike.

And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.

They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return.

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.
