I played a text-based game 7 years ago and I am looking for it. i do not remember the name of it. it's a text-based adventure game where harry collects items for hermione from different girls throughout the castle and he ends up having sex with them. If I recall it's called Harry potter and "something" quest. anyone can help me find it? it was one of the best fan fictions that i have ever played

**** There is actually a pretty sizable community who makes erotic text based games.

I did some conversational to standard grammatical English translation for a Russian guy who was making his own game.

From the bit of the content I've seen within the community it's filled with incest and furry content.
