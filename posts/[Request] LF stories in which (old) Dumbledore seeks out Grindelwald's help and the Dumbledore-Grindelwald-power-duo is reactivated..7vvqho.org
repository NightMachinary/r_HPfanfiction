The Dumbledore/Grindelwald stories I read mostly concentrate on their youth or on how terrible Grindelwald is. I would like to read something where Grindelwald has grown older and wiser and is actually not a complete powerloving nuthead anymore. Seeing them rekindle their old love would make me very happy as well. It can be completely AU or almost canon.

Thank you in advance.

Edit: well, looks like this is something that should get written. If anyone feels up to it, please do so and tell me!


** Almost canon and doesn't involve them teaming up, but you might enjoy [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]; it's a long term correspondence between Albus and Gellert during the latter's incarceration at Nurmengard.

** I think they teamed up in linkffn(Gods Among Us) wasn't any good though.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix
