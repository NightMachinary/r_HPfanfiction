No rape please

No over abusive Dursleys, just kind of done with that idea

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing if I can help it, am fine with Dumbledore bashing,if necessary

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes, etc. Does NOT have to be focused on pairings

Would rather not have the Lord Harry Potter-Black-Malfoy-Slytherin, etc cliche

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

Doesn't have to be horror/thriller/etc, can be any genre that tends to not be as written.


** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896]]) is chilling.

Antithesis by the same author is also dark. Its not the same type of story. Horror maybe but it's... Just heavy.

I don't know if you watch Doctor Who but I read this last night and it was very tense and thrilling!. Weeping Angels. I don't like crossovers but this was fantastic. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image]])

This is a Boggart one which was suspenseful linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13823533/1/If-you-could-choose]])

Is this horror? I don't think so but it's spooky linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680]])

Check those out.... I think they're what you're looking for but I could be wrong.

  Are you a witch or

  Are you a fairy?

  Or are you the wife

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
