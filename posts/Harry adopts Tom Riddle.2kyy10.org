I've been looking all over for some good fics where Harry adopts Tom Riddle, either by traveling in time or by a de-aging spell on Voldemort or anything really.

I find lots of fics that say "this isn't your typical harry-raises-tom story" but that's all I want!

Completed fics preferred but at this point I'll take anything.
