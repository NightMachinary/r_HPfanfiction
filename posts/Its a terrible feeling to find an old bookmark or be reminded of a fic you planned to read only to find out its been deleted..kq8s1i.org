Just wanted to rant, that's all. Skimming the old wiki, I found a link to Annie789's Marauder era fic, which led me to her LiveJournal, which made me realized I've already been here 6 years ago and spent a good month getting her to friend me so I can read it, only to be distracted by something else and had completely forgotten about it, and now she's taken basically everything off the blog.

Bah.

On the LiveJournal thing though, its sad to see so much stuffs lost to time and the terrible platform its hosted on. The first decade of the HP fandom and the golden age (long break between GoF and OOTP) of fanfiction was hosted there and now a good chunk of it is gone and the remainder has one foot in the grave. Not to mention all the stuffs hosted on private sites and blogs that's now permanently lost because the host died.


** I've got a bunch of bookmarks on AO3. Every now and then I'll scroll through to either re-read something or remove stories that no longer match my taste. It's always frustrating to come across "This story has been deleted" slots and not even have any idea which story's been deleted! I can usually only guess at which fandom it belonged in by seeing which stories come before and after on the list, since I usually only read from one fandom at a time. Sadly just knowing the fandom is seldom soothing on the nerves.

And I know I have a few “this story has been deleted” spots that belong to tardisistheonlywaytotravel and I'm still upset about that. I loved their works but they weren't long enough for me to download and now they're gone. (Length is no longer a download factor for me)

Apparently people had been cross-posting the fics without permission so titowtt got upset and took them all down? Not cool, audience. Fics are works of art graciously shared with us by the awesome writers, and abusing that privilege ruins it for /everyone/

**** Good news: they're not all be gone! [[https://archive.org/details/AO3_story_dump_continuing][Archive.org has been backing up AO3 for a good long while]], and there are multiple backups freely available.

Out of curiosity, I went ahead and downloaded the ZIP file (which is the /NOT/ the most recent backup, as its from March of 2019), and found four fics from this author. I'm currently downloading the big long list of 7zips to see what else is there. It'll take a few days, but I'll dump everything I can find regardless of fandom into [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nZl0xBSrMYM8bT-khyNGuUNgKJP9srqN?usp=sharing][THIS FOLDER]].

Note that the backups are text files and therefore not all that pretty, but it's better than nothing. Feel free to download the other files yourself if you don't feel like waiting and your internet is faster than mine :D I'm working with a handicap (motel wifi) until Friday, and it throws an absolute hissy fit when I try to look at the contents of each file LOL

****** Quick update: looked over two of the 7zip files on my ancient laptop before heading into work, and there's nearly 100 fics in there (one with 86 from a variety of fandoms, and one with six Dr Who). The beast was stalled out extracting the 86, so if you check the google drive folder in... twelve hours or so?... they might all be there. The torrent download itself had about 3gb to go, so in theory I'll be able to upload them all after work.

For reference, Bing has a cached version of that author's ao3 profile from last september, and there are 339 fics listed.

Not really, hard drives fail all the time, and bit rot is a thing. For few years of active use or more than that of sitting on a shelf it might be OK, but truly long term storage will require magnetic tape (still, 5-10, maybe 20 years if you're lucky) or [[https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/longevity-recordable-cds-dvds.html][specific, expensive and correctly stored CD/DVD disks]].

** Is there a script or a way to download the web link to every story you have saved on your fanfiction.net account? So you can run it through a program to download them all?

** My favorite fanfiction in the world was a trilogy clocking in at well over a million words, and after reading it through one time, I went back to it about a year later only to find a message that said the original author pulled basically all except a few chapters and was rereleasing it on Wattpad. She never got around to it, and I'm sorely tempted to send her a letter myself requesting a personal copy of all of the books bound. It was so sad to not be able to read it again. Pretty sure I cried.

** do you have the old url? Archive.org can help

here's the author's page from 2012 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427214423/https://www.fanfiction.net/u/546444/Annie789]]

and here's the main fic from their page [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427214431/http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287445/1/All_These_Complications]]

doing some spot checking, it looks like the first 49 chapters were saved on Archive.

** I was in school during that golden age of FF and I would copy/paste entire stories and print them out at the school library using narrow margins and point 7 font. Even now I still have old copies of favorite fics in word docs on my desktop. It's controversial but I even have a pdf of Neville Longbottom and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction.

** It always breaks my heart whenever I realize that a fanfic author decided to take down their stories. Whether it's because they are not interested in writing fanfic anymore or if it's because they were bullied off the platform. I think I found Annie's livejournal and it says that you can PM her. However, I think the last time she updated her journal was back in 2016. Nearly five years ago.

I think if you want to go down that route, you can ask for a link to the story through somebody that had managed to download it before the author deleted, but I suggest not doing this out of respect for the author. While it can be seen as being supportive, a lot of writers see this as an insult if the fic is not posted anymore. It would be like putting a book in copyright as a PDF and distributing it to people without paying for it... in this case the fanfic author deleted it and doesn't want it to be read.

** I'm glad that there was already an eBook project active for Nightmares of Futures Past when chapter 43 was posted, so it got picked up and included before FFN deleted the fic a few months later. There's other sites that have parts of the story, but nowhere else has chapter 43.

What's really concerning is the total radio silence from FFN when the author tried to question them about it. Maybe I should go through my whole favorites list on FFN and download them all... Never know when the admins might decide to wipe a fic.

*** Thanks for the offer, but that fic is popular and well archived, the link in the wiki led to the saved copy. I just found the author name familiar and traced it back. Its meant to be more of a general rant/discussion about the state of things and the loss of a lot of content over the years.

**** reminds me of how this one auther (noël I think) deleted a bunch of her fics because she was salty that people distributed/re-uploaded them. I think his is completely nonsensical because she esentially proving them all right, also her fics are like on ever top must read list
