Hello! I just want to know if anyone has any good suggestions for any Dramione fanfics. Preferably fluff with some comedy. Tragedy would be fine too though. Just not so much the smut stuff. (: Kind of like the fanfiction like Eight and Eighth if you've read that. Thanks!


** Alright, lets do this.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5498748/1/Simply-Irresistible][Simply Irresistable]] - Draco gave a cocky grin. "I am going to give you a makeover." "I'm sorry what?" "You heard me Granger, I'm going to give you a makeover that will make every man want you,and make Weasley die of regret. You will be simply irresistible."

/Ron cheats on Hermione with Draco's girlfriend, they decide to get revenge by pretending to date each other/

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2064124/1/Parenting-Class][Parenting Class]] - Complete DHr & HG Sixth years at Hogwarts are now required to take a parenting class, what fun! Hermione, Draco, and Harry are paired up in which they'll trade off being children. Can they live through the class or will being a parent prove too hard?

/More humour in this fic. Pretty easy read/

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5458618/1/A_Marriage_Most_Convenient][A Marriage Most Convenient]] - Hermione lost it all when she divorced. Draco would lose it all by age 30 if he didn't marry. Marriage to each other would be perfect, one would even say it was most convenient. Her daughter even looked like him, although, he wondered why that was.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3888635/1/An_Unlikely_Pair][An Unlikely Pair]] - They were an unlikely pair. He knew it, so did she. Everyone did. It didn't matter,they were merely friends, hardly even that. There was certainly no affection, no romance. Just friendship. Neither wanted more. Honestly. Well, maybe. Nominated fiction.

Also, [[http://dramioneficlists.tumblr.com/post/21297758960/dramione-fics-listed-by-genre][this website]] is pretty good at sorting out the fics by genre/side pairings/themes/etc. It's pretty good for when you're not sure what to read :)

*** Hmm... I checked out the parenting class one because the premise sounded kind of fun, but less than a chapter in I'm questioning why it has SO MANY reviews when it's just rather poorly written...

EDIT: I went with it, and it's oddly compelling despite the writing - it is admittedly fun to see Draco, Hermione and Harry as kids in turn with the other two taking care of them.

**** I felt the same way when I first read that fanfic, and I kept reading it anyways as well.

I've learned from reading fanfiction for so many years that sometimes you just need to look past the writing when there is a genuinely entertaining story.

** Unfortunately, you might need to get a bit more specific. Like, do yoh want comedy or tragedy? Do you want it to take place during or aftee the war? There are TONS of Dramione fics, some great, others terrible.

So maybe throw in a few more requirements?\\
I will suggest one though: Merry Christmas Mr. Malfoy, by Emerald-Kisses. It's on fanfiction.net. It's complete, has comedy and fluff.

AnneM.Oliver (same site) is good, too, but I find some of her work feels repetitve to I stopped reading her stuff a while ago.

Those are the first two suggestions off of the top of my head. I would provide links but I'm on my phone.

Good luck in your search! :)

** A few of these are rated M, but IIRC they weren't too smutty.

** I recently found a blog that lists a lot of Dramione's and have found it really helpful! [[http://dramioneficlists.tumblr.com/post/52891638124/coloured-grey-dramione-fics-and-where-to-find-them]] It has a ton of fics from a website that was shut down and also has other fics split into categories.
