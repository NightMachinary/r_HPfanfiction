Or is this just a consequence of the trope. I feel like there /had/ to be something well written that spawned the trope. I must know so that I may understand!

I have literally never read a single one. So far everything I've found has been agregious OOC or just totally forth wall breaking cringe.

This may not exist but I feel like if it does I want to try to get it.


** Short answer : no.

Long answer : definitely, no.

*** It's a very intense AU trope from what I gather - Wikipedia has a page on it if you want an explainer (rather than exposing yourself straight to it). [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegaverse]]

It's very R rated with usually a lot of sex, sometimes of dubious consent or rape. These things are absolutely not my cup of tea, but it is becoming increasingly popular - it started in fandom and seems to be seeping into actual, published fiction now too.

*** It is a garbage trope centred around masculine, possessive alpha and weak, submissive omega. Often involves dubious consent, lack of any agency, borderline rape. Very one way, extremely unhealthy relationship that denigrates the omegas to the extreme. There is often also male pregnancy involved.

If I had ability to wipe one trope from fanfiction - that would be it.

*** Its a super odd (I hesitate to say weird because I haven't read any yet) relationship tag based around alpha/beta dynamics.... I think? It usually has /very/ aggressive and possessive character with their pairing being weak and submissive.

That's about all I can glean off to this and the famfiction subreddit.

** I don't have any for you, but I think you're more likely to find people who might have mined the good ones over on [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]].

** Bro if you will specify What The Hell is A/B/O, maybe we could recommend the fics.

*** This is one of those things where if you don't already know, you're definitely not going to know the fics to recommend, and there's a pretty good chance you don't want to know either.

**** A/b/o is the epitome of [[https://imgur.com/gallery/cOjDpRY][this gif here]]

That said, if a person's curiosity is insatiable, they can go watch Lindsay Ellis' [[https://youtu.be/zhWWcWtAUoY][video on the Omegaverse lawsuit]], because there's enough other WTF to set off the WTF that is A/b/o
