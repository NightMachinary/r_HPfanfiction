Besides Auror and pro Quidditch player. I'm currently writing a crossover with the Avengers. For the most part, everything is assumed to the same as canon up until the end of HBP. DH has some differences, but none change Harry's personality so they aren't covered very much.

In OoTP, his stating his intention to become an Auror felt a bit fake, more of "here's a thing I could do I guess". In the crossover, he does work as an Auror (mentioned only) for a few years, just to round up the remaining Death Eaters and such. However, I can't see him desiring it that much without it being tied to Voldemort. Figure he might wander the world a bit before settling down. So what are some good ideas for a career aside from Wandering Rich Guy? (Including muggle careers)

*** Yes! God I hated that epilogue so much. In my personal headcanon, after Voldie went moldy, Harry ended up an auror for a few years and took care of the rest of the bad guys, then at the age of 25 he went back to Hogwarts and taught kids for decades. He also ended up being the head of Gryffindor house. Hell, maybe he even became headmaster. Hogwarts was his home.

** Why wandering rich guy? Why not wandering poor guy like Clark Kent in Man of Steel?

Harry's fame precludes him from doing entry level career stuff unless it's something like being an Auror or something involving more than paper pushing and whatnot. The Chosen One can't take a job like Percy researching cauldron bottoms. I guess he could take part in the twin's shop as he is part owner, but that doesn't really seem his style to me.

**** According to Dumbledore, Harry got a "reasonable amount" of gold from Sirius, who left him everything. The gold and the decrepit, old house. A reasonable amount of money from a will would be, I dunno, some tens of thousands of dollars, max? Sirius was also disowned so I don't think he had much of an inheritance from the main Black family.

And we never knew how much money Harry had in Gringotts. For all we know it was enough for his tuition and some left over for savings. No one in the books ever said that Harry was obscenely rich or anything, and if he was, I don't think Hagrid would have cared if Harry bought a gold cauldron like he wanted to during his first shopping trip.

From Philosopher's Stone: "Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts ... And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London."

This might seem like a lot to an 11 year old kid who never had anything, but to an adult this sounds like enough to live off of frugally for a few years before needing to find a job. And even Harry calls it a "small" fortune. He didn't find mountains of gold coins, he found mounds of them.

But really, you could go either way. The books are very vague on this matter, and we have no idea the cost of living in the wizarding world because JKR is notoriously bad with anything involving numbers. Just pointing out that it isn't exactly canon that Harry is as rich as the Malfoy family, nor as poor as the Weasley family; so you could easily make him a wandering poor man picking up random jobs wherever he goes.

As for "living off of his fortune" - A wizard doesn't really need to purchase a lot of things! Hell, if done right a houself or two and some seeds etc. might be the only things you really need to buy! Clothes (especially if you charm them up and repair any wear and tear with magic!) last for decades once you stop growing, so the only thing you really need to get is food and you can get by easily if you have a couple of houselfs and some land (to grow food on!)...so yeah, even a small fortune will go a long way!

****** JKR has said on twitter that the Ministry pays for "all magical education" this is true. But I tend to take anything she says outside of the books as second tier to whatever canon says. And canon says that Harry had to pay for his books, his school supplies such as cauldrons and potions ingredients, etc. That right away shows that saying "all magical education" is a gross overstatement. Especially since Hogwarts also requires you to pay for robes as well. JKR likes to embellish stuff on twitter and in interviews, sometimes contradicting herself in the books. She just doesn't think things through sometimes. Someone asked her if magical tuition was free, and she thought "Oh, that's a lovely idea, sure it is!" without realizing that she had made Harry pay for all his school supplies as well as the poor Weasley family who were scraping at the bottom of their vault for coins to pay for their children to go to Hogwarts.

And yeah, the Weasleys are poor. That they can't afford new robes, a new owl, pocket money to buy snacks on the train, or new books. That the most important object a witch or wizard could ever own, a wand, is something that is a luxury to this family, as even wands are given to their children second hand. If being poor in the wizarding world was so easy, as you say, they shouldn't be struggling as much as they are, especially for necessities such as wands. If magical tuition was free, that means that the Weasley family was struggling even with all their children being taken care of for free at Hogwarts. That's questionable, don't you think?

When people say all, they mean all, usually. And books and supplies are included in that. She said there was no tuition fee, and went on to say "all magical education". All magical education is all-encompassing, with tuition being a part of that. You can't really have an education without books, after all. And I haven't heard of a single public school that forces you to buy textbooks, in the US or the UK. So yes, canon does contradict this.

Let's say you're right. That means either Arthur earns not even enough to support himself and his wife and the cost of cheap second hand school supplies (with wands being handed down) -- or one of the major reasons they're so poor is because they're sending seven children to an elite boarding school with tuition, room, and boarding fees. The math doesn't add up, so JKR screwed SOMETHING up somewhere no matter which way you slice it.

Except even in your quote she picks out tuition. We know canon requires you to pay for books and suppies, jut as universities do (at least in the U.S.). So no, you gave no canon examples of the Weasleys (or anyone else) mentioning issues paying tuition.

Outside of Ron, I don't think we were ever told wands were passed down. In fact, who would they even be getting them from? It's not like they have a bunch of spare wands laying around. Then factor in new books every year (some of which aren't old enough to get second hand), new clothes (probably the cheapest expense), new supplies (cauldrons and whatever else they use) for multiple children... it adds up.

********** Hogwarts is not a university, it's a grade school, my man. And free textbooks are part of public grade school education. The only things the British pay for in public school are the uniforms, I think. And university education costs money as well in the UK. So...

You're missing my point entirely. I know she said tuition. I also pointed out that she went on to say ALL MAGICAL EDUCATION is covered by the Ministry. Like I said, by saying ALL she made it complete. That means books and supplies have to be included.

And even disregarding all that, how many boarding schools do you know of that are free for every student? Can you honestly say that that's a viable education model for a government to have, when the cheaper and better solution would be for students to floo home every evening?

And of course no wands were passed down other than to Ron. Charlie's last year was the year before Ron started his first year. There's a whole lot to think about here, but suffice to say that there couldn't be any hand me-downs to Percy or the twins or Ginny because there were no other wands to be handed down. For whatever reason, Charlie switched wands after he graduated, and Ron got his old one -- because the Weasley couldn't afford any unneeded expenses if they had a solution which was cheaper. Because they're poor.

Cauldrons can be handed down. Two cauldrons should even be enough for all the Weasley family in Hogwarts, as the only time both cauldrons would be in use would be when the twins have their class. Second hand books aren't really that expensive, nor are second hand clothes, and I'm sure only Ginny is the one actually buying new clothes. We know that Ron was using old pajamas that didn't really fit him in 4th year.

It wouldn't be a better solution. It would be a problem to have floo installed for muggle-borns, and if only they stayed in the school then it would create a divide.

Actually, even if you could create a transport for muggle-borns it wouldn't be beneficial to use it. It would lessen their integration into a magical world.

There is also a matter of tradition and training and homework in light of The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery.

Well aware, I was providing a comparison. Even if tuition is free in an education system that doesn't mean books are covered. You are ignoring something: we know the MoM don't pay for books and supplies. Inarguable. Neither Molly nor Arthur ever complained about tuition fees. Inarguable. Ergo, JKR's tweet is inarguable.

She was obviously talking about /going/ to a magical school was paid for, given the sentence prior.

The point of the wand bit is that it's an expense they had to pay out. And no, it's pretty unlikely two cauldrons would last that long. Neville melted his in, what, second year. Standard Cauldrons are made of pewter, they're not indestructible so all those Potions are going to wear them down fairly quickly. I said clothes would be inexpensive. But this:

#+begin_quote
  Second hand books aren't really that expensive
#+end_quote

I don't know where you got that from. Aside from the fact that they can't always get second hand books since they'd either be too new or too out of date for class (second year is the most egregious example since Lockhart's books wouldn't have many second hand available), books are still expensive when you have to buy them second hand.

*** Not totally wrong...I mean we are talking about the guy who didn't ever try to even the odds against the terrorist leader who wanted him dead, despite having instructors who could fight said guy's henchman (and even the guy himself) to a draw!

"Nah, that requires work and dedication! I will die anyway - might as well fly for a bit, play quidditch and later on some chess with Ron! Stop it Hermione, I don't want to go to the library and maybe learn a spell that could help me fight more than a disarming charm! That is good enough!"

** Harry? None probably! Remember, we are talking about a guy who doesn't believe he will survive (not to mention that he doesn't seem to believe into evening the odds, otherwise he'd tell Ron to go to hell instead of slacking off with him constantly! Hell, he might even believe that Quidditch isn't worth the time spent if he could learn/train instead!) and thus he told Umbridge more or less that he'd continue doing what he was doing already (he was already doing what the aurors should do but didn't or couldn't (says something if trained soldiers - remember the aurors aren't just standard police, they are SWAT or SAS - can't take Voldemort and force a child to do their work! IMHO they should all resign in shame and kill themselves...useless wastes of space, the lot of them!))

If given the choice (and believing that he will survive)? Maybe he'd become a therapist for abuse victims! (not a mainline healer, I don't think that that is Harry's calling!)

ps: I agree that Harry would probably not stay on the force (especially with the danger of being used as a poster boy!) after the DEs are dealth with (hate the crapilogue!)...hell, he might even re-take his OWLS and NEWTs, after some studying (Hermione's notes will probably help tons, hell he might even take Runes and Arithmancy!), to have more options! (I always thought it strange that Harry would take a handout - especially since it kind of proves Snape right! - "Can't take your NEWTs like an ordinary wizard, Potter? Need to take a job that is handed to you on a silver platter? How predictable! You sicken me, Potter!" (at least that is what I imagine Snape would say if he were alive!))

** He would /never/ work for the Ministry of Magic in any way, directly or indirectly. They shat all over him for years, and the MoM was corrupt beyond description. I can't imagine that the corruption's gone.

He'd definitely be his own boss.

I see him trying to improve the world in whatever way is practical and possible. Teaching? Hauling the Wizarding World into the 19. century? Introducing, I don't know, /democracy?/ Perhaps introducing the outrageously radical concept of decimal currency? There's definitely room for an impartial newspaper with well-researched articles that aim for truth and justice.

Maybe he'd remember everything bad that happened to him and try to avoid it happening to others. Start an orphanage, perhaps. Or become Headmaster and do something about the rampant bullying. Maybe even start his own school for younger muggleborn and muggle-raised children so that they're not completely blind-sided when they turn 11.

*** I agree, sadly Rowling is very inconsistent in her writing (most characters lack character development! Harry is basically the same 11 year old in the last book! Sure he knows about 5 (combat!) spells more, but that's it! He is still a slacker, he can't make plans worth shit (the 'crux-hunt...damned, bringing the clothes on your back and your wand is not enough Potter! Get some food, bring a tent etc. - don't expect freaking Hermione to save your ass all the time!), he tries to fight dark lords with disarming charms (that's like trying to use a tazer on a well trained and armed terrorist while you also carry grenades, a rifle, a side-arm, a bazooka etc. - you don't do that!) for fucks sake!

He might take the Defense-Job for a while (not forever, being a teacher isn't something he'd enjoy full time - at least not for dozens of students, he didn't deal with opposition in the DA well (he was ready to throw in the towel when this asshole attacked him at the Hogshead meeting!)), but I agree that being his own boss would probably appeal to Harry!

*** Nice! Either gonna start and orphanage, be a DADA teacher at Illvermorny or be a philanthropist. Or maybe all 3? Not sure, might be too much.

** Actually, I'd like to see him ditch Magical Britain with Hermione and selected friends, build a much bigger power base somewhere else, and return to thoroughly cleanse that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic.

*** While wearing an Iron Man like armor :D with additional goodies (invisibility (etc.) - I mean the Weasley-Car had that!)

Yeah, I agree (ps: Attribute the above to my temporary insanity, I just have this short sequence stuck in my head (ever since seeing Avengers: Infinity War) of a magical wearing the latest Iron Man armor, turning invisible, using shields and apparating to dodge attacks etc.)

** I like it when he becomes some kind of philanthropist, but often in those kinds of stories he's absurdly rich, which isn't necessary. Maybe after Voldemort he goes back to the Muggle world to get some education in economics and then founds a non-profit NGO type of thing in the wizarding world. Maybe education related, or making wolfsbane more wildly available, or whatever.

*** Some good ideas that no one else mentioned, thanks. Also considering the suggestion that he might start an orphanage given his upbringing and Riddle's.
