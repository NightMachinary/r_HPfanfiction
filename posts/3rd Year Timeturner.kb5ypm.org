Am I missing something or does it not make any sense that Hermione got a time Turner. Because if for example Ancient runes and divination were at the same time, every student who takes this class combo should have a timeturner. Ron mentioned there beeing 3 classes at the same time, so there should be half of hogwarts running around with a timeturner. Am I missing something or was this just a plot hole.


** Not to mention the potentially biggest problem with it, which is essentially giving time magic to a 13 year old. You'd think the Unspeakables would have time turners locked down like Ft Knox. Instead, McGonagall gives one to a 13 year old just so she can take more classes, and everyone's like, “Sounds great! Be safe!”

**** Shhh. They needed that time turner so they could have Dumbledore send two thirteen year olds out in the dark to run with a werewolf. And hopefully not get killed. But not to get the rat. No. Not that.

**** Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there another part in the books where there are dire warnings about what can happen if the timeline is tampered with? So they obviously know it's a huge potential problem. I don't mind stories having their own internal logic, but then that logic needs to be consistent. Either they don't have a problem with people going willy nilly back in time, or they do.

** Massive plot holes. Based on how controlled they are a student shouldn't get one. Much less for something as attending classes. And yes, the school should have made sure that the whole subjects can be taken without crossing, not for a madman who wants to take them all, but because people shouldn't be deprived of choosing 2 classes they want because the schedule made them collide.

** This is a problem that real schools and students face. Of course, real schools have more classes and teachers to try to fit together. My guess is that Rowling just copied over the problem without really thinking too much about the causes or implications.

There is a pretty logical way to schedule classes to make it work though. If each elective is taught twice at each grade level, they could be scheduled so each one overlaps with a different elective in a single closed loop.

For example, Arithmancy 2 at the same time as Care 1, Care 2 at the same time as Divination 1, Divination 2 with Muggle 1, Muggle 2 with Runes 1, and Runes 2 with Arithmancy 1.

That allows any student to take every elective. But if, due to scheduling limitations, each house and year has up to one core class scheduled in the same time slot as the electives, the schedule will still work as long as no one wants to take more than four electives. And that matches Ron's comment about three classes happening at once.

Now, I'm not sure how well this schedule matches other information we get in the books (the elective classes should be small enough to only need one class each, unless one is disproportionately popular, and I don't know if there is any evidence of electives having two classes for each grade that aren't split by houses), but it at least shows a possible solution that mostly matches what we see.

I suspect I've already put more thought into this than Rowling did, though.

*** I had this myself in high school.

One class I wanted clashed (Statistics) and I ended up taking it as a self-study option, which was only allowed because my Maths teacher vouched that I was able to do it.

This amused me greatly as this maths teacher had also accepted that I just didn't do homework.

*** Another vote for this being a real problem. I had to choose between history and geography at GCSE level because they were scheduled at the same time, and in A-level literally hike other to a nearby school because a course I wanted to take was at the same time as another in my own school.

** Personally, i think the Unspeakables have a specific logic: high-achieving students with access to time magic will do interesting shit with it. It could function as a recruitment spec. If the student gets into interesting things (potions experiments, spellcraft, enchanting, etc), they are allowed to keep the time turner and are marked for further interview. The twins may have "found" a time turner and that's how they found time to acquire the advanced knowledge in potions, charms, and other fields necessary to make their prank items work.

If they only use it to do homework (or like a dork [the Hermione method] where they use it *only* for class attendance, and not homework or health management), they are not considered for further interest. There are probably several of those, and I like to think Percy was in a similar mindset as Hermione.

** This was the way JKR used to introduce a time turner because she needed it to keep Sirius alive. No school, government or responsible adult would allow a child access to dangerous time magics...apart from JKR apparently.

** For sure! If a Gryffindor can't take all the classes, why not just put her in the Hufflepuff class (or whatever)?

I did see one fic explain this as Trelawney refusing to teach on "inauspicious" days of the week and times of day and Dumbledore indulging her. Meaning that the Divination schedule was so precise that it was impossible to schedule around, and as soon as Hermione dropped Divination she was able to get to classes without a Time Turner.

But the real reason is that JKR just didn't plan it out. /shrug/

** well at my school for a levels we have option blocks and if a subject isn't very popular it'll only be in one block. for example my brother couldn't take geography and computer science at the same time as they were both in block A. sometimes they can shift if lots of people want to take that combo but it can be tricky.

Exact quote for people wondering:

#+begin_quote
  "Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today," she said happily.

  "Hermione," said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, "they've messed up your timetable. Look---they've got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn't enough /time/."

  "I'll manage. I've fixed it all with Professor McGonagall."

  "But look," said Ron, laughing, "see this morning? Nine o'clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o'clock, Muggle Studies. And /look/---" Ron leaned closer to the timetable, disbelieving, "---underneath that, Arithmancy, /nine o'clock/ . I mean, I know you're good, Hermione, but no one's /that/ good. How're you supposed to be in three classes at once?"

  "Don't be silly," said Hermione shortly. "Of course I won't be in three classes at once."

*** I am not so sure if it is a plothole. Is there actually a Gryffindor who doesn't choose the combination of Divination/Care beside Hermione? I am pretty sure we see all Gryffindors at one point in Care and in Divination. So it isn't a problem if this three subjects take place at the same time, because every other Gryffindor had choose the same classes. And from book 5 we know that Hermione took classes with Ravenclaw.

** The only explanation would be that:

-the timetable was made the previous year, after the students made their elective choices

-more people than just Hermione had a time-turner

-there were additional, offscreen teachers for some electives, or even TA apprentices studying the deeper mysteries of magic and helping their teachers

-Rowling just didn't think that much about the topic
