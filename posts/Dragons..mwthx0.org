A myth. A legend.

Some say they truly existed. Some say that, even for the fantastical world of magic, they were just made-up creatures to make big tales and stories even bigger.

Prompt 1: Then, there were tales of Dragonlords. They were said to have been an ancient sect of warriors, who had a special bond with dragons. They would ride them into battle and rain fire and death upon their enemies. One day, Harry gets an anonymous letter with specific instructions. With nothing better to do, he follows them and finds an egg-shaped stone, unnaturally hot to the touch. It doesn't burn him, however. He gets another letter and follows the instructions again and soon he finds himself falling into a rabbit hole of an even bigger destiny than defeating Voldemort. Turns out, his family's legacy was more than just being brave and dying at the hands of the snake-man.

Prompt 2: Hagrid loved dragon stories. He wished they were real. When he wins a 'dragon egg', he tries to hatch it just for shits and giggles. What could go wrong? He certainly wasn't going to bring dragons back into the world.

*Why these prompts?* you may wonder. Answer's easy: dragons are effin cool.

PS: any dragon centric fics -- serious in tone and atmosphere -- that you guys may know, feel free to link them. No slash tho, please.


** Oh,yeah, dragons are my absolute favourite animal, of the non real varieties... /shifty eyes/ But seriously, Esama on ao3 has a few dragon fics, most xover with Temeraire.

** I just have to mention [[https://youtu.be/-Bo_LXpVE0E]] here. Nothing to do with HP universe, but extremely cool nevertheless.

** In my opinion, there is a shortage of dragon centric fics or even mentions of dragons in this fandom. Like seriously, Harry was raised by muggles, meaning that most fantasy stories include dragons in some capacity and when he enters the Wizarding World he isn't even curious about the?
