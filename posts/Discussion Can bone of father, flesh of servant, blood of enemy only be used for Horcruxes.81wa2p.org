Was this ritual specifically created for people who were wraiths due to horcruxes? For that matter, can someone very old and on the verge of death/ diseased person restore their body with the ritual?


** In the ritual, Voldemort didn't use any horcruxes, did he? He already had a body, and he wanted a proper one, not the baby thing that he was.

So, it could possibly be used as a ritual for a new body anyway. You could interpret it that way.

** Yeah the horcruxes were just to make sure he didn't leave this Earth. As long as he still existed he could be used in some ritual, like the one mentioned, to give him a body.

I wonder if there technically are other body resurrection rituals, but he liked that one because he resembled a serpent upon reassembly. Or if he just looked like that because of his Slytherin qualities.

Well, Voldemort certainly seems to believe that he could use the Philosopher's Stone to create himself a new body.

**** Was that the reason he wanted it? Or just another way for him to obtain immortality?

***** Those aren't mutually exclusive. The answer to both of them is “yes”. He straight up says that it would grant him the ability to form another body.

*** Voldemort had a serpent-like appearance before he was resurrected by Wormtail. In HBP, Harry sees a scene from Dumbledore's Pensieve where Tom Riddle applies for the DADA position, and he has become noticeably less human since the previous memories Harry has seen.

I don't know if making Horcruxes automatically makes you look like a snake, or if it's more the case that it turns you into whatever you are on the inside. It could be that if someone made Horcruxes due to greed, for instance, they would end up looking more like a pig.

Also at the end of OotP, Fudge and the other interlopers immediately recognize Voldemort.

** Indeed. I'd say the potion Wormtail created to turn him into the ugly-baby-thing was Horcrux-only, but the big Bone-Blood-Flesh ritual restores anyone to their whole healthy body, and could be used by anyone whose body was damaged. I imagine that if he'd been willing to go through with it, it could have healed Dumbledore's hand, for instance.

** I have a story with a ghost potter in it that is waiting on Harry to make a golem for him to use. I debated the idea of them seeing this spell in action and usiNg the ritual to reenshrine him in a body. Still debating it. I think I already have stated that potters cremate their bodies so they can't be used as inferis but his skull and his father's skull still exist in the story so i can use the bone of father bit easily.

** According to the wiki, that particular ritual is for restoring a wizard whose body has been maimed or is otherwise physically weakened. The ritual didn't restore Voldemort from a spirit, it returned him to his full power from the homonculus he had been since at least the previous August.

** I mean, prolly to the second. Cuz he was the weird ugly baby thing before Wormtail plopped him into the cauldron, so i think it'd just make him an actual honkin body?

** My headcanon is that no, it works for anyone, for reasons given by others in the thread.

My further headcanon is that the ritual can be done either on summer solstice or on one of the equinoxes. If done on an equinox, it restores the user to a healthy state, including damage from Dark curses, with the exception of things that were voluntarily sacrificed. (So, for example, the Weasley twin's ear would be restored, but not Pettigrew's hand.) If done on the summer solstice, it restores the user to a healthy state as above /and/ deages them into their prime.
