I love stories where the protagonist has some advantage because of memories from a previous life/a future/a different dimension/etc.

I also love stories that neither bash nor glorify Dumbledore.

So why not both?

Are there any stories where maybe Dumbledore gets a chance to correct all wrongd he did unto others? A story where he uses his chance at a second life by becoming just as quirky as Luna Lovegood (as he already had a strange personality in his previous life, but now not only does he have a lot of freetime and almost no expectations to live up to - due to the lack of titles and positions -, but also is he powerful enough to do whatever the fuck he wants.) A story where he gets to live the life of a different person (e.g. trapped in the body of Harry Potter/some random next generation child)?

Any ideas if stories like those exist?

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

**** I always tell people who are interested in Dumbledore more than Harry to just read chapter one as if it was a one-shot.

** There is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-next-great-adventure-dresden-files-harry-potter.22941/][The Next Great Adventure]], which is a Dresden Files/Harry Potter crossover.

/Summary: Albus Dumbledore came to the end of his story in his world. Fortunately, or maybe less fortunate for him, fate decides he wasn't quite done and whisked him away to world filled with monsters, magic and other miracles. How does a tired old man deal with everything the Dresden Verse can throw at him?/

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).
