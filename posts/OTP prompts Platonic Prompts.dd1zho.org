There are so many lists of prompts for friends/OTPs that are non-magical, and sure, some of them can be adapted to the Wizarding World, but a lot of them end up being coffee-shop AUs that seem to beat the same idea over and over again.

First, does anyone have their own list of good HP prompts?

Second, if not, does anyone know /where/ one could find prompts like this?

Honestly I just want to be able to find prompts that don't have to be AUs at this point so any suggestions are welcome
