Hi,

I find myself annoyed by the sheer amount of fanfiction that has Harry displayed as some special little snowflake that gets away with everything, that uses laws that no one else seems aware of, and in general has nearly everyone described as completely incompetent. Harry is already special enough with all those poorly explained/thought-out crutches. It sometimes seems like some crime to have him similair to others around him, on a surface level at least.

Like its some pre-requisite for a powerful Harry to shove it in everyone's face, often pared with nonsensical Animagus forms, shouting (often in the Great Hall), magical powers that for some reason only Harry has access to, owns Hogwarts, and is a Lord of half a dozen families; which makes no sense whatsoever.

I'm looking for a fanfiction that has a powerful Harry that displays some subtelty and nuances. That works behind the scenes to direct things in his favor, has magical prowess that isn't limited to him alone, works to a grand scheme/plan that doesn't rely on him being as loud and often as obnoxious as possible, and has a competent Dark Lord/antagonist.

No preference for pairings, but I'm in general terms not a big fan of slash.

Thanks and cheers.


** Not sure how "Subtle" are you talking here.... but try:

Hail Odysseus linkffn(10645463), to some degree has Harry being very secretive and dark, and hiding much.

Blindless linkffn(10937871) is in my opinion less subtle, and yet seems to fit some of your perimeters...

And if memory serves me (and I could be wrong), Effects and Side Effects linkffn(6375811), has Harry working "behind the scenes" if you will as a darker person.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855): this Harry was very powerful, but subtle enough to show his brilliance only at the right time. In the 2nd half of the story, he operated behind the scene and kept other people guessing most of the time.

*My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(6160345): Harry was a loner, quietly building up his power and biding his time. But when the time came, he struck heavily.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059): Time traveling Harry didn't bother his old friends with the exception of Hermione, and he massacred hundreds of his enemies within a short period after his new year 5.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620): Harry was powerful, but barely said anything and was silent most of the time.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): the Trio plotted in secret for more than 2 years before openly declaring war on the Ministry.

**** DLP stands for "Dark Lord Potter," and it's just a forum where people try to find well-written fics. The majority of them apparently fall under a particular category, hence the name being DLP, but essentially, they're just very critical readers and therefore anything recommended by them is usually good and written by a competent author.

C2 just means a "community" on Fanfiction.net, and DLP has a community there which is just the collection of well-written stories they have found on FFN.net.
