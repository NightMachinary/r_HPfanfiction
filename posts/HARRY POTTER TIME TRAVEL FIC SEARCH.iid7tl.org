:END:
I'm looking for a story I started reading and completely lost somehow (hopefully it wasn't taken down). Harry goes back in time and meets a Draco that came back with him, they strike an alliance through magic and plot revenge against Voldemort. Bravo lost his son to Voldemort if that helps jog some cogs

Thank you!

This also has a very similar plotline. I think one was inspired by the other but I can't remember which was the original.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
