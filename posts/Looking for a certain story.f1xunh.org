:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember too much about it other than Harry is chased to Hogwarts by Death Eaters, crashed through the roof of the Great Hall and landing in front of his friends. If I remember correctly, Dumbledore is about to announce that he's missing just before the crash, but I'm not 100% on that detail.

Last thing I knew was it was on fanfiction . net and was a complete story.

EDIT: Thank you to Alpha_Wolf179 for the story title. Wasn't able to see your comment(s), but I was able to go off the "The S" in my phone notification and narrowed it down in my bookmarks.

EDIT #2: The story is called Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero by Joe6991.


** Finally found it, can't believe it took me so long lol. It's Harry Potter and The Sword of The Hero by joe6991, sorry for the no link I'm on mobile.

**** Wasn't able to see this comment until now. Thanks for the title. I had it, plus parts 2 and 3, bookmarked but either eyes kept skipping over it or mind telling me it wasn't that one. Now that this story has been found, I gotta track down another that I've been looking for over the past 3 months to no avail.

***** My app says there's 9 comments, but I only see 6. I see that happen quite a bit. Isn't that what happens when someone is shadow-banned?
