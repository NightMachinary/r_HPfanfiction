I have an iPhone 5s and I can't use the links that the bot makes. Which app lets me use them or do I have to be on browser?


** Apollo is the best app for iOS imo

** Narwhal I know let's you open them. But yeah in the official app, at least the last time I used it, you can't open links from the bot.

*** narwhal? I never heard of that app but I'm sure anything is better than the official Reddit I'm tempted to make a meme about how shitty it is
