** I mostly read fics in fandoms of new TV-shows I start (and when I have to wait another year till they release a new season.) My most recently joined fic fandoms are "Witcher" & "Umbrella Academy" (which are TV shows I recommend btw)

Generally I would recommend you the *Supernatural* fandom and the *Marvel* fandom because these two are really big and you are likely to find a lot of fics. (If you read Marvel btw I would rec you to not only focus on Avenger fics but also check out some Deadpool and Spidey and Venom fics.) Personally I read a lot of slashfics so if you want recs just ask me I got a few good fics bookmarked but I know that some people prefer het.

I guess you know Marvel don't know about Supernatural but Supernatural is a TV-show that's been around since 2005 and currently launches it's 15th (and last) season so you'll find a lot of fics. A/B/O trope is supposed to have been launched from there so it's pretty big. If you don't know either fandomy you can just read college Au's or so.

You could also try the Lotr/Hobbit fandom and Sherlock as well as Doctor Who. I haven't really read fics in an Anime fandom but generally I would just rec you to look into fandoms of TV-shows and movies you like and while the fandoms might be small you usually get things you are interested in.

If you want recs of any fandoms I mentiones just ask (Though I never read Doctor who and I only know a few crossover HP/Hobbit fics) Most likely my recs are slash

** Most of the things I like don't have much of a fanfiction fandom. Of course there's nothing as big as Harry Potter fanfiction fandom anyway. The only other fandom I've really enjoyed is the The Vampire Diaries /The Originals /Legacies fandom. It doesn't take much imagination to do crazy imaginative things with that material(similar to Harry Potter).
