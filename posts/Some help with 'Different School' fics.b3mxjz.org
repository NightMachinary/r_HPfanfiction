:END:
Hey guys, I'm looking for any 'Harry goes to a different school' fics that you can recommend.

Anything well written, Het, Slash or Gen is fine so long as it is well written.

Starts at a different school instead of Hogwarts, transfers or leaves for a different school, incomplete is fine so long as it has at least a few chapters.

Thanks all!

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

** I'd recommend /An Aunt's Love/ by Emma Lipardi. Warning: the different school is a non-magical school. It's long, but very good. At this point, updates are very rare but I still enjoy re-reading it.

**** Yeah sure. I can't remember the VERY beginning, but he stays at the Dursley's a few years and I can't rmembwr if he runs away or they just dump him somewhere, he is quite morbid and retaliates violently when threatened, takes a little girl under his wing at the orphanage and encourages her to be adopted by other people. There's a headmistress from an elite school who could feel his magic and gave him a place at the school based in Avalon (I think) with accelerated programs and lots of students with creature backgrounds. Come the triwizard they essentially force their way into the competition. An older student adopts Harry to stop other students trying to get close to him. I can't remember how it comes about but Harry at voldemort end up together. I enjoyed it, so you might enjoy it also :)
