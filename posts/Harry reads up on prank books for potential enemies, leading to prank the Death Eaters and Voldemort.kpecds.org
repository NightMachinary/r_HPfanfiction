** It was quite a surprise when the Dark Lord Voldemort's cause of death was found to be from a badly treated concussion after slipping on a banana peel not once---but twice.

And in an alternate universe, the Dark Lord was smashed in the face with a pie, unfortunately he suffered a severe allergic reaction to one of the ingredients and he died shortly thereafter.
