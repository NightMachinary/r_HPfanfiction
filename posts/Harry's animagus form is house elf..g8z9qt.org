Harry worked like slave all his life so it is natural that his animagus form is house elf. He can teleport like house elf through wards, can spy on death eaters etc.


** In all honesty this would make sense.

*** Eh, not really. Harry being treated like a house elf by the Dursley's is mostly fanon

Really? So its normal to make a kid less than 11 yr old to be living under th stairs, making breakfast and doing all chores in the house as long as he is "well-adjusted"?

​

EDIT - I was quoting the comment above mine, don't know what went wrong!

***** Did you mean to reply to me? I'm confused.

But yes, that's what I mean by saying it's fanon. Harry doesn't do all the chores in the house in canon. He definitely doesn't get never ending lists of things he has to do without food or water, or he'll get beaten. Never happens. We see him cooking for the Dursley's a grand total of once, IIRC, when he's helping Petunia on Dudley's birthday.

I have no idea what the editor picked up. Sorry about that! And I did reply to you.

The house elf comment is really for the kid living under the stairs. Now that you mention it, I don't think we've seen Harry doing chores all that much in canon. Vernon asked Dudley to get the post initially in SS, which means that Harry may or may not be the house elf in the literal sense.

****** He was given all of Dudley's old clothes (while house elves don't get articles of clothing, the ‘clothes' they do wear are tattered), they don't remember his own birthday in CoS “The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake”. The only reason he gets a bedroom in SS is most likely because the letters were addressed to the cupboard. Although, he gets Dudley's old room which is filled with broken toys. In the CoS, he taunts Dudley even after Dudley was verbally making fun of him for not having friends, and this is what Aunt Petunia did: “Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.”

After the whole dessert exploding incident in the CoS, Vernon put bars on his window, and “He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in the room around the clock.”

This was only the first two books.
