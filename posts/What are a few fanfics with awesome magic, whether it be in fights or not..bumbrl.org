** I like 0800 Rent A Hero for it's fascinating use of divination. Not so much combat magic, but the author basically added a ton of depth to a topic that had basically none in canon. linkffn(11160991)

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** I greatly enjoy how linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) plays with runes and rituals. While it is perhaps nots the best way of doing so, the writer certainly makes it work. The way she does tattoos is an awesome plus.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** I have two to suggest. Both are Hermione/Severus, fyi.

The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]] by Caeria. The Arithmancy in this is awesome. The author got relatively deep into theory of magic type stuff, and the fantastic question "When is a potion not a potion?" is asked (and answered).

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3711288/1/A-Proper-Romance][A Proper Romance]] by Keryl Raist. Not quite as awesome, but the magic is still fascinating because of how academic Hermione gets with it -- she teaches wandless magic and it merges with Buffy the Vampire Slayer in interesting ways.

** I really liked The Art of Self-Fashioning for self transfiguration as well as animal transfiguration.

linkao3(5103614)

I know I'll get downvotes just for this, but HPMOR had a pretty good transfiguration system as well. It's not consistent with canon, but I still found it very well thought out.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13217021/1/Tales-From-Durmstrang-Poisoned-Bloodlines]]

In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy to kill it once and for all.
