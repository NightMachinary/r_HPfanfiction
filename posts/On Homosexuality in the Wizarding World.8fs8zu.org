As a person who reads a lot of slash, it's natural that I would see many vastly different depictions of the Wizarding World's reaction to homosexuality. In some cases, it is widely accepted, with reasons ranging from the possibility of male pregnancy to contempt for Muggles and the idea that if Muggles don't like something, then it must be good. In other stories, the exact opposite is true: the Wizarding World detests homosexuality, citing it as unnatural and dirty, and is shocked when Harry (it's usually Harry) is revealed to be gay.

There are many areas of the magical universe that are vague enough in canon to allow fans to largely invent whatever they want, and these (e. g. magical literature) can be discussed entirely in the hypothetical, since canonical evidence is not, for the most part, specific enough to support one theory over another. However, homosexuality in the Wizarding World is not one of the latter, as I will attempt to prove in this weird informal essay-ish thing.

To begin with, we see that children are highly important in Pureblood society (I'll be focusing mainly on Pureblood society here because it is fairly clear through the lack of general resistance to Voldemort and acceptance of high-status Death Eaters after the war that most middle-class witches and wizards tend to imitate their “betters”, either out of fear or respect). This is shown in the histories of two Pureblood wizards: Draco Malfoy and Sirius Black.

Draco Malfoy, on one end of the spectrum, is endlessly spoiled by his parents. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy's chief traits are those of indulgence; from doing their best to have a creature who hurt Draco killed to lying to the Dark Lord himself in exchange for a scrap of information regarding their son's whereabouts, the Malfoys' first priority is demonstrated again and again to be Draco's well-being.

This becomes striking when compared to the attitude of other, non-Pureblood wizarding families: Arthur Weasley rarely harbors objections to his children fighting in a war, and even Molly Weasley's protectiveness stretches, for the most part, only to her daughter. Molly Weasley puts up a rather fierce resistance to Ginny's fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts, but doesn't seem to care much that her youngest son, only a year older, will be placing himself in just as much danger. While Molly shows few misgivings at her childrens' fight against an unstable, murderous psychopath, Narcissa Malfoy panics at the thought of her son facing off against an admittedly powerful but kindly and benevolent headmaster.

In the fourth book of the series, Draco brags of his mother fighting tooth and nail against his transfer to Durmstrang, a European wizarding school with a sympathetic headmaster. The Weasleys' kids, on the other hand, are spread out across the world in high-risk professions such as working with dragons and Curse-breaking.

This is not to say that the Weasleys don't care about family values, nor to imply that Lucius and Narcissa are better parents than Molly and Arthur. Rather, some (unfortunately necessary) extrapolation leads to the conclusion that, for Purebloods, children are simply more treasured than they may be for other classes of Wizarding society (especially since Purebloods seem to have fewer children overall, limiting themselves to one or two).

Now, the relevant part of the argument: same-sex couples cannot naturally have children (barring male pregnancy, which I'm going to disregard for the purpose of this essay since I'm trying to stick, as much as I can, to canon). While adoption is a possibility, the relevance of blood in Pureblood society implies that this would not be seen as a positive alternative.

What are we left with?

A society highly resembling that of Muggles that, because of the emphasis on blood purity and family traditions, is even more opposed to romantic unions that won't produce children than Muggles were for most of our history.

As for “blood traitors” (who tend, from what we have seen, to be societal outcasts), they may be far more forgiving of homosexuality as a whole, perhaps even as a direct response to Purebloods' intolerance. For other families, who are in neither of the categories (the Diggorys, the Changs, etc), their stance probably depends more on personal views rather than political ones, and therefore varies more harshly from person to person.

TL;DR: No, the Malfoys would not have been supportive of Draco dating Harry, even in a skewed alternate reality where that has any chance of happening.

If you disagree with any of my points, feel free to comment! I'd love to discuss.

Edit: okay, so my argument is as follows:

Value on children (esp. as heirs) more than seems average in WW (people send children to school where they can be injured/killed and allow them to fight in war) --> emphasis on children for family values --> families that can't have children considered improper --> homosexuality not accepted.


** This got me thinking about how large the wizarding families we know of are.

James Potter - 1

Sirius Black - 2

Narcissa/Bellatrix/Andromeda - 3

Cedric Diggory - 1

Draco Malfoy - 1

Weasleys - 7 - but specifically called out as unusual by Malfoy

Dumbledore - 3

Nymphadora - 1 - unmentioned siblings maybe possible, but unlikely

Delacours - 2

Greengrass - 2 - possible unmentioned siblings

Now if you ask me, this looks like a /society that has undergone the demographic transition/. But what are the hypothesized causes of the demographic transition? Low infant mortality. Education of women. Education in general. Wizarding medicine is very very good. Hogwarts is /old/. Hufflepuff /takes the rest/. Sex differences in physical prowess are mostly irrelevant for witches and wizards.

What if the wizarding world has /had a sub-replacement birth rate for a thousand years/? Maybe that's why the population is so small -- it's sustained only by the continuous influx of new muggleborns.

my guess is child labor laws and the cost of education. Sure Hogwarts is free but the required materials are not and wizards like the Weasleys need to buy second hand stuff.

So children are only going to cost money and cant support the family for quite a while and keeping them out of Hogwarts has them either become a uneducated worker who barely can afford to support himself, or requires families to hire tutors for them(probably more expensive then Hogwarts), or to teach them themselves when they could spend time working and earning money.

So it makes sense just for economical reasons to limit your number of children and magic should make contraception easily available for the majority.

They also have better health care in generals and a longer life expectancy meaning if you have a child you can become quite certain it will survive well into adulthood.

** Not commenting about wizarding views on homosexuality but I think it is a mistake to equate Victorian morals/values to wizarding values. The wizarding world isn't "old fashioned" compared to our modern world, they went down a completely different social progression then muggles. You can't assume that just because they have a traditional Victorian aesthetic that they have a Victorian society.

The canon wizarding world is already much more gender egalitarian then the victorian world, or even the modern world. The wizarding world has had their first female minister of magic hundreds of years ago... Compared to the muggle world, the wizarding world is incredibly progressive in a lot of ways.

My headcanon is that most muggle prejudices and biases are not very prominent in the wizarding world. Things like sexism and racism are something that barbaric muggles practice. They mostly substitute their own fantastical racism and prejudice for muggle prejudices.

** I tend to view the wizarding world as being very anachronistic, and pull a lot of my head canons on society based on a mix of Victorian and Elizabethan ideas (only because they're the aesthetics I see drawn from most). In Elizabethan England, specifically, their was a certain tolerance of homosexual behavior, as long as one married and had children as well. Men and women had ‘very close friends' and nobody would bat much of an eye about it. So I tend to write the world from that perspective. It's still not openly accepting of gay relationships, but you're not likely to experience violent homophobia.

** When you have things like polyjuice potion available I don't think it's too far fetched to assume the magical world has magical ways around the natural limits of biology. Even muggles have ready access to artificial insemination and it would likely be even simpler to achieve with magic available. Barring actual mpreg, two males could possibly contribute genetic material to grow in a surrogate womb or something like that. Ultimately I'd expect magicals to look down on muggles for their inability to do what they can and for their religious hangups on the subject.
