** Its mentioned that they can be but you have to truly feel remorse for what you have done. Which is said to be extremely painful. And they're considered evil because the only way to make them is premeditated cold blooded murder canonically. So self defense is out and while heat of the moment killing my tear ones soul it will heal in time especially if the person regrets the kill.

** I've always equated your soul to your humanity, the more you rip it apart, the more humanity you lose. (Which would be why LV didn't look like a human when he came back) Our humanity is what separates us from say, animals. Emotions, primarily, with it. The more of your humanity you tear apart and put away into the containers, the less you can feel, which would make feeling remorse to heal your soul harder and harder. Again, just my thoughts on it.

** The way I see it to create one you have to go completely against your morals just for the sake of immortality. That's also what I feel makes Voldemort's seven horcruxes so bad, he has to do increasingly bad stuff to be able to create more. Like if for example for the first he just had to murder a random student, well for the next one it would have to be his own family, the one after he would have to something even worse which means that his last one would be extremely evil.

** My headcanon is that to make a horcrux you have to intentionally do something as evil as manslaughter. BUT yo make another one you have to do something worse...and worse...and worse.

Repairing a torn soul is unlikely because you are purposely discarding the bits of yourself that might be capable of feeling remorse I bathe first place.

** The fact that it requires a murder to create a horcrux is what makes it evil.
