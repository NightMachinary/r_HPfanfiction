I don't remember where I read this but the premise was that Harry was some underestimated student in Slytherin with a different name. Then there was something about Voldemort somehow summoning Harry to him and Harry kills a muggle in front of them. I know this sounds pretty vague but the name is slipping my mind.

Oh and I'm pretty sure it was a slash fic

*** No I'm pretty sure he was in slytherin, he just had a different name and everyone just thought he was a muggleborn and just wrote him off as helpless. However i'm pretty sure the muggle was someone ho was horrible to him at the orphanage

hope that helps
