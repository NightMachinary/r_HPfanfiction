I've waited for ages to check again for some and it's been a year, two actually and I can't find any? I get how some people didn't love the crimes of Grindelwald but it has endless fanfiction possibilities.

Personally I would love a fanfiction where's Grindelwald uses his and Dumbledore's blood (assuming both of their blood is in the blood pact thing.) and make a kid and the kid does something like become Newts appreciate...I dunno where that was going... ANYWAY

have I been searching in the wrong place? Can anyone recommend some good longer ones if they do exist? Just m Newt collecting magical creatures for 500,000 words would be cool.


** Don't know if these will work. If they don't search under movies for Fantastic Beasts...

*** Is there something to search for it cause I can't find any on ffn and I'm always wary of ao3 because it's not always the highest quality and I find myself sorting though just straight up porn and bad writing.

** I found both those films horrible, and I'm fairly certain I'm not the only one. That might have something to do with it.

**** Agreed. They do add depth to the HP universe. However, McG's presence in the second one killed it for me. She's like -8 years old. Fucking retcon... ü§®

***** Yeaaah they did try to go very heavy handed with certain aspects. I like the additions of Jude law as Dumbledore he really fills the role were portrayed in the books just younger, Newt himself is a great character and I quite like his depth but yeah the movies themselves. Not great.

***** Yesss I know I've been looking into what's going on with all the canon things and it's weird. My main one is Newt disarming Grindelwald in new York yet not being the master of the elder wand. It's the same thing as Harry getting the wand from Malfoy by taking his normal wand.

But I do love Newt as a character just sad they are steering away from him and focusing on Grindelwald and Dumbledore. Both interesting characters but what makes the whole thing so unique and original is Newt in the first place.

****** I'm honestly more concerned by the broader strokes. MACUSA or how that's called should either not exist or be some kind of French/Spanish colony. The mere existence of anything resembling the US as it is in our world makes no sense since the worlds diverged in 1692 and at that point, the English colonies were significantly smaller than the ones which rebelled in the late 18th century. There would have been no Louisiana purchase, no acquisition of Florida and therefore nothing which could have threatened Mexico/Spanish North America in 1848. Nevermind that most factors which allowed the various independence movements to succeed are irrelevant with magic. The French Empire could deploy its entire Auror force to put down a colonial revolt and be home for lunch rather than shipping regiments across the ocean for months.

******* There's a whole explanation of the founding of magical America on the wizarding world page. It explains everything neatly I'll like the pages so you can take a look. It answers everything there but to be fair to JK and a little heads up for myself practically nothing is taught about US history in the UK so I'm not sure of about 90% of what you said, sorry I can't be more help.

******** None of the history makes any sense. The worlds separated in 1692, which should not mean an independence movement. And at that time, England controlled very little of America, so why the hell were they used as a model? Why did magical Spain and France suddenly lose all their territory? Why was there suddenly a spirit of unity when all those people had been happy fighting each other for centuries, be it natives vs natives or English vs French.

If you were to ask Spanish, French or English colonists around that time, they would have identified as that, or maybe by town of origin (town in Europe that is), not as American, and most certainly not as the same nationality as those who had been their mortal enemies a few months ago.

********* We don't even know if magical Spain or Fance were even in America, it sounds like a few British magicals came over in the Mayflower (that was the original ship right?) And that other magicals came from all over Europe as most were running or fleeing. So I guess I'm filling in the gaps when every magical came together slowly to form MACUSA to protect themselves.

Honestly I don't know anything about anything to do with US history so I'm just going with your right. They'll probably address these concerns at some point...
