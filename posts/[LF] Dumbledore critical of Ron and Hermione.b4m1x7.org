In Rise of the Wizards, Dumbledore regrets encouraging Harry being friends with the Weasleys because of Ron and his laziness and Hermione because she smothers his drive to learn/curiosity. Are there any other fanfiction like that?


** I don't think I've ever come across a story like the one you're describing. If anything, Dumbledore having a hand in fostering any of Harry's childhood friendships, regardless of how limited, would likely play into the Manipulative Old Bastard trope just as much as his endorsement of the Trio's relationship.

*** While I agree, I can also see the point of view that being friends with Ron and Hermione stifled Harry's intellectual curiosity. One is (commonly in fanfiction) not terribly interested in finding out what he doesn't know and the other finds out everything for them and doesn't make them figure it out for themselves.

*** I didn't say intentionally. And to be honest his study habits in later years weren't really addressed in detail. And while canon hermione is a decent if flawed character, I always felt her flaws weren't addressed in canon. She's loyal, intelligent, but also a bit close-minded and has a bit of a jealous streak. Ron may have abandoned Harry at two points, but he doesn't deserve violence in his relationship.

** That goes so far into fanon that there probably is a story like that. Since none of the three are anything like that.

*** It's not canon, but it's a logical extension of their personalities. Mind I'm interested in a good Dumbledore who tries manipulates Harry for Harry's benefit.

**** A manipulative albus is a perversion, not an extension of his personality. He is a hands off guy.\\
Hermione tries to get them to study, so her stifling their desire to learn is also a perversion.\\
And Ron isn't lazy. He's just focused on different things.

***** Dumbledore manipulated Snape into protecting harry, using his guilt to do so. He manipulated Harry into getting Slughorn's memory. He was never completely honest with Harry, especially with him having to die. He kept Draco at Hogwart's despite him essentially being a danger of a cornered animal. He does so in Fantastic Beasts, getting Newt to try to get Credence as he is bound by non-interference. I'm not saying an evil manipulative Dumbledore, I'm saying a Dumbledore who tries to manipulate Harry to have a better life. A book recommendation here or there, how to handle the Dursleys. Hermione and Ron, despite fanfiction being contrary, are actually good friends of Harry. However, you are a product of your friends. Harry picks up closer to the study habits of Ron, and Hermione is a bit heavy-handed in her approach to getting them to study. Moreover, she actually does get a bit jealous of Harry beating her at potions in her sixth year. I'm trying for a more human cast. I want a Dumbledore who tries to help out a bit more during school years. I want a Hermione who gets confronted for her flaws, and a Ron who has to improve his work ethic.

*** 1. Dumbledore is protrayed as extremely manipulative throughout canon. He literally arranges Harry's life so that he'd willingly die for +our sins+ the chance to defeat Voldemort permanently. Dumbledore did this because he calculated that this willingness to die (without knowing he'd survive) would save Harry in the end. Dumbledore was right, but let's not just brush aside how manipulative a person would need to be to pull this off. Even a hardened former Death Eater like Snape was horrified when he finally understood Dumbledore'd plans for Harry.

2. These interpretations of Ron and Hermione are valid (to an extent). Harry certainly stops being quite so awed with the magical world after making friends with Ron, and being lazy and wanting Hermione to pull more than her fair weight during homework sessions is canon.

I don't think canon Dumbledore disapproved of their friendship, because he wanted Harry to have what little happiness that was within his reach. It is the Resurrection Stone that kills him, not the Elder Wand, because Dumbledore's great flaw is that his heart is too soft, not too hard. I'll reiterate that doing something manipulative while regretting it all the while doesn't make you not manipulative.

**** I love your analysis. I think it's correct for the most part. It's just that a good Dumbledore trying to help Harry from afar is something I haven't read much. Maybe he gets Harry to help Luna, which leads to the deathly hallows as well as opening Harry's mind to new thoughts as well as stopping her bullying. Maybe he tells Molly that Ron needs to work to his potential. He starts encouraging teachers to be a bit harsh whenever Hermione screws up (violence/over-confidence/arrogance). A heartbreak is no reason to attack a friend, and confunding an innocent to cheat for a friend is also wrong. Maybe he intervenes when Neville/Ron are forced to use hand-me-down wands. Maybe he audits a class by Snape and fixes his attitude (a lack of trust makes it harder to protect Harry).

***** These are all interesting suggestions for a fanfic, and I'd definitely read a fic with this sort of Dumbledore in it. But in canon, Draco Malfoy literally gets away with attempted murder, so I don't really see Hermione's actions as too terrible when we see what the student antagonists get away with.
