I was reading something recently, can't remember what (been reading a lot lately), and it had a scene Harry, upon learning from Ollivander that the wand that worked best for him was the brother of Voldemort's wand, decided that he didn't want it.

So he broke it over his knee.

Looking for more of this sort of thing. Not just Harry with another wand, but Harry knowingly /choosing/ to get another one because he doesn't want that one.

Because really, who hears "You know that guy that killed your parents? He had the brother wand to this" and /keeps it?/ The best explanation is Harry not wanting anything to do with Voldemort, either for the reasons I listed or because he's trying to avoid being "The-Boy-Who-Lived".

Don't really care for the reason, I just want Harry to knowingly and willingly choose to get a different wand.


** Ollivander would be crying, screaming "THE WAND CHOOSES THE WIZARD!"

*** From what I remember of the fic I'm referencing he was quite annoyed that Harry broke it. So was everyone else that was present. Although I think that was more the wand snapping in general, not the brother-wand bit.

** I've read fics where harry rejects it bc it only works for part of him(the horxrux but) but not one where he rejects it for its link to voldemort

*** Wish I could remember what I was reading. It was an odd Harry, and he ended up buying one off a pushy American dealer I think. Snape was not amused. I think it was that fic where he names Hedwig "Voldemrot".

Okay, I remembered I shared a bit of that fic with on a discord server I'm on, so I should be able to put a link to the screenshot [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/624447304849686531/691224572867117066/unknown.png][here]]. Finding this fic isn't the point of this post, so I'm not asking for it, but I /think/ that's the fic I'm referencing.

Anyway, back on topic: I just think it's an interesting idea, where Harry rejects the wand because of the connection. Why would he want to carry around a reminder of the guy who killed his parents? How weird and morbid is /that/?

** I don't really remember the name of the fic.... But I think there was a time travel one in which Harry got the wand again and suddenly hated it for it being the brother wand and the wand died or something right there in the shop...

*** That sounds like what I'm after. Harry /choosing/ to get a different wand. Because why would you want to carry a reminder of the guy that killed your parents and made you an orphan?

** OMG, I've been thinking about this fic lately, but couldn't remember what it was. I remember him saying something like, "There! Now Voldemort's wand is an only child, like me." And then he goes on essentially a world-wide search for a wand because he can't find another that will choose him.

+If anyone knows, please remind me the name of this fic.+

Found it! "Voldemrot" was the search term I needed. The fic is So Sue Me by LunaKatrina linkffn(3003214)
