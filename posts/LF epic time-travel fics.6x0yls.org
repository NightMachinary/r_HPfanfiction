Looking for Harry-centric time travel fics like linkffn(a long journey home by rakeesh) and linkffn(the wizard from earth by morta's priest).

If you haven't read these fics, they are time travel fics where Harry is sent back to ancient civilization and has to live through history before returning to the present. A Long Journey Home features a female Harry Potter. Both are incomplete but well written. I think the Wizard from Earth is abandoned but ALJH updates about once or twice a year.

I prefer Harry-centric fics but all recs are welcome.

Thanks!


** Well, the low hanging fruit here is mentioning Joe's stuff (wastelands of time, Hero trilogy).

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

**** A few H/G stories for your consideration then:

The first two are the more abnormal fics the others are the normal Harry sends himself back in time.

Amulet of Time 1: The Age of the Founders is the first of 4 completed stories with a fifth that's incomplete but kind of stand alone so it doesn't matter. All four are in the 80k word range. Linkffn(844334)

Destiny Redefined is a great tale about Harry wanting to try to change the outcome of the war but ultimately being unsuccessful even though he goes back several times. Its a good story that explores alternate time lines. linkffn(3928184).

Backwards with Purpose is Backwards with Purpose its legendary its one of the best fics ever written even though its Harry/Ginny. linkff(4101650)

Harry Potter and the Time mage is one of the oldest "Harry sends his mind back to his younger self" stories and its one of the only ones that was completed. It has several good bits of writing in it, but can be a bit too Harry/Ginny at times. linkffn(2114097)

Erasing the Future is the best and longest "Harry sends his mind back to his younger self" in progress story. It is updated STILL just VERY slowly and once again it can get very Harry/Ginny at times. linkffn(2833136)

You did say you didn't have a preference regarding ships... lol

I started reading it a couple weeks ago and stopped at the second chapter when Harry just walks into the Burrow like an asshole, Dumbledore shows up, and then Harry immediately tells Dumbledore everything like he was the most pompous ass to ever walk the Earth.

** You'll probably like linkffn(10709411).

It's not completed, but is still rather long, I feel like it's coming to a head soon-ish. Maybe a year or so left before it's completed. Harry is flung back in time by millennia and participates in historical moments at times. Pretty interesting. No romance except for one sentence about 200k words in that the author added to get people off his back. Only other thing is that the author is not a native English speaker and it shows in his work, you get used to it.
