I feel like this fandom seriously lacks dystopian, dark fics; and i feel it's a shame, because magic could be used to make incredibly dystopian societies. When you have the Imperius, Obliviation, and numerous others spells at your disposal, creating a lasting tyrant regime would be much easier then in the muggle world.

The possibilities of having the MC escape secret police, play dangerous political games, and generally try to save society are endless.

What do you think?


** Isn't canon year 7 a dystopia? Not that years 5 and 6 are far from one, either.

*** They definitively are a dystopia, by our standards.

What i meant is that it could have much, much worse. What happens in the books also can happen in the muggle world. But we cannot have mind-controlling technology (atleast not yet) nor obliviate spells. But wizards do.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512582/1/Keep-Your-Enemies-Closer][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - The fic begins in Harry's 6th year. After Voldemort wins he immediately begins reshaping wizarding Britain to his ideal vision.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/][Mi Aedijekit]] - Set thousands of years after Voldemort has won. The technomagically advanced nation he now rules can't remember that Britain was ever without an immortal dictator to rule it. (This is a new fic and hasn't reached the meat of its plot yet, but I think you might enjoy it because it has the same central pairing as 'The Philosopher King'.)

Also, why is wizards ruling over muggles a bad thing? Adds to the dystopian feel, in my opinion; also maybe due to the fact that the wizard overlords secretly have quite a few bastard children with muggles, over time non-magical humans become more and more rare?

** It depends on what you qualify as a dystopia frankly. If you take a somewhat loose definition, then most of canon certainly qualifies with the imbalance of wizard activities related to muggles (one gets the impression low level harrassment is much more common by the wizarding population than just the blood purists).

There are quite a few fics I can think of that have various dystopian worlds setup - here are just a few examples linkffn(Beyond the Curtain by Bobika; The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5; Reign of the Serpent; Prince of the Dark Kingdom; The Pureblood Pretense; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw; Hogwarts Battle School; Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma; The Legacy Preservation Act).

What you'll notice is practically all of them qualify as dystopias. But the thing is a dystopian society is one based around some sort of injustice being applied to part or all of society. That is ridiculously common in fiction, partly because that is ridiculously common in real life and partly due to the fact that there is an extreme range of variability for "injustice in society."

I think what you are really asking is: why aren't there more fics that depict a society like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Oceania][Oceania]] in Nineteen Eighty-Four? That good sir can be answered quite simply with 1) that does not mesh well with the tone/style of Harry Potter in general (even the really bad things essentially are all brief and/or offscreen) and 2) it takes a lot of time and effort to create and set up such a dystopia, to really think about both the society and how it would work, which is often well beyond the threshold of most authors (it is for fun after all, not work).

You have institutionalized slavery, magic used to bound people to the state (worldwide), civil wars, truly fucked up gender mechanics and so on and so forth... it's one of the most terrifying worlds in all of fandom.

***** I'm sorry if it's not what you're hoping for as a description, but I am terrible regarding what I consider to be spoilers (that's what my husband says at least, when I don't watch movie trailers with him...).

In the first book Harry learns to live in this society and we learn about how it works. Harry attracts negative attention.

In the second book, we learn more about the problems of the society, their origins and their possible solutions. Also, Harry plans to change the current situation.

In the third book, Harry's revolution. Voldemort's war (he's not the main event, but he has a nice subplot).

I'm not sure how accurate this is, the last time I've read it was almost a year ago. This is the general gist of it...

** Well, this story isn't truly the "dystopia" you might imagine, but Emperor by Marquis Black is actually pretty close. Coz while it doesn't focus in the wizarding world taking over the muggles, it does focus in the wizarding world being influential enough to take over the muggles. One of the best stories ever, though drawn out at times, and more importantly, incomplete for the near, or even far, future.

** Unto Their Own by CRMediaGal linkffn(9681003) and Princess of Gryffindor by Aurette linkffn(5490903) are two of my favorite "Voldemort won" stories, by two of my favorite authors in general. They're both Severus/Hermione though, and I know it's an unpopular pairing on this subreddit, so fair warning.

*** To me, it's not the pairing but the usual characterisation and dynamic present in these fics.

There are quite a few fics of this kind, that have Snape and/or Draco and/or Lucius and/or some other Death Eater sheltering or taking possession of Hermione once Voldemort wins. The problem is that Hermione is usually portrayed as innocent, careless, and flighty; whereas the DE is portrayed as mature, wise, cool-headed, meticulous, and powerful. And, the fic itself is less about trying to resist the new regime---except when Hermione's impulsive, poorly thought-out, inept, and ultimately futile attempts create trouble for the DE, opportunities for the DE to rescue her from danger she had gotten herself into, and to chide her for it---and more about angst and some sort of a Harlequin romance with a side of Stockholm Syndrome.

Not that there is anything wrong if you are into that sort of thing.

Does this apply to the two fics you've recommended? My general sense is that the Snape pairings tend to portray Hermione as mature and powerful far more often than the other Hermione/DE fics.

** Sadly, I think a lot of HP fanfic writers going for dark wizarding worlds go for (Edge) Lord Potter setups, which are totally fine, just not my cup of tea. A lot of Marauders era fics have dystopian air to them, and they're usually pretty well written. I don't know how to do links on here & I can't think of names off the top of my head, but there was a series of one-shots focusing on the bystanders and reluctant participants of the first Wizarding War that really captured that air well.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** I would like to add another Voldemort Wins dystopia. It's short but extremely dark and disturbing. I hate this Voldemort and his Harry so much that I would like to skin them myself.It's actually quite rare for me to feel this kind of hatred when reading a fanfic. As portioned from a whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6524323/chapters/14925616][As Portioned from a Whole]]

A large portion of well-written harrymort/tommarry,rare as they are,are dystopia. Past Enemies. Future dark kingdom fic. Darker than Prince of the dark kingdom. Much lighter than As portioned from a whole because muggles are left untouched.

  A true single point of departure leads to a world without Harry. Changes compound- and no one is safe.
