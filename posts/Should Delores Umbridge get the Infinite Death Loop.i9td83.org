I'm making a JoJo/Harry Potter Fanfic and wondering if I should "Diavolo" Umbridge


** I don't know enough about JoJo, but it does sound like an infinite punishment for finite crimes, which is probably unjust.

*Edit:* On further thought, /if/ she is responsible for someone being kissed by a dementor, /and/ being kissed by a dementor prevents one from passing into the Potterverse afterlife, /then/ (and only then) that may well be an infinite crime. (That still doesn't necessarily mean that an infinite punishment is justified, but it's a better case for one.)

**** It is still finite

There is no justice possible with infinite punishment

**** Death, no matter how messy or miserable, is still a finite punishment. The OP seems to be proposing an infinite one.

**** Riddle did receive an infinite punishment. He is trapped in limbo forever. Arguably, his crime was also infinite, since he attempted to become immortal.

**** OK. Let's take, for example, Hitler.

Suppose that you can make him suffer, a thousand times over, the death of every person for whose death he was even indirectly responsible, as they have suffered. In addition to that, make him observe a reality (perhaps embellished over our own) of everything that he had hoped to achieve failing, again, a thousand times over. He will experience literally trillions of years of physical and emotional suffering.

Would that be enough of a punishment?

It would still be infinitely smaller than any actual infinite punishment.
