Are there any fics out there that have the roles flipped? As in, Tom Riddle was always good and is actually a freedom fighter. The Dursleys are nice and decent people. Dumbledore is the spawn of Satan bashers write him as?

I'm not looking for bashing fics. I honestly want a fic that flips everything around. Are there any of those out there??


** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) scrambles those characters' roles around in very interesting ways.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

*** Thanks! I don't think I've read two of those.

I have read Reverse. And the fact that the main characteristic described of evil swapped Hermione and Ginny is that they are more sexually active is.... it makes me roll my eyes really hard.

And it's not finished! ;o;

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
