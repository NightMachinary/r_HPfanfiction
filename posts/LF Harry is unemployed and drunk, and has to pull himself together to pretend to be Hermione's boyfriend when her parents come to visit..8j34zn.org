I read this fic a long time ago. Post Hogwarts where Harry is disillusioned with life, Ron and Luna are together and Hermione convinces Harry to pretend when her parents visit.

It also has Luna and Hermione helping Harry regain control of his magic.

Thanks!

*** Thanks! It's not this one. But this isn't a fic I've read before, so adding it to my list :)

The only thing I vaguely remember is the fic starting with Harry and Ron playing some stupid game. Sorry I can't remember more details!

  When Hermione called him asking for a favor, his stupid reply had been, "Sure 'Mione anything," and apparently anything meant pretending to be her husband for a week...
