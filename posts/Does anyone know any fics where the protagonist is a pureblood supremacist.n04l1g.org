Does anyone know any fics where the protagonist is a pureblood supremacist?


** A pretty decent portion of Slytherin Harry fics range from Death Eater apologism to outright "Voldemort is a Dumbledorian shill"

** There is a story by The Dark Wolf Shirou whose name I forgot. The MC is a but of a pureblood supremacist I think. But it is a but of a semi crossover with The Witcher and Lucifer.

  A Death Eater's wife, Draco's mother, Bellatrix's sister and the witch who made an Unbreakable Vow with Severus - but who was Narcissa really? Canon-compatible, (books 1-7) following Narcissa from her seventh year at Hogwarts in 1972 through to the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. All chapter titles are named after constellations and their myths. Complete.

** So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

#+begin_quote
  HP/LV Slow Burn. Major AU. Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
