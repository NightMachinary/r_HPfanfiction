:END:
I'm looking for a HP fanfiction, that I read about a year ago. Don't know the name or author, just some parts of the plot. HP somehow gets to an other dimension, where Potters are alive, that dimension's HP is a huge prat, Neville is the BWL, Sirius and Remus have a son. I also remember that HP is really good at ancient runes and gets his OWLS and NEWTS early and in later chapters teaches the subject together with the professor. Don't really know anything else. Someone help?
