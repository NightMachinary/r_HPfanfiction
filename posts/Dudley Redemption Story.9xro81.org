I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]] and some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]'s story about Dudley reconnect with Harry and become friend. I've also read some Nice!Dudley in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871][Blindness]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][HP & Psychic Serpent]].

Is there any other fic where Dudley become good friend with Harry, more than "Christmas card terms" in canon?

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** I feel a bit uncomfortable linking my own work these days, but this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]] one of mine features Dudley as a significant character. It's not exactly a redemption story but Dudley and Harry do reconnect in this and find some common ground.

** This is a time-travel fic, but in /Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone/, Dudley does end up friends with Harry. Granted, he's an adult in a child's body, but Dudley does try to right some of the wrongs he did to Harry when they were kids.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

  Dudley Dursley is determined to show he is better than his freak cousin. What better way than to show everyone what it means to be a Dursley? When his science teacher asks him to choose a research topic, his answer is genetics, specifically, inheritance. As his research advances, he's in for a rude awakening.
