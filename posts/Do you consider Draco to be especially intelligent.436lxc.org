I, like many am tired of the gazillion tropes surrounding Mr Malfoy such as Draco the Slytherin sex God, Draco in leather pants, Draco the suddenly best friends with Blaise and the list goes on. Yet while I've considered Draco the especially smart to also be a trope, a lot of (hopefully less biased) people seem to agree that it isn't OOC for him to be very smart. Do you agree with this or don't you? And if you do, please tell me why, but don't give a response that is basically "because I said so".


** Draco is never really shown to struggle with his schoolwork until 6th year when he devoted himself to fixing the cabinet (a task of unknown difficulty to us). The [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][wiki page]] on him is good for reminding us of the details though. He's skilled at Occlumency, which is not terribly easy. He must have done well on his OWLS, as he takes the NEWT classes in potions, transfiguration, and DADA. He picks up non-verbal magic early. And conjuring that snake in second year is apparently the sort of magic not generally taught until 6th, which is very impressive. Also, he eventually picks up alchemy as a hobby.

So, all of this points to him being quite intelligent. He probably doesn't have Hermione's natural brilliance, although even this is difficult to tell, because a lot of what makes Hermione so impressive is her work ethic, and Draco is not shown to be so dedicated to his academics.

**** Well, that's sort of true--but I would assume that most students aren't like Hermione, or she wouldn't be quite so impressive. Harry and Ron are shown to rely on her to check their essays a lot, Neville is just plain incompetent, a lot of the girls in their year are a tad ditsy...

By contrast, Draco is often talked about as being skilled at Potions (and he made it into the Potions NEWT, which takes very good grades) and he masters a lot of difficult magic at a normal if not slightly more rapid pace. He's driven and cunning, so even if he didn't apply himself to his grades I believe he would still strive for knowledge about things he cares about. I've always assumed him to be of higher intelligence.

***** I don't see this "great cunning" anywhere. He appears as a typical spoiled brat using his father's name and influence to get by. His ploys are so utterly stupid, they only work because everyone else seems to be rendered stupid for plot reasons - like his oh so cunning "I'm hurt terribly by this beast, I cannot play Quidditch right now" plan. And his "Potter stinks" plan should have backfired if JKR hadn't decided to write Dumbledore and McGonagall as some evil assholes who leave Harry out to dry and won't even protect him against such attacks.

****** They aren't written as evil assholes. Just because /we/ live in a society where teenagers run and cry to a teacher every time some kid /teases/ them, doesn't mean everyone does. Children in the wizarding world are often depicted as being more self-reliant.

They don't /tattle/, and when they /do/, nearly all of the adults expect them to work it out. Even nurturers like the Weasleys.

Consider all the /crap/ and torment Fred and George put a young Ron through. And the few times when they intervene beyond a "stop dat" is when it's a matter of life and death. Like when they were going to have him make the unbreakable vow.

Even when it progresses into the realm of "bullying", well that wasn't really a big deal in the early 90s (when Potter started at Hogwarts) anyway. People weren't as /sensitive/ then.

And even less so in the wizarding world. The things you named aren't "attacks", they're /childish teasing/ and considered quite normal.

If you have even an inkling of "suspension of disbelief", and you can accept that Hogwarts exists, then you're fully capable of accepting that the wizard children are a bit more resilient.

Once you've accepted that "well don't tattle, pull up your big boy pants and deal with it" is normal, then you can accept that "Potter stinks" badges and lying for sympathy and the problems these things cause for one kid don't really register high on any adult's radar. Sorry you're having a tough year, kid, but man up.

They weren't being evil, or assholes, they were being what passes for normal. Keep in mind too, this is a society where at some point since Argus Filch was old enough to remember (50s? 60s?) it was acceptable to punish children with manacles and whips.

They are actually /unbelievably/ nuturing, given the society which produced them.

Now that we understand the /ways/ in which the society works, we can look at Draco's actions within it.

Yes, knowing that people either won't believe, or won't dare contradict you, at 12-13 years old when you claim an injury, is a /little/ clever. Not the cleverest, but by no means stupid, either.

His "Potter stinks" plan was ingenuous. He wasn't only teasing the boy, he was doing so in a way that would not violate a single rule - he /could not/ be punished for it. And it was done in such a way that Harry would feel entirely isolated - the whole school /had/ to support Cedric, so even many who weren't against Harry would wear the badges simply to support /Hogwarts/.

He came up with the "Weasley is our King" song (which is rather clever, as far as wording) and used it in a highly effective manner to throw off not just Ron, but the entire Gryffindor team for /ages/.

Even at 11, just starting, most children who have influential parents know barely enough to say "Oh, well I will tell my Dad!" whereas Draco knew how to /wield/ his family's influence, effectively.

As far as education - Potions, under Snape, required an "O" on the O.W.L.S. - Snape himself admitted this was an extremely high standard. The O.W.L.S. aren't administered by the professors, but by a team of (old as hell) wizards from various places, and you've no way of knowing who will test you. Draco made mistakes, and he could not use his family name to cheat - the administers did not /care/. Still, he managed an "O" in Potions - which even Harry could not do. In fact there were very few who did make it.

#+begin_quote
  When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan
#+end_quote

Ravenclaws are typically the clever ones. Only 4 made it. The only Gryffindor, then who got an "O" was Hermione. (Harry and Ron got lucky with an "E" because the professor changed.)

I'd say that speaks more to his intelligence than anything, but lets carry on.

Speaking of O.W.L.S, Hermione got an "E" in Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Malfoy got an "O". He's more clever than her at /something/ even though he's shown goofing off while she grinds her nose to the books. He slips through the classes on his name, but he /aces/ the tests. Harry and Ron rely on their experience (often gained from luck). Draco doesn't have this. Hermione relies on constant study, and an insanely good memory. Draco doesn't study often (that we can tell). Yet he still manages to ace the O.W.L.S. presumably with some combination of knowledge and logic, which is actually quite clever.

Finally, no, not all students take N.E.W.T.S. Fred and George, for example, never intended to. They didn't have the O.W.L.S for them. There are many fifth years who aren't mentioned again in Book 6. And there are a /multitude/ of wizards mentioned who only got an O.W.L. or two in their time. N.E.W.T.S. require at least /passing/ grades. Neville got, I believe, 4. Charms, herbology, DADA, and Transfiguration. But his Transfiguration was only an A, and that does /not/ qualify you for N.E.W.T.S.

He got DADA only because of Dumbledore's Army lessons, and Charms and Herbology are considered "Pass" classes. Only complete morons miss those.

I think the misunderstanding here is when people don't realize how O.W.L.S work.

You "Get an O.W.L." by scraping by. Barely passing. Acceptable. (What would be a "D" in an American school, for example).

You get into a N.E.W.T. class with /good/ grades. Some require an "E" (exceeds expectations, loosely resembling a "B" in the USA) or an "O" (Outstanding - these are your Honor students)

Most people - wizards or otherwise - are average. "A"ccpetable. Not N.E.W.T. material. Your A and B students are N.E.W.T. worthy.

Draco /took/ 4. Even though he had tons of other stuff going on, he took 4. He could very well be eligible for more. After all, Hermione got 10 O and E O.W.L.S. and only took 7 N.E.W.T. classes. And she's an overachiever. Most of the wizard students whose classes/OWL levels are revealed /don't/ take all the N.E.W.T.S they can.

Harry and Ron each only got 7 O.W.L.S., (/failing/ 2 classes each) even with Hermione's help, and had enough for 4 N.E.W.T. classes (5 including the changed Potions requirement) Huh. With experience /and/ Hermione's help, they got about what Draco did - and his "help" was Crabbe and Goyle - two morons. And way less experience.

I'm not sure how anyone gets the idea that no students are struggling (unless people who have only seen the movies) because it's /specifically/ mentioned that even during /study/ for the exams, people regularly break down from the stress, and end up either in the infirmary, or sent home. When Harry is seeing Voldemort, they actually chalk it up to O.W.L.S, because it /is/ so common for wizarding students to struggle.

We don't usually see them struggling, because those students are rather irrelevant to the plot. But they do.

Finally, Draco got the drop on Harry, numerous times. He got /poison/ into Hogwarts, a feat which astounded everyone because it had never happened, /and/ they had more stringent security.

The necklace would have worked as well, since, if you recall, from the books, Filch was not at the entrance scanning for cursed items when Katie Bell was cursed, and it was only Luck that saved Dumbledore. If a friend hadn't grabbed for the package, Katie /could/ have walked it inside, handed it to Dumbledore (who, by the way, /does/ make mistakes) and said "Professor, do you know what this is?" to which his in-character reaction would have been to hold out his hands for the object, and immediately be cursed.

And no, Dumbledore had no way to tell Katie was under the Imperious curse. He did not recognize it in Rosemerta, and therefore would not have in Katie. It /was/ a good plan, and only luck kept the Headmaster alive.

Well, luck and Slughorn's love of booze.

I'd say coming closer than anyone ever to killing the most powerful wizard alive, while attending school, repairing a vanishing cabinet, fielding death threats from death eaters, and keeping up with classes, not to mention avoiding detection by the "chosen one" and not being caught until everything fell together at the end - well, I think that's pretty clever.

One again, you assume Draco got no help in school just because we didn't see it in the books - which were told from Harry's point of view.

Draco only ever got close with his assassination attempts because the victim himself was covering for him, and had Snape help him out. (Not to mention that the whole plot made Dumbledore evil and/or stupid again, since no competent good man would let a killer endanger students in his care - especially after the first time bystanders were almost killed. Draco should have been shut down, hard right then and there, if JKR hadn't wanted to ruin her characters.)

Except they don't. In the books - not the wiki, or the lexicon, or the movie, or the fanfics - but the actual books, the adults - teachers and parents alike, leave children to their own devices until it /is/ physically dangerous. All of them.

And actually, from a sociological standpoint, it makes sense as well. You see it with most societies where children need to learn /survival/ versus sitting in an office staring at a computer. Tribal societies, for example, as well as medieval ones. Hell, even in early American history.

"Sheltering" children and breaking up petty disputes is practically brand new. "Go work it out" is a model, that, whether or not it offends our modern sensibilities, has worked for years.

I "assume" Draco got no help in school because he is described in the books (especially 6th year) skulking the corridors - while everyone else is studying. Formulating pranks and plans - while everyone else is studying. Showing off - while everyone else is studying. In the room of requirement - while everyone else is studying.

He blatantly states that he doesn't bother with his homework, in no less than 3 of the books, and he spends his "down time" with Crabbe (moron) and Goyle (moron), oh and Pansy Parkinson (moron). He /has/ no one intelligent to help him.

Dumbledore /did not/ "cover for him", in the books. He was never /certain/ of anything. Unlike in the movies, It isn't until Harry brings him the final piece of the puzzle that everything starts clicking into place, and he knows it was Draco.

Dumbledore is far less "all knowing" in the books, but he isn't an idiot either. He doesn't know Rosemerta is under the imperious curse until Draco says it was her. He doesn't /know/ which student it was, and all he has to go on is the unsupported suspicions of another /child/ who hates Draco. And meanwhile there are several other possibilities - Crabbe and Goyle, for two, who are specifically listed as Death Eaters in books 5 through 7, and who have no alibis for the time when Katie Bell was attacked - while on the other hand, Draco does - he was not only in the school, he was with the Deputy Headmistress, Professor McGonagall at the time.

Snape did not know of any of the assassination attempts until after they failed (or succeeded) in the books. He /was/ aware of them after the fact, but then, if he so much as /told/ Dumbledore what he knew, he would drop dead. And Draco would be dead. And Dumbledore would die.

And yes, even with a single murderer loose in Hogwarts, (where no one died) it was safer than out in the wizarding world where multiple people were dying every single day. There were Death Eaters, Inferi, Dementors, and a raging lunatic of a werewolf out there. Hogwarts is safer.

In the /books/ (do people here actually read those?) Dumbledore couldn't have shut Draco down - /even if he could prove it was Draco/ - without Draco and his entire family being murdered.

And whether that makes Dumbledore (who was, /in any case/, a better man than most in the wizarding world) was a "good man" or not highly depends. Are you judging him by the society they live in? Or through your own world?

People "almost died" all the time in the wizarding world. Accidental spells, blown-up cauldrons. Quidditch. Ferocious animals. Each other. If you use today's standards, then yes, Draco should have been shut down the first time. And Quidditch banned. And Hagrid fired, and the forest sealed off, and Potions and DADA cancelled and Umbridge made Headmistress, so we can wrap the little darlings up in Contemporary layers of Safety, and leave them utterly helpless.

JKR didn't ruin her characters. Hollywood and "fans" may have, but in the context of /just the books/ it's all tied up rather nicely.

(Keep downvoting if you want, it doesn't make you correct. I'm sitting here /with/ the books, making well-reasoned, supported statements, and you're throwing out a paragraph of broad sweeping statements about the "series" supported only by opinion. Your votes don't affect me. Want to make an impression? Let's see evidence. :))

********* If Dumbledore didn't know it was Draco, then Snape, who knew about it, was inept, or a traitor, and Dumbledore would have been an idiot for trusting Snape either way. And even if Snape was unable to tell Dumbledore, Dumbledore could have found out who was the culprit simply by having Snape read the minds of the usual suspects - a short list which Draco would lead, and then conclude that it has to be him when Snape can't tell him anything about him.

And yes, he could and should have shut down Draco - the Malfoys were Death Eaters working for Voldemort. I know people like to white-wash Death Eaters, but to demand that the Malfoys are saved at the cost of innocents goes a bit too far. Sacrificing them to prevent Katie from getting cursed, or Ron and Slughorn from getting poisened would have been the right choice to take. Protecting Draco made Dumbledore an evil man.

And once again: We don't see what Draco is up to - we only see him when he's antagonizing Harry. Book 6 doesn't really count since he was working to save his family and kill Dumbledore, and focused on that instead of on school work.

********** Dumbledore knew that Draco was going to try to kill him. That is all. He also knew that Snape was going to kill him. And that Snape was under the Unbreakable Vow to kill him (Dumbledore) if Draco failed. Again, it's explained /very specifically/ in the /books/. (which are not /entirely/ written from HP's POV)

There was nothing linking a cursed necklace which a /random kid/ brought back from /Hogsmead/ to Dumbledore or Draco. There was nothing linking a poisoned wine bottle in a teacher's office to Dumbledore or Draco.

(And in fact, the book /specifically/ shows Dumbledore realizing that Rosmerta poisoned the bottle under the Imperius curse /as Draco is about to not-kill him/ - when he finds out that she has, in fact, been cursed.)

And again, book six shows the /most/ of Malfoy, but it is not the only book that specifies.

Snape /could not/ tell Dumbledore /anything/ regarding Draco because he was under the Unbreakable Vow. Not inept, not a traitor, just he would *literally die the second he said a word against Draco*.

And no, "saving the Malfoys" was never a priority over "saving the students" but yes, a /good/ man would have wanted it over without any of them dying. Chances of a murder in Hogwarts? Slim. Chances of Draco (A CHILD) and his entire family being murdered if Dumbledore accosted him? 100%.

He can't hold Draco at school if Draco's mother calls him home. There, Voldemort kills them. Including the kid.

If you think it's okay to send a kid to their /guaranteed immediate/ death, that in fact you /must do so/ to be a "good" person, then, well, I don't really care about your opinion on what makes anyone an "evil man".

And again, everything you've said is hypothetical and unsupported opinion. Downvote if you want, the proof is in the books, and I'm done arguing with "because I think it's wrong".

Of course, Lucius also complains that Draco needs to get his grades up, so perhaps he is not doing outstandingly at all, but Lucius knows he can shame his son more by talking about how Hermione beat him.

***** If the Vanishing Cabinet is anything like a wand or the portraits, it probably can't be fixed properly by magical means since IIRC, Flich would be responsible for fixing that stuff via non-magical means, and a broken wand is worthless without having the Elder Wand to fix it. I don't think any magical item (e.g. wand, portrait, etc) could be fixed that easily and even if it was, it wouldn't be guaranteed to work properly. I think someone with specialist knowledge in magical objects like Mr Borgin would have fixed it way faster than Draco did.

So I agree with you. I don't think fixing a vanishing cabinet is a matter of intelligence but more a matter of experience. I think fixing one is really easy if the person knows what they are doing (e.g. Mr Borgin) and would take a few weeks/hours/days, but the vast majority of wizards (even the smart ones) wouldn't have any experience trying to fix a vanishing cabinet and either will give up or take months to fix it. In that sense, it would be like Harry's Patronus since a patronus is about strong emotions rather than actual power/intelligence of a wizard.

** I get the impression that Draco is meant to be as intelligent as Harry so there's nothing to compare him to Hermione's logical or book-smart mind. Since he's a foil to Harry throughout the books, it would make sense to be if they're about the same when it comes to intelligence. They just have different skill sets. Draco is excellent at occulumeny while Harry struggles in it, but can cast the patronus from a young age. They're both seekers. We can assume Draco had an O in Potions since he was already in the class. Harry had an O in DADA.

He's quick-witted, although he usually uses this to be rude to Harry and friends. Harry is equally snarky. He's good at deducing things (he noticed Harry was invisible in the train compartment, realized the connection between the vanishing cabinets) and Harry's ability to deduce things is usually what gets him into all sorts of trouble.

Being good at one or two things "above your grade" (if Hogwarts has any standardized curriculum at all that is) doesn't make you a genius. Here's the facts:

- Snape was clearly in on it. He even flat-out reminded him to use it in Harry's duel, which he also set up.
- Draco never used another fancy spell since then. He never showed to be capable of dueling magic or knowing how to defend himself.
- There are several moments where he or his parents are complaining that his grades are low (of course he blames it on the teachers rather than take responsibility for his failings).

From this I conclude that him knowing Serpensortia was a one time deal. Snape was the one who taught him that spell for the sole purpose of humiliating Harry (and we don't know how long it took him, it could very well have been a months work or more for that one spell). Draco has never showed any real talent for dueling or high level spells since then, which we would have expected had he truly been this prodigious by himself.

Actually we do know. At the end of book 5 Dumbledore explains to Harry why he wasn't chosen, from this we know the process in which prefects are selected.

It goes like this:

- The heads of each house pick one boy and one girl they like best.
- Dumbledore can veto if he wants for whatever reason he wants (even non-school related reasons like why he vetoed Harry)

And that's seriously it... Malfoy was picked because Snape picked him. There are no other requirements (like grades) or leadership abilities. It was all pure nepotism.

He conjures the snake at 12, but the lack of reaction from any students or staff kinda takes the wind out of that argument. In contrast, when Harry casts a corporeal patronus at 13 it's big news and repeated frequently.

He's made a prefect, which could be indicative of intelligence. It could be just as easily be Lucius bribing Snape with gold or favors (again). Snape ostensibly has the final say in the Quidditch roster, and he gave Draco a spot because Lucius bought the team brooms. Is Draco a decent seeker? It doesn't seem like it to me.

I don't think that speaks bad about Draco.

- Potions was supposed to be only for Outstanding marks. Harry and Ron are the only ones who need the books and materials, so we can safely assume that all the rest got an O in the Potions OWL.

- Ron somehow didn't get an O in Defense even with the help of the DA, while Malfoy got in the NEWT class of DADA without going to the DA. Then Draco proceeds to do much better than Ron at non-verbal spells.

- Transfiguration only requires an A. We have no idea about Draco's mark in his OWL.

And about the snake conjuring, people were afraid of the snake, and after that he kinda got outshone by Harry speaking Parseltongue.

All that says is that Draco, Harry and Ron are of similar intelligence.

Harry might be no mental giant, but he is not stupid either. He is the type of student that is known as "straight B student" - getting good grades on talent combined with a reasonable amount of effort.

He can easily keep up with Hermione, who we know for sure is above average intelligence (canon says so). She has a lots of booksmarts and a strong work ethic, which gets her top grades when it comes to written essays; in contrast Harry seems to have a more practical intelligence. Hand Hermione a hammer and she will hit her own hand, hand Harry a hammer and he will nail it.

Ron only gets mediocre grades because he has a tendency to procrastinate. He is not stupid, just lazy with a laid back attitude towards studying. (Take a look at Fred and George and their grades compared with their obvious talent.) Having Hermione nag at Ron and sitting down with Harry and Hermione to study pulls Ron' grades up sufficiently so that he easily gets into the same classes as them and mostly getting similar grades as Harry. If he put in the same work as Hermione I can really see him getting Outstanding in many classes.

Draco seems to fall into the same category as the Trio - above average intelligence with genuine talent but no genius/child prodigy.

That's kinda my point. I don't consider Harry and Ron to be especially smart. I see them as average-ish. Harry is the Defense star with middling grades in everything else. Hermione is above-average across the board. I see Hermione as fulfilling the "jack of all trades, master of none" adage. Ron is lazy but does well enough, maybe due to Hermione's assistance. Neville is average-ish, but amazing in Herbology and terrible at +potions+ Snape.

My main primary point was that we frankly don't know much about Draco in any sense (or really any students other than Harry, Ron, and Hermione). Draco gets more time than most of the other students, but all it really tells us is that he's a jerk. He could be smart, he could be not. He could be a deeply convicted young man who is struggling with separating his beliefs from the ones his father instilled in him, or he could just be a coward too afraid to follow through on his beliefs.

** No. People here seem to give examples of feats he achieved (plot devices, which really aren't that impressive), and completely ignore his exceedingly moronic behaviour. Draco is an idiot. Through his thuggish and disrespectful behaviour he has made everyone hate him (I imagine that his housemates hated him more than anyone else), the professors despise him, Snape probably wants to murder him for having to deal with his shit, and his mother is likely extremely ashamed after having to drag his leper-like body out of the Hogwarts Express two years in a row.

He has no sense of diplomacy or tact, which alienates every ally he might hope to make (not just Harry, but I imagine Viktor didn't like him much after talking to him for a minute), and continuously literally screams opinions that a clever kid would know keep to himself (/"youre next, mudbloods!"/). He is a complete loser who would have been nowhere without his daddy's influence. His HBP plot only worked because Dumbledore allowed it to, and told Harry to ignore it.

Animal conjuration? Ron does it in the same book. Fixing a Vanishing Cabinet? after an year of getting instructions from Borgin, who probably has a lot of experience with that. Occlumency? I don't think Harry's half-hearted attempts give us a clear picture of how hard it is to learn. Prefectship? seeing how unexamplary he acted when given the power, we can assume that he wasn't given the position for his responsibility and maturity (and those who say Ron is stupid, well, he was given the same position). Slytherin Prince? Slytherin Sex God? his only friends were two dumb sycophants that betrayed him when they had the opportunity, and the only girl he dated at Hogwarts was frequently described as "pug-faced".

** Absolutely not. It's a clear case of fanon displacing canon.

Here are two sources: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][HP Wiki]] and [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html][HP Lexicon]]. The wiki states:

#+begin_quote
  Draco was quite intelligent and quick-witted, capable of deducing things and coming up with clever plans based on a small amount of information; his father had expected him to obtain top marks in school after his first year, and showed disappointment that Hermione beat him.
#+end_quote

This is /purely/ conjecture (and terribly phrased). The Lexicon makes no reference to any supposed intelligence. Scan through their article and you'll find no mention of any cleverness or distinguished academic achievement. It's no wonder the Lexicon is considered to be a far more reliable source of information regarding canon.

Now what purpose does the CoS scene in Borgin & Burkes serve? It introduces us to Lucius in an unguarded moment. The quip about Hermione's academic prowess is /not/ made to give us insight into Draco's intellect, but to showcase Lucius' bigotry towards witches of 'no proper family.' That hasn't stopped Draco fans from treating this scene as a ringing endorsement of the clever!Draco trope.

Draco's use of the Protean Charm is also often used to justify his ranks within the intellectual elite at Hogwarts. This is supposed to be an extremely difficult piece of magic to get down properly, as we learned from Hermione's use of it in OotP (it's N.E.W.T. level magic and by then they hadn't taken their O.W.L.s). So far as we know, Draco was only able to reproduce her work after consulting an original DA galleon. [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/spells/spells_p.html#protean_charm][The Lexicon]] states that his copying of her work is intentional. So that tells us that he wasn't clever enough to figure it out on his own. Also, +Gregory Goyle+ Vincent Crabbe - who is widely considered to be quite [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/goyle.html][stupid]] was able to master the incantation and wand movements for Fiendfyre even though he proved unable to control it properly. Having a character cast one difficult spell one time does not instantly make them a genius. It's also entirely possible that his Aunt Bellatrix, mother, father, or any other qualified post-N.E.W.T. Death Eater performed the spell for him.

TL;DR: Draco's fans have made him smart in fanon to better pair him with Hermione.

*** Cunning and intelligence are not the same thing. Neither is wisdom and intelligence. For example, do you think Hermione is cunning? At the start of the books, when she is young, would you call her wise? The answer to both questions is no, but she /is/ intelligent.

***** Firstly, clever and sneaky, while often used interchangeably, are /not/ the same thing. However, sneaky and cunning can (mostly) be used interchangeably.

'Sneaky' implies against, or at least not within, established rules, and can also mean done without another's knowledge. Likewise, 'cunning' is subtlety with elements of deceptiveness but also some level of skill beyond what 'sneaky'.

'Clever' is quick thinking or sometimes /dexterous/ thinking (which is why there is sometimes an overlap with sneakiness, as this is often seen as 'outside the box' thinking), but it is not deceptive or subtle.

So what evidence to you have that Hermione is either cunning or sneaky? Draco shows /both/ quick thinking and a level of deception/subtlety when he tricks Harry and Ron to attend the duel. In other words, he is both clever and cunning/sneaky.

As a 1st year or second year, and even into third Hermione is portrayed as know-it-all, bossy, book smart, loyal (sort of), and rule abiding. She argues /against/ sneakiness, she obeys the rules. I can't think of any action of hers in those early years which is particularly sneaky. She is more seen as classically intelligent (she knows facts, is logical, and can plan and problem solve) but she doesn't do so necessarily quickly, nor dexterously.

****** In second year Hermione organized a group of her and two other twelve year olds to steal from a teacher, drug two students and infiltrate a password protected private area in disguise. That would pretty fucking impressive for an adult, nowhere in the books does Draco show anything near that level of sneakiness. The thing with the duel is a case of Harry being a retard and has nothing to do with Draco being smart.

*** Actually Draco wasn't provoking Buckbeak. He bowed and everything. He just casually insulted the animal, as he is wont. And if you think surviving due to plot armor is a point against a character, Hello golden trio. Subtlety I agree with, but he is cunning. He brought death eaters to Hogwarts, which even Dumbledore thought was impossible. He also created those badges - Harry stinks - which any student in Gryffindor including Granger - could reverse. In fact any attempts resulted in worst insults.

**** Essentially, but they have different connotations, I think. Cleverness is making connections in your head and finding ways to work around an obstacle, intelligence would be, I suppose, straight up brainpower. There's also cunning, which is more opportunistic than actually being smart? But that also requires a level of cleverness.

Different kinds of intelligence, that all kind of overlap. Words are hard.

******* I disagree. I'd say that you need some level of intelligence, but above average? I just don't see any basis for that assertion, given how subjective defining and measuring intelligence can be. How do we actually know that you have to have above average intelligence to be clever, as opposed to somewhat intelligent? Hell, what are we even defining intelligence as? How well you do in school? Emotional intelligence? Gut instinct? To me, it's one thing to suggest that one requires the presence of the other, but to say that you have to have one and be at an above average level seems to be unfounded.

******** You can disagree if you'd like. I based my comments on the dictionary definition of clever, which is overwhelmingly composed of words that indicate above average intelligence.

IE, he researched the many ways words were used already in language. He also made the innovation of supporting his definition by illustrating the words' uses in literary quotation.
