Well, I've finished the most basic chapters in this work, and I thought that it might be the proper time to show it to a larger audience. I should hardly call it very good, but it might be worth wasting some of your time on, especially for those regularly asking for a malevolent or intelligent Harry. I am trying extremely hard to portray such a character. Fair warning: you may have to wait until second year until some of the darkest content begins to emerge. This is intended to be a fiction approaching the million-word mark, and much of the gore and combat will occur in the later years.

I would be very grateful for critical response, particularly regarding the substance and style of the work, along with Brit-pickings. Should anyone have questions, it would be my pleasure to answer them, though I cannot promise a prompt response.

Summary: When a young Harry Potter is manipulated into picking up the Coin of a desperate, infamous Fallen Angel, he falls victim to a slow seduction. A conversion by the smallest of steps. And in the end, it is such a quiet thing, to fall. But far more terrible is to admit it. Harry Potter/ Dresden Files crossover.

** I've always liked the premise of a denarian Harry, and I could never get into the denarian renegade series. This story is so far so good. Are you really going for a tragedy for this like the description indicates?

*** Absolutely. This story doesn't have a happy ending. Right now it may not seem like it, but Harry is going to fall about as far as a person can fall and still be human.

Maybe even a little further than that.

*** First off, I would like to thank you for giving critical response to my fic. You've definitely made me rethink the pacing, and how quickly I may wish to diverge from canon.

It's a valid criticism that the first part might feel too long/bloated (though I'm not quite sure if it would be possible to do everything I've done in a chapter or two). That said, the first parts of the story are the most essential. Each chapter thus far has set up an arc or subarc for the story. The work was always intended to be slow and long, eventually picking up pace. I believe it unrealistic to jump straight into combat or fights, as so many fics do. There must be a natural progression of power.

As for following the canon: we've really only had one chapter (perhaps two) since the start of canonical material. It seems canon compliant because Harry wishes to avoid raising suspicion, or because certain events would likely have happened in any case. I assure you that it won't stay this way forever; in the very next chapter which I hope to publish, something happens that will destroy the plot lines of at least two books, and a (much later) event will destroy two more. Only the first few years will bear any resemblance to canon.

Once again, thanks for the feedback. I hope you find it more to your liking in the future.

** Lol. For some reason I was imagining Harry with a personality like Olenna Tyrell when I saw the title.

** How much crossover content do you have? Is it a full x-over like "Denarian Renegade" where everything was pretty much canon for both world and the 'Wand-wavers' are just a different part of wizarding society or did you change some things so they better fit in?

Or did you go the Alternate Dimension route where either Harry or the Coin somehow get transported to the other world like in "Awaken Sleeper" or "Deal with a Devil"?

Edit: Also, depending on which route you chose: How much interaction will we get with Dresden Files main characters and HP main characters`You tagged Mab and Nicodemus so I imagine those two will be rather important but will we get much Harry Dresden or Dumbledore or Hogwarts action or White Council executions?

*** It's intended to be a full universe crossover. Wand-wizards coexist with the supernatural community from the Dresdenverse, though the vast majority of them are unaware of it. The interactions and origins of the wand-wizards for a rather important subplot for the work. Some things, mostly regarding the use of magic in the Harry Potter books, will be altered slightly to fit in with the Dresdenverse.

We will not see much interaction with the 'main' charcters from the Dresden Files, if by that you mean Dresden's normal associates, or perhaps even the man himself. I'm not completely comfortable with writing Dresden's character, and feel that I do it a disservice. Moreover, Dresden and Harry will (eventually) have personalities and goals so antithetical that they would mandate a throwdown between the two, and I'm wary of the fan backlash from any fight that I write for that. He will certainly have a cameo, however. Certain Knights and other Wardens are also very likely to make an appearance.

As to the White Council: it will play a significant role, but executions aren't really in order. As a member of the Order of the Blackened Denarius, Harry is covered by the Accords. Moreover, there's the role of the wand-wizard/true-wizard relationship, as many wand wizards practice what the Council would deem dark magic and are not punished for it.

If you mean villains, however, it is quite likely that we will see many of them, and many of the more powerful supernatural entities/factions. At least one other besides the two listed will play a major role.
