Instead of a Voldemort pretending to be Harry, write about a Slytherin!Harry who pretends to be Voldemort reincarnated, but actually isn't.

Maybe he's a natural at mind arts and managed to extract some memories from the soul fragment in him with the names of all the death eaters, and then he takes over the entire group...

Or maybe it's a time travel redo fic where Harry uses information from the future to successfully pretend to be Voldemort...

*SPOILERS*: Harry accidentally tricks Lucius into thinking this. Funnily enough Lucius is actually technically correct, but since Harry has none of Voldemort's memories Lucius's guess is still wrong in practice. Also, Harry doesn't realize what he accidentally tricked Lucius into believing, which leads to a critical misstep in gauging Lucius's reaction later on.

** "I really think something is very wrong here."

"What?"

The two new Death Eater recruits were handing out candies to the children at some unimportant park.

"Uh... Everything?"

The other one squinted. "I don't think I follow."

"We are supposed to be Death Eaters. Do you get it? /Death fucking Eaters./ People should be crumbling in fear of our lord as we bring madness and mayhem into their pathetic mudblood lives."

"Uhuh. Got that."

"Then why," he almost screamed, "are we passing free candy to these kids?"

"You know that you should not question the actions of our lord."

"For God's sake, Larry, do you have no rational mind? Will you be forever doomed to be the Ron Weasley substitute for this fic?"

"Yes?"

Shaking his head, he continued to give joy to the infernal brats till his shift ended, at which time he swiftly disapparated back to the secret lair of his master.

"Our work was done without any complications, lord." He whispered, and kept his head bowed, along with twenty others like him waiting to be dismissed.

His lord, a young boy with barely a stubble to show for age, looked at them all with his green eyes, and stroked his owl as he planned further duties for them all.

"You may return to your home, all of you except Steve."

His blood ran cold, and then hot, as he gripped his wand fiercely. He wouldn't go down without a fight, Dark Lord or not.

He also prayed for eternal misery in hell for Larry.

"Stand up, Steve, and face me."

When looking at him directly, it was very hard to take the Dark Lord seriously. His looks were very much like that of what a small child might dream up as the looks of the Dark Lord. Lucius Malfoy stood at his right, his wand pointing directly at Steve himself.

So be it.

Before any spell could leave either of their wands, a loud and high-pitched "Stop!" echoed through the throne room.

"This is no place for a fight. No, I would not have two of my allies fight each other. Also, Steve, lower your wand. You will not be harmed during this meeting."

All brain functions inside Steve came to a screeching halt.

/What?/

"Lower. Your. Wand."

He did.

"Now turn around."

He did that too.

"Petrificus Totalus!"

He was powerless to do anything as his limbs snapped to his body and he started toppling, before being caught by "Wingardium Leviosa!"

I remember there was this one-shot where Voldemort /was/ Harry, but an older one that got put into Tom Riddle's body after the older Harry defeated /his/ Voldemort. Harrymort was determined to get defeated and fulfill the prophecy. Problem was that when he did that, he ended up sending the new Harry back into Tom Riddle's body creating a loop. Hope somebody remembers what this one was.
