Most working wizards in the books seem pretty over worked. Molly spends all her time cooking and cleaning, even with her wand. The Weasley's can't afford to all go on holiday as a family unless they win the lottery? Remus Lupin who was supposed to be smart and good at magic can't afford or make decent clothes or a healthy lifestyle?

I get that in canon wizards are like that, but I'd like to see some stories where wizards use magic to improve their lives.

Why wouldn't you just apparate around and throw up some wards and pitch a wizard tent wherever you feel like it? Or find a cave, expand and transfigure stuff until you have a nice apartment or mansion? Hunt, gather, fish, farm, rob or con muggles with magic? Or just do simple things like repairs or even collect junk and fix or transfigure it to sell?

TL:DR\\
Looking for fics where people use magic creatively instead of acting like muggles with wands

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

*** You just reminded me of a story with a very doomsday prepper concept. I can't remember the title, sorry, but the basic plot is:

Post OOTP. Terrorist hires a wizard to get nuclear launch codes, nukes set off global EMP, no electricity anywhere, rioting. Hermione's dad was a low key prepper, he helps Harry lead a group of wizards to form a new community. Voldemort somehow gets more sane (?) and they fight for food and leadership of surviving wizards.

If anyone knows this I'd love to read it again!

**** Well, just because magic is capable of doing something doesn't necessarily mean it's easy or advisable to do it.

I'm quite willing to accept that Molly Weasley might do the replicating food thing (which WOULD explain why Ron gets corned beef even if he doesn't like it), and the movie at least has her clean dishes with magic, but Molly is actually pretty damn good at magic; it's not a given that everyone or anyone could replicate food and have it be as nourishing or even taste any good... or clean dishes without breaking them. It's quite possible that people who don't do these things just aren't capable of doing them, or they're so hard to learn that it's less work to just do the dishes by hand. Transfiguration of clothes might likewise be a specialty thing; just because you can turn a mouse into a snuff-box doesn't necessarily mean you can use Transfiguration to mend a shirt...

As for Apparation for vacations... well, we KNOW that Apparation is tricky and that lots of wizards don't bother with it. Side-along Apparition is apparently tougher, considering how none of the students in Harry's year has done it, and it was freaking Dumbledore who took Harry. We see how badly a botched Side-Along can go in DH... when Hermione Apparates with Ron, Ron ends up getting Splinched so badly that he nearly bleeds to death. Situations like this would be a big damper on a family vacation.
