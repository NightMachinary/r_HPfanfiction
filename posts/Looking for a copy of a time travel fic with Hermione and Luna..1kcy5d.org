Im looking for a time travel fic with Hermione and Luna being the only survivors of the war. Hermione has red eyes and Luna has white hair. The author took it down and I'm wondering if anyone has a copy or a link or anything? I don't remember the name but its by margologrim on fanfiction.net.


** It [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3359229/MargoloGrim][looks]] like she took it down a few months ago, but she says you can message her.

** I'm sure I've got a copy of this that I downloaded with flagfic on my kindle that I can get ahold of when I find my kindle.

What's the etiquette these days of sharing stories that have been taken down?

*** To the best of my knowledge, it's accepted to share by emailing to individuals, but I think they frown upon reposting (even when giving credit to the original author) or putting up download links.

I'd like a copy of the fic too, if you wouldn't mind sharing.

*** Would like a copy as well - never heard of it but since it involves 2 of my favourite characters...

On another note - how does one share files over reddit? (Or should I send a private message with my email address for such cases?)
