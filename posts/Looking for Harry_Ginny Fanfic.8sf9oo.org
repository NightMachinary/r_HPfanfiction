There's a fanfic story where Ginny and Harry break up at Christmas because of a misunderstanding and Ginny leaves for quidditch for a year or so, but when she gets back she tries to win Harry back. She starts sending him gifts and one is a picture of a Hungarian Horntail tattoo she got. Harry also has a house that no one has been invited to before and has insane wards on it, he takes Ginny there. I've tried for days but can't find it. Please help!
