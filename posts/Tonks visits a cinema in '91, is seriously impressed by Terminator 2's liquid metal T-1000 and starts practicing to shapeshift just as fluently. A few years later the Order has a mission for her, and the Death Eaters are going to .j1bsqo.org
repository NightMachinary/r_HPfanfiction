** Any fic where metamorphomagi are awesome is welcome, but I don't think that Tonks could morph like the T-1000 (like literally transform in a puddle of liquid metal or pass her body through a hole) and be credible in the HP universe.

But yeah, a fic where she explores her limits, see what the absolute she can do would be interesting.

***** I mean, she can already to some pretty intricate shape changing. With her even being able to mimic animal parts, she could theoretically lengthen her arm, merge her fingers, sharper, and toughen her nails(nail at this point) with the most durable biological make up possible. So no liquid puddle, but certaintly pointy lance at least.

****** "Biologically possible" is a much broader category than "evolutionarily practical." Natural animals are always going to be sub-par compared to the stuff you could theoretically get cells to do if you were perfectly in control of their functions and arrangements, since natural animals have to deal with the inherent laziness, randomness, and forced compromise of evolution.

******* Hence why a magical shapeshifter who can control such changes could do such a thing. I don't get the point of your comment. Tonks is in control of such things. All she'd really need is the knowledge of such things, which you could argue magic helps you bypass. Since I highly doubt Tonks knows all that stuff, yet she can do such complicated changes already.
