So a couple months back I read a short fic called linkffn(Ruthless by AngelaStarCat) and it's been kind of stuck in my mind. The pairing is Harry/Hermione/Theo, and Harry and Theo essentially share Hermione and are a just a /little/ bit possessive of her/jealous of each other.

Yeah so this was hot and I'd like to find more stories like this instead of the millionth Harry/multi fic. I'd prefer it if the two guys are straight (as in they are in love with the girl only, not each other). There doesn't have to be any sexual content or heavy amounts of romance.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), is hugely underrated.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** Harry/Ron/Hermione is my not-so-secret OT3 and a site called TheQuidditchPitch had a whole section of smutty triofics. Unfortunately the site is gone now, though AO3 attempted to archive the site. I'm not sure how much they got, but here's a [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/thequidditchpitch/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Hermione+Granger%2FHarry+Potter%2FRon+Weasley&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&collection_id=62173][link to the fics it has]]. Some might also be [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works][listed here]] under the Table For Three site which is also now defunct. Several classic triofics are listed on the [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry/Ron/Hermione][fanlore wiki page]].

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
