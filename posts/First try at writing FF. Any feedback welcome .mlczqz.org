Hey guys,

After spending too much time reading fanfiction I decided to do something more active. So I tried to write one.

It's about 40k long now and before going any further I wanted to check if I was completely off my rocker here and needed to stop, or if it was a fun read.

Also english is not my first language. Hope I didn't make too many mistakes.

If someone enjoy the beginning of the story and want to beta-test it, refine it and discuss plot ideas and so on, I'm definitly interested :)

  Things went really wrong so Harry and Hermione try Dumbledore's last trick...Prologue : Slight AU where main pairing is Harry/Hermione. Diverges mostly from the seventh year. It mostly starts after that.Mid spoiler if you want a better summary : Hermione and Harry plan to go back in time to the marauder's Era to infiltrate the death eaters and mud in the bud the whole thing, but when Hermione arrives Harry is not there.Inspiration: Delenda Est, Debt of time, Methodes of Rationality... I'm targeting to make something untertaining, mostly adventure/mistery with a bit of romance.Hope it turns out interesting!

** When I get a chance I'll read it, I like the concept before even starting though I'd suggest maybe breaking this into chapters bc 40K is a lot of words.

*** Thanks!

Let me know what you think of it, specially if it's not positive. I don't want to write 300k words to realize there's a core problem to the whole thing.

I split it into smaller chapter.
