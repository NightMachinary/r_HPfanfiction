In which Harry or someone else explores the chamber of secrets and finds something.


** It's an insanely long fic, over a million words, and the Chamber of Secrets plays an interesting role in it but not until 5th year. I'll link it anyway, whether or not you read is your call. I personally enjoyed it immensely.

** It's a fairly common trope for the Chamber to have Slytherin's library hidden in it. Here are some examples:

- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series (first book is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]) - Harry finds several important things in the Chamber at the end of book 2. He starts using the Chamber extensively in book 5. linkao3(12608820)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] - Harry uses the Chamber's library to learn about the history of Slytherin and other important lore. linkffn(6254783)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12405748/1/][Harry Potter and the Curse of Undeath]] - Harry returns to the Chamber in year 4 looking for power that might help him survive the Triwizard Tournament. linkffn(12405748)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Scorpius isn't on the Hogwarts Express at the start of seventh year, and Albus discovers that he's become very ill over the summer. Determined to find out what's wrong with him and how to make him better, Albus starts doing some research, and discovers Moramortia, a fatal illness with just one cure. Together, Albus and Scorpius (with some help from Rose) set out on an adventure to find the ingredients to make the potion that will hopefully save Scorpius's life...
