I want an eventual super Harry, but I want him to progress realistically. I want him to bother to learn, I want him to apply everything he learns, and I want him to craft or augment his wand.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), meets your requirements the best. He was eventually super, he was a knowledge hog, and he augmented his own STAFF!

*** One of my biggest gripes with blind!Harry stories is that they're almost universally not!blind!Harry stories.

They almost all incorporate some kind of "Mage Sight" that renders his blindness irrelevant or, ironically, allow him to see better than everyone else.

**** Well done! You hit it in one. I think in this sprawling 31 chapter epic Harry is blind for about 2 chapters, if that.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I suppose a good one would be the R Series, which starts with linkffn(2008185). It's also a pretty good Age Regressed!Tonks x Ravenclaw!Harry.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
