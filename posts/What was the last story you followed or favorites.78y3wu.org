** My favorites list is just barely a page long, and the last time I added a story was over a year ago. linkffn(11643446). I don't think I've ever actually followed a story before. I read so much and with how slow most authors update, by the time I'd be alerted by a new chapter I've likely forgotten what the previous chapter was about so I'd usually have to reread the whole thing.
