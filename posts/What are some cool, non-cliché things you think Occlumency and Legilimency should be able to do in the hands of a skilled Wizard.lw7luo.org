** Legilimens - Project the sounds, smells, and tastes into someone's mind to enhance storytelling... or to inflict pain or overwhelm their senses.

Occlumens - Pain resistance. Should also note that being an Occlumens doesn't mean Veritaserum won't work on you at all, but that you can have enough presence of mind to be evasive in your answers, though still truthful.

** For Legilimency being able to spread your mind out and sense people's locations through their minds, even when invisible. If the person is an Occulmens they would still be able to sense them because the person still has a mind to sense, blocked from intrusion or not.

For Occulmens, being able to give enchanted items sentience by injecting memories or feelings during creation. While the idea could work for Legilimency, they would need to be an Occulmens otherwise the memory could become tainted with unwanted memories/emotions and cause the enchanted object to backfire/be cursed.

** Occlumency might work against things other than Legilimency, but not just in the cliché "barrier" way.

Say, you're hit with an Obliviation spell - the spell contains an instruction for what memory it's supposed to delete. If you use Occlumency to disguise an irrelevant memory as what the spell wants, you could resist it.

Or what about the basilisk's gaze - if you know that the deadly part is its eyes, you might be able to stop your visual cortex from decoding anything that might be a face, rendering you immune.

Veritaserum could maybe be beat by repressing the truth and elevating a falsehood to its place, letting the potion draw out what you actually, truly believe is the truth in that moment. It might also allow you to switch to a different language, because the truth is the truth no matter what language you speak it in. If you're tied up, sign language may allow you to resist saying anything.
