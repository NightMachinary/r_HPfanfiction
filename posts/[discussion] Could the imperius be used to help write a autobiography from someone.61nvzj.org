Would the imperius be useful in writing a autobiography or an biography. Could it be used to drag up memories you have forgotten. Ive seen in fanfic (not sure about canon) where the imperius has been used by doctors to make the patient have no pain by commanding them to stop feeling pain.


** I... suppose.

If you want to use an unforgivably dark spell to... write a book.

Sure. Might work. Possibly not. The spell may not dredge up unconscious memories, but conscious longterm is likely still there. The connection might be tenuous, and the memory foggy.

*** That sounds like an incredibly Ravenclaw thing to do... "I only want ultimate power so I can read more books."

I like! :)

**** Yeah. So a Ravenclaw asks a friend to imperius him/her to read/study 24/7. Then the Ravenclaw gets all of the knowledge in the world... hmm not bad

**** well, yeah. As a Ravenclaw, I am curious as to what the minimum murder necessary to create a Horcrux is. Could I kill an innocent non-sentient? Either way, there's an obvious way to get around the 'only have a fraction of my soul' problem - simply:

- Create some clones of yourself (actual RL not-Hollywood-science clones).
- Do minimum murder to make said clones into your Horcruxes. If you need a sentient, use criminals condemned to death.
- This establishes intitial Horcurx Legilimency soul-connection.
- Since there is no mother's-love barrier, and you have awareness of the connection, use the link to slowly copy your mind into the clones as they grow up.
- If possible (i.e. research this), integrate your soul-shards into their souls completely.
- When they are old enough to successfully perform Horcrux ritual, have your clones make you into their Horcrux. Then have them perform it with each-other, so each body has a piece of everyone else's soul.
- This way, you have an army of yourself, linked into one super-mind, like the Borg, each ensuring everyone else's immortality. If you can integrate the soul-fragments, you can thereby avoid the insanity that tends to arise from having a partial soul.
- Rinse and repeat as needed.

** Why use an Unforgiveable if you could use Legilimency or a Pensieve? Or in other words: Why make yourself guilty of a crime if there are legal ways to do it? I mean... I suppose you could, in theory, but why would you?

In canon the Unforgiveable Curses are 100% seen as evil magic. Even the Imperio Harry used on the Goblin was described as a last way out.

In all "humanitarian" uses of the spell, I could easily think of other spells, or create my own, that would do the trick just fine. Instead of ordering someone to feel no pain, why not use a spell that numbs the body?

*** Forgivable uses of the Unforgivables:

- AK: Quick death of minimal pain (other than that of dying). Other than 'mercy killing', also for any case where the only way to stop a very bad thing is the death of someone, or where there is a (magical) shield that would stop other spells.

- Imperius: Person X must perform an action, and cannot summon the willpower to do so. e.g. Person X is trapped, has to saw off own leg. Circumstances prevent use of direct spellwork to teleport or remove leg. Person Y uses Imperius on X so X can remove leg with minimal danger. Or Person X is about to (innocently) push big red 'end of world' button, so stunning or immobilizing spells could cause it to be pushed anyway.

- Cruciatus: Depends on how it works. If works by, say, making every nerve fire, it could restart heart, breathing (as part of a magical CPR), or disrupt a seizure. Could possibly also disrupt migraines or cluster headaches - a single moment of cruciatus might be better than an extended migraine or cluster headache. Even if it works by magically inducing the sensation of pain in the mind, that is still going to manifest in extreme brain stimulation... so the latter uses might still apply.

**** Meh, I don't know about the Cruciatus.

I mean, we know that you need to hate in order to cast the Cruciatus. If you don't hate a patient, you won't be able to cast it. Also, if we're talking hypotheticals, I could see healers using animation charms to make the heart pump and the diaphragm move to push air in and out. Also: Headache Potion - cures all headaches.

The Killing Curse and the Imperius are more open to debate, I'd think. Though I also feel like they should have some sort of penalty, or difficulty to them. There gotta be a reason why casting an Killing Curse is "unforgiveable", but blowing the head of someone off with a Reducto isn't.

** I don't think so. Imperius sort of turns you into a human puppet. It doesn't so much affect the mind as it bloats it out, allowing someone else to control you. I don't think an Imperiused person could even efficiently access their own memories at all.

*** I'm pretty sure security questions are supposed to be a lazy defense against polyjuice, not imperious.

Also, I think the books show how imperious works with actions rather than more cerebral things. In book 4 when Moody casts it on Harry, thinking about what is going on helps Harry break the curse, so I wonder if something that requires more thought would be easier to break in the early stages.

**** That is where subtlety comes in. When doing cartwheels, there is no real objection. You don't tend to hate cartwheels on principle. But commanding things which require thought is easier if you make it things they want to do anyway, and harder if they have an objection. That's why Imperious in the Ministry is so dangerous. You dont force someone to make a law, rather you force lots of people to do paperwork which when put together is evil. They were all doing paperwork anyway, so it isn't as if they can really object to their job. It's just that the small tidbits which seemingly don't matter actually make up the plot.
