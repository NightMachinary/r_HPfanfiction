I remember reading a fic awhile ago that has Harry using a time turner for studying while in a magical trunk. Pretty sure he talks with himself as well, anyone know the name?


** Does he talk to himself directly or indirectly (i.e. through notes)?

*** I think he ends up having an actual conversation with himself and you get to see both perspectives of it

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.
