** ShayaLonnie has one, I believe it's called A Bit Of Sky where those three time travel, but it's a Drarry and Remione story and Draco is still a Slytherin. It's a WIP but it's really good (all of her stuff is incredible). Her best time travel fic is Debt of Time which is an epic four book tale picking up at the end of HBP.
