I've read a few but cant find any more good ones. Please no Vela fics or ones involving the pairings of Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco, Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione. Thank you


** I presume you've read the fantastic harry the Hufflepuff, one of the most hilarious series ever written. Worth it for his interactions with House elves alone. linkffn(6466185)

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

** I can recommend you two, although he does not act like a Hufflepuff in either.

Too Young To Die Harry is using his Hufflepuff status to hide his darkness.

insurgere by Silver Pard has a Tom Riddle sorted into Hufflepuff. Great one shot.

** linkffn(6413108) I started reading this awhile ago and either never finished it or just completely forgot about it. I recently saw it recommended in a time travel thread, so I decided to start re-reading again. All I can really say as far as tropes go is that Harry is in Hufflepuff and it has no pairings.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  AU Harry disappears ten years ago, from his relatives. When he comes back he is not the innocent boy everyone knows. The Boy Who Lived, grew up differently than anyone would have imagined. He's not the goody goody way to polite boy from Number Four, he's a sarcastic, arrogant little twit, who has love deep down and wants to be loved. But can he open up to anyone around him?
