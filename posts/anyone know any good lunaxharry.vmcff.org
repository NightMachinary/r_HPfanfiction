** It's a shame about Harry x Luna. It's easily my favorite ship, but Luna is by far the hardest character in the series to write. Especially when writing her in a romance, you need to keep the spirit of her character alive, keeping her mature enough to make the romance not feel creepy on Harry's end, and weird enough that you don't start to go to far into "Luna flake" territory. I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle_in_the_Jungle_A_Harry_Potter_Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and the sequel, but flake Luna tends to feel like a copout.

I don't have any recommendations, just felt like sharing my thoughts.

*** This is my favorite ship, too! But everyone always goes on and on about how Ginny is much better suited. I just don't like that ship as much because it seems cliche for the hero of the story to get the most popular girl. I like Harry x Luna because you get this curiosity on Harry's end. Normally he's always sticking his nose into things about Voldemort or other conspiracies, but with this it's just such a cuter curiosity. I also think it's a more interesting writing point when the two people are in different houses. (At least for pre DH) Then you can have all of those scenes where they have to sneak out to see each other. Thanks for the story though.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enonjon][Nonjon]] likes to ship Luna/Harry sometimes. His /Where in the World is Harry Potter/ fics ship Luna, but not exclusively. They're hilarious, though, well worth a read. He captures Luna's essence better than most!

** I know of 2, both are on the short side though. I was disappointed after Luna was introduced then had no role w/ the epilogue... anyway. The first is *[[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=245704/]] Forgetting Alone] and the second is *[[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=301180/]] Like Being with a Friend]. The author mentioned a sequel for that long ago but I have yet to see it. Not much story, but she is well written

edit:Well I cannot figure out hyper links via phone but there you go
