I'm looking for good, really long Fem!Harry fics that I can just read for a long time. I didn't particularly like the one called “Spiral Path” or something with a Path in the title.

Interested in either F/F or F/M, maybe with Hermione or with someone unexpected, like Katie, Fleur, etc. Really, anyone but a Weasley, which I particularly dislike (Weasley hater here sadly - they all kind of seem shallow/undeveloped IMO) please no Tom/Voldemort pairings - it disgusts me.

Crossovers are not preferred, but recommend them anyways if you love the fic.

Mature ratings would be lovely - I like a bit of grotesque violence and other kind of mature scenes.

This is all kinda specific isn't it? Sorry! Feel free to recommend things that don't meet these suggestions!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

*** For the most part I liked the Silent World of Cassandra Evans, but I had to drop it.

I don't mind gay pairings, but come on! Everyone and their mother is gay in that fic! Even if the wizarding world had no problems with homosexuality (which would be surprising given the focus on bloodlines, but maybe magic has a way for homosexual people to have trueborn children?), my suspension of disbelief was outright shattered when like the 5th gay couple crawled out of the woodwork. Oh look, and they're all close personal friends/half-siblings with Cassandra.

And every last couple is, on the very first try, like some "it's like we're fated to be together" love for the ages. At twelve!

** linkffn(8233291) is probably the best fem!Harry fic I've ever seen, and by far my favorite fanfic series, ever. It's almost complete, the author only has a few chapters left, and the four-part series has over a million words total.

It's a Twin-Who-Lived fanfic has a fem!Harry as the sister to the Boy Who Lived, who thought a squib and given to the Dursleys. They abandoned her, and she ends up on the streets, and eventually in a brothel, until Sirius finds her. It has an absolutely fascinating take on magic, rituals, the dark/light division, etc, and quite frankly an astounding amount of worldbuilding. It even has BOTH the pairings you're looking for, having the MC at various times date both men and women. I HIGHLY recommend it.

** I doubt you're interested but I'm writing a dark fem!Harry story. It does have a fem!Ron as well, an ooc Dudley, and currently still standing at one measly chapter. I've recently gotten back into writing it, though, because I now have time to focus on it, so, hopefully, I can get some sort of headway into this.

It's also rated T but that's only because this will be covering the first year. It will go up in rating later on in the series, though. And it does feature Weasleys. It won't be on them for much longer, maybe three or four chapters, except for Ron.
