*** It's not really a rating system, but [[http://www.ladyimmortal.org/beyondtheveil/index.php][Beyond The Veil]] is another forum that can be used as a filter. The site was formed when fanficauthors.net discontinued their forum and a handful of the regulars gravitated to the new site. They have some threads with recommendation lists, though the most active thread on the board is the [[http://www.ladyimmortal.org/beyondtheveil/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=7][updated fics]] thread, where notable story updates are posted. Since the stories are posted by site regulars, it tends toward the sort of stuff found on fanficauthors.net (there's very little slash, e.g., and the recommendation lists are more romance-friendly).

*** That site would be crazy to not give it a full score, I read part of their review and it seems they didn't give it much chance.

But you shouldn't read a fanfic based on these sites, I think if you want to see if a story is any good reading the reviews from the story itself is a good way to tell.

**** Not really most of the reviews on FF.net are terrible and sites like DLP are great filters. Sure they have their own bias but I think it better to have a filter too harsh than a filter too broad.

**** Comparing DLP to FF.Net's review section is comparing a group of jerkass elitist to a pack of rabid fangirls. DLP may be harsh, but they're certainly correct, over the fanon-eastrogen-bomb-hivemind that is FF.net. There is pretty much no use trying to find a rec for a romance fic in DLP though, DLP despise het almost as much as slash over there

***** Completely agree. As much as I am grateful to that community for [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=8086][Potter Law]], they /are/ a bunch of elitist jerks. It's also true that their reviews are more reliable than ff.net.

I like solid action sequences /and/ fluff. It's hard to find a site that can reliable rate a fic accurately in both categories.

** This was one of my favorite reads of this year so far. I don't know how I missed it for so long, but this was a fantastic story. :)

** I remember reading this all through the night until 4am to finish it. It was one of the very few stories I've read from beginning to end without stopping. In context, this story was written in between HBP and DH when it started and I had picked up the first few chapters, but I forgot about it for a long time. I saw it was completed and started reading and just couldn't stop.

It's not a story that's going to have jaw dropping surprises and cliffhangers. It actually stays within a lot of tropes (especially for post-HBP HHr stories), but it is so well written and creates such three dimensional characters that it doesn't feel hackneyed. I'd recommend it for H/Hr fans or even those who are pretty neutral about pairings. It does lean heavily towards PK tendencies, but it's still one of the best stories I've read.

If you're looking for a similair Hermione-POV story, Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Couldson Eagle is a story on par with Resistance.

**** In some ways, I think HG and the Goblet of Fire is better than Resistance. They are too markedly different fics with two different writing styles, so it's hard to say which one is "better."

But you should definitely give it a look. It's one of the best re-done GoF fics I've read.

** The only thing that frustrated me was [[/spoiler][how quickly they got engaged/married after they started dating]] Other than that, I thought it was decently well written, and a lot a story with well written suspense, violence, and drama. A good mix, really. Overall pretty enjoyable! It's hard to find fics that can do all of these successfully. The romance was okay, but the drama and violence made up for it.

I'm a sick person... lol.

I have also really enjoyed /Unlike A Sister/, which is strange, considering -- like I said -- I'm not usually big on Harry/Hermione. (Though I'll take that over slash any day.) The only thing that was irritating was the smut. I don't mind a scene that gets a little steamy, but sometimes it was a little... over the top?

I hope she updates soon, though. I thought everything was written really well. It's one of the only H/HR fics that I've had hardly any problems with.

*** You should probably post spoiler tags for your first paragraph, don't want to ruin anything for people who haven't read it yet "[X Kills Y!]"(/spoiler) <--- remove quotes

[[/spoiler][I think their relationship in the story was handled real well all things considered, they're in the middle of a war and I can believe they would want to marry each other rather than risk either of them dying and never having the chance.]]

[[/spoiler][I usually begin to have problems when their relationship is too rushed, too corny or fluffy, but the author has managed to get them together for very real and emotional reasons, the most important part of it all is keeping their canon personalities in-tact and the author's ability to portray ALL the characters in HP is unmatched imo.]]

**** Very true.

Hey, if you have any H/HR recommendations, send them my way! Big fan of drama/angst/violence, or perhaps even adventure; Well written, too, but that's a given! I usuallly stick to H/G, but I haven't found any new fics to enjoy lately.

** I really enjoy the characterizations in this fic. Harry and Hermione's motivations and choices are believable and stay consistent throughout the fic. The consequences -good and bad- that develop from the characters' agency are interesting and often unexpected.

I haven't read this in quite awhile, so I can't vouch specifically for the grammar/spelling/etc, however I almost always stop reading a fic if it looks like someone tried to write it without spellcheck.
