The author deleted his story and left the epilogue, and I'd really like to have a copy of it saved for my kindle.

**** I don't use an Android, so no. I checked my copy, and there are no quote marks at all...so at least you have blank blocks!

I'll try to convert the book to another format and see if the quote marks come back.

*** It was about what Dumbledore's Army got up to at Hogwarts while Harry, Ron and Hermione were out on their Horcux hunt.

Apparently they all turned into total OOC versions of themselves with all the boys becoming Manly Soldiers and the girls all becoming delicate nurturing flowers who spoke a secret language or some rot like that, and Neville turned into a total douchebag that everyone worshipped for some reason, and everything turned REALLY bleak and dark and depressing.

I wouldn't bother with it if I were you. There are lots of better "Dumbledore's Army at Hogwarts" fics out there.

***** Well, all right, I have three here. :)

"The Lions of Gryffindor" is fairly short, but well-written. It's essentially Neville's story, with flashbacks to his parents and grandmother.

"Not from Others" has Ginny as the main character and is pretty Weasley-centric, but features Dumbledore's Army well.

And "A Call To Arms" is multiple-POV and the longest of the three fics.

All of these are tons better than "Year of Darkness."

  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.
