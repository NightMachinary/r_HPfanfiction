I recently read a fic where Harry was a girl, and absolutely loved it. I quickly read through a few others I could find (including the ones from the last time someone asked this question). Do you guys have any recommendations?


** No reccomendations, but there are a couple of archives of them that I can see. I haven't had a look through these communities recently, but they are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter]]; the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Miss-Potter-Collection/114607/][Miss Potter Collection]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fem-Harry/93136/][Fem/Harry]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Female-Harry-Archive/98426/][Female Harry Archive]]. There will be many doubles, of course. The Female Harry Archive is updated regularly (still), so it might be your best bet. As for quality...well, it's pretty easy to weed out the really dodgy stuff.

If you already found these archives, then just ignore me. It's quite hard to find good fem!Harry stories, though, if you /are/ in the mood.

** Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is very good, 120 words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Fem!Harry AU. When she was seven years old, Alexandra Potter discovered she had special powers. She thought she was the only one, but then a letter comes and reveals to Alex a world she never knew existed. Will she become the hero so many believe her to be? Or will she lose herself to the temptations of power? Character-driven story, lots of world building. Not a canon rehash.
#+end_quote

Another, somewhat over the top tale is The Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]], 80k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
#+end_quote

Also, Wordhammer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is quite good, 406k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

** Well, I haven't been able to work on it since my summer class started, but I have a FemHarry fic that I'm currently writing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10326963/1/]]

A Life Unlived: James and Lily are killed along with Charlus Potter during an attack on Potter Manor when Dahlia is only a few months old. Dorea Potter takes custody of little Dahlia Potter and goes into hiding at one of the many Black manors in France. There she is raised to be the perfect Pureblood Heiress despite her own blood status. How will Wizarding Britain react when Dahlia Potter-Black, heiress to the Potter and Black fortune, returns to Britain just in time for the Triwizard Tournament? More importantly, how will Dahlia react when she realizes there is more to life than being the perfect heiress?

Tags: Pureblood culture, sexism, misogyny, old fashioned beliefs, female!Harry, BWL!Neville, unrequited love, possible cross-generation romance later.

Pairings: undecided for now.

**** I haven't decided! I had initially thought Bill/Dahlia, but then decided against that.

I keep coming back to Severus. Lots of other fem!Harry tics have her with Severus though, so I'm not sure. She will at least consider him especially with how much Sirius hates him, and she's all about rebelling against Sirius.

******** Yes, though it is not because of Neville himself but because of outside influences. Hmm. I think I'm going to write some today! Now that I'm finished with my summer class, I can do as I please for the next two weeks!

********* Please do, just finished off chapter 2 and I'm enjoying it so far. It's an interesting take to have high society pureblood culture, but without the racism (I hope). Really looking forward to see how you play out the relationships with the others as well, given that they no longer have the foundations they have in Canon... can't wait for the sorting either, gonna go ahead and place my bet on a Ravenclaw Harry for this one :)

tl;dr nicely written, can't wait to see more.

Other:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4831537/1/Someone-To-Run-To][Someone to Run To]] by aadarshinah. Complete. Snarry. Note: I wasn't sure what to make of this at first. It's very funny, but it feels like a parody of fem!Harry fics (the bizarre, nonsensical names people come up with, etc.) It's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.
