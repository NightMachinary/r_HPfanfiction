4 years, various murder attempts and resurrected dark lord later, Harry realizes who the problem is (and rightly so, mostly), DADA teachers.

Harry has reacted enough, it's time to be proactive! It's time to get rid of them before they do him in.

Dumbledore had trouble filling the position annually, let's see how he does it weekly!

Expecting this to be a crack fic, obviously, with Harry finding unusual and creative ways of getting rid of the teachers, and somehow not getting caught. Ron is, of course, easily swayed in Harry's schemes. After all, no teachers means no homework. But Hermione takes time, with each ridiculous teacher that comes in, be it via Dumbledore or ministry (and Voldemort's spies), her resolve to not be involved crumbles.

And as soon as Umbridge takes the post, Harry recognises her from his disciplinary hearing, and gets her to confess early on (somehow) and realizes that he's on the right track and nothing can away him from his decision again!

There could even be a version of Dumbledores army, except it's aimed to help Harry out, plus they do have OWLS and NEWTS, and Harry is the only option they have.


** The final teacher of the year is just Voldemort. Preferably in a disguise so bad that even the first year muggleborns can see through. (But somehow all the staff is clueless about it)

*** As he's not actively trying to kill anyone they decide to leave him where he is just on the off chance that he escapes and then they don't know where he is again. Tom gets his dream job, and the students get a decent teacher. He never gets the chance to take the job for granted because, even though they're no longer intending to drive him off or kill him, making the attempt has become a school tradition, they just don't try as hard or creatively as they could. It gets to the point where the Education Authority says that if they can get rid of a teacher, it's an automatic O+ on their DADA Newt.

*** Even better, the staff are well aware, but pretending not to know, he was the only applicant, and after Umbridge they're desperate to avoid letting the ministry send someone, a few are even quietly hopeful the curse will get rid of him for good.

A la Count Olaf in series of unfortunate events. Excellent.

** Years later, a new class is created at Hogwarts, where students learn how to deal with their evil teachers. Naturally, the class is called Defense Against Dark Teachers.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/]] has exactly this sort of proactive trio, except they aren't limited to just the defense post.

** Turns out that this was Voldemort's end goal all along, he never actually wanted to rule, he just wanted to have the children that came into their would to be as skilled as possible in DADA and since he wasn't able to do it as a teacher he instead choose to make the environment so hostile that the students have no choice but to become masters in DADA, Dark Arts and murdering.
