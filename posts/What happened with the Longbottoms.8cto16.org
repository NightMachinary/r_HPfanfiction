So I was trying to figure some things out for a hp ff. Voldemort thought the person in the prophecy was Harry. From there we can conclude that this was the reason why the Longbottoms weren't in hiding. However, if the Longbottoms were tortured...it must mean the 4 inner circles were told the prophecy...so again, were the Longbottom's ever told? Were they in hiding? Did they have any protection (you know, besides being two pure-blooded aurors). Oh, and if they thought Neville could have been the chosen one why'd they leave him alone when there master went to kill Harry? Someone explain please! haha thanks!


** It happens two weeks later so if therecwas a fidelius, it may have been removed. and they went after them for info about riddle's disappearance due to his rAnk, not due to them being a target of the prophecy.

** The Longbottoms were highly respected aurors, or at least according to Neville's gran. When Voldemort vanished, his followers didn't know what happened. The LeStranges and Crouch Jr were some of his most devout supporters and refused to believe he could just vanish. They tortured the Longbottoms trying to find out where Voldemort went and if they knew anything about it. In my opinion that doesn't require a connection with the prophecy. Snape as the one who told Voldemort the prophecy might have been there when Voldemort deduced who he thought it was and as such, when he begged Dumbledore to help save Lily, Dumbledore knew the Longbottoms didn't have to hide.

** I don't think the Longbottoms' torture was at all related to the prophecy. They were aurors (or at least one of them was, canon isn't entirely consistent) and known members of the Order. I don't know how much of the inner circle was told about the prophecy, but since the torture happened after Voldemort's first defeat, it seems unlikely there would have been any remaining doubt about who the prophecy referred to.

** I think I remember them actually having been in hiding until Voldemort got Morted, and then they went out of hiding and got tortured into insanity

** I always thought that the DEs knew he was interested in the two families, and that probably they were off-limits. I doubt anyone realized it was the children themselves he was interested in.

I don't see him being trusting enough to share the details. They may have been aware of a prophecy concerning either family, and thus they were hoping to get details from the Longbottoms. This also might explain why they left them alive, and left Neville - they were obeying his commands not to kill them.

Also, he never fully trusted anyone. Neither Lucius, Bella, nor Regulus were told what they were protecting/lending the elf for. Nor did they know there were more.

** In the headcanon for my fic, the Longbottoms were under Fidelius, but the secret keeper was killed by Crouch Jr (Because, as Aurors, they would most likely make one of their fellow Aurors the secret keeper, and Barty Senior knew about it, as he was DMLE head at the time.)
