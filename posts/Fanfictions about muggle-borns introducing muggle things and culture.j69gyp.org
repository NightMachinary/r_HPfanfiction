I know there's a few one-shots and thereÂ´s a bunch of tumblr prompts but I would like some long ones. Thanks!


** There's a fic I read recently called 'Things Hermione Has To Explain'.

Basically it's a bunhc of muggle things that Hermione has to explain to Blaise and Draco. Each chapter is a new thing. I do have to warn you though, that some chapters have a Draco/Blaise/Hermione pairing so you might want to skip those if you're not into that.

** Muggle Movie Nights are a thing in my story "Patron", and the mugleborns also take the purebloods out clubbing in muggle London during the war, when the wizarding venues were deemed too dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
