Looking for stuff that picks up quite close to where the books/movies left off. Recently heard from one of those Potter Facts pages that Harry became the youngest Auror at the age of 17 - no idea if this is true or not, but it got me wanting to read some stuff that showed him dealing with life post-war and learning what comes next. Doesn't specifically have to be about just Harry, bonus points if it includes the fates of multiple characters, shipping is not needed but is acceptable.

Anyone got me any recommendations?


** I would really recommend linkffn(The First Day by Little0bird)

You might also be interested in some of my stuff. Although I haven't written immediately after the battle, I have written a few stories and loads of oneshots/snippets about Harry's life throughout canon and post Hogwarts.

** I just finished reading two really good post battle fics, and was thinking about posting a thread like this, so thanks!

The two fics are connected and are Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione respectively.

linkffn(9787334) *Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest, Chance* is about Harry and Ginny starting up their relationship again in the midst of the Weasleys grieving for Fred and the beginning of the Death Eater trials.

linkffn(11807757) *In Love and War* is about Hermione and Ron going to Australia to bring back her parents, and has Percy's POV of the Weasleys in their grief and him dealing with how much he screwed up in the war.

linkao3(15687453) *Proof* is unrelated to the previous two, and it's about Harry recovering from the battle and having to deal with politics when he just wants to bake a loaf of bread.

Edit- Forgot one!

linkffn(9840649) *In the Year of Weasley Scarves* is about Molly's grief after the Battle and how Fleur helps.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  Although Harry and Ginny both survived the war, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night.

  Hermione has resolved her war is not over until she brings her parents home to England. Ron thinks a summer on the other side of the world is a perfect escape. But transitioning from friends to lovers is not always easy, and some hurts seem impossible to forgive, as Percy Weasley knows all too well. Can the bonds of love and family mend the pieces of their lives torn apart by war?
