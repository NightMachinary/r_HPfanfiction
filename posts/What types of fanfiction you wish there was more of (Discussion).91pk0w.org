I, for one, would like to see more 'For Want Of A Nail' type of fics that takes place using canon elements and premises without all the over-powered, Lord stuff.

I am very picky when it comes to Fanfiction as I usually prefer stories that are written with the spirit in which JK intended (which eliminates a lot of stories from my field of search).

Of course, everyone has their own preferences.

I'd like to know what are the kinds of stories you think aren't being written enough about or you'd like to see more of?


** More fics that explore the wizarding aspects of the world. Like, Harry was hidden from that world for 10+ years so I want to see him full of awe and wonder beyond just seeing Diagon Alley or Hogwarts for the first time. I want more /magic/

Accidental Animagus and The Many Deaths of Harry Potter both touch on it briefly (AA has a Latin American antagonist and Many Deaths briefly mentions Harry learning Native American magic). Chessmaster has /something/ going on with Irish magic, but I haven't gotten there yet in the fic.

** Stories that pair Harry with background characters outside of the usual suspects (Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, Fleur, Tonks, Luna). Each of those characters is basically a blank sheet to be filled with creative concepts, and yet all we get is about five characters all falling into one of the following:

"Good pureblood"

"NEUTRAL pureblood"

"Veela stuff"

"Luna is a seer"

"just porn".

Is it too much to ask for stories where the love interest is actually a character, is more than tropes and drama? With at least 40 named girls/women, why does fanfic always return to the same eight or so suspects? Postwar Harry/Lavender has so many interesting ways it could go, Harry/Padma (or any other girl really) can be shoehorned into anything from "rebellious girl fed up with her family's heritage" and "Astronomy nerd who wants to go to space" up to "Freelance Merchant travelling the world" and "Witch using magic to enchant a car and dominate the underground racing scene". The sky is the limit and yet most authors prefer to stay on the ground.

** Adventuring stories. I do not care if its at Hogwarts or the main characters are journeying in Siberia looking for lost artifacts of the Rus shaman. A whirlwind of excitement and unexpected turns, not the slice-of-life story that most inevitably devolve into.

Good trio fics. I mean one that captures the relationship of the three and has them making the most of their collective talents. Kind of like Forging the Sword or We are the Golden Trio! actually.

An idea: Voldemort reveals the prophecy during the PS showdown, and Dumbledore responds to Harry's depression by having him attend a new school each year going forward. Even better, Hermione and Ron are determined to go with him.

Monster hunter fic. Maybe something like Luna is in South Korea or something and discovers a hidden colony of pygmy dragons or something.

I might have something for you there. My story "Dawn of Darkness" goes into that direction after Harry is at the wrong place at the wrong time. It can be a little fluff-heavy at the beginning, but eventually takes a turn towards a more serious tone.

** Original Hogwarts-based mystery-adventures like the first 3 books. They can have Voldemort-related elements, but they are not "war fics". They would have a lot of slice of life parts depicting everyday Hogwarts life and coming of age themes as well as the mystery plotline.

For a long time I toyed with the idea of a retelling of the HP series from post-PoA onwards, essentially asking "What if Voldemort hadn't returned?". The series would have continued the books according to the formula established in PS-PoA, with new year-long mystery plotlines for 4th-7th year (e.g. no Triwizard tournament, but rather a different 4th year plotline).

I had the first story planned out quite intricately -- the first chapter of which is posted to my FF.Net profile -- but ultimately I had to choose between writing this and writing Victoria Potter. So I cannibalised many of the planned story elements for the post-PoA series and incorporated them into the plan for Victoria Potter.

**** The idea is not to tell a "butterfly effect" style divergence which sticks to the original timeline. Rather the idea was to put myself in JKR's shoes before GoF was published and tell an alternate HP series. The only "binding canon" would be PS to PoA.

So while in the canon timeline the preparations for the tournament started well before the events of GoF, their existence is established by GoF. With GoF out the window, so too are those preparations.

I'd have kept world building elements from later books (e.g. the existence of occlumency, horcruxes, hallows, the Dark mark, Aurors, characters) but events would diverge completely. For example, while horcruxes exist in this universe, whether Voldemort had used them would not be certain as this is a fact established by HBP.

I feel this approach to AUs -- keep the world, ditch the events -- is the best way to keep things feeling like HP but avoid rehash.

***** Ah, I see. I tried one of these long ago, a story diverging at the Mirror of Erised confrontation, where it turned out Voldemort /wasn't/ actually evil (anymore), and just wanted to borrow the stone for his body then return it to Master Flamel. This Voldemort's biography was entirely different from canon, and Dumbledore's was too.

That being said, a handy butterfly-effect can easily produce as non-rehash a story as what you are proposing. My /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/ has basically nothing to do with the canon plotline by now, except (as it happens) that there still will be a Tournament, yet I've done all I could to contradict no piece of canon known to me.

** Ron/Hermione fics that accurately portray what could be considered a dysfunctional relationship. Personally I have no issues with the pairing and think they could work but totally understand how their personalities would make them a disaster of a couple so I wouldn't mind reading realistic fics that go this way. I know this might be controversial and I'm not saying this is my headcanon or anything, but in a world where Ron/Hermione don't work well, I could see Ron cheating. He has always been insecure of his place in the world and after the war, suddenly he is very famous and desired. His spats with Hermione make him feel unappreciated or undervalued, and suddenly the attention other women show him is very tempting.

That's basically the plot of half of the postwar Hermione stories where she is not with Ron in the end. Ron likes the fame, he cheats, she ends up with Harry (somewhat understandable) or Malfoy (because dating someone who wanted you murdered countless times is a good idea).

**** Oh definitely, but I rarely see it used in what's essentially a fic about their relationship, not Hermione's with Draco, Harry or someone else. I don't think there's enough realistic depiction of their relationship that aren't actually about another relationship and aren't just a bashing of Ron or Hermione.

*** I might help you with that since I am writing a mystery/adventure story which begins at Slughorn's Christmas party and diverges from there on into an international murder/intrigue mystery. The only station of canon used is the party and even that one goes completly different. I try to come up with worldbuilding to cover most of Europe in a meaningful way and not just "England is a backwater, France has hot Veelas and the US is the best". Stuff like two Greek governments trying to discredit each other (new Greek State established around the turn of the 19th century and returned Byzantine Exiles), the Romanovs purging magic from their lands, a magical equivalent of the Holy Roman Empire with the same basic structure (Electors, an Emperor, fragmented lands instead of a unified government). And instead of the "good" and "bad" guys, everyone is acting in their own interest. And between all of that is Harry, trying to make sense of the mess around him.

I would enjoy canon-divergences where Sirius doesn't die, Harry becomes more involved with the Order of Phoenix post GoF, the war takes place over a longer period of time and/or is described in more detail, Voldemort isn't as goofily killed as he was in canon(I hate that part), Granger stays the hell away from Ron, and Ginny from Harry, each can date anyone else, but I hate those pairings, they make no *** sense.

And why not? Given that the only one who could challange him in a fair fight had died and the official government had fallen, there was very little point for the average citizen to fight. Given the ruthlessness and brutality of the average Death Eater as well as their ability to kill, resistance, at least in such an open fashion, was futile. Most people have no idea how to fight with magic and learning that takes considerably more time and than to learn how to shoot a gun (which is what real life resistance movements did) and you might very well still be too weak to put up a fight because there is no easy force multiplier for magic.

Any normal person would have either accepted the change of government or simply fled the Isles.

** I would love to see some fics that deal with the Wizarding World at War. Most stories involving the war involve Super OP! Godlike Harry/Hermione.

In order to write a child hero you have to have some level of adult incompetence. I would like to see a war lead by Kingsley and Moody. Or one over the 1st war, where both sides actually know what they are doing. If one side of a conflict just vastly out talents the other, then that conflict ends pretty quickly. In canon we know that Voldemort went to school while Dumbledore was worried about Grindewald. Voldemort then went about traveling the world and studying. When he did return he already had followers and more than likely he trained a lot of them to a high level of skill. He then preceded to wage active war for 11 years and before that people who could oppose him were disappearing for years. It seems like the WW had a lot of powerful and skilled wizards and witches to fight against him. Maybe Dumbledore was the only one he feared but there were probably an additional handful that he had respected before they were killed. Whether by his hand or a follower. I would like to see that. Preferably without the hold Lord trope that gets used so often. I want to see growth and exploration not plot armour and magical steroids.

A story built a lot like Tolkien, where the author finds it okay for the hero to become scarred, damaged, or even killed. That not everything is going to go perfect. In most fanfics any smart person becomes a super for some reason. There will always be someone who goes before you or comes after and becomes better at a certain skill, I understand that. What I would like to see is the adults take back the story. Build a world using magic outside of school and creative use of magic.

Also if the screaming and use of STUPIFY was not used in battles. Creative magic is so much better than, "Harry dodged and yelled 'Stupify' instantly destroying the shields of ten wizards who have decades of experience on him. Or Hermione walks up picks up a book and you get "She just cured cancer, solved the world's poverty issues, and created a potion that fixes the mind and body and makes you an animagus and metamorphagus. She also dispite showing zero athletic talent is the world's quickest dueler and knows every piece of magic and is the height of beauty and has never been wrong in her life." Oh and she is 15.
