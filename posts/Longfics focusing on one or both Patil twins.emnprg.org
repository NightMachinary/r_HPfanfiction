Looking for decent length fics which have either one or both of the Patil twins as important characters.


** I really liked linkffn(11858501), but it is unfinished (and with the last update 2017-04-03, it will probably never be finished). On the other hand, perhaps, it is right it has never really moved into that Avengers crossover. Ugh!

However, what we have is really nice, and the last chapter seemed to indicate nice story line, which I would like to see, but I have never seen developed. Yes, no spoilers.

  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.

** I don't remember the name of this fic but I think it was HG/DM and they end up working together as undercover spies for Harry (head of the DMLE maybe). One of the twins was a seer for a brothel owner and there was something about secrets being used to power a home. I think she ends up with Blaise but sees his death and her death. The evil forces are a “club” made up of old powers like Nicholas flamel.

Now that I've written that out, it sounds weird. I remember the story being decently long and obviously parts have stuck with me! If you're interested and no one else know what I'm talking about I'll see if it's in my reading history.

** ...

/sigh/

linkffn(8186071) is the only one I can think of. The fic itself is... well... you either love it or hate it I think is the safest way to describe it.

Padma is a part Harry's main group of friends, like canon's Ron and Hermione.

Warnings for Ron and especially Dumbledore bashing, and /heavy/ use of Indy!Harry tropes.

Edit:

Alternatively, Meaning of One Part 2 [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] and linkao3(11063298) I think make great use of Parvati and/or Padma in their stories, but not anywhere near the forefront.
