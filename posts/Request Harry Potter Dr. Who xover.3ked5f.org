*** Hmm Interesting I'm going to have to check those out. Do you know of any longer novel length ones or ones that have a higher rating?

  SEQUEL TO THAT WHICH HOLDS THE IMAGE. Life. All normal and stuff. With jobs and houses and boring-y, woring-y things like that. Normality, as Harry Potter realises, does not attract mad men in little blue boxes, so any hope of seeing his old friend the Doctor again is pretty slim. But then Ginny Weasley notices the sky is falling, and everything goes completely to hell.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  Out in the Universe is a bright blue box, holder of a fantastical realm. Inhabiting this box is a mad man who calls himself the Doctor, his son, the Savior of the Wizarding World aka Harry Potter, an immortal man from the 51st century who affects a Captain in front of his name, Jack Harkness, and a pink and yellow once-human who is simply Rose Tyler. What was Dumbledore thinking?

** If you want a really long read that's updated fairly regularly, there's linkffn(Visited by a Doctor). I haven't read it yet, but I've liked a couple one shots the author wrote.

** I have a sordid history with this particular crossover. Every time I'm looking for something to read I think, "Hang on, why haven't I ever read a HPxDH fic?" and then I have a look at the "best" fics on FF.net and I remember why.

All I want is for a simple premise:

Female character from HP world gets sent to DH world somehow and meets the Doctor. The Doctor has *no knowledge of magic* and is intially very wary and dismissive of it. Female from HP world is likewise dismissive and (depending who it is) hostile towards technology, especially the TARDIS.

Travel time and space, saving people, getting into arguments about whether magic or tech is better e.t.c.

Surely not that difficult of a premise? Not for the HPxDH community on FF.net, there is always some annying detail in most of those fics that just kills my desire to read more.

It's such a shame.
