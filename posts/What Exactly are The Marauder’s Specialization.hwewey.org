We hear that Lily and James were, either canon or fanon, excellent at Charms and Transfiguration respectively, but what about the other three? We never really had background skills regarding Sirius, Remus, nor Peter.

Considering that the Mauraders were skilled in their own right, what are their specialities?

Ps: it has been a while since I've read the books or so. So anecdotes or citations will really be appreciated.


** The best wizards seem to be generalists. Specialization seems to be a mark of a inferior wizard. Look at how Neville and his grandmother only passed either Charms or Transfiguration but not both. James was said to be especially good at transfigurations, but Sirius and James were said to be exceptional students, scoring Os easily. I think that while they may have had preferences for specific fields, they were skilled in all of them. Look at how Sirius /conjured nonverbally after years in azkaban with a poorly-matched wand/.

Lupin seems to struggle a bit more; he needs to study more than Sirius or James. That isn't to say he wasn't skilled at magic, however. It does seem that he may have had an inclination for Defense because of his own affliction.

Peter seems fairly skilled as well, if not on the level of the other three. Peter brews Voldemort's potion and helps him with the ritual. Peter casts spells competently throughout the books.

** James is said to be good at transfiguration, no one ever comments about Lily in charms but it's safe to assume she was good, although her specialty seemed to be potions. Pottermore lists Sirius as charms and nonverbal magic, and I think it lists Remus as Defense Against the Dark Arts. I don't know about Peter, he's just hanging there. So, James transfiguration, Lily potions, Remus defense, Sirius maybe charms, Peter is unknown.

*** Yes. That's what I normally read throughout the fandom. Remus more of a generalist.

If that was the case, we can assume that Sirius, took lead in the map then considering and assuming it is mosltly Charms work.

Then James took the lead with the animagus project since its mostly transfiguration.

I'm genuinely curious as to what Peter brought to the table. There wasn't much known regarding him other than the obvious things that the books tell us.

**** Animagus transformation is actually mostly potions. Slughorn comments on Sirius's abilities in potion-making and calls him talented, so maybe Sirius spearheaded that. I went into more depth about it [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/&ved=2ahUKEwiIxKTfuOPqAhVJs4sKHToCAvYQFjAAegQICxAB&usg=AOvVaw0WqQna-QjHUcTN8gA3JhzL][here]]. Although I personally believe it was more of a group effort in all parts, because Rowling calls the map a testament to the ability of the four of them.

I like to believe Peter was good at Care of Magical Creatures and that being animagi was his idea as a result. Because I love the idea of Peter having an integral part in accepting Lupin. But yeah, your interpretation makes sense. Do you have any headcanons about Peter?

Edit: Since you asked for citations, I tried looking for that pottermore article, but I swear after pottermore became wizarding world it's not there anymore. I linked it in the post I linked, I think.

***** Actually I don't have any headcanon with regards to Peter. We can assume that he'a at least good with Potions considering he was the one who followed instructions/brewed the potion that Voldemort was resurrected in.

I think the most skilled Peter I saw was in the Prince of Slytherin series. Other than that, people always portrayed him in a bad light.

****** Try checking out the Unbroken Universe, he's an ambassador for the Department of International Magical Cooperation. I think my headcanon that he was good at Ancient Runes is an extension of that.

But yeah, potions seems about right, I guess. After all, McGonagall said he was hopeless at duelling and transfiguration, nothing about potions, but it seems to have stretched into talentless everything.

**** My headcanon is that Peter was good at drawing (did the fancy artwork for the Map), /and/ turned out to be oddly gifted at Divination. This would be a skill his friends might consider useless, but one that Voldemort was probably terribly interested in, after learning about the prophecy.

****** This is exactly my point, and I guess why it was out of left field that, in universe, the people did not expect Peter to betray them.

He was just literally ‚Äòthere'.

Also I doubt Dumbledore will recruit him other than the other Mauraders vouching for him. He was deep undercover so he had to have some skills of use.

Edit: corrected a linking verb.

******* I thought he was targeted by Voldemort because of his association with the Order. So, an average wizard all around but useful for information. I suppose he's also quite insecure (humble?) and eager to help.

******** I'm actually not sure ,or if it was I do not remember, if this was explored in canon regarding why it was Peter that was targeted. I do remember in PoA that, during the Shack encounter, Voldemort was too powerful and was inevitable that he would win that's why he switched.

He feared for his life and his sickly mother at that time iiirc.

** There are no evidences from Canon, but I like to think that Peter was the cunning one from the group. What he lacked in talent, he compensated in ideas. His animagus form also probably helped a lot in their explorations of the school (and the creation of the Maraudeur's map).

Also, I don't think he was that bad at magic. It's just hard to be compared to people like Sirius and James, who were extremely talented. He was probably average or (considering the average level of wizards) above average.

*** Don't be so quick to discount the no evidence, yours is a really solid theory, the entire fact that he /was/ the spy and nobody suspected him is enough evidence to support it. He was also a hatstall between Gryffindor and Slytherin, the latter clearly has cunning as a characteristic ;)

I agree about Peter being not untalented, I also think he was overshadowed by Sirius and James especially, although Lupin was no slouch either. Given his feats in canon, I like to think he was firmly above average, he's just unassuming, which is why people called him a bit slow. Actions speak louder than words for me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** Him being a spy doesn't mean that he was not average, it means that he's just charismatic enough, or anti-charismatic even, to convince people that he isn't what they thought.

We never really saw how good he was compared to the others. He might be a generalist too.

***** I was saying it's supportive of the cunning part, who came up with ideas, not his talent.

Yeah, I was theorising why so many others called him a talentless lump for PoA ended, so we don't really know what his real talent is. But maybe we can infer with some backing from the text that he was bad at duelling and defence, not the best at transfiguration and good at everything else! He has too many fears to ignore.

****** Ohhhh! I like the fact that Peter was the Maurader's idea guy. Like he was the one who pitched the map or some of their pranks.

You can say, headcanon, that he was the mastermind of most pranks and the others were just the executors. That I can see within his character with him dropping hints like ‚Äòwe should do this/that,' and the fall guys will be Sirius or James.

******* Absolutely! I don't believe for a second that they kept him around just for the aesthetic of four friends. I genuinely believed he brought something to the table, like worming their way out of trouble or maybe (hehe) he was an escape artist. I just feel like him being evil before the betrayal is really cheap, since it really hurt Sirius and they genuinely trusted him.

I like to think Peter's Muggle father was out of the picture (I'm just that unoriginal), and he lived with his witch mother and squib aunt and sister. The idea of Peter growing up in a female household is really nice to me if portrayed from the hilarity angle, especially if he's their errand boy/tease machine.
