Things like ballpoint pens and typewriters and they talk about the precision required to make the ballpoint part of the pen, and all the little pieces of the typewriter, the complexity of which is comparable to high end magical artifacts since most magical devices are just regular things with one or two moving parts that just have a bunch of spells on them.

The purebloods are shocked by aluminum cans of rootbeer, or a cheap pair of binoculars with a better magnification than those recording devices from book four. And don't even get me started on the mechanics of lift and airfoils!

Something like what you'd find on [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]]


** There was something like this on Tumblr years ago but it wasn't Harry or Hermione but some other Muggleborn students not from Harry's generation. I'll try to find that post.

** I mean wizard's use clocks and sometimes cars so it's not like they don't get exposed to muggle tech.

It's mostly that the stuff they already have is 'good enough' and there is little point in having anything more - i.e. a typewriter? That stuff sucks balls. Sure, you'll write faster than with a quill... if you practice a ton. Just better to get speech-to-ink charm on a quill if you're in a hurry. And if their regular quill has some minor magic on it writing with one is propably comparable to using a fountain pen, so it's pretty decent.

Cans? That's a disgrace. Bottled drinks are always better than canned ones, and more comforetable to boot - a pureblood would be disgusted by one if anything.

Binoculars? They have telescopes. And i'm pretty sure their version is better.

And, well, you don't need classical mechanics if you can just violate all the other ones as well with a 7 year long education and a wand.

*** I disagree with your statement about cans. Canned drinks are always better because the plastic from the bottled one's name bottled drinks taste funny

**** But the glass bottles sodas taste the best. Especially the glass bottled coke.

***** I will agree that the glass bottles are better. But most sodas don't come in glass bottles. Usually its plastic these days. And there are some sodas that taste better in cans like Dr. Pepper

****** The german root beer brands (Karamalz and Vitamalz) are better from cans too but nowadays u find them almost everywhere only in bottles, plastic and glass...
