Let's be real, the original reasons for setting up the Statute are all but obsolete. The only remaining strong reason - that Muggles would demand too much of magical folk - I find to be utterly selfish bollocks. To me the Statute does little but hold back the progress of humanity as a whole, and if it were up to me I know there'd be a rocky transitional period but I'd vote to have it taken down every time.

So does anyone have fics that toss the SoS in the trash? During, before, it doesn't matter. Also if it were real-world up to you would you keep it or get rid of it?


** I think the SoS is fundamental to wizardkind having a sense of identity. Also, it was implemented in a time when firearms were barely a thing, and nowadays, muggles are very adept in the art of killing. They kill other muggles just for different religious beliefs and different skin color, so if you add in a whole group of people that are fundamentally different with powers they cant understand, it seems like a hotbed for trouble.

** On the opinion- I'd keep it. I think the Statute was implemented for the sake of the muggles more than anything, and I think having wizards not screwing with their world allowed science to bloom. Since the rules weren't being bent or broken all over the place, they could finally figure out some of the more subtle things like germ theory, radiation, atoms and molecules and evolutionary biology.

That's not supported by the books, which have the upper echelons of Muggle government perfectly aware of the existence of magic and yet content to let them govern themselves (though the way the British ministry is named, they might on paper be subject to the Queen).

And if all wizards were to die for some reason or another, then what? What'll happen to all this magically aided 'progress'? We'd be more or less back to square one, that's what.

** War would ensure. There is simply no chance in hell that the unveihling of the magical world would go without trouble.

It all really depends on who fights in these wars. If massive powerblocks like the USA, the EU, Russia or China are seeing the advantage in having wizards and witches on their side and not fight them, magicals would eventually become a ruling class.

If war is waged against them, wizards either emerge as a ruling class or a slave class. It all really depends on how quick military protocols and technology can adapt to the new threat. Given how fast that is done in real life, I'd wager a guess that in less than a few months, militaries would have some sort of weapon against magicals.

For one scenario I can offer you a one-chapter start to one of my own fics. Its currently being written, but as I write really fragmented chapters, the online part is only one chapter in. Its completely OC, just so you know. linkffn(11666708)

You have of course the religious zealots first. For them magic is against their god, so thats one huge pile of muggles against magicals. Then you have the big uneducated mass. If they are told that magic is dangerous, they'll believe it. And fact of the matter is that magic is freakin dangerous, for magicals themselves and especially for those who aren't. So you don't even have to tell the public a lie about magic. You could tell them about Legilimency, Obliviation, Reducto Curses, Dragons, Dementors, Draught of the Living Dead,... and you'd have one huge mass of people calling for A) the regulation of magic or B) the extermination of magic. Then you have the elite - industrials, finance,..., who're then told that the basis of their wealth, capitalism, may find a near end because with a wave of a few thousand wands, consumerism no longer depends on production. Industry after industry would fall prey to magic and /that/ is when magicals are fucked. When the elite calls for your head, the politicians will follow.

And it only needs one Ministry to obliviate the president/chancellor and the muggles getting wind of that and you have even the political elite calling for the wizard's heads.

I'm just judging from what I see every day in the news. Magic is strange and dangerous. Magic destroys the economy and jobs. Magic can take your free will, freedom and rights. Magic combines in itself everything people are waging war over - /literally everything/. Religion, Power, Money. How can you not expect a war?

See, here you start making a point. And true - I said it would be a rough transition period, but it ultimately depends on how it's initially handled. After all, I could replace all that put together with "nukes" and have a real world situation that's arguably more terrifying for the average person, yet the public trusts the government and other countries with weapons of mass destruction without batting an eye because of the propaganda of the fifties and sixties.

#+begin_quote

I personally don't give a single fuck about capitalism, so I'm a bit biased here. The truth is that the elite would be the ones that would end up controlling these new influences on the economy anywhere, marketing unbreakable products and superlight devices and so on. Hell, in my opinion they'd be /ecstatic/ that they can drop production costs to near zero and still control supply (look at things like IP). I don't see why the answer here is violence over investment, especially when it comes to the military, but okay.

Funny enough, it's the existence of fictional universes like the Marvel multiverse and the A:TLA universe that don't hide their metahumans behind convenient barriers to avoid examining the interaction between the mundane and the, well, not-mundane that got me thinking about the Statute of Secrecy. And I enjoyed the Civil War comic run, although I'm still slightly ambivalent on that one (if you held a gun to my head I'm Team Cap though).

Part of my dislike for it is that the fandom (as evidenced by this thread) is so far into our heroes' heads that we've started thinking of Muggles - let's be real, ourselves - much the way that magical folk do: as charming oddities to be protected but at the same time worth less than magical people. Because see, I think Muggles deserve to know if there is a group of magicals siccing Dementors of them or plotting to throw them into concentration camps and set a totalitarian government over them. They deserve to know exactly what threat they're facing and (choose to) take steps against it themselves, not sit in ignorance and let questionably competent vigilantes fight on their behalf. Muggles are an almost faceless block that's entirely without agency in Rowling's narrative, and it's kind of a cop-out in my opinion.

** It must be done! For the Greater Good!!

Honestly, I see very little chance of this /not/ ending with a huge number of (mostly muggle) deaths, but if you want a rather optimistic view of things (at least as far as the statute is concerned), I would recommend [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12266&chapter=all][Counting to Five Thousand]]. It is short (around 12k words) and not the most realistic, but it got me rather emotional (and dare I say... hopeful?) when I first read it. Would recommend.

The Imperius Curse might as well be called the Automatic Victory Curse. As in Muggles can't resist it whatsoever, and thus an Imperius'd Muggle would be at the mercy of their controller. I think many people forget that the Imperius Curse is far, far stronger than it may look, and has no limits whatsoever other than it can be resisted (by an wizard with a exceptionally strong will)

It would be as simple as:

- Imperio a whole bunch of high-ranking military/government officials in a country (Imperio can be used on multiple people).

- Said Imperio'd people are at a wizard's mercy until either the caster willingly ends the spell or the one under Imperio resists it (which is said to be very hard to do). Since Muggles aren't magical, and resisting the Imperius Curse is a form of magic, Muggles can't resist the Imperius Curse so Imperio is basically an instant victory against muggles.

- Statute of Secrecy never breaks since the now-Imperio'd Muggle higher-ups cover everything up. If it was broken, it is now repaired. As far as Muggles know, anything magical can be handwaved as "Photoshop", "Special Effects", "Fake", "Gas Pipe Explosions", or some combination of those things... and the latter was an actual canon excuse to explain how Wormtail killed the 13 Muggles.

- Have the Imperio'd Muggles tell the wizarding world everything about the Muggle World that is relevant. Since the Muggles are military/government officials, they would know a lot.

- Thanks to the Imperio'd Muggles, the Wizards can then just create counters to said AI and create more counters to the usual muggle weapons (e.g. nuclear weapons), assuming they didn't have counters to the latter already.

- If the Prime Minister/President/Monarch of a country was Imperio'd (which they would be), they would be forced to give up any nuclear weapons they had... which could then used to wipe out Muggles. If wizards didn't already know about nuclear weapons from being a muggleborn or halfblood, then they would learn once they are told what they are.

- If any Muggle would attempt to destroy the wizarding world, they can just be Imperio'd into total submission, Obliviated, or just killed off. This isn't even mentioning the obvious solution of "let the Dementors feed on the souls of all the Muggles" given that Muggles can't do anything to a Dementor.

- Rinse and repeat as need be.

*TL;DR: Imperius = Automatic victory for wizards. I think people underestimate just how powerful wizards are. All it takes is just 1-2 wizards in each country capable of using the Imperius Curse (since Draco could do the Imperius Curse at 16, then pretty much any wizard aged 16 or older can use the Imperius Curse) for Muggles/technology to never be a threat.*

** You seem very convinced that muggles and magicals would work together to form a perfect society. You'd be wrong. All you have to do is quite literally look at the world today. Voldemort and his followers kill a bunch of people at a muggle concert. People don't just blame them they blame all magicals. Look at how the world reacts to terrorist attacks by islamic extremists and that's exactly how they would react to magical extremists.

Also you're talking about a hidden society with their own governing bodies within sovereign nations. Do you see the Ministry of Magic just packing up shop because now they should be part of the Muggle government and answer to them? Do you see the magical people getting fair representation in the Houses of Parliament when they make up such a small portion of the population?

How do you think the world would react to knowing that school children have weapons of mass destruction at their fingertips when we don't even trust them to drive cars?

**** I think the problem is that technology is ill-defined in the series. A car has complicated machineries with fine tolerances but it works fine and even the ministry use them. A radio (which is not particularly complicated or easy to damage) can't survive in Hogwarts.

I think the easiest explanation is one I read in a fanfic once: the wizarding world hates muggles technology and they employ house elves to look through muggleborn children's trunks and sabotage their tech to keep the lie alive that they won't work. Also there have to be tons of compulsions and confundus charms involved, Hermione Granger never even tried to bring an actual pen or pad of paper into Hogwarts which makes me suspicious that mjnd magic is involved.

Harry has performed magic at Privet Drive, and so has Dobby, and their tech is fine.

Though I think what Rowling actually said was that only really, really magical places like Hogwarts have that effect on tech, which would explain why the car failed when it crossed into the Hogwarts grounds
