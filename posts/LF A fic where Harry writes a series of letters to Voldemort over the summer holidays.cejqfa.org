I cannot find nor remember the name of this fic, although I remember several details about it. I remember that Harry is with the Dursleys for the summer and that Dumbledore has set up wards around the house to prevent him from writing anyone he doesn't personally consider a friend, so he starts to write Voldemort to pass the time and he actually responds. I remember that eventually the wards start trying to prevent his letters because he's actually beginning to think of the Dark Lord as a friend, and I think that it /may/ have wandered into Harry/Voldemort towards the end? Although I'm not sure on that. I don't remember whether or not it was good so I can't give you a quality spectrum to look for. Thank you!

** Do you remember what year of school he goes into after the summer? Or is the fic solely about the summer, and not include school at all?

*** No, he does get back to school. I want to say it's the summer after fifth year but that's mainly just a guess.
