Has anyone wrote a fic about Luna's adventures post-Hogwarts? Rowling has insinuated that Luna travels the world finding new magical species after school (even meets and marries Newt Scamanders Great Grandson during one of her exploits). I'd love to read "Luna Lovegood and the last El Tunchi of the Amazon", "Luna Lovegood and the Curse of the Bestyia" etc.

It's actually Teddy Lupin-centric, as he goes on a trip with Luna over the summer. Animal hunting and Scamander meeting abounds!

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin is sixteen and his hopeless crush on Victoire has sent him into an epic sulk. As a distraction from his romantic angst, Luna invites him to tag along on an international expedition to catalog the mysterious and magical jackalope. Together they cross the sea, travel through the Arizona desert, and encounter new people and legendary creatures, and along the way, Teddy deals with his past - the parents he lost, and the things he would have liked to know about them - with help from an unexpected direction. He also discovers that perhaps there are girls out there who are much scarier than Victoire, but that even they are not so very difficult to talk to...A Teddy-centric fic, with a romantic b-plot about the courtship of Luna and Rolf, and lots of Remus/Tonks allusions.
