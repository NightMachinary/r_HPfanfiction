Hey... I'm desperately looking for a James and Lily fanfic that I read quite a while ago. The only scene that I remember from the fic is this:

Everyone in the Gryffindor common room is shouting "KISS KISS" and then Remus (I'm 90% sure it was him) kisses Lily. James is heartbroken and decides to leave. Sirius stops him and James says that he has "head student" (ya it actually said head student and not head boy) duties and walk out. A while later Lily comes out and asks him as to what duties were to be done.

That's all I remember...

I've been searching for more than a few days now.... Really really need someone to just help me out here.. Almost in tears.! :'(
