So I've had that thought for a while, I was toying with the idea of writing a short horror story that takes place in the HP universe/wizarding world.

It doesn't have to involve any of the original HP characters (actually it would preferably include a completely original cast). I was trying to maybe involve dementors, vampires, hags, inferi, horcruxes, etc. Maybe even set it somewhere other than Britain, like the US or Russia.

Any ideas?


** It would depend on what vibe of horror you're going for. Personally, I love the more psychological side of the genre with a dash of creature or monster.

I'd likely do something like these:

- A family, alone and isolated in the middle of the woods, is hunted by werewolves. Just as they think they've beaten them out, one of them starts having strange reactions after an attack.

  - Could be a muggle family to up the strength of the werewolves; they might not even know of magic or their only magic user is a first year with limited knowledge.

- A falsely accused and incarcerated inmate of Azkaban struggles to remain themselves amongst the vilest of the wizarding kind.

  - The character would be facing, not only dementors, but the other inmates, themselves, and, likely, human guards (if you decide to add them).

- A muggle, with no knowledge of magic, has their memory altered by a magical folk with an unhealthy interest in the mind.

  - Think mad scientist experimenting on an unconsenting party.

** I love it.

A few ideas mentioned were already really cool, but what about a house infested by (a) boggart(s). It could be a muggle or a wizard who doesn't know what he's dealing with, thinking he's hallucinating.

Some lovecraftian style fics are already out there and I really love those too.

Maybe a dark wizard experimenting with inferi - I remember a fic in which Voldemort made Mr. Granger into an inferi and sealed an alive Mrs. Granger inside his corpse. Creepy as fuck.

Also what could be rather funny would be a fic about a Muggle moving into a new flat. Overtime, he realizes he is losing time. Sometimes he finds himself in his home, wearing different clothes then when he left, his phones don't work as they should - ringing at odd times etc. - he misses work, he remembers being in the city and then wakes up at home. Sometimes food in the fridge is gone even though he doesn't remember eating it. And the more he tries to find out what's going on, the more often he loses time. He finds notes in his flat - obviously written by himself - with clues on them and warning him about maybe an abandoned building across from him. Overall he freaks out and his friends think he's crazy.

The end reveal is, that he moved in right across from some Wizard building - Like the Ministry of Magic or the house of some wizarding family with kids - and whenever someone slips up, they obliviate him or confund him into forgetting what he saw what he was doing.

You could do some cool thing with a group of curse breakers raiding an ancient tomb, (remember the holidays of the Weasleys in egypt with the skeleton in the pyramid with multiple heads) only to be cursed one by one or eaten by inferi or other nefarious creatures.

I mean there are a lot of Dark creatures you could use, kelpies luring someone in to drown, hinkypunks getting people to get lost, werewolves hunting ppl.

Overall you could also write about the first wizarding war - the people who lived in the villages that were raided by Death Eaters.

Also a conservative Muggle family discovering their child can do magic - thinking it is possessed by a demon

Also we know from certain canon mentions of Sirius Black talking about his aunt, that Muggle hunting was a rather popular sport among certain crowds

You could do a thriller about a magical serial killer (what can you force ppl to do under the imperius)

Also I read a fic recently in which Narcissa mentions a room in Malfoy Manor in which you can hear movement if you press your ear to the ground and an unknown creature roams. Death Eaters have to spend a night in there as initiation. Snape then says in the fic, that he was 17 and that he made a warding circle and hid under his cloak, not daring to look at what was roaming there until it left. I find this intriguing. Overall the idea of a Death Eater initiation sounds rather cool. You could write about some arrogant kid who wants to become one, but gets super disturbed by the initiation and flees or smth.

Edit: in addition if you want it to play in another part of the world maybe consider adding creatures from the native legends. Like Wendigos for America or so
