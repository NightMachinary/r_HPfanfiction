I'm looking for books in which people time travel generations. Like golden trio meeting marauders or the next gen meeting young golden trio, etc(either generation can time travel)

Please don't suggest fics which focus on romance. Minimal romance is ok but without weird pairings like Hermione/Sirius or Hermione/Snape etc.


** Possibly one of the most recommended fics that meets your requirements is linkffn(Basilisk-Born).

It is time travel and visits multiple generations. It can be a tough start but after two chapters or so you get used to the prose and it really hooks you (kind of like reading Tolkien). It isn't complete yet though.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** The only stories I know of are HP and the Freak Parade: linkffn(3022004) and A Long Journey Home: linkffn(9860311).

HP and the Freak Parade goes by the adage that you literally can't change history.

A Long Journey Home goes by the fact that the MC actively tries to avoid changing history by not being near events that they are aware of in order to avoid changing it.

***** Predestination paradox is based on a theory that you can't change the past and all things that a time traveler does in the past were always part of history. I don't see how the length of the time jump affects it.

For example, Harry travels to the Founders Era and, to his surprise, finds out that Godric Gryffindor is just as bigoted as Salazar and also only accepts purebloods. Through his time there, Harry convinces Godric to abandon the prejudice and causes Salazar to flee Hogwarts. Nothing is changed, because his actions were always part of history.

Another a bit closer example: Harry goes through the photo album of his parents and noticed an unknown boy in some school photos with them and wonders who he is. He later accidentally temporarily travels to the Marauder's Era, where Dumbledore sets him up as a transfer student and changes his looks, so no one asks why he looks so much like James Potter while he's still there. When Harry looks in the mirror, to his surprise, he recognizes the boy in the photos. Turns out it was him all along. Him being in the past is already a part of his past, so his presence there doesn't change anything.

****** It's just that the author has to plan absolutely everything in advance. If the character jumps back a few hours and all the complicated time stuff happens within one chapter, that's possible, but if you have decade long time travel then pretty much the entire thing has to be planned out to ridiculous detail before the first chapter can be released. Good luck.

******* But why would it need to be planned out to ridiculous detail? I just though up those 2 examples on the spot and it's just a rough outline. Establish some event in the past or take one from canon, which we don't know much about, then have the protagonist time travel and cause it. Actually, the concept is used in the fic I linked earlier in this post "Timely Errors" by Worfe, so it's not like it's impossible.
