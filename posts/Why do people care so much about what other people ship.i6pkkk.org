Really, shipping/pairing wars are so stupid. Don't like it, don't read it and don't insult the ones who do. Like it, just enjoy it and don't shove it down other people's throats.

It doesn't matter if doesn't make sense to you or if you're squeamish about some things, just don't read it. I kinda wanna puke when someone pulls the "it doesn't work in canon" card. It's fanfiction, the very own premise of this shit is to not be canon, so the point is moot.

It is ok to not like somethings or have strong feelings and opinions about them, but to persecute people who are just trying to enjoy the content makes you an arsehole. Example: I don't like Harry/Tonks, I don't read Harry/Tonks, I don't think they would fit in well together for x, y and z. It is completely fine if you do like Harry/Tonks tho. See how easy it is not to be a piece of shit? No need to attack the ones who like the ship nor the ones who write that type of content ;)

To each their own.

That's all, folks!


** Generally speaking, I don't. I've seen some crazy ships over time that I wouldn't go near, but which others love. And I've been subject to this myself -- having preferences that others wouldn't touch with a 20 foot pole.

Shipshaming is IMO the worst part of the HP fanfiction community (and probably other fanfiction communities as well -- I just don't happen to be part of them), and only serves to drive people away from it.

However, there are cases where you want to know what someone ship. For instance, let's say there's an author with a good and interesting story, but where the ship(s) in the fic is unclear, but the fic isn't gen. This may attract people that end up detesting the future ship, causing them to stop reading in disappointment. In cases like this, knowing what the author ships beforehand would have helped a lot. There are ships, including "reasonable" ships (ships that are almost universally liked) that I can't stand. I'd want to know if an author is going to write such a ship before I start reading a fic, so I don't end up leaving halfway in.

** Some people honestly think that you should write the stories they want to read, not stories you want to read. They honestly think you writing a story they hate somehow hurts them.

So, in their fucked-up worldview, every story that they don't like is a story they like that wasn't written - a loss, actually.

** Most people don't care about other ships...they'll give their opinion if asked but otherwise they do their thing.

The issue is the, for lack of a better word, assholes who seem to take slights on their favorite character or pairing as a personal insult and can't seem to handle others having a differing opinion. You've seen it here the last few days where a couple of folks who are obsessed with their dislike of Harmony and do everything they can to whip everyone else into a frenzy about it. There are plenty of Harmony shippers that are just as adamant on the other side.

Every fandom has the immature folks who want to make everything personal and an argument...it's just the way it is.

****** You're full of shit. Don't try and split hairs with me about how it's not necessarily pedophilia when we both very well know most of it is. I tried looking a couple years ago after I'd run across a shockingly decent Tom/Harry time travel fic thinking that maybe I'd misjudged and most of what I found was 30+ year old snape fucking a sub 17 Harry. It's disgusting and your pathetic attempts at running defense for it without overtly seeming to remind me of when aspiring nonces try to bring up the age of consent.

There are definitely good, non-creepy/pedophilic Snarry and Snamione fics too. I don't think it's fair to jump on someone for using them as an example of ships that get shit on and assume they're defending all the awful fics that use those ships too.

******* Oh my, aren't you in a fit? Just fucking chill, man. Because post-war fanfics aren't a thing, huh? Neither are eight-year, time-travel, post-hogwarts, time-skips(because canon didn't skip 19 years, no sir), so on so forth. And I am sure you looked over all the 10k+ fanfics out there... I'm not the one full of shit. You can't judge the whole ship over these fanfics when I'm tired of seeing Harry rape a lot of his love interests in a fucking lot of fanfics but somehow his pairings aren't sullied with that knowledge.

Add in a handful of defensiveness, a bit of the devil's advocate and the ease of screeching anonymously on the internet and voila, ship-wars as far as the eye can see.

It's absurd. Imaginary dolls are literally one of the most meaningless things in the universe to fight about.

** It's easier to understand because the series is over now: back in the earlier days of the fandom, when the series wasn't complete, shipping was the central aspect of fanfiction because what else is there to work with? There was actually a ton of toxicity over different ships, way more than anything in the fandom right now.

If anything, HP fanfic has shifted massively away from strict canon-compliance and ship-centric fics, and I really haven't seen too many ship-specific writers or readers recently on this community in particular. Sorry that you've experienced this pettiness, I thought we were past that in 2020.

** It's so weird how recently there were quite a few posts that seemed to be a bate for arguments or maybe a way for a person to insult others. I honestly don't understand how people still think they are so superior to everyone else because they believe that those who like this or that non-canon ship are just crazy. I have a ship I like but I'll nevr say it here because I know that it's bound to attract some crazy person. And if it's not going to turn into ship shaming, I'm still not going to risk it. Even the questions why people like this or that ship seem to be just bate. I mean, in most cases it's not so difficult to figure out why people like something. I've seen maybe one post that genuinely wanted an answer to this question without sounding as though the person actually thought those who like the ship are dumb and just wanted to let them know. I don't like ships with Greyback,for instance. And as I don't read stories about them, I'm not certain what attracts authors to such ships, but I'm not going to insult anyone. Now everyone is so convinced their opinion is the most important and certainly the right one that people stop being reasonable. I'd love to see them throwing insults at people in reality the way they do that on the Internet.

** As a serious answer. I think its because some people get too emotionally invested in the characters. Its almost like a bleed between reality and fiction. They see themselves in Hermione, or see her as a friend, and therefore the idea of someone shipping Hermione with Draco horrifies them. Not that this is a conscious thought of "If I was Hermione I would never date a former/junior Death Eater" but a subconscious distaste for it that feels more personal than it really should. Because it feels personal they react with emotion, and you get shipping wars.

When reading ships like that(i.e. snarry, snamione, Sirius/Hermione, Tomione, Tom/Harry.......), and the youngest part of the ship happens to be too young(under 18), I will nope the fuck out of it, unless it is seen like a wrong thing within the fanfic. But I don't find it fair to attack the whole pairing/people who like the pairing because of it.

I mean, disagree with people, avoid the ship like a plague, discuss why you didn't like it, say you think that and that, but the need to attack people is just petty.

Oh my, I went into a mini rant, so sorry hahah

** Should people discuss things in a civil manner? Absolutely.

Should people stop discussing Harry Potter fanfic and cease sharing their different opinions? Absolutely not.

The whole purpose of this place is to discuss Harry Potter, which inevitably means people with different opinions interacting and disagreeing with each other. If encountering politely expressed opinions which are different to your own is traumatic, then I'd suggest that a discussion board may not be for you.

Oh but that is exactly what I am defending. Things should be discussed and shared in a civil manner, because we all share a love for Harry Potter and no one's opinion is better than the other, they are just different.
