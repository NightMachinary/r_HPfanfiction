I'm looking for something where Harry, angered by the Wizarding World's actions against him after the Twiwizard Tournament, pretends Voldemort hasn't returned when everyone else knows otherwise. Basically a reverse.

Voldemort is attack families and the Ministry (Bonus if it's Fudge) asks Harry to support them against Voldemort and his Death Eaters and Harry pretends to not know anything about it. Telling them to stop lying.

Students at Hogwarts ask for Harry's help to protect themselves should Death Eaters come for their families or them and Harry adamantly refuses to believe that Death Eaters even exist.

Sooo... basically a Umbridge!Harry

“THAT IS A LIE!”


** "What are you going to do about You-Know-Who?" asked a student in Hufflepuff robes, poking him in the back.

"Who?" said Harry, turning around, looking at the staring Hufflepuffs sitting behind him at their table.

"You-Know-Who!"

"Er..." said Harry. He picked up his fork. That treacle tart looked good today. "I /don't/ know who."

"V-V---" said the Hufflepuff. "Vol... /thingy!/ He killed your parents!"

"Sorry to tell you this, but my parents died in a car crash," said Harry. He sighed and cut himself a slice of tart. "If you've heard anything else, whoever told you made it up for attention."

*** When he says "I don't know what you mean" he shoulda said "I don't know who"

** This sounds hilarious.

​

Like, Harry is the dog in those "this is fine" memes where everything is burning.

​

I love it.

​

Thanks for an excellent mental image. :)

** Sprinter1988's excellent "Junior" inquisitor fits that criteria to a degree. Sadly abandoned, but at over 200k words, still a good dive.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
