I know that it stands for the "Wrong Boy Who Lived" but I never read a single fic with that trope and considering how long the famous ones are, I don't really plan to go into any of them without prior knowledge since it doesn't seem like the kind of trope it would interest me. However, I would like to give some of them a shot and therefore I appeal to you. What does being the WBWL mean?

- Does it mean that Harry is the child of the prophecy but Voldemort misinterprets it and goes for another?
- Does it mean that there's another child, say Neville, that prophecy refers to but Voldemort goes for Harry?
- Does it mean that Voldemort attacks the wrong child but the child survives through some circumstances?
- Since many fics in this category involve Harry having a sibling, does it imply that Voldemort gets the mixed up?

And anyways, in this situation who is the WBWL and the actual BWL? The victim or the child of the prophecy?

Thank you for your help.


** It can mean a number of things, but the most common is that someone else (Harry's twin, sibling, or sometimes Neville) is known as the boy-who-lived, but the real boy-who-lives who is affected by the prophecy is actually Harry. So people are taking care of the sibling and protecting him, when it's really Harry who needs to be protected. Sometimes Voldemort knows who the real boy-who-lived is, sometimes not.

A very popular WBWL fic right now is Prince of Slytherin

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Usually it means another person is thought to be the BWL/GWL, but secretly it's Harry and no one knows (he probably learns at some point, and usually everyone does eventually). This is usually (tho not always) Neville or an OC sibling of Harry's. Methods usually involve having Harry and the other child be together the night Voldemort attacks, and although he attacks Harry, everyone thinks it was the other child who was chosen. I've seen this explained, for example, by the rubble of the house collapsing (after the AK) causing scarring on both children, and then dumbledore or whoever figures V was targeting that child. It can be a fun trope - and it's a particular fav of mine - but it often goes hand-in-hand with edgy, Indy!Harry/Grey!Harry tropes and bashing that can be offputting.

** Can't say I've followed any of them. I do quite like the Pureblood Pretense series, where there's no prophecy and no Boy-Who-Lived at all (but Harry comes into conflict with Tom Riddle anyway).
