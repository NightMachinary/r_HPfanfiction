:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fic I read some months ago, in which Harry pranks Dumbledore wearing a muggle Darth Vader costume. He swears his allegiance to "Emperor Dumbledor"(clearly he is one, sitting on a golden throne and what not) and proceeds to be "dark".

That's just one scene of a much more lengthy fic, but I can't remember the rest.


** I read this one and think that the scene with Darth Vader was what made me stop.

** I think Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk linkffn(9750991) is what you're looking for. Specifically [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/21/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Chapter 21]].

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** I want to say it's linkffn(Courage and Cunning by preciousann) but it's been a while since I read through it. That particular story contains a lot of pranks really.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

**** He's probably on par with Dumbledore (Salazar Slytherin was one of the greatest wizards of his time after all) and rather the expert on dark magic, but he doesn't get to use it much. Few of the problems in that fic get solved with simple violence and Voldemort is much more dangerous than canon too.
