Spells are apps that are downloaded to wands, and are such massive files that you can only have like 50 saved to a wand at a time. The constantly have to plug their wands into computers via USB ports to change out their spell lists. 'Magical Cores' are just the battery life of the wand, they need to be plugged in daily to maintain their charge.

​

Idea courtesy of some of my non-fanfic reading coworkers. They saw me reading HPFanfic at work and joked about what they would do with their own fanfic.


** This was it, the final battle. Voldemort and Harry were standing face to face, ready to duel.

There was no way this could end in defeat for the Dark Lord. He had the Elder Wand in his possession, he had his Horcruxes, he would be victorious!

The boy looked at peace with himself. Good, he will be meeting his maker soon enough.

As they raised their wands, Voldemort gleefully cast the Killing Curse.

/”Avada Kedavra!”/

Suddenly, his wand let out a sharp beep, as a small voice chirped out of its core.

/”Attention: You have exceeded your data usage of this spell, please pay 12 Galleons to add more storage capacity.”/

Voldemort could feel the power from his wand reverberate as the spell he had just cast rebound back towards himself.

** Isn't that like Thor? I think in the MCU, Asgard's magic is just very advanced tech

*** Yeah, but I think the fun it is would be imagining it with all the crazy limitations and how everyone tries to get around them.
