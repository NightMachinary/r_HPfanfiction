I myself got into HP Fanfiction after reading the Deathly Hallows. I wondered if there were any fan-written stories out there, and did a web search and found sites like FanFiction.Net and HPFanFicArchive. I got hooked when I realized there were literally thousands of fan-written Harry Potter stories out there. Since then, I have been an avid fanfiction reader and the line between canon and fanon has grown steadily more blurred (I believe there was a thread on this a little bit ago...)

So what made you get into fanfiction, or more specifically, HP fanfiction? Was it dissatisfaction with JKR's writing? Was it interest in a sequel? Or was it just simply wanting more of Harry Potter?


** I read My Immortal. It was amazing and after reading it, I looked for more fics to fill the void it left. I have yet to be satisfiied.

** I read the HP series quite late (December of 2013) when my close friend recommended it to me. I read the series in a week and a half during School term, which involved a lot of all-night reading sessions and dozing off in school. Afterwards, I watched all the films in a marathon with my friends. Once they were finished, though, I had a major "what the fuck do I do now" moment.

I started following Pottermore and going through every article that exists in the HP wikia. Then, in January, I read the article "Fanon" and was introduced to the concept of fanfiction. Read my first story (Nineteen Years by Tom Young) and realized how much potential fanfiction had. I started off, obviously with shit tastes, but slowly progressed from there.

Sorta went something like this:

Canon Compliant --> Dark Ages (SI, MarySue, OC, etc) --> H/Hr --> AU --> Today

Now, after two years of reading millions of words of fanfiction, I've refined my tastes (thankfully) to where I place quality of writing above preferences. I'm also fine with most pairings (I've finally made peace with R/Hr) as long as they're realistic and well-written.

** This is strange but...

At 13 I joined a rp forum. After a couple of months of roleplaying with an internet stranger they asked me to look over their fanfic (can't remember what it was now but I dont think it went anywhere). Started clicking around ff.net and fell heavy into the rabbit hole. This was about ten years ago and let me tell you the fanfiction back then was....strange to say the least.

****** No problem!

For one, linkffn(Retroactive by loopy777) is a brilliant piece of work. It has suspense, mystery, drama, action, and occasional comedy to spice things up. The same author has linkffn(Mai's Ramblings), which are sort of meta-commentary on basically all possible pairings in the fandom, narrated by Mai, in the style of Zero Punctuation's game reviews, /and/ linkffn(Lady On Fire), which also features Mai, though in a far less meta manner. And a collection of that author's oneshots and drabbles can be found at linkffn(The Ember Island Lighthouse: A Beacon of Insanity).

linkffn(Avatar Aang: An Annotated Bibliography) is a super-dry, super-interesting take on what future scholars in the Avatar universe would think about Aang and the events of ATLA. It was written before LoK, and is thus totally non-compliant with it.

linkffn(Lost In Translation) is a short fic that explores the different ways a creation story might be mangled by the propaganda machine of the Fire Nation.

linkffn(Bring Me All Your Elderly!) is basically "what if the Gaang go into the universe of the Shyamalan movie and try to correct it?" Again, it's brilliantly funny.

In my opinion, season 3 is the only one of LoK worth watching. I feel like 1 tried to do too much with the episodes it had, 2 was strange, and 4 was just a let down.

** I wasn't fully satisfied with the direction HBP and DH took and so I sought a fan-written material that could have provided me with a look at "how it should have ended".

I started reading a lot of Dark & Edgy fics that showed my favourite character, that of Dumbledore, in a really evil light, and I was like WOAH HOW DID I NEVER SEE THIS BEFORE??

Then I made a kind of 180 degree U-turn back to canon compliance. I've mostly stuck to fics with interesting plots, good action /or/ good romance (I tend to not like fics that blend both) and my reading preferences have progressively grown more and more AU. I think I'm on the tail-end of my time reading HP.

** I got into Harry Potter fanfiction in summer 2005 after Half-Blood Prince had been published and I had a load of free time after finishing my GCSEs. We're talking something like 10 weeks of summer holiday.

I started via Harry Potter discussion boards talking about the books and speculating about number 7. The main board I used was HPANA, and they had a fanfiction sub-forum. After a few weeks of pure discussion I wandered into the fanfic area and read a few things and followed a link to SIYE. After that I found my way to PhoenixSong.Net, then finally to FanFiction.Net.

A couple months later I saw DLP mentioned in a rant by Volorn666 in the author's note to his story Ascension of the Scorpion Sorcerer. The rest is history.

** My reading of fanfiction started with non HP stuff. I was actually reading fanfiction on dial-up before the first HP book was published. My first fandom's were the old Toonami shows, Dragonball Z, Gundam Wing, and also Sailor Moon. I don't honestly remember how I first came across fanfiction but I have snippets of stuff I tried to write as far back elementary school (1995 or so). I still have some old fanfics save on /floppy disks/ (I'm not joking about that).

When HP came out, it just seemed natural for me to look up fanfiction for it. By that time, sites like ffdotnet were getting off the ground and fanfiction was becoming less spread out around the internet. I don't have many stories favorited from that far back, but I've had my current ffdotnet account since 2002 (I had an earlier one but lost access to the email address it was under, and couldn't reset the password, sad days then).

I think part of the reason I've always been attracted to fanfiction is that I've always had an active imagination and loved to make up stories with the characters I was watchig/reading about in them.

I honestly can't remember what the first HP fanfic I read was. I've faved plenty over the years, I could probably figure it out from the date. Hold on I'm gonna go look... the /oldest/ HP fanfic (of the 86 I have faved on ffdotnet), is a crossover. "Harry Potter and the Super Saiyan Wizard" linkffn(2390160) Of course that wasn't the FIRST HP fanfic I read, just the oldest one I actually remembered to favorite :P

Overall, it's certainly become an obsession, though I haven't published any HP fanfiction yet, I do have some I'm working on.

/And also, reading some of the other responses makes me realize how long I've been on the internet. All you young'n's don't know how good you have it! :P/

*** Ha! Similar! I was introduced to the concept of fandom through Digimon (so this was like 2001) and dial up. Same about the totally shit fanfics on floppy discs (neon in my case lol). Too funny. So it was natural for me to go searching for stuff once Harry Potter entered my life, but I probably wasn't into HP fanfiction until high school and then took a long break from it because, adulting.

**** Haha, I have neon floppy's too! I also have a crap ton of floppy's from Digital because my mom used to work there :P So much crappy fanfiction!

I've never really taken a "break" from fanfiction, but I do go through phases with it. At this point I have nearly /seven hundred/ fanfics saved on ffdotnet. Some of them are saved for nostalgia even though their bad and some I could reread all the time.

SO many are unfinished though. :(

But I really love fanfiction and I find that it's a good way to destress at the end of a long day and just read something fun. If a fanfic can grab my interest and hold it, I enjoy reading it.

** Rewatched the movies for the second time and just felt sad that there were no more stories to find, so i went and looked for some. Found some really bad ones and a couple of ok ones (which then i found great) and started reading.

I think harry potter as such couldnt have been more tailored towards fanfication even if rowling really tried to. It just fits perfecrly and makes writing (and reading) very easy and thus there is so much of it.

** I was 10, DH had just been released, someone told me about fanfiction, I googled and started reading and never looked back.

Read a ton of Dramione and Wolfstar, then Drarry and Snarry. Used to actually look at the new queue, and had rather low expectations... I'd say the turning point of my fanfic experience was finding DLP - I was never an active member, but I lurked and proceeded to read every single fic rated four stars and above. Was disappointed when I finally finished everything, took a break from fanfiction because real life, and came back!

** Between GoF and OotP, I was too young to understand how books worked, and searched for a new book on BearShare. Found some ridiculous thing where Harry attended a new class taught by Dumbledore where they invented spells with a sort of a real-life programming approach, with variables and stuff like that.

Read several after that, and stumbled upon a Psychic Serpent pdf. Absolutely loved it, found the sequels on FictionAlley and bawled my eyes out after the ending and the prequel. Then OotP came out and I didn't really like the direction it and the rest of the series went (angsty Harry, dead Sirius, horcruxes, H/G...), so I kept on reading fanfiction.

I couldn't for the life of me remember what the first story I read was, or how I stumbled across the site.

The books weren't even completed at that point either, so there wasn't any mention of horcruxes for some time.

I recall a Ginny/Harry story that was sometime in the future, but I'm 100% sure it fell victim to one of the FFn.net purges.

** A couple years back I had gotten a summer job that gave me a lot of down time and I wanted to fill it by finally reading the Harry Potter books properly (when I was younger I read only 6&7). So I got my copy of book 1 and read it the next day at work and finished it by the end of my shift. Then I got a copy of 2 and again finished it in a day. The same went for 3. So I then began book 4 and that took me about a week to read at a slower pace than the others. It was around once I finished book 5 I felt myself getting burnt out on the books since I read them all so quickly and I had trouble making myself read 6 again. I had been reading Naruto fanfiction for years at this point so I thought about checking out the Harry Potter section for once and wanted to fufill my desire of reading a story where Harry is paired with Hermione. I never looked back and have been into HPfanficiton since then.

As an aside I got into hpfanficiton right around the time "Hogwarts Reads the Harry Potter Books" had gotten big and found myself reading the books again by proxy even though I was burnt out on the books themselves.

What I remember though is my first fanfiction, which was linkffn(Taking Control by fake a smile), featuring a ridiculus Super!Harry, Harry/Ginny, a very cringeworthy way of dealing with intimate relationships and an unfinished sequel.

It's quite suprising if oyu consider that I never before really thought about fanfiction, let alone read them.
