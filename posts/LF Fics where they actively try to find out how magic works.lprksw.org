I'm fine with anything, so long as the story has people not knowing how magic works and trying to find out. Could be an epic quest to go find Lady Magic to ask her what the fuck is up with magic, or could be a quiet story about some Unspeakables finding love in the DoM while researching esoteric magical theory.

Essentially, rather than the story having an explanation for magic, it should be about finding one. "What is Magic?" as opposed to "Magic is this.", so to speak.

Specifically an 'explanation for magic' though - I'm not looking for those 'psychopathic researcher Harry' fics where he finds new ways to use existing spells.

What the hell - /side discussion/ too. What do y'all think are interesting explanations for magic? Does 'Lady Magic giveth it' suffice, or do you like something else? Canon and headcanon appreciated. :)

=o=o=o=o=o=o-o=o-o=o==o==o=

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Harry potter and The Artificer Legacy is a good story with the main focus on Harry Potter being an inventor of types with magic. its maybe not what you are looking for because he is not (yet) looking for where magic is from. he however did quantify magic and do things with that.

smut level: so far avoidable i think. (but its present) pairing: multi (harryxmultiple women)

warning: lots of fluff :)

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!

*** Yeah, sounds like it might not be quite what I'm looking for, but maybe it will get there in future. Like you said - 'yet'. :)

I poked through the first chapter and I admit I'm not wholly convinced, but it's definitely interesting enough for me to try press on and read more to decide. Thanks for the rec!

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Normally I don't recommend this, as this sub seems to dislike it. But this prompt is just so perfect, I can't give it up.

*** Tentatively seconded, though it's a relatively minor subplot. For a more thorough exploration of the origin of Magic that keeps with HPMOR's sci-fi interpretation, I think some of the fan sequels would be best. linkffn(11117811) in particular, if I remember correctly, actually gets to the origin.

Edit: Or maybe it was linkffn(10446022) or linkffn(10755550) that actually does it---all of them are so similar they end up blurring inside my mind into one thing, I swear.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** Eh. Even if only one person picks up the fic and enjoys it, that's still a worthwhile recommendation. Doubly so for the longer stuff like this - imagine how much fun time someone who likes this fic will have with it. :)

Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. Not due to the plot - just the Harry character. Not a fan of him. But to relate what I said in my OP about smut, maybe someone else will enjoy it, so thanks for the recommendation! :)

** Not sure if this meets all your requirements, but I recommend Core Threads

This is one of those stories where Harry discovers and masters his magic before coming to Hogwarts, and because he learns the magic in a completely unorthodox way, he is capable of feats that normal wizards cannot do.
