To put it in as few words as possible, a few years after DH, a secret organization threatens to reveal the wizarding community's existence to the Muggle world. The story follows a group of Aurors who have been ordered to stop it, but also various members of the organization itself, as they play a game of cat-and-mouse. The organization feeds the Aurors misinformation to throw them off-guard while the Aurors try to find out exactly how they plan to expose the wizarding community. I also try to tackle various questions that arise from the relationship between Muggles and wizards, such as why the wizarding community is hiding in the first place, the real reason behind the prejudice towards Muggles, and, interestingly, why magic is such a prominent feature in fantasy. All the protagonists, antagonists, and otherwise major characters are OCs.

I've been toying with the idea for a while now, but I haven't started it yet, because 1) it feels like it's going to be a pretty big project, and 2) from what I've seen around here, there doesn't seem to be much interest in OC-centric fics. I definitely intend for it to be read, so I'm gauging interest with this post. Would you be interested in reading such a story? Please give me your thoughts :)

The difficulty curve gets exponentially steeper if you do this. Alexandra Quick is pretty much the only story I can think of with an all-OC cast that's worth reading. Granted, it's stellar.

You have to have a really, really good grasp of storytelling - phrasing, pace, character development, tension - to hook people. I would give it a shot, because it sounds like you've thought the idea through and it's intriguing enough, but for me, the story would have a very short leash.

If you do this, I'd recommended you spend a lot of time making your first 500 words incredible.

*** This is one of the most encouraging things to read, funnily enough. Writing folks are always out to prove themselves, so being told that my project is /too difficult/ is a challenge and a tease all in one.

Given your advice, it definitely makes sense to work extra hard on the beginning. After all I won't be given a second chance in selling the story, right? It's not like I'll be able to rely on the inherent appeal of already existing characters like Sirius or Snape.

The stakes have never been higher.

Cheers! :)

** Since it's taking place only a few years after DH, have you thought about trying to take advantage of characters who technically exist in canon but who have no real characterization? It might lend a little bit of familiarity for the reader. Not that you should to star Bill Weasley, but there are tons of characters in the books who could be kind of a "name brand."

The thing is that the wizarding world is very small and insular. It's almost unrealistic to create a 3D large-scale story that takes place a few years after DH and spends a lot of time talking about the auror office and the wizarding community/world without coming into contact with characters we know. For example, Harry Potter is basically a VIP, he would still be hugely relevant to the magical community as a symbol and just as a celebrity. The D.A. and the Order are already in various parts of government especially the Auror Office, Kingsley is supposed to be the Minister of Magic. So to be honest, if you got through an entire story without mentioning or including any familiar characters even at the tertiary level, it would actually seem unrealistic.

It sounds as though this is largely unrelated to the Death Eater movement, but there might be a few former Death Eaters who would love to make Kingsley's government a bit uncomfortable, even if they don't want to see the wizarding world exposed.

** So whats the objective of this 'organization'? I mean if they plan to reveal the magic world to the muggles why waste time telling the aurors that? why not do it right away?

As for OCs if you can write interesting characters it really doesn't matter if they are OC or not as most canon characters are almost always OOC anyway

** If this is all in Britain you could still use some canon characters to drive it. Plenty of OCs would be needed on both sides of the conflict and you wouldn't lose the 'value' of fanfiction by alienating the built-in audience.

** Personally, I rarely read non-Harry focused fics, nor about after Harry defeats Voldemort. Not to say that your idea isn't interesting, but I do think you'd be fighting an uphill battle. But if you succeed, it'd be a great addition to HP fanfic.
