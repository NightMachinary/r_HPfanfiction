So I just saw this comic on about an artist who avoided death by putting put his "heart and soul" into his art because the grim reaper took his soul by taking art ([[https://imgur.com/gYE8zxd]]).

What if highly skilled artists could create/accidentally created horcruxes by creating art they were deeply passionate about? Or if there was an artist who became infatuated with the thought of actually preserving their lift through art?

I'm not super writerly so this is all I could come up with but it seemed like a fun thing to share.


** Voldemort never wanted to be evil, you guys. He was just a very passionate artist.

Actually this explains the Dark Mark.

I can imagine teenage Tom Riddle doodling in his diary and trying to come up with a cool symbol, and then eventually sketching out the Dark Mark.

Man, say what you want about Voldemort, but you can't deny he's an artist

*** Lord Voldemort wasn't applying for the Defense position when he came back to Hogwarts, he wanted to be its first Art teacher, because he understood the sublime beauty at the intersection of art, magic and the soul. Dumbledore refused him with some tosh about it being "too dangerous" and "highly unadvisable in a school full of hormonal teenagers", but Lord Voldemort knew the truth: Dumbledore was jealous of his talent and would do anything to prevent him from showing it. If Dumbledore refused to give him Hogwarts, very well: he'd make the world his canvas instead.

**** Ok so like the top two posts should totally be a tom riddle era fanfic where he's literally not at all evil, just kinda edgy and angsty and rlly hot and doesn't kill people or hate muggleborns, but is just a really passionate artist. Ya know what; I have wattpad I'm totally making a cover and description of this to add to my drafts. I probably won't write it for a while but I've got the idea, it's gonna happen.

***** Sooo, I posted a thing, but only because I need help with something trivial: names. Also I am using this chance to advertise.

Pretty please go check out Heart and Soul by HufflepuffBellatrix (me) on Wattpad. Nothing is actually written yet, but I can't write anything until I get a good name (the character is going to be referenced to a lot, in both jokes and explanations, so it's gotta be good)

Please help!

*** It reminds of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler][somebody]], who would better be a bad painter, than what he became to be.
