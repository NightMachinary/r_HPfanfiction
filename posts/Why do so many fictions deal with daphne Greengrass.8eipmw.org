I don't think I read much about her in the books, and she wasn't in the movies, so wtf is Happening with her popularity?


** She appears once in the books. She, Hermione, Anthony Goldstein and Gregory Goyle all go off to do their charms practical together.

However, we also know that her sister married Draco Malfoy and that her family are part of the sacred 28. So if you want a canon pureblood character who has no canon appearance or personality and thus no existing issues with canon characters she's pretty much the top pick.

** Relatively blank slate with an intriguing presence as an "ice queen" in fannon makes her a great opportunity to make a character that can contrast against Harry without being a straight-out Malfoy. Gives writers a chance to explore the clash between a type of personality unexplored in cannon against Harry himself.

Also that it's a rather pleasant sounding name.

*** Which I honestly don't think is a bad thing. It's kind of useful to have an OC you can work with that most readers will at least be a little familiar with already from the common portrayals. The little differences each author makes is pretty interesting, at least to me.

** She is technically not an OC, JKR put her name on a list of 40 students in Harry's year. So she's canon, by word of god. Plus Draco married her sister in the epilogue so we know she's a pureblood.

Not just word of god. She's actually in the books (once).

That's actually word of god. Astoria is not in the epilogue. It's just Draco with his nondescript wife.

This is from JK Rowling herself and I'd take her word over the word of god.

*** You're not entirely wrong, but by now Daphne has a lot of established (fanon) characteristics. An actual Harry/OC story is much more likely to be a subtle or not so subtle self-insert fic than Harry/Daphne.

**** I dunno what you mean. Fanon characteristics are OC characteristics if you like it or not. In fanon Daphne is everything between Death Eater, Malfoy's whore, and the Saint who rescued Harry from the Weasleys. You can do everything with her what makes her an OC for me.\\
Don't get me wrong. It's not that I hate her, or I don't like her. In some of my favourite stories, she was even an important, nice character. However, I can't see her with Harry. In canon, she's just a name, not a character, hemce in fanon she's OC.

***** I just [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tqa4sxJVY8][megaloathe]] self inserts and they seem to be much rarer for Daphne fics than other female OCs. That was my theory why that might be the case (it's much more difficult to SI yourself into Daphne Greengrass, because of her established limitations, even if they're all fanon). But maybe you don't share my observation or have a different explanation?

** It goes like this:\\
We know all the Slytherins, look, there is Draco the blond ferret, there is Pansy Parkinson the pug faced, and there are Crabbe and Goyle, we know a <placeholder animal> is more intelligent than them, and there in the back is Daphne Greengrass, she is ......, wait what, Where did she come from ? Why didn't we notice her ? , isn't Greengrass the maiden name of Draco's future wife ? hmm..... She looks interesting, and has a nice sounding name, let's see what is the story behind her.

** All the points mentioned above, also,

There aren't "so many" fanfictions. If you look at the ones on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] that even list her as a character, and compare it to other characters, the number difference is staggering.

The HP fanbase is quite old now, so many people get bored of writing stories with the same characters repeatedly. In comes Daphne.
