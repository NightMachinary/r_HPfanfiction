I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/4/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] and there's a scene where Dumbledore is setting up Ward in Holmes' flat when something occurs to me: Magic in Harry Potter */really/* doesn't follow any logic.

#+begin_quote
  [...] Dumbledore asked John a lot of questions. Some of them were scary, like the one about Afghanistan wizards ("Don't think I met any. But then, I might not remember it even if did."). Others were interesting, but didn't sound very helpful ("The first time I met a witch or a wizard? You know, Mr. Lee might have been one. He and my Dad used to play rugby together. I saw him jump twelve feet in the air when he thought no one was looking."). The rest were just odd ("Was I a healthy baby? No. No, I wasn't, but then I got better.").
#+end_quote

Somehow I remember the Ollivander scene on PoS.

  He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. [...] Harry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, [...]

Most great Magic description in fanfiction that I've read either shows Magic in a typical fantasy-esque ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]]) or makes Magic scientific ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]]). I don't really recall any other fanfiction that shows the weirdness of Magic the way Rowling does.

I'm not looking for fanfiction where there's a 'magical theory' that shows you how to conjure kitten or how ward works using runes and ley lines. I'm looking for fanfictions where there's a potions for curing boils that need a buttered crushed garlic that has been used to make a chicken soup, a ward that need the person's signed Hogsmeade slip, a spell to track people that their first crush's blood, or a magical device that you can only use with your uncle's son in law written permission.

Is there any other fanfiction that really captures the wierdness of Magic like this?

Edit: Add some description based on my other comment. Thanks [[/u/carelesslazy]] for the suggestion


** That's kinda the whole point of Potterverse magic, isn't it? While it does have its rules, when compared with other kinds of magic(k), it's absurdly OP and logic-defying.

*** Agreed. It is reminiscent of Victorian-era children's books where the authors were probably high while writing, and I say this with the utmost fondness and respect for the genres. Harry Potter's universe is about absurdity like Hitchhiker's Guide, it's about the bizarre and the strange like Alice and Wonderland, and above all it's about having a good laugh. Only dark magic and the magic between Harry and Voldemort fits outside this absurdity and instead reflects the themes and motifs of fairy-tales. You're spot on, the magic is absolutely logic-defying.

** Sorry if I'm not helping with a link, but the reason it makes no sense because it was used as a plot device by Rowling to move things along. Do you realize that magic would solve most of their problems? I mean, look at the Time Turner: yeah, the future is in a closed loop, but that fiat was probably added in so that you couldn't argue about 'what if Harry/Hermione were just a minute late to saving Buckbeak?' or any other event that happens in PoA.

Most fanfics don't use that level of weirdness because the magic is meant to be a backdrop and a tool used by wizards rather than a convenient plot device....and somehow the Disarming Charm is able to intercept a Killing Curse and create a Pirori Incantatem effect that brings out the spirits of the dead to help you.

*** I know that Rowling only use magic as plot device, Harry Potter series is more focused in mystery than fantasy anyway.

I'm not looking for some Deus Ex Machina like Priori Incantatem or the ownership of Elder wand. What I'm looking for is fanfic that shows that how the magic in the series doesn't make sense or follow any sort logic. I mean, what does a distance between nostrils have to do with choosing a wand? Why did wizard travel via fireplace? Wouldn't using a full-body mirror make more sense? Why did they offer hot chocolate and toothbrush in knight bus? Why did they use a toilet as a Ministry entrance?

It doesn't have to be the focus of the plot, some (recurring) offhand comment is perfecly okay.

Just about every building in Harry Potter has at least one and it's probably less legal work, and cheaper, to get your fireplace hooked up to the Floo Network than to get a lot of portkeys plus it lets you get into places that have anti-Apparition wards like Hogwarts and the Ministry.

#+begin_quote

Well the toothbrush is to brush your teeth if you're using it for a long trip and the hot chocolate is to make you feel safe and comfortable.

Okay, this one I have nothing for because it makes no sense. I get the phone booth because no one would just punch in MAGIC into a phone booth and usually it would have like...11 digits in a phone number so just hitting 5 keys make no sens. Also, I say 11 because I'm pretty sure that British people have 11-digit phone numbers unlike Americans.

**** "Priori Incantantem" is a phrase that means past spells are shown. It's established that it's a known thing that happens. It's established under what conditions it occurs. It's never explained why it would be the case. The phrase, or the phenomenon having a history, is not an explanation. It's just a brute fact, and not one that follows from any underlying deeper principles. Rowling's world is weird in the sense that seemingly every piece of magic is its own, unique and idiosyncratic. You can't describe it all in just a few sentences like you can physics.

***** So the thing is, those weren't spirits of the dead for real, at least according to Dumbledore at first. Then again, maybe we can throw all this out because Harry Potter is the Master of Death, so it can happen, but just for him?

And, of course, it is partially explained that magic imprints upon vessels like wands. So the idea that you can force/cause a wand to repeat the spells it has cast is not absurd.

Magic in the Potterverse is nonsensical because of all the stupid spells and that's the point, it's meant for pre-schoolers and we happen to enjoy the whimsy.

**** It's a bit of a fever dream AU, but essentially played straight within that restriction. If you've read Borges' Library of Babel, the premise is something similar, both in that the theme of alternate universes and time travel is touched on and in that magic seemingly derives from a bunch of library books containing magic spells that have always Platonically existed - alongside a bunch of books filled with incomprehensible, meaningless nonsense.

There are many good specific descriptions of weird magic in it. For example, the castle's entrance is described as behaving as follows:

#+begin_quote
  A tremendous bellchime rattles and silences the collection of students. Instead of swinging open, the individual bars of the gate separate and float upwards---bending, twisting. The ground rumbles as a vast moat sinks around the castle, punctuated by a second tremendous bell-chime. Water floods into the moat and crashes into a wave that sends spray far above the heads of the students, but the spray slows---the sharp features of the turbulent water arrest, and it softens into a great blob of water that settles back slowly into the moat. All the while, the gargoyles continue their brutal, glacial fight. As the bulk of the water sinks below ground level, a wide path is revealed, leading to the front door. With a crack, Alvin appears in front of them.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  The castle has...subdued? Different bits still seem to rotate along a thousand different axes, but the gargoyle's battle has reached some sort of incomprehensible end, with one identical-looking faction having declared victory and littered the outer surface of the castle in the body parts of the other. The moat water still sloshes in turbulent slow-motion, though. A blob of ejecta occasionally ventures too far from the surface, and time seems to catch up for it, the father it gets away. Frothy spray foams at Horry and Hermany's feet as they watch the water.
#+end_quote

Lots of strange, non-Euclidean, paradoxical, mysteriousness haunts this story's version of magic, but there's also a persistent suggestion that there is a deeper structure underneath magic, just infathomably difficult to understand. That keeps its weirdness /interesting/ in a way that purely random or plot-convenient weirdness can't match. Pure noise is boring. Acid-trips captivate.

Unfortunately, the story seems to be abandoned, and the author mostly only accomplished laying groundwork for future satisfactory ideas, so it's really kind of a big tease. But it has some very peculiar descriptions of magic that I liked a lot and haven't seen elsewhere, and I hope others might take some inspiration from it in future worldbuilding.

** I think the reason for this "magical theory" is the fact that we have, in canon, the example of magic not making sense (ie, measurement between the nostrils), and then we have the assumption that the teaching of magic follows the same systematic teaching methods of their non-magical equivalent, simply because we're not given any /real/ description of classes beyond "McGonagall is strict," "Snape's a bastard," "Binns is boring," and "Trelawney's a crackpot." Magical theory is simply the other extreme of people "knowing" magic.

My theory is that magic doesn't /have/ to follow set concepts of "normal" logic. But that doesn't mean it doesn't follow any logical process.

A completely esoteric approach can get the same result as the common one. It's why some fics have different methods of magical travel. /Accidental Animagus/ had magical sandstorms and the ley lines, along with the usual Portkeys and Floo. Hell, I read one fic that had Luna travel by something called "treewalking", and inwardtransience fics have a dark equivalent to Apparition.

Magic is the illogical extreme. It's how the fic author plays with their arbitrary nature that make the fun of it.

like he literally brought hermione back from the dead and also made harry the supreme mugwump (????????) even though he was 11 years old. and also dumbledores last wish was to offer harry the POSITION OF HEADMASTER IF HE WANTED IT.

***** Huh. I got the impression that Yudkowski was setting up Hermione's return from the time she died, when the "end of the world" prophecy upended Voldemort's plan and induced him to set up 10 different layers of safeguards against Harry meddling with world-ending magic trying to bring her back. And at the same time, Harry was acting suspicious in a way that suggested sleight of hand with her body.

Looking back, I can't find any reference to Dumbledore making Harry Headmaster or Supreme Mugwump. He did make Harry Chief Warlock (with Amelia Bones as regent) in his will because he assumed he'd be killed at the hands of a resurrected Voldemort, whom Harry was prophesied to defeat. (The power of Chief Warlock was conferred by a physical artifact, and he presumably wanted Harry to have all the help he could get.)

Granted, that's still pretty silly, but not as silly as making him Headmaster, which would be pretty pointless even in that context.
