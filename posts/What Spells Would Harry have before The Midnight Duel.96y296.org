I want to have Harry and Draco actually duel each other, rather than it being a bait and I can't think of what spells they could feasibly sling at eachother. Iirc they wouldn't have even learned Wingardium Leviosa yet.


** I assume that they don't teach Serpensortia, the snake-conjuring spell, to second years, so Draco probably learned it before that. That means you could have Draco use that, and Harry's parselmouth ability come into play. Otherwise, they know Lumos. Try to blind each other? I don't really know, unless they got private teaching or taught themselves, they wouldn't really know spells useful for a duel.

*** That is kinda boring because it peomises non-canon by actually having a duel take place, and then just reverts to canon.

** Draco perhaps would know more than Harry, having been around the Wizarding world his whole life he could have picked up a few more spells or even gotten tutelage beforehand

** Harry might know these:

mending charm, as demonstrated by Hermione to fix his glasses

wand lighting charm

incendio

probably how to make sparks come out of the wand like when they first receive the wand

Draco would also know those and probably the stinging hex.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6913210/1/The-Duellist][The Duellist]] has an interesting take on this.

** Harry literally knows nothing.

Draco knows of a lot of spells, but probably can only cast a few minor jinxes. Maybe jelly legs, stinging hex.

The duel would have to resort to fisticuffs to finish with any sort of real loser.

*** The book even lampshaded this.

"The most you and Malfoy will be able to do is throw sparks at each other."

"What if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"

"Throw it away and punch him in the nose."
