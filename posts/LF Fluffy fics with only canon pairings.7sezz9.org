Sometimes, after perusing the most absurd pairings on the market, a man just needs to step back to canon. Preferably during Hogwarts Era pls.


** It's not Hogwarts, but have you tried this one yet:

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

When I see the words 'soul bond' in a summary, I usually shudder with apprehension, as most of them are awful.

From what I can remember though, this fic does a pretty decent job of it. Also has Canon Pairings with Harry and Ginny. Not really sure about the other pairings, if there are any.

Hopefully you like this, sorry if it isn't quite what you are looking for.

Edit: Just realised the title said Fluffy. I can't really remember if that fic has some or not, sorry about that.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
