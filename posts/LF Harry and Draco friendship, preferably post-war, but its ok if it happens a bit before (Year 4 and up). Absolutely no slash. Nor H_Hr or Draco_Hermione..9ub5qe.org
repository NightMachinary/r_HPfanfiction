I abhor the use of contractions in pairing, like Haphne or Dramione. Sorry.

I want something fun but essentially plot-heavy, with repercursions from their friendship. Would like that there isn't any sort of bashing, specially Ron, which I doubt. I hate bashing in general, but sometimes I can tolerate for a good fic.

No DE Harry or Mentor Voldy or stuff like that. Draco doesn't necessarily betray his family, though that would be hard with the war going on.

Stuff similar to The Other Boy who Lived, Hogwarts Battle School or A Fine spot of Trouble.


** It's not really the focus of the fic, but Draco does end up helping Harry in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249][War Is Over]] linkao3(252249). It's post-war, canon-compliant, and plot-heavy with no bashing.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.

** Perhaps try The Redemption Series - it starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3662420/1/Save-Me][Save Me]] and continues with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3701756/1/Brothers-and-Sons][Brothers and Sons]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3801134/1/A-Foreign-Language][A Foreign Language]]. There are also a couple of companion stories for the series if you are interested - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3934136/1/A-Few-of-Our-Favorite-Things][A Few of Our Favorite Things]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3975880/1/I-Am-Gryffindor-s-Daughter][I Am Gryffindor's Daughter]]. It has been awhile since I've read the series so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember that it's not H/Hr or Draco/Hermione, it's plot heavy, and I'm pretty sure it's post war. Quick disclaimer that there is one gay character but he's a minor character and it's only mentioned a few times (except for one of the short oneshots in A Few of Our Favorite Things, but that's easily skipped over if you didn't want to read it).

** Astra Inclinant by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/eleventy7/pseuds/eleventy7][eleventy7]] is post-war and I'm honestly enjoying it so much! It has a really strong adult Harry and Draco friendship with a bit of James and Scorpius friendship/rivalry on the side. I know it might be a turn off that this one's also next gen but I can't recommend it enough. It's so well written and there's absolutely no bashing. Characters are realistic and flawed and there's a nice take on what happened to the Malfoys after the war. It's not canon compliant ... as James is Harry's only child here and he is the same age as Rose and Scorpius, but I won't give anything away in case you want to check it out!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4153050/chapters/9369954]]

It's still a work in progress though, but the latest update was a few months ago, so I'm optimistic it will get updated soon!

I also really like Take Two by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Bundibird/pseuds/Bundibird][Bundibird]] but this one is just starting and updates are slow... however it's so much fun to read! Aaaand on the bright side, chapters are long, so even if there's only 4 of them it's not a short read!

It's a what if take on year 4 when Harry's name is drawn from the Goblet and the school turns against him, Draco uses this as an opportunity to get on Harry's good side by supporting him, and they actually end up becoming friends.
