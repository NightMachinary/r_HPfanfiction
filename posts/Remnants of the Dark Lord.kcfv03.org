No one can cheat death, not even Voldemort. With no Horcruxes, the Dark Lord meets a rather undignified end the night he moves to annihilate the Potter's.

Fast forward to 1994. The Dark Lord has been gone for well over a decade and Harry Potter has peacefully reintegrated into the magical world.

With the overwhelming success of the assault on the Quidditch World Cup (and with his position of de-facto power over the Ministry and Hogwarts), Lucius Malfoy finally accepts that he is the man poised to possess the entirety of magical Britain. Beginning his campaign against the mudbloods and Muggleborns in the shadows.

His only issue does not come from the Boy Who Lived standing against him, but from a misjudgement on his end in 1996, when he released the only woman who could contest his budding rule.

Bellatrix Lestrange answered only to the Dark Lord, and with her band of psychotic loyalists, she wages a personal war against Lucius for trying to steal Voldemort's throne...


** This prompt is only slightly different from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], in which Lucius Malfoy seized power through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981. He successfully instated the Pureblood rule and brainwashed Muggleborns into serving as his personal Janissaries...
