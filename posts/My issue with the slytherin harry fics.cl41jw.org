** A lot of this is in part due to the perspective the story takes, I feel.

As someone commented below, a lot of Slytherin-focused fics can be generally split into two categories: redeeming the rebellious underdogs, or venting frustration with characters the author has a bone to pick with. This framing isn't always a bad thing, and with adequate amounts of world building you can genuinely make characters better than their canon counterparts and therefor make them easier to empathize with.

The problem is when that nuance isn't there.

I think the greatest example of this is Tom/Harry (and, to a lesser though no less weird extent, Snape/Harry). Especially Tom/Fem!Harry. In all likelihood, the fic that started pairing either Bookdemort or 16 year old Tom with Harry probably made attempts to redeem his character by either divorcing him from Voldemort or by adjusting the characterization to make him redeemable and a worthwhile romantic partner. This works when it works, and in all likelihood the fic was probably decent and is even more likely to be entirely forgotten to whatever depths of WattPad or FFN that it now exists on.

This isn't true for the fic that followed it, or the fic that followed that. Fandoms build on collective ideas and tropes - it's why Daphne and the slew of characters who get little to no screen time besides /maybe/ being among those who wore Potter Stinks badges / took part in the defense of Hogwarts are actualized characters nowadays, it's why the concept of magical cores exist, though I think Wuxia/Xianxia/some modern fantasy has more to do with that, etc - and so when someone strikes gold - whether through writing ability alone or by keying into a new idea - people tend to take inspiration from it. This isn't a bad thing, it's actually rather fascinating if you can watch it happen, but what it does mean is that the purpose of the pairing and the lengths people go to justify them are disseminated with each additional fic that's been inspired from the last.

So by now, we've had numerous years of fanfiction behind our backs and, depending on which part of the fandom you mostly drink from, we have a lot of common tropes and rationalizations for pairings, among other things. Most people probably haven't read the books in a while - I know I haven't - and therefore they feel even more divorced from the characters they're writing. This means that, when it comes down to the wire, people will end up writing characters off of what they personally remember from their time reading the books and from drawing inspiration from their favorite fics. In a nutshell, it creates a fandom character, which is great, I love this sort of thing and find it endlessly interesting and there are some fanon characters I find infinitely better than their canon counterparts, for better or for worse. But it also means that the writers are so divorced from the original characters that they either go through great lengths to /justify/ their actions (see: the endless deluge of fanfiction that justifies a group of generally well-off and entitled upper-class individuals using a literal racialized slur against a minority that has been, in the recent history, hunted and murdered like animals, because seriously I will never understand how people can flat-facedly say "mudblood is for those in this small minority group of people who aren't ever introduced to our society early who refuse to adopt wizard culture above their own" and not get how really weird and gross that is?) or they swing the other way and take things up to eleven (Ron is probably the biggest example of this. Ron is a bit of a dick but so is /every other character/ in canon but it's because people only ever really remember Ron being jealous, though that's in part due to book 4 being one of the best ones in my opinion, or petty or mean or just outright cruel. Ron is a kid, Ron is a dick, but Harry is also both of these and so is Hermione. They're all little shits in equally unique ways) because all they can remember of the character is the big moments in the books as well as what other people have written them like.

All-in-all, blame the fact that we compartmentalize tropes and ideas as a community and that a lot of things have been stripped of meaning and reduced to shorthand, leaving characters that need to be tweaked or changed in the dust while we try to justify why a 14 year old girl would shag a nazi snake wizard.

Example: Ginny Weasley is Lily Potter. In Cannon, the only similarity is being a redhead (not even the same shade of red at that). In Fannon, they're basically the same person.

** Yes, I agree. More middle-road Slytherin fics would be appreciated. Would you mind listing any decent quality ones you've found? I'd love to read them. I've read a few of the really popular ones, but it's easy for less well-known fics to slip through the cracks.

** I think this comes down to what type of story the author is writing, and to a certain extent the qualities of the writer itself (ex. age, gender, geography, books vs. movies only, etc.).

The cases where he is welcomed by everyone seems to be written mostly by women/girls who may want to set up slash pairings, people who like the 'woe is me, poor misunderstood people, no wonder they rebel' feeling (popular with teenagers for obvious reasons), or people who are deliberately trying to be edgy and shake-up the somewhat bonkers housing arrangements in the books (in that order).

The case of a more horrifying Slytherin experience is people who often have a bone to pick with the the bad guys in Slytherin. This generally involves Harry, Hermione (as ridiculous as that is), or an OC getting beaten down, forced to mature, then striking back hard and becoming King of the house (or /the Prince of Slytherin/, to be a bit on the nose). This is mainly a mixture of revenge-porn and independent stories.

So to say why these are so common, I think its pretty simple: *most writers put the horse before the cart*. They start with something they want to happen in a story (ex. power fantasy or harem) and try to build a story around that. This is akin in fanfiction to trying to carve a marble sculpture out of Michelangelo's /David/, without lowering the quality. Building a story around pairings or emotional appeal or caricatures is boring, because the writers neglect good writing (such as organic or believable characters) to get to what they want as quickly as possible. Thats why you see similar characterization of say Ravenclaw house in fics as well - these stories are outlets for authorial whims and not intended to actually depict how these people behave.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Miramirth is one of the few authors which I think created a realistic Harry---a Harry in Slytherin where Snape is an asshole (people like to portray him as some misunderstood victim, and not a dude who willingly joined a racist death cult) but he's not out to like abuse Harry. Most of the house treats him like relative shit or ignores him, but his quidditch abilites win some of them over as do his magical abilities. He only has a few real friends, but he's not even sure he can trust them.

Charlotte the Great and Powerful also has an interesting take on HP in slytherin.
