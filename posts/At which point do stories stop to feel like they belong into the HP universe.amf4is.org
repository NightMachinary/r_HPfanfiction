While I know that there is no universal rule due to personal preferences and interpretations of the series, what are some points/lines where you say "That's a nice story, but not Harry Potter"?

It can be anything:

- Plot

- Trope

- Time

- AU

- Pairing

- Theme

- Divergence

*** Adding on to this, when they introduce complicated new magic that doesn't fit in with the book magic systems. It's fine to add new stuff if it feels plausible within the Wizarding World universe, but if you make the whole thing about angels and demons or have one person suddenly magically bound to marry eight people, it jumps the shark. Don't get me wrong, I still might read it, but it definitely stops feeling like the Wizarding World to me.

HP's magic system makes sense when you just accept that they are localized Reality Manipulators, but once you ask what they can't do or what's the worst you can do it becomes a shithole

*** "system"?

lolwut.jpg

The magic in Harry Potter is in no way a system. It doesn't function by rules and limits in a Sanderson-esque way. The magic is more about flavor and tone and style and feeling. It pushes the plot in certain directions, helps us understand the people in this world, and provides a framework for Harry's transition from downtrodden child to sort-of-everyman to self-sacrificing hero.

First, you shout some faux-latin nonsense to cast a spell. Until you don't have to anymore.

First, wizards use flying brooms to get around, until they don't anymore because the floo is objectively better. Then the use the floo until they don't because portkeys are objectively better.

First, Harry is famous for something his mother did, and no dummy, but is otherwise magically unremarkable, until he casts a Patronus that repels dozens or hundreds of dementors at once, a feat beyond any but the very greatest of wizards. But that's kinda OP so let's just go ahead and ignore it for the rest of the series.

But okay, sarcastic asshole-y comments aside, I agree with your point about creating and using magic that doesn't "feel Harry Potter." It's less about following a certain set of rules in a system and more about creating a feeling or vibe to magic that is at odds with the quirky, idiosyncratic, non-system of Harry Potter.

I'd even say that when authors TRY to turn Harry Potter into a "system" that can be gamed or rules-lawyered, then it stops feeling like Harry Potter magic.

**** Portkeys are single use and set up in advance, not to mention apparently regulated by the ministry: they're not really used all that much, just when you need to transport large numbers of people.\\
Brooms are mostly used for sports, but also serve as a mode of transport when you need to go somewhere you haven't been before (so you can't visualise it for apparition) that doesn't have a fireplace (for floo).\\
Floo is probably the most common method, it's limited in that it's one at a time and needs a fireplace, but seems to be the default. It's safer than apparition, faster than brooms and far less hassle than a portkey.\\
Apparition is the second most common, if you know your destination it's probably your fastest option. But it's not as easy, you can injure yourself quite badly if you mess up, and you can't do it until you're an adult, so not great for families. Side along is an option, but not for many people at once.

The incantation does seem to matter, but it turns out that it's thinking the words, not saying them, that does it. Clearly pronunciation and such matters, so teaching verbally first is a must if you want to be able to correct people, and it's likely much easier to focus on the words by saying them aloud.

***** Some of the fics that are labeled "pureblood culture," along with some of the ones that focus on the Black family (and I like Black family stories a lot, but it's a bad trope that pops up in some of them). Some of the fics that try and turn Snape into a dark Gary Stu sort also do it.

Like, okay, I get that some people are fascinated with the idea of a upper-crust society and all, but some folks go way over board. One of the fics was a female James/Lord Voldemort and Sirius/Lily fic that just seemed like an allegory for thinly veiled racism. Lily was depicted as stupid, dumb, dirty, etc. and so was Sirius for consorting with muggles and other muggleborns.

Let's just assume Muggles can't even find Tom for this example (notice-me-not charms or whatever reason). So instead you've got Harry on a ridge trying to snipe Tom. Whoever wins this fight depends on if Tom is aware of the possibility of guns, and if he knows Harry will employ them. I do agree that the first time a Wizard is killed by a gun, it'll be successful because it'll surprise them. But after that, I doubt a wizard would get killed by a gun again.

Ok. Like I said before, if shield charms are able to stop bullets, than Tom will have his own cooked up version of the Weasley shield-charm hats. Probably much better enchanted and with a much stronger charm, and with fail-safes built in.

If shield charms don't stop bullets, then Riddle has other options. He could disillusion himself, or wear an invisibility cloak, or he could even transfigure a bunch of inferi to look like him so Harry doesn't know which target to shoot.

Hell, maybe he could even come up with some standardized, always-on banishing charm that just repels any bullet that comes within a certain distance. Magic is about intent, after all. And it's incredibly versatile.

Riddle would never allow a full tilt battle with two sides facing off in a field to happen. Muggles would essentially be fighting a guerilla force, only 1000x scarier.

I doubt they'd manage to be that consistently aware and prepared. Considering that we see wizards hit each other with spells due to poor shielding in canon, I can't envision a world that's canon compliant where they are consistently and always ready to defend against potential sniper fire.

The bigger issue I see is Harry and co both learning how to fire consistently accurately from great range, and being lucky enough to find their opponents out in the open or near a window every time.

Or, again, a bullet-focused banishment charm. Bullets are a constant, not changing like spells. So much of the trouble against jinxes, hexes, and curses in canon is that there is such a variety. With bullets, you know what you need to repel, all you gotta do is enchant your underwear or Prince Albert piercing to do it.

You make a point about the bigger issue is teaching wizards to effectively use the guns. If they're trying to divide their time in between learning to be better wizards and learning to be better marksman, they're just going to fall further and further behind "full" wizards.

There you go with that "easily" crap again. Riddle couldn't easily kill a child, despite trying his ass off. He couldn't kill ONE old man (Albeit probably the best Wizard in England) Another child, Regulus, figured out his horcrux gimmick.

Magical Britain is going to collapse pretty fucking quick. Especially give that most of his supporters are of the pure blood nobility type. I can't see any of them knowing how to, or be willing to do, the hard work of keeping a society running. House elves better have their shit together.

This also entails that magical Britain in no form or fashion lets the rest of Britain know what's going on. Also that Riddle can, or have someone, play nice with Britain's government. He can't hope to mind fuck every single person that gets elected, or hope to keep a puppet in power.

These are other wizards. A wizard could easily win against muggles, not so easily against other wizards. This is the core of my argument.

"He couldn't kill ONE old man" you say, well of course he couldn't, because as you point out that old man is an incredibly powerful wizard. Wizards are incredibly powerful.

I would say they create some "kind" of love. Particularly Amortentia. Though clearly JKR believes in some kind of ideal, or maybe better, transcendental love that goes further than this "base" emotion (similar to how christian theologians like to describe God's love).

It's a shame that she didn't manage to put any reflections of that "true" love on the page though. Most of her romantic relationships don't really make the difference between them and the Merope/Riddle Senior relationship very clear. The closest we get is maybe the entirely 'off-screen' realtionship between James and Lily. Aside from that JKR seems to relish sacrificial love & martyrdom more than romantic - I actually have my doubts that she believes as strongly in romantic love as she likes to imply with her plot devices.

this is another instance where legilimency is simply too OP an ability to be used consistently. we only see three legilimens in the series- voldemort, dumbledore and snape, and none use it as effectively as they could

****** But why should he? No other child was a threat to Voldemort at that point, and that was before his regular magic.

The Blitz didn't happen until after Voldemort's second year (and there was no way he could have predicted it in June when the year ended at Hogwarts because at that time the Dunkirk evacuation was just finished). And after 1940, attacks were sporadic since most of the offensive capabilities of the Luftwaffe were bound at the Eastern Front. It's not like Voldemort lived in Berlin or the Ruhr Area were massive air raids were a common occurrence for years.

*** That's quite interesting to me. I get that feeling quite a lot on this sub. I know all the books are 'Harry Potter and the . . . whatever', but for me, 'Harry Potter' is synonymous with 'the wizarding world'. I want stories about other characters, but it seems you wouldn't call those Harry Potter fanfiction at all? Perhaps there should be more clearly delineated divisions between HP fanfiction, WW fanfiction and FB fanfiction. That would work for me. If I could look for 'wizarding world' fics I might find it easier to find things I want to read.

**** Actually, you got me there-- I wasn't thinking about FB fanfiction. But no, I generally wouldn't consider stories that aren't at least tangentially about Harry to be part of the HP fanfiction realm anymore.

*** I don't necessarily mind when they change the first name because "harry" does seem rather plain in the Wizarding World (even Ron is Ronald Billius) and it's commonly a nickname for Henry or Harold or so on. But his name is changed, it becomes weird when the author doesn't refer to him as Harry as as nickname but always refers to him as Henry or whatever.

Also, Hadrianus or Hadrian or Hieronmyus make me roll my eyes.

**** I'm cool with Harry/Henry/Harold/Hadrian etc etc. Even if some of them are a bit pretentious. I mean more like when it's "Harry Potter" but he changes his name to Varani and moves to Canada and has no further interaction with any of the other HP characters. Which is my vague collection of a fic I have nope'd out on before. I'm sure it was lovely and others liked it, but not for me. There are some exceptions to this, of course (like Basilisk-born), but in general...

***** I think I just got a bit tired after I read a story that had him called Hadrianus or something mad like that. Like Hadrian I can even understand, if it is a bit pretentious, with the nickname "harry" but Hadrianus was something else.

TBH Harold or Harrison or Henry or even Heinrich would make more sense with the rest of the characters. Ron is named Ronald, not Ron, James full name is James, not Jim, etc. But it does take me out of the story a bit, unless the character is nicknamed Harry.

**** voldemort would kill the potters without giving lily a choice, then likely wipe out the longbottoms to be on the safe side. let's say sirius is still framed and sent to azkaban. wormtail would return to voldemort after his faking his death since he's still active. so it's now voldemort vs. dumbledore and the world. things are bleak, but can still turn around. you can have slughorn shaking off his cowardice and telling dumbledore about the horcruxes, dumbledore picking off the prominent death eaters. though, things could still go wrong if dumbledore fucked up with the ring again
