I need a story in my life, but have nothing but another redditors comment to go by.

#+begin_quote
  I read a story quite a while ago that had either a fem!Harry or it was a story where methamorphs could genderbend and identified as female - don't remember which - where Harry discovered her abilities early in life and over several years slowly modified her appearance by removing imperfections one at a time and generally sculpting herself into her 'ideal' self. It was rather interesting because the twist was that once she got to Hogwarts she realized she was almost supernaturally beautiful and couldn't remember how she used to look.

  I thought it was an interesting idea, anyways.

The only other thing known is that it is on FFN

This could be total crap, but I would really like to give this a shot. I'm currently searching through ffn, but as of yet, I am unsuccesfull. Aid me in my search, fellow comrades of HPFanfiction.


** Interesting. Here is a WIP where fem!harry is female as a result of accidental magic (sort of a trans thing going on). Tonks is an important character, but apparently not a love interest. The world building and magic is A+. So basically nothing at all like you ask for, but I just wanted to spread the word: Linkffn(11862560)

*** Ah, his stories have so much potential, but it gets so bogged down by the excessive wordiness and repetitiveness. It's over 200k words at this point and it feels like I'm just reading the same three scenes over and over again.

*** While the premise of the story doesn't bother me and while it is well written, I just can't get over the incantations, 'reparet', 'stupeat'.

Why did he have to change them? To show his knowledge of latin? Really?

It just REALLY annoys me for some reason...

**** Author is a linguist; if the adage is 'write what you know', this one follows it by including a bunch of linguistic detail. Consider: from this writer's perspective, JKR really mangled the use of something that (s)he cares a lot about. Fanfiction is all about 'correcting the author's mistakes'...

***** His incantations are literally verbs in latin. They are able to be translated to 'to repair' and 'to be dazed'. It's just so... bland. Incantations aren't supposed to be literal translations, they are magic.

I suppose I'm not explaining this in a decent manner but I'd much prefer if he'd make new spells with incantations based on his latin knowledge rather than just translate verbs to replace canon incantations.

****** I agree. It also seems that as a linguist the author should understand that spells may change over time just as language does. We don't really know all that much about the canon magic system but as far as I understand is the incantation is not what makes the spell work. It's merely a crutch until the students are good enough/used to magic and can perform silently.

It stands to reason that incantations would change from country to country and with time. We don't really have canonical evidence but it's the only thing that makes sense to me.

***** I don't mind it too much in general, as the writing is very good, and authors are entitled to their idiosyncrasies. The only thing that bothers me a bit is that it doesn't make a ton of sense in-universe in this story. /To Reach Without/ is ostensibly post-GOF divergence, but some 9-10 chapters in suddenly the author starts pulling a bunch of very AU concepts that are shared with her story /The Long Game/. I like both (mostly), but it feels a bit off in this semi-canon story.

*** I just started chapter 16 on this, thanks for sharing the link. It's very enjoyable. Does it have its problems? Yes, but it's well into the 99th percentile of quality.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
