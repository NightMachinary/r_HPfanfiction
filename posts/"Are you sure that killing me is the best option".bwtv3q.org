"I mean, you don't fully understood my protection, so you can't know that it won't horribly backfire again. And you don't know the entire prophecy. Do you want me to tell you? Sure you do, it says that one of us will kill the other. Simple as that. And that's why you shouldn't kill me if you want to survive."

"You make no sense! If one of us will kill the other, me killing you is obviously the best for me!"

"Short term, maybe. But long term? As long as I live, I'm the only one who can kill you. If you kill me, the prophecy is void and anyone can. Are you sure that it's worth it?"

"Nobody can kill me! I'm immortal!"

"Ah, you mean thanks to your diary, your diadem, locket, cup und ring? Your snake?"

"You know? How do you know?"

"Pretty obvious, after Lucius dropped the diary off at Hogwarts, it's content revealing your heritage making the Gaunt shack obvious, the diadem being in the room that gives you anything you want which I've been using as training room for years, Bellatrix's vault wasn't too difficult to guess since Lucius had one and Regulus stole the locket ages ago. You're low on sources of immortality, and if you kill me you loose the protection of the prophecy too."

"Protection of the prophecy? It prophecies my doom!"

"Well, yes, but also no. It doesn't say that we have to kill each other right now. It implies that as long as we don't kill each other, we're effectively immortal even without Horcruxes. Since we're immortal, we can postpone the killing each other thing indefinitely. Seems like a decent deal to me."

"What deal?"

"I don't kill you, you don't kill me, we'll leave each other alone and enjoy immortality. You can have wizard Britain if you want, most wizards are stupid anyway."

"And how do I know that you won't kill me as soon as I release you?"

"I can't. I can't destroy your last Horcrux since it's, well, me."

"What?"

"Yeah, you accidentally made me a Horcrux when you tried to kill me as a baby. I was pretty surprised too when I found out. Since I can't kill you, and I can't die except at your hand as long as you live according to the prophecy, and you can't die as long as I live because I'm a Horcrux, you literally can't die unless you kill me. So don't."


** That is just asking for Voldemort to just wipe harry mind and put the body under the draft of living death, hell mabye even use a basilisk to petrifiy harry and Hide his stone body where no one can find him.

#+begin_quote
  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  "I'm going to make you immortal, Harry. The least you can do in exchange is to stay civil." - in which Voldemort learns the truth behind Harry's scar and the world changes greatly for it. AU from the Battle of Hogwarts. Powerful!Harry. Mature, too. Well, from time to time. PS: No one jumps through any veils in this story.

** In "Elsewhere but not Elsewhen", Voldemort listens to the Prophecy and deduces this - and sends Harry on a one-way trip to another dimension, ensuring his own immortality.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
