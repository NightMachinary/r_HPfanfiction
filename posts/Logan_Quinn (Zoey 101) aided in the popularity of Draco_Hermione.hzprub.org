** Erm... I personally credit Emma Watson and Tom Felton.

Also, love/hate is nothing new. Boy teases girl he likes as kids was a heavy sentiment pre 2000s. Plus the whole Romeo and Juliet thing. I think Zoey101 is a big stretch considering it wasn't that popular comparatively.

** Leaving out the murderous bigotry/racism is a huge thing, though.

** I think...you are vastly inflating the influence of Zoey 101 when compared to Harry Potter. They're on totally different levels of popularity.
