Looking for the best finished fanfic you know of please post description, genre, rating, and any other information you think is relevant!


** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/][Alexandra Quick]] series is great. Four books (years) in the series, each getting better than the last. Poignant sadness, the most welcome moments of relief and twists and turns that are all punctuated by the ever-persistent determination of a proud and stubborn witch with surprisingly good intuition.

I'm certain that anyone and everyone would like. :)

** This is the first fic that popped into my head. It's beautifully written, and very powerful. The two characters listed in fanfiction.net are Harry and Hermione, but that is not the pairing. In fact, it's pretty gen. It's got gallows humor, but is also really sad at parts. It does end on a hopeful note, though.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] by kayly silverstorm. Adventure/Drama, rated T. "Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour."

This one has some of the best time travel ever, and has alt history and alt present day characters that the author actually makes one care about. Harry has some idiotball issues, but he does in canon as well. Some people don't like the romance; that is the pair listed. I like the historic stuff, as it seem so well done. Original magical ideas that thankfully don't result in Harry immediately rolling over Voldemort. A good read.

I'm still not sure if I actually recommend this one. It is a thing that stands alone amongst all the sappy and crappy gray/dark Harry Azkaban shitfics. This story is *dark*, it is the exact opposite of a comfort fic, it does not have a happy ending, it does surprising and horrible things to the main character. It does have a sequel, which I have not gathered the courage to continue, but it stands alone just as well. And you'll be happy to finish it, because you know there isn't another chapter of the main character being tortured just a link away.

Is it wrong that I think this is a very accurate and complimentary description of my work?

On Summer of Change- the author brought the story to /a/ conclusion, by having a showdown between Harry and Bellatrix. The story as describing the summer also meets the scope of the intention. What frustrates the reader is that the changes haven't been applied to the greater Harry vs. Voldemort conflict, the author explicitly doesn't want others to continue the work, yet he hasn't made the slightest move towards posting a sequel.

***** Ha! Look at me, totally blanking and replying to *you* with that suggestion. Didn't even notice that when I posted but I meant every word, and all with the respect due an author committing 100% to a theme and execution. It is on my favorites list for a reason, but it certainly isn't for everyone, and it /easily/ earns its rating.

Background on SoC makes sense, and I do respect it for finishing when it needed to. Sour grapes in there on my part for a good story ending before I was done reading it, I guess. Far too many fanfic authors (IMO) feel the need to rush into a final fight for no reason other than to justify that complete tag on their stories, so props to anyone resisting that urge.

Now, I just need to correctly use RES so I don't derp on this again...

The best fanfic I have ever read. It's an eight book series, starting with Saving Connor, which begins year one with Harry sorted in Slytherin. Lot's of action, hurt/comfort, and eventual romance. It's a bit slow at first, but wow does it pick up! I personally couldn't stop reading them.

Author's description:AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

****** I really like the pairing. This was the first Fanfic I ever read and I didn't know it was Drarry until the 4th book. I had never known it was even a big thing, but this author did a really great job with it. I remember I getting to the chapter And reading the paragraph where It was obvious that Draco was thinking how he liked Harry and just being like what? And then I thought about it and was like omg yes yes yes!!! Then I was actually hoping that Harry felt the same. And now I ship Drarry. It's not for everyone, but I have given this series to a lot of ppl who feel the way you do, including a friend of mine who is a die hard republican and a very straight man, and they all either don't mind the pairing or they make an exception for this particular series.
