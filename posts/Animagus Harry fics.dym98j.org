It could also be that one of his friends or an important character.

Harry being an Animagus cant be a minor part of the plot, it has to be important.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is one of my favorites and Hermione is an animagus. It's quite central to her character because after reading that which animal you get depends on your personality she uses psychology trickery to modify her personality to ensure a highly useful animagus form, and while she thinks she has it under control her personality warps more and more with every scene from her perspective. The animagus form is also quite plot relevant since after getting the form she wanted she uses it practically everywhere.

She turns more and more into a crazy cat lady, and becomes obsessed with using the cat motif, catburglar in a catsuit with a cat mask and she can turn into a cat, which makes it a little too obvious for the investigating aurors.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

What I thought was wonderful was how it only dawns on the specific investigator after the fact, like "how could I be so thick?!" but in reality could really /only/ be solved by someone close, which of course creates some dramatic tension. It's great.

** In this one, it's unclear if Harry is actually an animagus or not. Some time shortly after starting his (Muggle) primary school, he turned into a dragon and has been such ever since. The Muggles never noticed because of the magic that keeps them from being aware of magical things, and since nobody reacted Harry thought that some kids just turned into dragons. At this point in the story, 6 or 7 of his fellow students have become animagi. linkffn(13230340)

*** This story is a wonderful departure if anyone is looking for a more light-hearted fic that doesn't involve a ton of dramatic, angsty, hyper-mature, or dark themes. For example, there are several instances where Draco Malfoy tries to rile up Harry and Harry throws him through a loop by never taking the bait. Harry just sort of automatically assumes everyone is doing their best and overall has a very positive attitude toward everything. Even when the Dursleys try to abuse him, Harry doesn't really mind, because he intrinsically treats his cupboard under the stairs like a miniature lair, and he can eat pretty much anything so he doesn't go hungry; he even enjoys doing the gardening because he just eats all the plants that need to be gone. It's fantastic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I'm surprised that nobody mentioned *Vox Corporis*.

The story diverges after the Third task in fourth year and Harry spends the summer with the Grangers. Both Harry and Hermione become animagi. It's a very central part of the story, along with the Harry/Hermione romance.

  When Harry goes on vacation with the Dursleys to America, he will learn a skill that may be just what he needs to defeat Voldemort. Of course, because he's Harry Potter, it doesn't quite go as expected. Now, with an incessant, caring Death backing him, Harry doesn't think he will ever get a break. At least his dogfather will be proud that Harry takes after him. Animagus!Harry
