I have read too many rehashes of canon and would appreciate a change. I'm looking for stories that have conflicts different to that of canon; as in there are different tasks for the Triwizard tourney or there are different obstacles in the way of the stone.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is 7 Hogwarts years in a non-magical AU. It's one of the very few fanfics I enjoyed more than Canon Books. I like it so much that I actually wrote a quite [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][detailed summary]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), is another extreme AU. TWT had 4 very different tasks, and Voldemort had a much different plan for his resurrection. In this story, Dumbledore was cool and the Ministry was kind competent, even Lockhart and Pansy Parkinson were likable, but Voldemort was utterly terrifying. Fortunately, Hermione and Aberforth picked up more slack.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), begins shortly before the Troll incident. But this Harry had another 'Power He Knows Not', so Year 1 went quite differently afterwards. Year 2's event however still happened roughly the same, but things became very different once Harry entered the Chamber.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), is near completion. Harry was legally blind and never went to Hogwarts. However, he was magically exceedingly powerful and Voldemort was not his biggest concern.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** So you want AU that still follow Harry through Hogwarts, or is more AU okay too? Just give you both. linkffn(What you leave behind) follows a one year older Harry through Hogwarts. Brilliant story with an enjoyable writing albeit hasn't updated in ages.

linkffn(Too young to die) a Harry who isn't the boy who lived tries to bring his dead sister back to life. It has a few weak points with Harrys brother and parents but a very good story still.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels are a crossover with Dresden files (though you dont need to know anything about it). Filled with demons, angels and similar stuff, very good story.

linkffn(Wastelands of Time) it hardly gets any more AU than this. Harry the Time Warrior ventures to Atlantis. One of the best fics there is and we dont see Hogwarts pretty much the whole time.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) Time travel where we dont see Hogwarts at all, instead Egypt and Merlin.

*** I really didn't like Too Young To Die. The story really wanks the power level of Harry unreasonably high for someone of his age and circumstances. Furthermore, his parents' and Zack's blatantly unjustifiable treatment of him is grating. It's obvious that the author's only making Zack attack Harry in the halls with three dozen people on his side and get trounced for it, for instance, because it's an event that will make you sympathize with Harry for being unfairly ostracized, instead of an event that would be conjured up by... any reasonable antagonist. No, I don't consider Dumbledore's final-chapter confession that he was behind Harry's treatment a justification; "heretofore-benign-looking Manipulative Dumbledore reveals in the last chapter that he's the evil force behind the woes in Harry's life" is a blatant ass-pull.

The author's treatment of women is also really, really skeevy. Women fall over to have sex with Harry left and right because of his Power Level. The Love Interest shows that she is a good, pure, virtuous woman by trusting Harry no matter what horrible things he does; from her treatment in the story it's clear we, the readers, are meant to think this is a laudable hing for her to do, just as it's laudable for Harry to then obliviate her of every interaction over the past year for the purpose of "protecting her". Nowhere is this more evident than with the treatment of Harry's sister as a character. Harry endeavors for twenty chapters, through backbreaking toil, to bring back his sister. At the climax, he finally does! What does his sister do then?

Nothing.

Absolutely nothing. She doesn't have any scene talking with her brother. She doesn't even have a scene where she thinks of her brother after he gets dragged off to prison. She doesn't, for that matter, have any scenes at all. She has no lines, no thoughts, and no characterization- we definitely know what she looks like, though! Ultimately, Harry's sister is not treated as a person- she is a thing for Harry to prize and, ultimately, to get. In other words, she's an excellent example of the treatment every character with a vagina gets in Too Young to Die.

** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) follows canon, but is definitely AU starting with the third book. Along with canon events, there are more plot lines that drive the story forward but are not seen in canon. This is complete, and despite the warnings, there is no actual portrayal of the ship it proclaims to be.

**** But that hasn't happened (nor will it) in the story. It explores how perceptions of a person can change. The story is currently in 5th year and Harriett knows she has a crush on her professor and Snape sees her beyond her parents. It took around 500k+ words to get to that point but the whole plot so far is very believable.
