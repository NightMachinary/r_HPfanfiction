Hi, I'm looking to see if anyone knows where i can find two stories i read a while ago and haven't really refound. One is /Snapdragon and Prongs/ by Ariastar. She purged her ff.net account. I emailed her the other day and have yet to hear anything so if anyone else knows a place it might be posted or a way to contact her I'd be very grateful.

Other one is the /Draco Dormiens/ trilogy by Cassandra Clare. Again any help finding these stories or a way to contact the authors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.


** I can't find any copies of Snap Dragon and Prongs either, but I have copies of the Draco Trilogy as well, in various formats including the PDFs reformatted so they're a smaller file size than the author's original.

** If you don't want to download it, I read Draco Dormiens as a PDF [[http://mortal-instruments.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DracoDormiens.pdf][here]] :) (haven't read the other two in the trilogy though)
