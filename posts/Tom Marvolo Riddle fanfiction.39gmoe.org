So, as the title suggests I'm looking for a well written and comprehensive TMR fanfiction, preferably novel length, during his Hogwarts years and/or shortly afterwards. I'm pretty open about canon-compliance, AUs or even his characterization - the only thing I absolutely can't stomach are the ridiculously unbelievable pairings, most noticeably with Harry or Hermione, that immediately ruin the story from the getgo; sadly 90% of fanfiction that feature TMR do just that. I'm sorry, and to each their own and everything, but I simply can't take any of it even remotely seriously. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I don't have anything against pairings/romance in general, though. But no slash please.

*** The Very Secret Diary is amazing. A word of warning though: it's a dark, dark story that will creep out even the bravest of hearts. Definitely not for the faint of heart.

(Btw, whoever posted the story on ffn.net not only got the title wrong, but didn't bother crediting the actual author either. WTF?)

**** I suppose dark, dark and creepy is right in my comfort zone- not sure what that says about me.

Re: ff.net link- I saw that too (which is probably why I have only seen people like the archiveofourown version). That being said the poster did say this in their profile ~ "After finding out that *A Very Secret Diary by Arabelle* has been deleted I searched far and wide and found the whole document with it so I am now uploading it here so others may still find, read and enjoy it." ~ Also the address bar for me at least has "10705988/1/A-Very-Secret-Diary-*by-Arabella*" so I gave it a pass. Still it would have been very easy to use /The/ and add '-by Arabella' somewhere on the first page.

(emphasis my own)

*** Would your idea be a romance fic or not? A lot of the time when I find a premise sounds intriguing they turn out to be romance fics which are not my cup of tea, especially when they turn into X/Hr as Hermione is often too perfect.

***** That's quite an accurate description of how I view a young Tom Riddle in my head. You definitely should have said it as it has got my imagination going.

Or too stupid. Seriously, I'm a Tomione (TMR/HG) pairing fan, and in some of the fanfictions I read, Hermione is portrayed as this completely naive girl, and thus totally OOC, or as grabbing the Idiot Ball, especially when it comes to stories with smut. I've read one too many fanfics where Hermione basically says, "Wow, how could I have gotten pregnant after having /unprotected sex/? I know, it was the guy's fault all along!"

We're talking about Hermione here - a powerful, very intelligent, clever, cunning, and knowledgeable witch - and suddenly, it's as if she's never even heard /or/ read anything about what she /should/ know about. She lived in a dorm with other, sociable, gossiping, talkative girls. She even tries to give Harry love advice about /Ginny/ in HBP. She /knows/ about these sort of things, and too often, it seems like Hermione's character is derailed simply for the sake of the plot (or rather, to suit the author's weird ideas).

*** Thanks! I'll be sure to check them all out and hopefully at least one of these will be good enough to absorb me, if you will. And I agree with everything else you said, the character has so much potential beyond Rowling's portrayal of him. I will definitely give your story a try once you get around to writing it; would you be willing to share the premise?

** Thanks for all the suggestions guys! Some of them aren't exactly what I was looking for (like 'I am Harry's Brother') but I'll check them out anyway. I'll write a short feedback later on.
