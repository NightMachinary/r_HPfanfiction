Before I rant I just want to say that I absolutely adore Harry Potter. It is one of my favorite book series, movie series, and even the fandom is amazing, well, mostly... While I love the fandom, one of my biggest problems with the fanfiction that I've seen is that there seems to have been this shift ever since Gof, at least from what I've seen.

One of the reasons that I absolutely love the fanfiction of this series is because it used to seem wonderful, and by that I mean that people took the concept of magic and ran with it. In the original series magic was seen, definitely, but it always seemed reserved in a sense, there was never anything truly awe inspiring except for a couple of scenes, and yeah, I get that the series was just as much a story of Harry Potter and co enjoying the ups and downs of being kids as it was about the chosen one beating the evil dark lord, but fanfiction was this place where all of a sudden there was hundreds of story's detailing all of these extremely crazy and absolutely amazing uses of magic that were completely acceptable because Rowling never set limits on that aspect of the story.

Then the Dark ages (As I affectionately call them) happened. All of a sudden story's went from magic to politics, wonderful and new ways of enjoying hp to story's about how everyone's evil and wants to get to Harry, and Jesus Christ all the angst story's, like fucking hell dudes! I'm already going through my own teenage angsty years, I don't need a hundred thousand story's about Harry being raped and mutilated at the dursleys only to the be completely screwed over byeveryone he loves.

Earlier I made a post looking for happy/powerful Harry story's, and while I made a few of the Same points there as I did here, there seemed to be only a few responses because I was looking for fics, I didn't really say I wanted to discuss anything. Or maybe people didn't like my post, idk.

So my question to you is this, what do you think about the fandom? By now the "Dark" ages have kind of reached their end from what I can tell, but there still seems to be this over abundance of these kind of angst story's compared to the story's that really rekindle that wonder of magic that the books inspired in me as a kid. And a quick sidenote, yes I am aware that some story's might be trying to be realistic, but this is fucking Harry Potter, if there was ever a story where realism could be suspended at least to an extent, I mean unless we're going to forget about talking portraits, half Giants, FUCKING HIPPOGRYPHS! And of course Draco Malfoys hair, because that's too slick to be even remotely realistic.

(P.S. Sorry for cussing so much, I tend to get vulgar when I get enthusiastic)


** I guess it's a matter of perspective. To me fanfiction is interesting exactly because it can address the things that Rowling avoided, because she was writing children books.

The fact that torture and rape exist in a world of bigotry and Dark Lords seems like a very natural follow through. The idea that Harry's abuse by his relatives might have run deeper than portrayed in cannon - considering they locked him in a cupboard and later put bars on his window - seems reasonable (even though it has become clich√©d for many fics). The concern that Dumbledore and his Order might not be the paragons of nobility and selflessness is not completely unfounded (and adds much needed conflict if you don't want to retread canon 1:1 - I already know how Harry defeated Voldemort and hunted all his Horcruxes thank you very much). Of course these things have been done to death (and often in a bad way) by ff, but the concepts aren't invalid.

The original books are fun adventure stories and they are very good at that, but even the staunchest Rowling defenders have to agree that many things don't really hold up to scrutiny. I think it's wonderful that fanfiction can pick up on these thoughts and run wild with them... See where they may lead.

*** I know Rowling has said that she envisioned Ron swearing and that she wanted to let him swear in appropriate situations but the publishers wouldn't allow it. I think part of the books not holding up to scrutiny is down to the restrictions she was under, which is a shame.

** The HP Fanfiction cataloge has *750.000* stories on fanfiction.net alone. That is three quarters of a million stories. To put that into a context: The next biggest cataloge is Naruto with not even half a million - 406.000.

If a fandom has at least /one/ story for every taste, its the Harry Potter one.

I can see that. Maybe lean back for a bit and think about the fact that not everybody out there is here to cater to your taste and a lot of people out there won't share your taste either. Some want angsty stories. Some write stories to deal with their own problems. Some couldn't give one damn about the magic in HP, and rather have the characters they love interact. Magic is just one part of the universe and honestly, I highly doubt this fandom would still go strong if authors never branched out.

Yes, there are trends, and of course the trend moved towards darker themes as soon as the books went there. The first four years were fun and exciting. Harry battled trolls, and basilisks and outflew a dragon. The next books he had to deal with abuse and death and despair. Of course fanfiction follows.

Now that the books are long finished, authors starts to think outside the box a bit more. A lot of "extended universe" or "alternative universe" fics have started after DH.

Overall, I enjoy the sheer diversity of fics in this fandom. There is stuff for every mood and every taste, from crackfic to horror story, from powerful Harry to squib Harry. The only problem is the filtering of fics, as there are just so many.

** I think the tone of the stories changed as JKR further refined the world she was presenting. Up until Goblet of Fire, it was acceptable to expect magical birds to swoop in, drop off a God-made Artifact and disable the enemy's strongest weapon.

Later on the stories only allowed for a more limited intercession and even tormented the hero; friends died, villains got away with torture and even the mentors were cut down before they could finish teaching what they needed to teach.

Finally, the last book was released and the options for conjecture about 'what it all means' and 'how great can a main character become' were answered. Much of the swell of fanfiction after that was a protest against the author's endgame, but with the assumption that the underlying rules were now set.

Whenever someone comes around with a different interpretation or extrapolation of magic than what canon has established as the 'hard' limits, critics will suggest that they either 'don't get Harry Potter' or ought to write a whole original series using their ideas.

That's what I see, anyway.

** I have only started reading fanfiction for a bit over a year, so I can't say anything about the evolution of the fandom.

But well, the thing with fanfiction is that anyone can publish it, so it's mostly unfiltered. And given that Rowling is a great author, the majority of fanfiction is bound to be vastly inferior to the source material. And that's ok. Not everyone who enjoys writing is a great writer. But it's still frustrating that it's often so hard to find something readable.

** Can't say I'm a big fan of HP, I just like fanfiction, for some reason. It's extremely popular, so there are a lot of fics and I can actually find some decent writing.
