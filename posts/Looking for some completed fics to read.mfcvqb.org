I've been reading HP fanfiction for 15 years and I'm starting to get a little antsy. I'm looking for recommendations. I might get hate for this, but I actually love a lot of the tropes. It's really interesting to me how people can take the same concept and make it different. So, I love Super!Harry, magical trunks, time travel. You name it, if it's a trope, I probably will like it. Any recommendations would be highly appreciated?

  Post OotP. Harry inherits more than gold from Sirius and his parents. Now he must train to fight Voldemort while fighting against Dumbledore's manipulations. Full Summary inside. Slight Dumbledore Weasley bashing. Review!

** I seem to recall that linkffn(Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand) eventually leaned into Super!Harry, although I don't remember a lot about it except that it starts with a widespread disaster and collapse of society.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a powerful Harry (actually Harriett) as the biggest criticism of what's otherwise an excellent and funny series. Note that her power comes with a price; being exceptional doesn't mix well with hiding your identity.

** I'm so following this thread haha. I'm horrible with remembering fics, but were in the same boat. I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for just about 21 years now. I also love tropes. I think it's because for a lot of fic readers they come into the fandom and the tropes are established and they are everywhere. But for us, we watched them evolve and remember when they weren't tropes but some huge revolutionary part of a plot and it was mind blowing. That's why I like them anyway. I hope you get some good recommendations!

** These are not necessarily super tropey, but they're completed fics that I really enjoy! :D

linkao3(41159) *Beyond the Veil*- fics about Sirius after he fell through the veil were super tropey back in the day, so I say this counts lol

linkao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise Again*-another Sirius through the veil fic

linkao3(987408) *Stealing Harryverse*- Here's a really old one for you, its from 2004! A Sirius and Remus raise Harry fic.

linkao3(1038392) *Teddy Lupin series*. Not that tropey, but its a fun romp of a series of totally completed NextGen fics all from Teddy's POV. Also an older fic, I think it was started soon after the last book came out.

linkao3(189189) *The Changeling* is a fic where Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It has a few tropes like a secret Slytherin club, plus its a really interesting AU.

linkao3(16308554) *Inevitabilities-* very powerful Harry, it's tagged as Harry/Tom, but more of an obsession than a romance

linkao3(15465966) *The Second String*- time travel and powerful Harry. Technically complete, just the epilogue that needs to be posted.

linkao3(6623293) *Realignment* is a Harry time travels fic

linkao3(13760487) *The Dogfather*- another Sirius raises Harry fic

linkao3(10588629) *The Problem of Potions*- Harry is obsessed with potions

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is probably the opposite of tropey... BUT it is so well written, absolutely beautiful and the characterization is amazing. Its a Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle AU. And the pairing is Petunia/Sirius, but I promise it works! Give it a shot ;)

linkao3(1085412) *A Marauder's Plan*- if you like tropes than you've probably read this, but I thought I'd list it, because it is absolutely full of them lol

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his godfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

** I completely understand your desire for completed fics. I, too, have abandonment issues ㅠㅠ Anyway, here are my recommendations for completed fics. I've included one-shots because they are, by definition, complete. ^^ I have too many recommendations for just one comment, so I'll include the rest in a reply to this comment

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

During Harry's Hogwarts Years

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is an AU wherein Sirius never went to Azkaban (for reasons explained in-text). Harry spends his days going to Sirius' bookshop until Sirius discovers canon-level abuse and steals Harry away. There are consequences. Sadly, the sequel is unfinished, but they got up to year 3, so I think it's still worth a read.
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], Lockhart accidentally crosses paths with Sirius on November 1st, 1981. Recognizing the PR opportunity, Lockhart decides to raise Harry and obliviates Sirius.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned).
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is a Snape/Harry mentor story. I like this one because Snape is still a bastard, but he's not the kind of bastard that can watch a kid get abused (canon levels) and do nothing.
- In the world of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][Grey Space]], students get Hogwarts letters at 14. I honestly think that the less you know the better. I love the writing style and it has my favorite kind of magic: homespun rituals (like Life Skills Outside the Curriculum).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! The first story in the (completed) series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him.
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. (complete)
- I know this one is hella famous and even more controversial, but if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], you should give it a try. If you don't like it by, say, chapter ten, then it's not for you.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] is a crackfic wherein Harry is very nearly a squib. He has to be cunning to get by.
- I loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12959277/1/Paradox][Paradox]]. It's got stabby Hermione from an alternate universe, dimension hopping to a universe where Grindelwald rules, and an engaging plot. What else could you want?
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]: Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys, forcing an impromptu visit supervised by Snape. How will Snape react to seeing Harry's treatment by the Dursleys? In ways that are not out of character but also not super dickish. Complete with one sequel complete and another in the works. The first two completed works are 1 million words and the third one is 620k words so far. The third in the series was updated last week.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is super well known, but too great to leave off any rec list. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Definitely recommend this one. The first three in the series are complete. Each can stand alone. The author is writing a fourth one now, but you can stop after the third. (I did)

*** I had too many recommendations for just one comment, so here's some more

Post-Hogwarts

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face....
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20636933/chapters/49004756][Making Do]] is a story of a miserable, broken man who is forced to reckon with a world he never anticipated living long enough to see.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad Says"]] is an EWE. Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there. I thought the writing could tend a bit towards the melodramatic, but I also stayed up until 1:45 a.m. reading it all in one go, so I kinda have to recommend it :-P
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]], the consequences of Malfoy's petty act of revenge force him to actually engage with the world around him. Trust me. He hates it too.
- In a similar vein, Draco acts the fool and gets himself stuck in a Groundhog Day situation in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]]. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the second result. Very good.
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series is touching. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive.
- Practically everyone has read this, but I would be remiss if I didn't include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It is almost universally beloved for its wit and originality.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]], Harry is training to be a Healer and rotating through departments. He ends up in Chemical Dependence (basically rehab). An old rival is currently running the department and Harry is forced to face old wounds.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]] is the polar opposite of the last one. This is a dark mystery wherein Harry is trying to find his wife's killer. I haven't read this in a good long while, but remember enjoying it.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]], Harry gets a glimpse of a world where he made different choices. It is Drarry and epilogue-compliant.

Fics set during Marauders' Time

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It has a completed sequel

*** I am not sure whether or not to apologize for this wall of text.... but this is the last one, I promise!

One-shots

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13502309/1/Molly-Weasley-and-the-Second-Cousin][Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin]] is the true story of her Squib accountant cousin.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is a little similar in that a character is part of the Muggle underworld.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7432218/olivieblake][OlivieBlake]] has two series of one-shots, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12337045/1/Draught-of-Living-Death][Draught of Living Death]] for the darker side and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995576/1/Amortentia][Amortentia]] for light fluff. I loved the Draught of Living Death, but I never truly grew out of my emo goth stage in high school. *shruggies*
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] isn't the best written, tbh, but I really appreciated the concept. It's basically examining how the wizards relying on memory altering to hide their world affects the Muggles in their path.
- In a similar vein (i.e., not the best written, but an interesting concept), I present to you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents][Hermione Granger and The Obliviated Parents]]. It's a oneshot from Hermione's parents' perspective twenty years after the war looking back on how Hermione's obliviation affected their relationship.
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]], Harry ends up in a different universe where he's not the BWL. It's not the main focus of the story, though. The story is more about broken people healing.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] is from Dudley's POV. It won the Quibbler Awards (not sure what that is, but included in case it's relevant). In this, Dudley reads a story with an abusive family and, through it, is able to realize that his own family was abusive to Harry. Vernon and Petunia do not take this realization well.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3052359/1/To-Live-Nobly][To Live Nobly]] is an AU in which the Dark Lord wins. Our protagonist is sleepwalking through life. A chance meeting with a familiar face wakes him up...
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is a gem. In this amusing fic, Harry must buy a toilet. Who comes to the appointment but Malfoy, Lord of Toilets. (this came from a prompt)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks.

#+begin_quote
  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.
#+end_quote

- By the same author in the same "what if series" comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][the girl who lived (again)]]. In this case (again) refers to the fact that the author had previously put out a girl who lived in this same what if line. Anyway, here's the first few sentences that should summarize it: "When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy."
- same author in what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him.
- same author, same what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]]: what if Petunia really and truly took in Harry. "

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).\\
  Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/359705][Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day]] is an 8th year Hogwarts fic. It's by Faith Wood. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, she has three of the top ten stories. Draco comes to with an injured, unconscious Harry Potter in the middle of the Forbidden Forest and without any memory of how he got there.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the number one result. I quite resisted reading it for a while. I thought the summary sounded unbearably dumb. But then I caved. And so did mah heart. Check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] for an 8th year fluffy oneshot by a very popular and prolific author.

** I'll add a few of my favorites.

A Year Like None Other and its sequel. It had a third part that's a wip, but if you prefer complete fics, the first two stand alone just fine. The third was a happy surprise and I'm waiting on it to be finished before I start. I honestly thought part two was the end.

The Minister's Secret.

The Debt of Time.

Storm of Yesterday.

The Best Revenge.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** You mentioned Super!Harry. While it's probably not what you actually meant, may I offer the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El]] series?

For time travel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] has Harry head back in time (accidentally) and finds himself dragged into the fight against Voldemort when a group of Death Eaters attack the pub he's having a drink in.

For comedy, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12169530/1/Charlie-does-the-Foxtrot-A-new-take][Charlie Does The Foxtrot - A New Take]] where Harry is found guilty at his trial and promptly unleashes his Inner Slytherin.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][The Power Of Paranoia]], Harry makes a wrong assumption and runs with it, using the Fidelius to remove all knowledge of him from the Wizarding World. This causes massive issues, including the Great Muggleborn Exodus.

Finally, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8937860/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight][Hiding In Plain Sight]], Harry discovers that not wearing glasses is an almost perfect disguise. At the same time, Alistair Moody becomes a first-year student at Hogwarts.

** u/VulpineKitsune:
#+begin_quote
  I might get hate for this, but I actually love a lot of the tropes. It's really interesting to me how people can take the same concept and make it different.
#+end_quote

Tropes are not inherently problematic. They aren't like cliches.

The problems most people usually have with tropes is either that a) They don't make sense but people still use them anyway and/or b) Instead of properly giving the trope a unique spin, many inexperienced authors simply take it and essentially copy paste it into their fics.

That said, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a linear Circle]] is my recommendation. Incredibly long, yet incredibly detailed at the same time (Note that ~800mil at least is filler/prequel material that, while incredibly made and very interesting, can be safely skipped and you might only miss a couple of references). The actual main story is fully complete. The only things that are incomplete are some filler stories and a prequel. All the important pieces are fully completed.

The pairing is m/m and yes, there are a few sex scenes. But those can be easily skipped if you wish. Please, don't let the pairing turn you away. I normally don't read m/m stories, but this one managed to keep me glued to it from the very start.

I can't actually say much about what kind of tropes it uses, because then I would kinda spoil an important reveal. Trust me when I say that it's a very unique take that /has/ been given a /lot/ of consideration by the author. You can tell that they were very passionate when they wrote it and that they gave a lot of thought to it.

  Harry ended fifth year in a much better place than he began it. The Ministry's hunting Death Eaters, and he's free to focus on school, quidditch, and his girlfriend. But Voldemort's still out there...

** The Merging by Shaydrall has a magical trunk and was only finished recently.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/]])

However, if you've been reading fanfiction for 15 years, which is about the same as me, you've probably read all the good stuff.

Although I keep thinking that but since coming on this subreddit I've been finding stuff I hadn't seen.

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF
