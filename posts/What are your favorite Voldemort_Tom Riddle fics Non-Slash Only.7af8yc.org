Looking to read something different for a change


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), of course. linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) updates at a snail's pace but is pretty good too. linkffn(Rectifier), also, for a more serious sort of story that's actually complete.

Arguably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) as well, and especially its unofficial sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Memories of a Sociopath), which, without giving too much away, does a great job of tying some of the original fic's "arbitrary" departures from canon into established canon lore.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** Antithesis linkffn(12021325) : It is a remake of Shadowed Malice, which I linked lower, featuring a Father!Voldemort with abusive relationships. The story is alright, nothing extraordinary, but it lets itself be read.

Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux linkffn(12278649): Very good story featuring an awaken horcrux inside Harry's head, very good story pacing and character development. Amongst my favorites.

Harry Potter and the Chrysalis linkffn(12278649): Sequel to Accidental Horcrux, on temporary hiatus for now.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9408516/1][Hit the ground running]] : Same theme as the Accidental Horcrux, a bit more innocent and only doing the first year. I did love it.

In Limbo linkffn(11598592) : An enjoyable and well-written one-shot.

Keep your enemy closer linkffn(6512582) : Another one of my favorite stories, with very well written characters and interesting premises and developments.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469) : I'm still not sure how to categorize that one. Feels like a story that do not take itself seriously, without being a parody. Tremendously enjoyable.

Limpieza de Sangre linkffn(11752324) : Featuring female Voldemort. Well-written, but cahracters are overly blushing everywhere and it kind of pull you out of the story after a while.

Shadowed Malice linkffn(7179133) : Wrong boy-who-lived, with all the tropes that come with it. Edgy!Harry somewhat gary stue and featuring a Father!Voldemort. I did like it, however, and there's nothing particularly wrong with it.

The Nightmare Man linkffn(10182397) : Good and original, I liked it very much. There's a prequel, but without voldemort, so I did not post it.

The Train to Nowhere linkao3(294722) : It WILL go slash eventually, that I am certain. I would still recommend it, because it is a marvel of worldbuilding and character development. Very, very good.

Warning sighs read Desolation linkffn(11358664) : Hasn't updated in nearly a year. Disappointed, because the story is good. Characters kind of pop up from everywhere without building, but it's really not a major flaw and it's a very enjoyable read. IF IT COULD ONLY UPDATE.

Warping Circumstances linkffn(2862220): I'm still puttint it there, it has time travel, but I'm mixed. I enjoyed-ish for what it was, but there are lots of small things. It is not beta-read, for once, written in present tence, which is something I have a problem with from the get go (personal preferences) and has lots of small mistakes with the quality going down as a whole. I'd still recommend you to give it a look, I'm a VERY picky reader, so choices I view as bad quality does not mean you will not enjoy it yourself.

  COMPLETE. When Voldemort came to, he realised he was completely stark naked ... in the middle of King's Cross Station ... which was illogically silent and empty save for himself and a grinning Harry Potter. This was just a bizarre dream, surely. (Gen, MoD!Harry, oneshot)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

#+begin_quote
  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when your only friend is your worst enemy. The war ended over a hundred years ago. Harry Potter and Voldemort are old, out of practice, and politely ignoring each other. What a pity that couldn't last. In the Black Forest something is rising which will require them both to stop. Major non-canon elements. COMPLETED.

  He died trying to save the universe... thousands of years in the future. Now he's back in his reincarnation of 1926. Meet Charles, one of the many reincarnations of Harry Potter. He comes to 1930 with big plans, none that involved Tom Riddle.
