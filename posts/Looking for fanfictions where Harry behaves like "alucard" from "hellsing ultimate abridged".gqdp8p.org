*** Alucard is depicted as an amoral psychopath who is only technically a good guy because he does kill people worse than he is (canon Hellsing). The Abridged series also adds an element of him being a wisecracking smart-ass. For example, he sends this letter to the Pope:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Chief Replacement,

  I wanted to send you this friendly little letter to inform you of your imminent demise. If you're curious about the frequency of which I send these letters, it is merely to instill as much fear as I can. As if basting a turkey. Which I will then proceed to have sex with.

  That's right.

  I'm going to FUCK the fear turkey.

  Follow me @theCrimsonFuckr!

  Sincerely, Alucard
