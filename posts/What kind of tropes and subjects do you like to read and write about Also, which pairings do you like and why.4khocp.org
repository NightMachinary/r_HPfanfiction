*** To leapfrog on this, complex endings. Endings which aren't black and white, where victory is achieved, but at a cost - and that can be to the hero or the villain. At the end of Empire Strikes Back, for instance, Vader seems to have won, but the heroes have escaped.

**** I don't care what the middle of a story "ends" like. If Star Wars ended with ESB, I'd not like it. And while I don't mind "Victory but at a cost", it should be both a victory, and at a cost that doesn't turns it into tragedy. Rule of thumb is: If more good guys die than bad guys, and half the cast ends up dead, then it's not a happy ending.

***** That's your opinion, and I commend you for it. Mine is different, and I enjoy downer endings that aren't grimdark.

It needs to be remembered that at the end of ESB wasn't the middle at the time, and it was not clear that it would get a sequel (though clearly Lucas was angling for it). I think it succeeds as a story on it's own.

**** Well, frankly most of them are crap. Enjoyable crap, yet still crap. So I'll just list a bunch that I enjoy. Assume that the fic is completed, if I don't say otherwise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts Redux by Clell65619]] is a (mostly) less serious fic about the two of them post defeat of Voldemort.

A classic by kb0 is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is always Greener]].

For a... darker take is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6245561/1/The-Lies-that-Bind][The Lies that Bind by Zephros]].

SeriousScribble's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] is the pinnacle of an HP noir fic.

Just because it gives me a sort of spy v spy kind of feel, you can check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145549/1/Duality][Duality by Anda Faith]]. Still in progress.

For another in progress fic, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][Days to Come by chris400ad]] which I enjoy.

A very quippy fic would [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord]], and I'm rather annoyed that it took me 10 minutes to remember the name of this.

There is the only chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487772/1/The-Amalgamation-Agreement][The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomiac]] and I'm furious that this is the only chapter.

And finally, the in-progress [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy by storytellerSpW]]. Easily the longest on this list, with a good 80 chapters, 720,006 words, and still more to go, though it is nearing the end.

** Considering the current contents of the thread, I'm going to be a weirdo and say that Harry-centric fanfics generally bore me, unless they feature some insanely unique premise. No, what I really like are fanfics that centre around Hermione, because she has so much more drive to /do things/ than most of the other characters. She doesn't really need much poking to want to go out and change the world, because the Wizarding World as portrayed is a stagnant mess, and we really don't see much of it from Harry's perspective. Seriously, it's a travesty how her drive to change the status quo is treated by Rowling in canon. Hermione, by comparison, actively wants to learn about this stuff in the same way I would, and is much more likely to get into the particulars of how things work, and why the Wizarding World actually kinda sucks in canon. Basically, I like heavy, technical stories with an independent protagonist, but Indie!Harry is generally a cancerous mass of stupid, so I ended up shifting all of the things I like about that idea onto Hermione instead, and she seemed like a much better fit. She had drive, and ambition, and the bravery to apply it... until the horrendous SPEW thing stamped that out of her, I guess.

Time travel can be either the best thing since sliced bread, or insanely boring, depending on the author. I still love the idea, particularly Groundhog shenanigans, though I prefer it when things get progressively more intense /without/ devolving into 'wacky' comedy. For example, 'Time Braid', from the Naruto fandom, manages to be funny at times, yet remains mostly serious despite the rampant insanity of a multiple-Groundhog collision. And that's /interesting/ in a way that 'Hey, let's go snowboarding instead of attending Hogwarts, lolrandom', Innortal-style loops never will be.

Pairings wise, I'm a sucker for femslash. I don't know what it is, but femslash pairings often seem to be balanced (in terms of power dynamic in the relationship) in ways that het and slash often aren't. I think it has something to do with the Seme/Uke thing that slash has going, though I've read some very good slash and het romances too. I prefer heavily conflicted pairings, like enemies hooking up, because the line between hate and love always was quite thin. With that in mind, Bellatrix/Hermione is basically my crack cocaine, though post DH Hermione/Narcissa can be pretty interesting too. I always felt that Hermione needed someone who could keep up with her, you know? Pansy/Hermione could be cool, depending on how you characterised Pansy, but there's a real dearth of well-written fanfic for that pairing. Fleurmione isn't bad, though there's less intrinsic conflict to the pairing, and therefore can more easily devolve into mindless (and boring) fluff/smut. If you hadn't noticed, I find R/Hr a little too tame, and I have difficulty believing they'd stay together for very long.

Ginny/Luna is adorable, 'nuff said. As far as het goes, I'm partial to Harry/Tonks, but those are pretty rare, and ones that don't treat Tonks like a fashion accessory are rarer than rocking-horse shit. Seriously, most Honks fics are harem 'gotta catch em all' style affairs, and I have no tolerance for that.

TL;DR: Hermione could be awesome, and I think she's more awesome as a lesbian and/or with someone as smart as her. Other stuff is okay, I guess.

**** linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear by Kuraibites) is a classic Bellamione, and probably the fic that got me interested in the pairing. It's very slow-burn, as a 'realistic' improbable pairing really should be. Like... 150k words before they even think about kissing, slow burn, yet despite this the progression is natural and evocative as Hermione's perception of Bellatrix slowly shifts. I'd say the biggest obstacle to a new reader is that early on Bellatrix does some things that might seem odd based on her canon personality, largely because Kuraibites had to expand her backstory enormously to make her a more complex and interesting character. She's still the sadistic whackjob we know and love, just that her personal loyalty to Voldemort is somewhat overstated. Frankly, canon Bellatrix started and ended with Sadist!Insane!villain, and this take on her is /so/ much more than that. *Cannot recommend this one enough.*

Linkffn(The Dark Corners of the Earth by Useful Oxymoron) is far from your typical Bellamione, and mixes political drama with adventure and cosmic horror in what feels like the magical world's first world war. Despite this, the pairing is extremely important to the plot, and the ending made me cry a little.

linkffn(Our Mercurial Selves by brightsilverkitty) was... weird. Interesting Bellamione, but a bit of a mind screw if memory serves. Been a while since I read this one, so it might not be as good as I remember, but it was solidly written as far as I know. Her other big fic, Time Heals All Wounds is a Bellamione story I've had on my reading list for ages and never got around to reading, due to being distracted by SwanQueen stuff over in OUAT.

As for Hermione/Narcissa, there aren't so many good ones that I've seen. Linkffn(Skirmish by fountainpens) is pretty good for the banter and general awkward adorableness of a post DH BookshopOwner!Hermione romancing Narcissa Black over coffee and book recommendations.

Linkffn(Glass Silence by Zarrene Moss) is a very AU Hermione/Black Sisters (not Blackcest up to where I last read). The tags imply that it's endgame Bellamione, though her romantic attentions are largely split between Bellatrix and Andromeda to begin with. Hermione's interactions with Narcissa are more 'sisterly' for a long time though I caught hints of slow-burn romance there. It's certainly quite dramatic, and despite some parallels, I wouldn't call it a harem fic. It's more like a three-way tug of war...

Edit: [[http://batlesbo.deviantart.com][Batlesbo]] over on deviantart has some great fanart for Gilded Chains in her gallery, if you're interested. She also did the cover art for the aforementioned.

***** Aye, i see another Bellamione fan here on this subreddit! Yes Gilded Chains is one of those born again fics and gives me faith that some of my in-progress fics may somebody be updates or have an ending. It was a little tormenting to reach ch. 63 and watch it lay dormant from Dec 2012 to Dec 2014. Also, I find Time Heals All Wounds to be a decently well written fic, but is underwhelmed by its ending, where the house elf solves everything. Something i do go back and read here and there

Useful Oxymoron's two Bellamione stories are also very enjoyable i agree, although i find Bellatrix and Severus fighting it out as the head of two magical alliances in a wizarding world war a little stretching my suspension.

[[/u/throwy09]] Another fic i do recommend for Bellamione is linkffn(Room 5), at least up till chapter 27. It raises the forbidden allure of this two characters on opposing factions. This is one fic where i was well-prepared to accept chapter 27 as a decent end and would have been content with what i got.

****** As I recall, it got excessively grimdark, with Hermione becoming more and more unhinged due to the use of dark magic. As far as I remember, I read maybe the first 100k before I got tired of wondering if it was just going to be an endless downward spiral, because dat tragedy tag tho. In all seriousness, it doesn't really seem like the kind of fic you read for the Hermione/Narcissa... where I got to, it was more about the effects that dark magic can have on a person, and the psychological horror involved.

I love weird, twisted ships, but generally prefer when things work out in the end (for a given value of working out), so I avoid the 'tragedy' tag largely because that's usually FF.net's 'sadfic' tag.

There's a compulsion placed on them now that they're married; it's making them very attracted to each other and I think it makes them love each other too, since that takes care of all conflicts that might arise. Narcissa does mention the age difference once, but Hermione convinces her age is just a number and that's that. I guess the grimdark is there because the conflict has to come from somewhere.

********** Yeah... sounds about right. At least, it doesn't conflict with anything I remembered about it, which was mostly that the romance was incredibly bland when it was present at all.

Considering I'm personally in a relationship with someone twelve years my senior... let me tell you that age gaps are way more than that. Depending on the size of the generation gap, it's possible that you might seem to be speaking different languages at times, yeesh. Age may not be /super/ important in love, but it's far from 'just' a number. Stupid authors. /Rant

Also, soul bonds, ick. That may be what put me off, thinking about it. I couldn't stomach Twin Dragon Heartstrings, one of the longer Bellamione stories I've seen, because apparently Hermione having the sister(?) wand to Bellatrix's acts /suspiciously/ like being soul bonded to a remarkably docile (and still living, don't remember how) Bellatrix. And that just... saps the life out of a romance fic, when you derail a character for the sake of the ship, or make two strangers (or mortal enemies, in this case) act like they're in love. Or both, y'know, /whatever works, author/ 9_9. I really don't get it. It's just fucking lazy, at the best of times.

*********** See, I read a lot of snarry, which has a great age disparity and power imbalance, and never thought about how language itself might be an issue. It's such an interesting point you brought up.

And in the story, I forgot to mention, Voldemort orders Narcissa pregnant. You'd thought that might bring some conflict, but ofc not. Snape has a potion for this.

It's basically everything I love about HP and Naruto in one down-to-earth crossover fic, which is something given that canon Naruto has become everything I hate about Shonen anime. Long story short, Sakura is the reincarnation of Hermione's soul after a deliberately vague (and, via hinted memories, utterly chilling) incident in the Potterverse. Sakura/Hermione-centric, with some absolutely beautiful imagery and unusual takes on Potterverse concepts.

** I am fairly new to HP Fan Fiction but so far this has been my interests:

My favorites above all else are Harry-centric fics that dive MUCH deeper into Harry having to change the world. In other words, stories where he doesn't just stop with taking out Voldemort, but wants to change or do more, such as fixing the "stagnant" magical world, or maybe even merging the magical/muggle worlds or other things.

I don't really care if hes good/light, dark/evil, or something in between as long as its well done and he doesnt come off as too childish. I prefer more mature material, with the darker side of things, blood, gore, sex, whatever because I hate it when writers hold their punches and do not create a realistic world for the sake of a "pg" or "t" rating if you will. If your story is solid with that rating then great, but more often then not I feel writers hold back.

I also like some romance in my stories but in this situation I am not the most picky. I like a LOT of pairings, but my favorites are Harry and either Hermione/Daphne/Luna. I am not a fan of Harry/Ginny. I am not particular to the style of romance (no slash though), and am very accepting of harems, multiple pairings, marriage contracts, and the like... as long as its well done and has solid reasoning behind it.

Not a big fan of AU unless its well mixed in, and have yet to find a "crossover" I liked apart from a single story relating to what was beyond the viel (star wars). If I look outside the Harry-centric style, then I do enjoy stories about James/Lily as well, in addition to stories where Hermione is the main character.

Then you should like those fics:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): Hermione and Harry were quite brutal in this story, and the real war began after Voldemort's fall.

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): it's extreme AU, Harry and Voldemort were duking each other out over the control of Europe. Both sides had thousands of magicals and millions of muggle soldiers at their disposal. It's one of the very few fics that successfully merged magic and tech.

*The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971): the muggles surprised and seriously threatened the survival of magicals. Under Harry's leadership, they built a magical spaceship and headed out for stars, but their trouble was just beginning. This fic is another nice merging of magic and technology, and the plot is excellent.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): the Ministry still sucked after Voldemort's fall, so Harry and his friends decided to fight back. Brilliant writing, very emotional, I especially loved the Trio relationship. It's one of my all time favorites.

**** Ive read Emperor. Amazing story but its so AU that I struggle to connect to it as a HP FF in some ways. Ive also read Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution and enjoyed it.

I have heard of Starship Hedwig but have yet to read it... partially because of a backlog of other things to read, but partially because I was worried how AU it would be. The Sum of Their Parts is on my "to read" list... again not read yet due to the "too many stories, too little time" reasoning.

Especially when they proceed to NOT do evil acts, but pretend to resist doing the good they eventually do. It's like making a character go from Good to Evil and then have then redeemed back to good.

I wanted to see the main characters enjoy their hard-won victory for one. My first fic, linkffn(A Little More Time) was one where Remus/Tonks survive their battle because their son pulls them forward into time and the implications reverberating from that act.

** I like female Harry and almost every kind of Master of Death Harry under the sun, and I like it even more when you put the two together. I like complicated duels between competent duelers. I absolutely love it when I come across something both novel and unique that is written with even an ounce of talent, examples being linkffn(On A Pale Horse;The Little Veela That Could;A Long Journey Home). I like crossovers, all sorts.

I love it when Mythology worms its way into stories; seriously, first year had a goddamned /Cerberus/. Why isn't more greek mythology extrapolated from that?? Second year could be a vengeful medusa or something. I remember one fic I read used a manticore for the First Task. Make the three tasks seven tasks instead! Make them Labors! Fifth year could use pegasi instead of Threstrals, though threstrals are very neat. So many farging things!

Where was I... I like magical theory. If you can do it in a non text-block manner, I will gladly read it. I like Old Magic, Deep Magic, Grand Magic... Magic! Especially magic on a big scale, the kind of stuff that just feels /awesome/ in the original sense of the word.

I just want more dramatic things. Not drama, /dramatic/. Flashy duels and powerful rituals and /dramatic/ things.

For pairings, I like Harry/Luna, Harry/Narcissa, and Harry/Tsundere!Pansy. I have yet to find a fic with all three at the same time. That would be a weird harem...

EDIT: I never said why I like them. Luna is adorable and the epitome of "be yourself and give no fucks". Narcissa is a straight up MILF and prime fantasy material, not going to pretend it's anything else. As for Pansy...

** I like stories where Harry isn't famous. It's annoying that he always has this "Boy-Who-Lived" reputation hanging over him and he can't just make a name for himself or act without it clashing with wide preconceived expectations, constantly hunted by Voldemort and monitored by others. It limits the plot significantly.

Right now I have an interest in absurd narratives that throw realism to the wind. Other than that, introspective characters, realistic characters, characters who are selfish and don't think it's their responsibility to save the world, characters who act instead of passively suffer, creative use of magic, characters who live with a big secret they struggle to hide, easygoing characters, stories with realistic consequences, and stories that try to make sense of the wizarding world rather than bash it.

Romance doesn't really interests me, canonically I like Harry/Luna because they seem to understand and fulfill each other's needs, but most fanfiction portrays it badly. Harry/Pansy is a guilty pleasure for the banter and the hate-sex.

The only negative is that Changes in a Time of War is not finished. Despite that though, I've read this series multiple times because of how well done it is.

But my personal favourite are "adult children" fics, were either the main character is an 11yr old super genius, or an older character dies or goes back in time and ends up with their adult memories in their younger bodies. This can take pretty much any for from Snape getting a re-do to save Lily, or Harry dying and ending up as a severely war-torn child with dark tendencies and PTSD. If there's a scene with a minor walking into Borgin & Burkes like they own the place, I want to read it lol. I also like Slytherin!anything (my house is NOT evil!), Lord Potter, Snape Mentors Harry... Honestly, if it's long enough to keep me interested (I average 40k words a day, more on my days off work), well written, and not a Snape Bash (he's my favourite character) then I'll probably give it a try.

My favourite pairing are SS/LE, SS/HG, HG/DM, HG/SB, and HP/DM. But again, I'll try anything. I swore I would never buy the whole HP/DM slash, them found a few extremely well written fics that made it completely believable. I also swore that Voldemort was evil and that was that, and I've found several HG/TR time turner fics that actually made me cry, and even one (that I've since lost and would like to re-read) where Voldemort is actually the good guy and Dumbledore is the manipulative Dark Lord.

TL;DR I'll read almost anything that's over 20k words and well written.

I tend to prefer stories whose main conflicts deal with complex power struggles among groups of people as opposed to "rise of a dark lord/existential threat" type tales. Or "yet another Hogwarts rehash" exploration.

I'm ambivalent about pairings. If there are any, all I ask is that the author make them believable and authentic.

** I'm a whore for time-travel fics, tbh. I devour fics featuring it in every fandom I'm in. I also really love grey!Harry, dark!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, MoD!Harry, genderswap!Harry, and BAMF!Harry (in general) fics. Severitus (both mentor!SS and bio-dad!SS) is another weakness of mine, though I haven't come across many that are both long /and/ well-written.

I also adore Harry-centric crossovers. Oh, and Harry-goes-back-in-time-and-raises-himself fics are always fun, though there aren't many well-written ones. "Eighth year" fics are pretty great, too. Creature fics are also great, though I haven't come across many that are long, well-written, and plotty as opposed to just shippy.

As for pairings...I ship Harry with most people, tbh (I refuse to read HP/Ginny, HP/Cho, and HP/Tonks, though).

For het I'm particularly fond of seeing Harry paired with Luna, Hermione, Bellatrix, Pansy, Millicent, Daphne, and Fleur. I read a fascinating Harry/Rose fic once, too.

For slash, I'm extremely partial Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Cedric, etc.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
