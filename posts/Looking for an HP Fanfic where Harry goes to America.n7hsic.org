:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Been trying to find this fic for a while but i can't seem to recall the name or much about it. It's a fic where Harry goes to America, and I think he get's guilt tripped into joining a band? Oh yeah and it definitely takes place after Sirius dies in OotP cause Harry writes music to grieve.

Any help would be appreciated


** Could it be Rise Above? I only read the first couple of chapters but it might fit. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7833937]])

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

*** Hey thanks for replying but this one isn't it either. It's been a couple of years since I've read the fic but i'm certain that Harry went to America by himself and that the Order spends months looking for him .... oh I remember that the only reason he returns is because death eaters attacked a concert? he was at and the order followed them.
