** Well, first off, you need to shorten your summary by a /lot/ - Aim for a singular paragraph.

Secondly, there gets to be a point, where you've mixed in enough different ideas and universes and unique characters that, well, you're really better off working on it as something original.

There's nothing new under the sun, everything is just a rework of something else. Don't limit yourself keeping it as “fan fiction” when you could make something incredible that's wholly your own.

** This is extremely hard to read. I would suggest getting a beta or at least using grammarly or a similar application. Paragraphs that look like this should not be in it

As his head continue to ache when his younger brother yelled and delight at the site of a rope tower that you could climb with platform suspended about 10 feet into the center of it. His two other young siblings Followed after Elijah a moment later and Mira given that she was 12 instead wandered over to a few of the girls that had been there when they arrived that were spinning on the gymnastics bars It was an old playground most likely built sometime in the 1970s with an adventure layout along with gymnastics equipment what looked to be uneven bars and even a pommel horse somewhere in the distance. There were teenagers as well as younger kids and a few parents scattered around the older teens were smoking in one corner by an old oak tree and then he heard it. The sound he didn't recognize but was somehow buried into the subconscious mystery that was his previous outing, A shout of “ Oi! Bastard! “ With reluctance Adrian turned around and there in front of him was someone quite surprising another teenager that was actually a few inches taller than him given the fact he was nearly 6'4 That was quite an achievement and somewhere in his fuzzy faded memories of alcoholic darkness it registered that the guy in front of him grinning like a madman was Abrams And Adrian had pushed him Off of low laying bridge into a slow moving river last evening, At least from the Giants expression it hasn't caused any offense.

Also, I can not find a single moment in the chapter that even remotely relates to HP

** This is like the fifth time that you've posted what is clearly an original story here. And you might claim that the HP stuff will show up later, but you have absolutely no credibility because you've done this so many times before.

And I'm sure you'll just end up deleting this post and story when you don't get enough attention or something, because that's what you've done every other time.

And to top it all off, your story is also an incomprehensible mess with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Again.
