I'm pretty bored of the Gryffindor's rash mentality, I want some fics where the characters use their brain more. I've read some !Slytherin Harry fics but i've been having a hard time finding any !Slytherin Hermione fics. So if anyone knows any good ones please post them!

Thanks!

*** Can anyone confirm if the first one has Hermione/Snape before I read it? Because if it does I really don't want to.

**** It does *not* have Hermione/Snape. It's just that they are the two most prominent characters in the story. (The author says as much in his notes at the beginning.)

*** I love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][/Princess of the Blacks/]] but fem!Harry is in Ravenclaw not Slytherin.

It doesn't matter if you're looking for 'dark' because /Princess/ has that in spades, but it doesn't have much of the overt multi-character politiking that seems to happen in a lot of the Slytherin stories.

** There is a ton of Slytherin!Harry fics, but a very small number that is tastefully done and enjoyable. Here are some:

- On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth (already linked from another post): Best of the subgenre.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] by Big D on a Diet: a hilarious series of one-shots speculating on how certain canon events would have turned out had Harry been a Slytherin
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/][Hogwarts Battle School]] by our very own [[/u/KwanLi][Kwan Li]]: a fusion of sorts between /Harry Potter/ and /Ender's Game/.
- The /Grey Maiden/ series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1015585/Chris-Widger][Chris Widger]]: Harry is raised by Lily's friend: abandoned, but what's written is good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When_In_Doubt_Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate!]] by Sarah1281: Harry is adopted in his infancy by Gilderoy Lockhart. A lighthearted fic. Has the rare property of being actually finished.

--------------

For Slytherin!Hermione fics, I occasionally trawl the fandom for those, subject to the constraints that 1) she is still a muggleborn, 2) she doesn't get an instant and inexplicable friend in Draco or some other cop-out that solves her problems for her, and 3) the technicals are decent. Given those, here are some that are either not too bad or have potential to be good:

- Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk (already linked from another post): Almost certainly the best execution of this premise so far.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][Labyrinth]] by Kroontjespen: A Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione, with Harry tagging along. Updates very slowly.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5769888/1/][Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter]] by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel: Probably abandoned, but what's written so far is amusing enough to be worth a read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][The Snake Pit]] by cupcake0118: New fic, only one chapter so far, but, given what I've heard from the author, it has potential.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8094421/1/][Wake of War]] by JeanHermioneSnape: Obviously intended to be an HG/SS fic, abandoned, but it can be read as a decent character study.

There are a few others that fit the criteria but did not really go anywhere.

** The Arc of Sacrifices by Lightning on the Wave is probably the biggest one I've been reading. It's taking me forever to get through the third book, it's something like 1.2M words... :/

** Not slytherin harry necessairily but anything with the pairing harry/daphne is typically a fic with a smarter harry rather than the rash gryffindor mentality. Not quite what you are looking for but similar would be the first book of congregation of asp by zaxorus. I dont remember what it is called, sorry.

** Just remembered: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift]] by cossette-aimee has a slightly Peggie-Sue Harry posing as Sirius's illegitimate son, end up going through Hogwarts again, this time in Slytherin. Hermione ends up following him into Slytherin. Updates /very/ slowly, but not much slower than /On the Way to Greatness/.
