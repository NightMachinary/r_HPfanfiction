For me, it's any fic where in dialogue they constantly say each other's names. "Harry, blah" "okay, Hermione, blah," "But Harry, blah," "Hermione, blah". Makes my skin itch.


** I power through it sometimes, but I really can't stand disrespectful nicknames for Dumbledore and Voldemort. You can make the characters as evil or manipulative or incompetent as you want. They both deserve a minimum amount of respect for what they accomplished in their life.

*** As a side note to this, something that doesn't cause me to drop a fic but does annoy me. The obligatory 'You shouldn't be afraid of a name.' trope, where Harry tells everyone they are dumb for fearing a name, which may make sense in the real world but makes no sense in Harry Potter.

- In classical tales of magic you avoid saying the name of evil because saying the name draws the evil's attention.

- Mind control was a real problem during Voldemort's first reign. You never knew who you could really trust, who might be listening.

- Voldemort was a known Parselmouth, I personally don't know how common snakes are in the U.K. is, but it would make me tight lipped outdoors.

- In book 7 we find out there is literally a magic that exists that allows a spoken word to be taboo. If you speak it, people will know, and they will find you, and they will most likely kill you. I don't know if Voldemort had access during his first reign but the potential exists if not for the exact magic, but something similar.

You don't laugh and mock people from war zones when they flinch at loud noises, or something sets off a flashback. It's damn insensitive of Harry to look down at those that have lived through such a time and have lingering fear of certain things. Nor is it ok to mock children for being scared of something that terrifies their parents.

**** Yeah, I don't really get it either. I think it's sort of like Manipulative!Dumbledore/Weasley!Bashing. Almost just thrown in because it's been big. But that's also the issue. It's just thrown in.

I swear I have seen more than one fic that seems to have written a chapter and then go trough it and find a place to fit in a Snape bait, a Ron-is-a-moron, Dumbledore-does-something-stupid. And you get the idea. If it doesn't do something for the story, then why have it be there. The silly names were sort of cool when I came across them, but when it's used in place of the character's actual name all the time except for when they're talking with said character. Then it just detracts from it.

You have Harry cursing up a storm, ranting and raving about the old manipulative bastard (which I don't mind), how he's going to "bloody make him pay" and suddenly "Dumbledork".

I don't mind angry Harry using childish insults for Dumbledore either - usually, in those fics, Harry is throwing a teenage tantrum anyway, and such words fit that attitude.

******** I'll allow it - the fics where it gets on my nerves are those where Harry is this ultra-mature perfect person but still uses those names every single time. It just doesn't fit. In a tantrum or as a one-off sure, but not all the time. As to taking away the fear of the name, I feel calling him tom would do that just fine (and I have read several fics I really liked which did that). On the other hand one of the reasons Fanfiction is great is that most people will find what they like and have things that they dislike while still having a lot in common. Like we are all real people or something, that is so rare on the internet :D

I get that he changed from Azkaban, but in the flashbacks, he came across more like an extremely entitled teenaged boy with a cruel sense of humor. He probably wasn't that way all the time, but growing up in the Black family is going to leave signs whether he likes it or not. I'm tired of reading stories that have him as a huge goofball.

I imagine a one-shot in which a Harry who doesn't understand oaths properly rushes into one to prove he's telling the truth, but instead of validating the truth he actually makes a magical commitment to tell the truth for the entire rest of his life (because he didn't specify a time period).

** I'm so glad I'm not the only one - that drives me up the wall!! Just awkward dialogue in general I can't stand. I wrote a mini lesson on tumblr yesterday:

#+begin_quote
  Nail down dialogue. It seems to be the thing that separates the good writers from the bad. Good, natural sounding dialogue comes from the same skills that lend themselves to acting - empathy, being articulate, and being able to adapt to your audience. If you want to read my lengthy lecture how-to, click keep reading.

  The first thing to remember is that people all talk differently. To be hyperbolic, don't have Dumbledore saying, “whazup dudes?”, just as you shouldn't have Stan Shunpike saying “don't be so obtuse, old chap.” When I find it hard to find a character's voice, and I often do, I write out their canon scenes to establish their vocab/formality level, their patterns, and any favourite phrases. For example, I've noticed that Remus is generally very articulate and rather formal, but at times of high emotional stress he uses a lot of pauses, and stammers slightly. Ron, on the other hand, uses lots of contractions, like dunno, but speaks with confidence even when angry - he doesn't use pauses or dashes, he has a quick tongue even at moments of high stress, and is likely to interrupt people. When it comes to creating OCs, they too should have their own unique and personable voice, and you should stick to it. Your reader probably won't notice if you do it well, but they will notice if you get it wrong. Practice makes perfect.

  When you have written dialogue, read it aloud. Does it sound right? Is it something that you can imagine being said on tv? (Don't wonder if you would say it - you are not writing yourself, you are writing a character. You may well talk like a robot, but unfortunately that probably means you don't have a career on tv)

  A few things that people often don't realise make their dialogue sound awkward:

  Overusing names/terms of affection. Ron doesn't need to call Harry mate every other word, and most people only say the other person's name when they greet them.

  Writing too formally. We don't want to write exactly how we speak - with lots of ums, and ahs and talking over one another, but we do want to use contractions, offhand comments and, now and then and only where appropriate, noises like “oh”, “eh?” and “huh”. Breaking the rules occasionally is ok and helps immersion, but most dialogue should be smooth and easily readable.

  Misuse of slang. This is a difficult one, especially if you are writing a character who has not grown up in the same country as you, or is in a different time period. I know it's not the same, but my eye twitches on so many Marauder imagines because they use slang and phrases that just didn't exist in 1970s England. Similarly, as much as you may want to use the charming British dialect you heard on vacation, Harry is unlikely to use words like “wee” or “aye”, because he grew up in Surrey, not Glasgow. If you are going to include slang, first think - has the character ever used this word or a similar word in canon? If you're not sure or the answer is no, ask a British person. My askbox is always open.

  Trying way too hard with accents. Hagrid's accent was HARD but JK Rowling knew it very well. Unless you're very familiar with an accent it's probably best to avoid writing it phonetically. It will just frustrate your reader.

If I was writing/reading him as the main character I think the accent would become really grating really quickly - even good fics like Hogwarts Houses Divided slip up by not getting that just saying "he had a thick Scottish accent" is enough of a description.

A good way to get around it if it's from his perspective is that people don't often realise they speak with strong accents. You can show that they have an accent by the reaction from other characters - people struggling to understand or saying 'you must be a Somerset lad, eh?' or something.

*** She had no idea that when she started her day she would run into the dreaded Lich of Agamar. Really, she just wanted to take a walk on the bike trail. Looking back some manners might have saved her, she knew that you walked on the right, and that the left side was reserved for runners and bikers, but surely it wouldn't matter would it?

Hearing a sigh behind her she saw him. Rotted flesh and eye sockets lit by green flames, wearing shorts and headband.

"You dare get in the way of my morning jog!!!!" screamed the feared jogging lich of Agamar.

"I am sorry." She proclaimed stepping out of the way, letting the lich pass by. "I don't see what the big deal is."

The lich paused and turned back around to face her. He pulled a couple of stones out of his pocket and they began to orbit his head. Spinning faster and faster they formed a portal. She screamed as she was pulled into the tear in reality. She found herself mentally and temporally lost in the vast ocean formed by his sparkling cerulean orbs.

The lich nodded to himself. It turns out it was a wise investment creating a personally demi-plane with time and mental suppression built in. Though it was a shame that it shared a boarder with the elemental plane of water, damn thing was always leaking. Putting his Ioun Stones away he continued his jog, daring anymore to stand in his way.

Yep, that's an instant close for me. Except if the fanfiction is set years in the future, after a long marriage - then "love" or "dearest" are acceptable, if - and only if - used rarely.

However, "babe" is never acceptable for any book character, except maybe Cormac McLaggen.

This is completely untrue. As a nineteen year-old I have to wonder if I'm someday going to forget my pre-teen and early teen years and have the same false memories of my youthful innocence someday, because most adults seem to have done so.

I had sexual feelings for both of my first crushes, the first was a girl in my class in Year 5 so when we were both 9-10 years old and the second was my friend's sister when I was twelve and she was eleven.

And given the conversations I had with my friends at that age I can say with certainty that I wasn't the only one.

** *World*

- Muggles/technology being depicted as able to defeat/get around magic.

- Muggle society being depicted as significantly more “enlightened” than wizarding society.

- Wizards displaying significant interest in Muggle culture or technology.

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Depiction of wizarding society as lacking innovation/static.

- Ancient magic that is depicted as more powerful or advanced than modern magic.

- A wizarding world with a functional nobility. A defunct nobility is acceptable.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- A magical population that is too large. I feel like 30,000 wizards in Britain is the absolute maximum, but really it should be significantly less.

- A magical economy that is too large or sophisticated. Magical Britain is about the size of a small town. It shouldn't have billionaires, a stock market, or really any kind of sophisticated financial services.

- The idea that “Dark Lord” is a commonly used title, or even a magically real title, as opposed to a made-up title that originated with Voldemort.

- Casual use of the Unbreakable Vow.

- Casual use of Veritaserum.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

- Depiction of Aurors as having a command structure, procedures etc which are reminiscent of Muggle police or military.

- Helpful Goblins who perform a great many functions which would more correctly lie with the government, law firms, and accountants.

*Magic*

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Depiction of wandless magic as equally versatile and powerful as wanded magic, capable of casting all the same spells as you can with a wand.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

- The idea that a wizard could cast powerful/advanced magic without having studied it in some form, whether that means reading up on it or experimenting with it themselves. Corollary: the idea that a wizard could have studied a piece of magic extensively but not cast it well. The most common and egregious example: Hermione who is an expert in magical theory but not so strong at actually casting magic, as opposed to a Harry who is great at casting powerful and advanced magic but doesn't really understand what he's doing.

- Magical oaths other than the Unbreakable Vow existing.

- Duels lasting a long time, with multiple injuries being incurred, rather than ending very quickly the moment one fighter gains a slight advantage over the other.

- A Veela's mere presence exerting a magical befuddling effect which they can turn on and off at will (as opposed to Veela having a befuddling effect that is connected to their voice and movements, and general extreme attractiveness).

*Harry*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that turns him into a genius.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- A Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- A Harry who tells his life story including extremely private matters to everyone he meets.

- A Harry who constantly dispenses “wisdom” to his peers, such as telling Hermione not to believe everything she sees in a book the first time he meets her. It's transparent use of Harry as authorial avatar.

- A Harry who ditches Ron and Hermione as friends.

- Overstating the level of the Dursleys' abuse.

- A Harry whose wealth is overstated. He should be comfortably well off, but any galleon count that goes into the millions should be avoided.

- Making Harry short

*Other characters*

- Any kind of bashing, especially of Dumbledore. Bashing turns characters into shallow cardboard cut-out villains who exist solely for Harry to knock down easily and thus look powerful/important/clever for doing so. But because the villain has been hollowed out, his defeat of them carries no glory. He's playing on easy mode.

- In particular, stupid/comic relief Ron, evil or incompetent Dumbledore, scheming Ginny, smothering Molly, jealous Hermione.

- Making Harry the only character who is capable of learning. Another common feature of bashing is rehashing the same conflict over and over, where a villain doesn't learn anything from the previous conflict and continues to make plans using their old, now disproven assumptions.

- Genius Hermione. She's clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- Any characterisation of Voldemort which makes his worldview reasonable or removes his psychopathy.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him too noble, or affable once you gain his respect.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him a one dimensional evil villain.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional connections to Hitler.

*Plot*

- Fics without a plot or plot structure.

- Any change made to the HP world which does not have corresponding changes to character motivations and actions. For example, in canon Voldemort could not penetrate Privet Drive during the summer. If your fanon makes it so that him taking Harry's blood does allow him to penetrate Privet Drive, you should also change character behaviours to match - Dumbledore would know this, and act accordingly. When an author changes the world but keeps Dumbledore's actions the same, and then criticises him in the story for those unsuitable actions, what the author is really doing is having the characters criticise their own poor writing.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic. Authors always underestimate the extent of Harry's knowledge. Just because we're not shown it doesn't mean he's not learning it.

- Romantic partners who do not have their own lives, with their own circle of friends, their own dreams and ambitions which may clash with their partner's plans, their own opinions and beliefs which differ in some areas from those of their partner.

- Naive sex god eunuch Harry. That is, having female characters be attracted to Harry precisely because he's so insecure and freaks out at anything sexual. “You behave completely asexually, which is exactly why I want to have sex with you!” said no woman ever.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose. Inconsistency in the abilities that characters possess, especially their level of duelling ability or the use of any special talents. This inconsistency is more often than not used to force the plot in a direction which it would not naturally go, given those abilities.

- Rehash of the canon plotlines with no significant changes. Especially where the divergent elements of the fic mean that events should logically diverge, yet the fic finds ways to force the original canon storyline.

- Depiction of magical warfare that ignores the high mobility and stealth capabilities of wizards, as well as the relative lack of need for natural resources or land. We should be seeing skirmishes for strategic objectives, not significant pitched battles.

- As above, time travel/dimension travel stories where the travelling character very quickly ends up telling their life story to people they barely know.

- Time-travel/dimension-travel stories in which there is more than one travelling character, or the character(s) are able to move back and forth between times/dimensions.

When he took the appareance of Albert Runicorn it was noted that he grew to be over 6 feet implying Harry himself wasn't.

I don't understand that one, or at least the absolute stance. I mean, magic is fine and all, but I can see a wizard get wind of the muggles CERN project, or their landing on the moon, the ISS or an atomic reactor and being genuinely impressed by it to a level of being interested in how it works. Also there is nothing we know about that comes anywhere close to muggle popular culture. We know of one band, one singer, some novels and radio. I don't think its so far out that muggle music, movies and other popular media may strike a chord with some wizarding folk, if only because of the lack of variety in the wizarding world.

Although, I agree that once it goes into muggle-wank I'm out too. And should I ever read a first date with a Star Wars viewing again...

If you want to get pedantic, that's a fanon invention created by a misconception that the unforgiveable curses are magically connected and not just a legal grouping of curses. What the killing curse requires is "a powerful bit of magic behind it", according to fake Moody.

#+begin_quote
  And I chose silent casting because even after it's learned, you still see adults and Harry & crew sometimes using verbal casting, which implies there is still some effort that has to be made to cast in that manner.
#+end_quote

A few things on that front.

Firstly, we know that non-verbal casting is a skill that you master spell-by-spell, not as a universal skill. For example, Harry is able to cast levicorpus very easily non-verbally, apparently because it is a spell designed to be used non-verbally, but struggles with other non-verbal spells in HBP.

Secondly, I'm not sure that Harry ever properly masters non-verbal casting in the main series (presumably he did as an adult, as we see adults casting non-verbal magic as a matter of course).

Thirdly, we know that once they do have the hang of it, wizards do generally end up using non-verbal magic for everything:

#+begin_quote
  Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantation aloud.
#+end_quote

HBP Ch11.

#+begin_quote
  Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.

  “Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.

  Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis Revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.

** I absolutely /detest/ Americanisms---/jerk/, /dude/, /jeez/, /oh my God/ (/Merlin's beard/ exists for a reason, people!), /holy smokes/, etc. There are lots of other small details which, once they appear non-canon, kills my attention to the story, and make me close the tab straightaway, such as a too lovey-dovey Harry, or a very effeminate Ginny, a Ron that exists just for comic relief (also known as film Ron), or any /seriously/ depraved theme. Then there's the issue of /too/ much swearing, especially in non-sexual situations.

I also cannot stand all those tags like Immortal! or Dark! or whatever. Generally, if it isn't canon, it's not for me.

Some /truly/ exemplary fanfics (featuring excellent grammar, wide vocabulary range, and generally stick to canon as much as possible) I've read, include those that have been written by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2832915/][keeptheotherone]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/][My Dear Professor McGonagall]], and, for some relatively adult content, [[http://fics-by-llp.livejournal.com][LunaLovePotter on LiveJournal]].

Special mention to redhed414 for his/her /The Request/, linkffn(/7711642). Though this /is/ Dramione, the characters (except Ginny) are fairly canon, and the story itself is well-written.

Also on twin fics where they send a whole chapter in describing the scene where Voldemort tried to kill Harry but the spell goes wrong and they both get scars.

I know it is ironic for someone who reads fanfics, but romance gets under my skin when it is badly done, and it's virtually always badly done in fanfics. When a story starts off without any hint of romance and no pairing is announced (or even when one is supposed to be minor), it's a deal-breaker when the story totally go off rails because suddenly Harry gets the hots for Fleur or whatever. There was that very good Hermione-centric fic I loved, and one chapter she goes into the room of requirements for story-driven purposes. And there, she forgets all about her plot-based endeavours and is just stunned by how hot Ginny is, and they start flirting and FUCK IT I HATE THAT WHY DO YOU DO THAT TO ME?

there are any number of drugs that in high enough doses act as poisons that would work as well and painlessly and not cause damage to the healer's soul since the ak is dark magic. The more you use it, the easier it gets to find another reason to use it.
