Grow Young With Me has probably been my favorite fic in a while and I'd love it if anyone could rec similar ones to atleast scratch the itch as I wait for updates. I like realistic OC's and not ones that are poorly hidden fantasies and self inserts. Anything that comes to mind is appreciated as I'll be sure to check it out.


** Linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes) is a pretty good Harry/OC fic.

** I highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/1/The-Unwinding-Of-Percy-Weasley][The Unwinding of Percy Weasley]] by JustAudrey07

edit: I suppose Audrey Weasley isn't technically an OC, but we don't know anything about her so she might as well be.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** I've been meaning to give this fic a read for a while but just haven't got around to it yet. Can anyone tell me what it is about? Like the description does give much away. I'm assuming from description it is a very politcally heavy fic but I may be wrong. Is it completely AU? Start canon and then diverge?

**** Yes, even the muggle world is significantly AU since nuclear weapons were never developed and as a result, the US fought a ruinous war against Japan and no Marshall Plan ever came. European countries never reconciled and the NATO fell apart after USSR collapsed.

In the Wizarding world, the Potters were distrustful of Dumbledore after their friends McKinnons got killed, despite Dumbledore's ironclad assurances before. So in addition to the Fidelius on their house, they set a nasty trap for Voldemort, who promptly walked into it and lost his body. The Potters then left Britain all together to hide from both Death Eaters and Dumbledore. They were often forced to move, and the young Harry was not pleased.

When Harry finally learnt the reason of his less than stable life, he decided to gain enough power and influence in muggle world so he could force the Wizarding world to leave them alone. He met a girl named Elicia in high school, who was kind similar to Hermione in personalities: super smart, a little bossy, generally kind but ruthless if needed.

Most of the story happened after 2008, when Spain declared war on Britain in order to get Gibraltar back. Harry saw his opportunities arrive, used his magic extensively in the war, and things got out of control quickly....
