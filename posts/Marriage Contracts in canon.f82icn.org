Technically not a fanfic related post. I was just curious, as I have seen many Harry Potter Fanfictions utilising the concept of a marriage contract, and I was wondering where if at all they are referred to in the books as I can't recall them being mentioned. Essentially I just want to know if it is a recognised canonical concept or just another overused fanfic trope.


** They aren't mentioned at all in the books. Marriage contracts are mostly used as a plot device for romance.

**** Yeah, not my favourite trope for sure lol. Then again, its fanfiction. World is yours to mold. Aurors are depicted as police in the wizarding world but I've always seen them as more of an intelligence agency.

** it's a fanon thing that makes sorta sense cause the wizarding world is very victorian/medieval, and marriage contracts were a thing back then, or at least arranged marriages (kinda the same thing)

*** While they were a thing back then, it's the how and the why of their use that most of the fandom gets wrong. Basically, it was a way to cement political alliances between the nobility, and not whatever nonsense they're used for by the fandom at large.

Also, historically, said arranged marriages were always between two people who actually existed; rather than being for hypothetical future children who might never actually exist as I've seen done in a number of fanfics.

**** ah, but your forgetting that alot of wizards are stupidly self assured there line will continue, so having a contract that can fit specific parameters would be fine for them....and if their line doesn't continue at all, well then the contract just dies, which we've never seen cause why would authors write about "pairings this person could of been in if they lived"?

***** If that were true, then why does it seem like so many pureblood families only have 1 or 2 children?

****** cause they're stupid and arrogant, thinking they don't need more than one or two. in harry's case it was cause his parents died before they could have more

** Marriage contracts, like the others have said, are not really canon - they're more an offshoot of the aristocratic/old-fashioned aesthetic that many people read into the pureblood culture of the WW. Think back to medieval nobility - betrothal agreements were quite common at the time, and this is basically making that magic.

Past that, as a plot device, it's pretty easy to see the appeal of them. Everyone (well, most everyone ;) ) likes romance where two diametrically opposed people end up liking each other - and a contract like that is a very easy way to force Harry into a relationship with someone he'd normally hate or not even look at.

*** To each their own I suppose, but in my opinion it seems to just be lazy writing in lieu of actual romance.

**** Well, it's not romance - it's a plot device to get the romance started when it wouldn't normally.
