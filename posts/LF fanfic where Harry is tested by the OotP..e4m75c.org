The things I remember about this story make it sound ridiculous but I know that I read it somewhere (I want to say on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]). It's an older story where Harry is kidnapped by the Order and he goes through all of these tests and trials, not knowing that it's them that have put him through it. He's in a manor where he meets a little girl(Dumbledore's granddaughter?) and tries to 'save her'. He's also doing a ton of dueling and the one part that really sticks with me is when he is confronted with 5(?) Dumbledore clones and he has to decide which one is the real one. He ends up saying something like "I've missed you Professor Dumbledore...absence makes the heart grow fonder" to figure out the difference between the last clone and the real Dumbledore... and he like stabs the fake ones and they turn into house-colored phoenixes? I also remember that he is really pissed off when he figures out it was all fake and just a test...also might have been a Harry/Fem!Blaize pairing (I know he was with a female Slytherin)...She was Snape's goddaughter and H&B are overheard talking about what they would name their children?

It sounds so weird but I can't get this out of my head and can't find it. Please help!
