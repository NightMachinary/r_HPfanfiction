:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once saw a comment (that I can no longer find) recommending a fic where Harry and Hermione were sorta timelooping, but not quite -- I think they'd get sent back to a random time (maybe upon death)? And I think they were slowly figuring out what was going on.

â€‹

Anyone have any idea which fic it could be?


** Probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon by willyolioleo)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** [[/u/wordhammer][u/wordhammer]] probably got it, but if you're interested, there's a somewhat similar "return to earlier save point upon death" mechanic in linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) which is a decent read too.
