  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

      Warnings:  Super strong language, graphic sex scenes, a few scary situationsContent/Enticements:  8th year \+\. Side pairings: Hermione/Millicent; Ron/Lavender\. Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess\. There is a surplus of cats in this story\. It wasn’t planned, but when are cats ever?Author's Notes:  Dear Isinuyasha: You said ‘chemistry’ and I ran with it\. I hope you like this take on what I’m sure was meant to be a throwaway comment\. I'm pretty sure I got almost all of your requests in here\. \(Also, I love your art\!\!\!\) Original prompt: here\. Thank you one zillion times to the most amazing beta in the entire world, E\. I am honestly astounded by how amazing she is\. I can’t even put it to words\. Thank you also to the mods who gave me an extra four days when I was freaking out about the ending\. You guys are awesome\! Happy holidays\!Beta: eidheann
