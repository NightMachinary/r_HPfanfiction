I'm planning on doing a fic in which Luna falls in love with Harry and becomes possessive of him. I want to find a good reason why she would so and hopefully not make it too OOC.


** It sounds like this such a pivotal part of your plot! What are YOUR reasons for her to obsess? I'm not trying to be snarky at all (it keeps coming out a bit, but I mean this seriously) but if you can't work that out, I'm not sure you're ready to write the character this way. Search for Luna's reasonings, her motivations, then you can follow them to her actions, and then to the plot and her further feelings and reactions. There are any number of reasons why someone might obsess over a person - you need to explore the character's reasons yourself.

** Perhaps Harry is the first person to try and befriend her at Hogwarts, or helps stop the bullying. Kind of boring, but works.

** She wouldn't. You can't force a character to behave in a way contrary to their character, and maintain that character. Also you've got things backwards. You should let your characters drive the plot, not force the characters to fit into an idea. This isn't easy, but is the key to writing good fanfiction. Characters are everything. If a character doesn't fit, use someone else, or twist the story until things work.

** Luna is convinced the whole prophecy thing is actually related to her interest in cryptozoology. Harry is not destined to defeat The Dark Lord, he's destined to find new and amazing creatures.

For comedic purposes you could have Harry unknowingly fulfilling Luna's prophecy throughout the work.

** Maybe HP intervenes and stops people from bullying her? Maybe she sees a second aura from the horcrux scar and wants to be around that? Maybe because nargles?

** She's just as much a conspiracy nut as her father (I don't buy into the seer nonsense), and Harry makes a very interesting subject for conspiracy theories...

** You could also add how he is what she is not; popular, not picked on etc which starts her interest and then they bond when he reveals what it is like at the Dursleys.

** Luna hangs out with Ginny a lot, who always says lots of good things about Harry. This leads to Luna becoming infatuated with the Chosen One, which is only reinforced when he asks her to Slughorn's party.
