** "Give it up Voldemort! It's over!" Harold, the blessed Paladin shouted as he charged the Dark Lord. It's all been building up to this. All the sweat, tears and blood, all for this very moment. Behind him, stood his two faithful companions; Mioh'nee, a elven druid and Roonil Wazlib, a rogue dwarf. Mioh'nee was casting defensive spells, ensuring that Harold was warded from devious attacks while Roonil supported his friends.

"Indeed, Harold! It'll be over once I kill you and your meddling friends! But no matter, I will have my victory!" Voldemort screamed as he brandished his staff as he cut through the air, "TIME STOP!"

Harold, Roonil and Mioh'nee were frozen in time as Voldemort dashed through them, dealing enough damage that both the pesky sidekicks would be forced backwards once time resumed. Once he was certain they would no longer interfere, he stood in front of Harold, smiling maliciously.

"Oh, Harold. Did you really think you would win? Against me? The Dark Lord Voldemort! I, who discovered spells that even your precious druid would shudder to think about. If only you accepted my offer when we met in your youth, perhaps you would be by my side now. I digress, now is the time to-" Voldemort's speech was cut off as he looked down at the sword impaled in his heart. How? It was impossible! He was invincible! No-one could move during his time-stop and yet the paladin somehow impaled him. "H-HOW!?"

Harold smirked as he drove the sword deeper, "Call it the Potter Luck!"

...

"You just killed Lord Voldemort..." Tom voice dropped to a low tone, making the three kids nervous, "with nothing more than a Nat 20 roll for luck?"

Harry gulped as he looked into the crimson eyes of the Dungeon Master, wondering just how much trouble he would be in. Hermione and Ron were also nervous, they had never seen Tom this quiet before. Suddenly the man started laughing, making the three children jump.

"It's about bloody time! It should have been a short campaign, three months, if that. You somehow managed to turn it into a year's work! I should had used Foresight a long time ago," Tom lamented...

**** If there ever was a name suitable for the Forgotten Realms, it would be that. Although there is no doubt in my mind that Tom would make Ron re-write his character sheet until it was as neat and tidy as his.

** A volde with wish and time stop would never lose. A volde with greater invisibility would never lose. A volde with any amount of contingency would never lose, (I am looking at you lethal damage + magic jar) and dont get me started on spell turning!!!! (Yes because 3.5 was the last real addition for d&d)

*** But just imagine the salt if Voldemort discovered 'Clone' spell only after making a Horcrux (thus making him ineligible for the same reasons Liches can't use it) and he realized he could have had immortality without the side effects! XD
