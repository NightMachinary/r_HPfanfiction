:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been reading fanfic for a long time so hopefully I remember this right.

It's about Snape getting Harry as a baby. Lily comes to him, like days after birth, asking him to keep him. They still die. Snape keeps his identity from everyone, Voldemort and Dumbledore, as when this happens he just agreed to be potions teacher and is Voldemort's main man. The story mainly about Harry and Snape, with some Voldemort/Snape thing, oh and Fenrir like wanting Harry for his pack or something.

It's been a few years, could be on FF or AO3, and it's a longer one. I don't think it's in multiple stories but I could be wrong.

Thanks


** It's a small world. I was literally just looking at this story again earlier today.
