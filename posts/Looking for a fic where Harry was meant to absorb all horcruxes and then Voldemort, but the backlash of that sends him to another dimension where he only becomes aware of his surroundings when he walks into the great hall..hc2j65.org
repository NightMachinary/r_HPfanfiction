:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty sure the AU Tom Riddle and Myrtle Warren were a couple who ran the orphanage Harry goes to. Voldemort is in Harry's head and constantly angry at everything I'm pretty sure. Harry exorcises Binns when his fellow Hufflepuff asks him to. I honestly can't remember the plot, but I remember enjoying the fic and I want to read it again.

Harry spends his years before Hogwarts completely out of it, and the only reason they send him to school at all is because he listens to commands and performs any spell people ask him to. (hence the Binns exorcism)

I don't remember if there was a romance between Harry and Voldemort, I feel like there wasn't, more an intense begrudging friendship or whatever.

Oh and AU Tom Riddle is horrified when Harry tells him what became of his counterpart. Voldemort feels the same about Tom's relationship with Myrtle. Oh! Tom is the DADA professor.

I'm 90% sure it was on AO3. I've tried searching the tags and the general search, even targeted Google searching, but I can't find it. It might be deleted. If anyone has a link for me, I'll be eternally grateful.

Edit: just realised Harry might not have been a Hufflepuff. Maybe he was a Slytherin?

  AU Post HBP. DH semi-compliant: The horcruxes are destroyed- the bits of soul latched on to Harry's own. But killing himself only sends Harry to an alternate dimension, this one desperately vulnerable to the dark soul he carries.

*** Thank you! If you can believe it, I just found it myself on the third page of google by searching: "someone excorsised binns". But I won't revoke my eternal graditude just because of that.

Here's the Ao3 link for those who prefer: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2679206/chapters/5992307][Warping Circumstances]]
