Why, out of the 841k Harry potter fanfics, are there only enough fanfics with harry and cho as a pairing, to where I can count them on my fingers, I love the pairing, I really do. I have already read "The Autumn Swan" and its remake, both exceptional pieces, which sadly never got finished. The other fanfics have only been one shots. So here's the kicker, can someone please help me find a fanfic with HarryÃ—Cho.


** Over on [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], you can find:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/No_Good_Deed/No_Good_Deed/][No Good Deed]], a one-shot by Jeconais. He also has another one-shot, All Night Long, which is not what you're looking for, but does have Harry and Cho as main characters.

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] and its sequel, [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Midnight_Duel_Midday_Love/index/][Midnight Duel, Midday Love]], by Draco664. Both multi-chapter stories. You may need a site login, or maybe just click on a link to say that you're ok with stories rated 'Mature.'

The only story on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] that I've read that has Harry and Cho as main characters is a one-shot in which Harry is talking to Cho about how things went wrong.

** linkao3(The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel) ... it is just pity, it is only one-shot and the author has never developed it into full-size novel.

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
