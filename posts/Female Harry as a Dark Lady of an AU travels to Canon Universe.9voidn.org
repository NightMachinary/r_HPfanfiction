this might sound like a Paradox, but even if its called so in the Fic, i would accept it. So, i wonder if there are Fics that have an Alternate Universe Harry (who is there a Female, instead of male), who is a Dark Lady (the female counterpart of Voldemort or the Conquerer of said one, but then gets corrupted) somehow travels to the Canon Universe, whether to Conquer this Universe too by herself or by assisting Voldemort.


** Umm, well, Lily from linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) does tend to end up in such situations in some particular spin-off, though I can't remember which one, though I'm sure Canon Harry meets her and starts to question reality in linkffn(The Wonderful World of Fanfiction), which is NOT a fic I'd recommend unless you read a lot of The Carnivorous Muffin and actually enjoy what makes it unique (if you do read a lot of Muffin, you'll know what I mean)

** I remember one recommended in a post asking for male Harry meeting alt female Harry fics, but don't remember it's name or any other details. Maybe you can Google for fic recommendations like that from Reddit?
