Who was the family eccentricGiven the fact James thought he was a little odd that must say something because the potters we're firm believers in mischief and thinking out of the box.

​

Terry did have to stay with the Dursleys in order for his blood protection to hold her but that didn't stop His two remaining magical relatives from relocating to number 5 Privet Dr. little whingeing in SurreyPetunia even started a homeowners association in desperation to get them evicted Louis just bought for other properties in the surrounding area and outvoted her just on the principle of it hairy didn't spend his afternoons at the Dursleys he wasn't assigned chores chores instead he just hopped defense hot offense hot offense hopped a fence and was in the magical garden Petunia even started a homeowners association in desperation to get them evicted Louis just bought for other properties in the surrounding area and booted her just on the principle of it Terry didn't spend his afternoons at the Dursley‘s he wasn't assigned to George chores instead he just helped offense hot offense hot offense hopped a fence and was in the magical gardenOf his cousin Louis who was formally of the opinion you could speak to a hippopotamus if you had the right accent and his great great aunt Eunice who was deaf as a door nail but sharp as a tack so long as you didn't approach her from behind because she spooked like a thorough bread and was at explosive with a wand as a horse was with a kick to the head.

​

Henry had an interesting upbringing to say the least, But he knew both sides of his family history thanks to Potters efforts and a few enchantments aimed at Petunia first spilling family secrets.

​

Harry hunting was still a game deadly engaged in Dudley engaged in but it was more trying to locate where the various family magical properties were and catching hairy before he got to one of them he usually failed and got chased by a dog for his efforts
