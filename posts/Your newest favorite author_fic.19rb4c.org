We all have our ultimate favorites, the ones we love to revisit on a rainy day and recommend to everyone else.

And there are some fics that get passed around here a lot, like Methods of Rationality, Backwards with Purpose, Life and Times, ect.

But what awesome authors or fics have you only just discovered? What fic or author are you currently obsessed with?


** I would definitely say I've become addicted to Darth Marrs' writings.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4753440/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Founders][Harry Potter and the Four Founders]], a great Harry being the founders' heir fic. After that story, it has two really good crossover sequels with Star Trek:TNG, and then Star Wars.

Another great one by him/her is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/][Firebird's Son]]. It has an idea I don't think I've seen before. Summary for it, "Think you know what the magical world is like? You're wrong. A completely AU story of Harry Potter in a world with four times more women than men. But will a world run by women, in which wizards are commodities to be controlled and threats to be contained, actually be any better?"

Both are really good.

*** Darth Marrs is really good, but there is tendency to overdo things (in Firebird's Son - AUness and amount of dystopia). I truly liked only "Unspeakable Things" (epilogue was overdone, but rest was in norm).

**** Eh, I enjoyed Firebird's son because of that. I thought the setting was really interesting, and didn't come to it looking for something really close to canon. I see nothing wrong with changing a lot of things up from what is expected, */if/* you can do it well.

***** I like deep AU (and I discard anything too close to canon) but in this case it is an original work pretending too be fanfiction - or at least awfully close to this.

** On The Way to Greatness, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Magical Relations - all 3 I've found on this subreddit, all 3 are outside of my usual search params, all 3 I tried out of boredom and not expecting much.

PS. There should be a clear way on all fanfic sites to make distinct the case of 2 main characters vs 2 paired characters. I have definitely seen Magical Relations once before on some rec site and moved on because it had "Harry/Dudley" in description which I naturally interpreted as another slash fic.

** "The Sea King" - probably the first version of "19 years later" that I liked. Oneshot.

link: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King]]

"Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks"

This one is really strange - enjoyable story that includes Super!Harry, SuperAbusive!Dursleys, boring parade of moving machines in the first chapters, dumb Malfoys unable to do anything, overdoing crossover AND it is too obvious that author is male.

Usually one of this things is enough to ruin fic for me.

link: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3397550/1/Harry-Johnson-and-the-Headmaster-s-Socks]]

status: may be read as complete story - as sequel is worse and sequel of sequel is abandoned.

Both by the same author.

*** Calum Wallace (Doghead Thirteen) is one of the greats who hang out on Rorschach's Blot's CaerAzkaban yahoo!group. I think he's still connecting-the-dots on the Harry Johnson stuff, from what I've seen on-list, so anything might yet happen to it.

I'm mightily wishing his "Book of Dobby" (either version) muse would return. It's too wacko to be crack; ditto "Enter the Dragon".

*** Current favorite: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]] writes the best Ron I've ever seen. You want to hug him and punch him at the same time. Most of her fics center around Ron and to a lesser extent, Hermione, but she (or he?) has a knack for writing friendship-y moments between the trio. Not the "I'll be there when you confront Voldemort" sort of moments, but the really really normal moments like sitting around the common room and throwing biscuits at each other.

*** I tried this for a few chapters... does it by any chance get less sappy later on? The constant descriptions of 'poor Harry looking so alone and in desperate need of comfort' turned me off on last try.

example (ch. 4):

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Hermione and Ron found Harry reclined on a bed to the left of the entrance, the sole occupant in the hospital wing. Hermione couldn't ignore how alone he looked. She wanted to hug him...
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

(seriously "sole occupant" of a room looks alone?)
