She was angry with Dumbledore who welcomed her in the Heavenly King's Cross, but before leaving to return back and saving the day, she as a woman just couldn't take it anymore, and she took the remainders of the Baby Voldemort and went to the departing train and passed the child to Merope, who was already on the train.

It was just few chapters long story, but well written.

  There are stories with snakes that bite and say {you knew what I was when you picked me up} but this isn't one of them.
