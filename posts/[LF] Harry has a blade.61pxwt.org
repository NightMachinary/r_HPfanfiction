"Oh my god, the Avada Kedavra kills in one shot and can't be blocked by anything but physical objects!" Well, news flash: there's that thing called a SWORD that does the same thing, and can be used faster. And repeatedly.

I'm looking for Fics in which Harry has a sword or any bladed weapon longer than a potion knife. It can be magical or not but must play a part in the story. It should also not be the sword of gryffindor. How anyone is able to wield this piece of junk is beyond me.

Thanks a lot!

**** Let me guess, and katanas are the epitome of personal combat weapons?

Longswords kicked /ass/.

Also referred to as hand-and-a-half swords, that's because while one of your hands goes on the upper hilt, near the crossguard, your other hands rests on the pommel (the big palm-sized jewel on the bottom, perfect for wrapping a hand around). It could be wielded single-handedly with a shield in the offhand or with two hands in the manner described above. Skilled practitioners could also grasp the middle of the blade to guide the point to gaps in opponents armour or just flip the entire weapon around, grab it with two hands by the blade, and use the crossguard to bash an opponent's helmet in.

Meanwhile over in Japan, samurais were cutting each other into ribbons with katanas, and that worked well for them. Their armor was made of leathers and fabrics, not metal, so a thin, fast blade could do a lot of damage, hence the curved single edge of the katana, which gave it a lighter weight and increased cutting ability. Of course, that was when they weren't shooting each other from really far away with bows. Saying you were good with a katana was actually a faux pas for the longest time in feudal Japan because it was essentially admitting that you were shit with a bow (and after all, only the rabble scrap around in hand-to-hand. Much more dignified to sit on your horse and shoot the enemy from very far away).

All in all, while longswords and katanas were both well-suited weapons for their time periods and intended targets, a bunch of metal-armored Middle Ages knights wielding longswords would absolutely destroy an equal number of samurai with their gear. Their katana's wouldn't do diddly-squat against suits of armour unless they managed to thrust into the joints, while the heft, power and reach of longswords would let their wielders smash through the tatami mat armour of the samurai, as they can rely on their suits of armor for defense and focus on unleashing all hell on their foes.

And of course, a single unit of modern soldiers practicing guerilla tactics could probably kill all of them.

***** a long sword and an hand and a half sword were two different swords. a long sword is a two handed sword usually double edged, while as you said an hand and a half sword had the you grip partially around the pommel if you needed to use two hands. For balance purposes a hand and a half sword usually had a slightly shorter blade than a long sword. The sword of Gryffindor had more in common with a arming sword than either of these swords. a short sword with a single handed grip. The only feature it had of a long sword or hand and half sword was the wide cross guard.

***** Nay, what I'm saying is that the sword's handle is built like a short sword's handle with the blade length of a longsword. It would have been very hard for Harry to wield it easily even with featherlight charms. Harry doesn't have the physical strength required to wield a longsword with only one hand.

Edit: Also, the jewels on the pommel limits its use as a bastard sword.

****** You can't claim feats of accidental magic as something every magic user can pull off all the time, as accidental magic is inherently uncontrollable and unpredictable. Sure, there might be charms and stuff that can replicate such effects, but we never see them cast before a match: the greatest augmentation Harry ever plays with is Hermione making his glasses impervious to water.

And as for the bowling ball being big and nasty, yes it has much much more kinetic energy than a bullet, it spreads that out over a much larger area. While it would probably be fatal if hitting a face at 50km/h, if it hit a nice soft torso it would do a lot less damage. There'd still be damage and likely internal bleeding, though.

A bullet on the other hand, focuses all of its kinetic energy (coming from speed rather than sheer mass) into a single, tiny point. It pierces straight through anything that's not a dedicated anti-bullet defensive measure and, if it's a hollow point, shatters and spreads out into and through all the soft bits. Bowling balls are lethal by happenstance, bullets are /designed/ to be lethal.

I'd argue that guns are still very effective against wizards despite them tanking Bludgers for fun (although I find that /very/ iffy that they bring as much force as you hypothesize to bear on teenage players - a maths whiz Rowling was not). A gun fires projectiles too small to see, not that any non-muggle-raised wizards would recognize the sound, and so they get shot before they think to defend. A rifle can fire an entire magazine of 30 rounds in seconds, and I honestly do not know how good wizarding ballistic shielding spells are (assuming they're not Protegos, but those have never demonstrated an effect on anything that's not magic).

As for their culture being two hundred years behind, I think I phrased that a bit poorly. Wizards split off into their own culture when the Statute of Secrecy was implemented. They kept to themselves and worked on their own innovations while our muggle world developed in another direction. They made such things as multiple means of countrywide teleportation, their own analogues for muggle technology (perhaps even centuries before muggles actually invented the same) and things that are outright incomparable, like the Weasley's family clock. If it were not for the influx of muggleborns into wizarding society, the wizarding world would have gone off in its own direction completely. Even then, any ideas or innovations muggleborns come up with would be frowned upon and sneered at by the ruling pureblooded elite, and thus take a very very long time to actually see widespread implementation. So, a better way of putting it is, wizarding culture split off from muggle culture when the Statute was signed, and progress and introduction of new ideas is extremely slow due to very long lifespans and general anti-muggle(born) sentiment.

**** Small diameters with high velocity have better penetrating powers. Which is why most Anti-material rounds are very aerodynamic and sleek with a point, and/or explosive, rather than just huge chunks of metal.

Even if we'd presume that wizards have the same resilience as flexible metal (or something of the like) they could be penetrated and killed by bullets, just as a steel plate could stop a steel ball of 25cm diameter, but would be punctured by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_bullet][K-Bullet]], for example.

Then the bludgers don't have a high velocity. They can be seen, reacted to and then dodged in a repeatable fashion, not just out of sheer luck and foresight. Hitting targets with them makes you a good beater. Dodging them repeatedly is a somewhat standard requirement for a Quidditch player. Through a simple calculation I get that a bludger at the speed of 50Km/h (which I'd say is a somewhat realistic estimate) drives a force of 972,2N. If we assume 100km/h I get 1939N. Given that fighters can deliver punches [[http://www.livescience.com/6040-brute-force-humans-punch.html][up to 3000N of force with a 25% chance of breaking ribs]], I'd say that more resilient wizards can stomach the unrelenting force of a steel ball instead of a fist quite easily if it doesn't knock them unconscious.

All in all, its very likely that bullets do considerable damage to wizards. Small diameters with supersonic speed will penetrate and if it hits the right places, kill a wizard just like a muggle. The only difference could be that the effective range of weapons would be shorter when you fight wizards.

****** No, I get it. Wizards are more resilient than muggles. I even argued with that in mind. Its just that bullets are /so much more deadly/ than a bludgers, simply because of their form and speed, that wizards would have to have steel-plate-skin to be safe from them, magic aside. You argued by bringing up the impact force of a bludger. Krums achievement is less that "his bones aren't pudding" but that he wasn't knocked unconscious by them - that he could suppress the brains automatic response of shutting down when shook by a high /acceleration/. Basically, Krum took a MMA-fighters fist right in the face and remained standing. Plus, a bludger is a blunt punch-like impact, while a bullet seeks to do penetration-damage on a /much/ smaller, almost pointed surface.

To your points in the other comments: Yes. No doubt. The most simple example is the Protego. The Charm is made to protect from harm. A bullet does harm. Ergo, the Protego protects from bullets. You don't even have to get fancy to defend a wizard from a bullet.

So in the grand scheme of a fight - no, muggle weapons aren't "answer to all" effective on their own. However bullets /can/ kill a wizard with relative ease if not shielded. Therefore, a combined use of both guns and magic could be effective.

******** I agree. The amount of "Protego doesn't do anything because bullets are so fast, they break the shield"-bullshittery I read in fanfiction is rather staggering. Its a symptom of fics that try to bring magic in a more science-y environment (/-cough- magical cores -cough-/) and forget in the process that magic, by definition, isn't very compatible with science. One example is the one I already gave. Its not the amount of force thats important to stop a bullet, but the fact that bullets do "harm" and therefore fulfill the requirements of the spell.

The only good examples I read I could name on one hand. They mostly deal with guns as a niche-solution (for example, for some high-distance kills), as part of a mix of weapons (then mostly to force the opponents to use Protego while you cast something else), or as the basis for "Hextech" (including such great things as enchanted Minigun barrels that send out Reducto curses, or Fiendfyre filled artillery shells).

I find that's really at the authors discretion. I don't really understand how you come to the conclusion that the concept of the bullet would trump the underlying concept of the Shield Charm with such conviction. Also, it would be the authors decision if non-magical objects can "use" their "concept", if you will. One argument that wouldn't question overly much is "magic always trumps not-magic".

Protego is effective against everything but the Killing Curse. So, what I could buy is that 1bullet = 1 spell, and after deflecting one, Protego would have to be recasted - which would make a semi-auto rifle a pretty destructive thing to go against as a wizard.

In the end it will come down to what tone you need for your fic. Should wizards or muggles struggle, or should they find a somewhat level playing field?

*********** In my stories, I assume that a Shield Charm can stop more than a few bullets, depending on the skill of the caster. In one fight, I had Bellatrix' Shield Charm shrug off automatic fire from a machine gun and an assault rifle, as well as several spells while she cursed people, until finally the agregated strain from bullets and spells shattered the shield.

I don't really see it as "muggles versus wizards" - muggles cant even see or find wizards without magic or wizard help. A muggle repelling charm, or a mind controlled leader, and they are neutralised. There is no playing field; the muggles can't even get into the arena to watch.

For wizards, though, guns can have their uses, though it's situational in most cases. And if one side starts using them (or other muggle tech), people on the other side will take counter-measures. You won't really be able to snipe too many unsuspecting people from afar, once knowledge spreads, for example, because wizards will quickly start to hide, stop exposing themselves, and keep moving when out in the open. And you'd need a lot of training to reliable snipe moving targets - too much training, usually, to make that a good Investment if you're already fighting a war.

**** .22? Probably not.

9 millimetre? Eh, maybe.

10 milimetre? If it's not a hollow point, there's a good chance.

5.56 mm? Yes.

7.62 mm? That shit fucks trees son.

.308? That shit fucks trees from a mile away.

.50 cal? Oh boy. That could probably kill a Nundu.

12.7 mm? That's gonna kill the Nundu, the giant behind that Nundu and the troll clinging to the Giant's back before going right on through the neighborhood behind them.

Back to man-portable:

AA-12 FRAG-12 explosive rounds. Gets fired out of a shotgun (the AA-12 assault shotgun) and blows shit up when it hits.

40mm grenades. Come in a variety of flavours, though defaults to 'kill everything within 10 metres of blast epicentre' most of the time.

RPG rounds... Eh, iffy. I mean, if they're thermobaric, then yes, but that goes for everyone in the room if detonated in-doors.

And, of course, grenades. Gas, Fire, Frag, White Phosphorus, Flashbang, they come in all shapes, sizes, yields and effects. Almost all of them are designed to kill you stone dead.

So to answer your question, yes, I do think bullets are effective against wizards. Maybe a standard 9mm parabellum won't do much, but since we've basically designed bullets that are capable of killing anything from a squirrel to a building, I am sure that there is at least one type of widespread bullet that will do the job even better than an AK if you need to find it.

And hell, if push comes to shove and none of the above work, well that's when you resort to the fun weapons (Lahti L-39 anti-tank gun firing 20mm rounds, for example) and find what works.

And if they don't, well...

IED's, Artillery, TOS-1 Buratino rocket artillery/area denial flamethrower system copies, area-launched missiles, regional missiles, inter-regional missiles, continental missiles, Inter-continental missiles, orbital KKV's, suitcase nukes, dumb bomb nukes, ICBM nukes...

There's a really, really long list of options you can try if guns don't cut it.

Because if there's one thing we've excelled at in the past century it's devising exciting and exotic ways to murder entire armies at the push of a button.

So... there's that, I guess.

Even if wizards are tougher than normal, wouldn't bullets pierce them as it is "sharper", has smaller impact site so saw less resistance, and goes like mach 10 so it would penetrate their skin anyway rendering their resistance to blunt force trauma useless? That's if it's a pistol I'm pretty sure an AP rifle can do anything.

And Tom Riddle grew up in World-War-II Muggle London. Voldemort certainly knows about guns and their power, and so do a lot of the evil magicals, probably. Not everyone is as uninformed as Arthur Weasley.

Look at the [[https://streamable.com/scbgo]["Reparo"-Scene]] from the Fantastic Beasts movie (Spoilers, duh) - the control wizards exhibit over matter is insane. Is it hard to believe that Wizards didn't come up with an amulet or anything different that deflects or redirects bullets?

Even if hard to make, Riddle with his hatred for Muggles would love to render them powerless after being powerless himself when young. And seeing the fear the president of MACUSA has of muggles, do you think they wouldn't work on something like this?

******** You make quite a good point, bullets at mach 10 is only like rifles and tanks. I guess you would be correct, if we assume they have some sort of shield that can block kinetic projectiles they would be immune to like most of Humanity defenses. I'm pretty sure bullets can probably fo considerable harm to them on impact though, if the president of the US are scared of them. Especially incendiary and chemicals rounds. At least if their protection is like a shield/charm/curses/etc. then it can fail, so we can always resort to the good old shoot it until it dies approach.

Except they can apparate away from the gas on the first sign of 'it hurts'? And, to quote canon:

#+begin_quote
  On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation.

Wizards in canon have incredibly powerful protections against most forms of muggle warfare if they are skilled. I have no doubt that some wizards would be killed, but a single wizard could easily take tens or hundrets of Muggles with him on average.

The problem is that the Muggles even then still outnumber wizards extremely, and a slaughter of that size would kill so many people, magical or not. I think she is scared of being responsible for the potential death of millions, on both sides - because neither side understands the other.

I mean just look at the potential of destroying Muggle infrastructure. Take out 20 power lines simultaneously and watch the power-grid collapse. A study by the German Government estimates that a blackout of seven days would lead to something akin of a civil war.
