I've read a tonne of edgelordy Harry fics, or at least the first chapter of them and I can understand most of the common decisions made by authors, but the one thing I don't get is why Harry growing out his hair is so common. I can get long hair being seen as a sign of rebelliousness, but that its popularity in these kinds of fics is almost as common as evil Dumbledore seems bizarre to me. Does anyone have an explanation?

******* Muggles are on the bleeding edge of eye therapy, and it's no secret that wizards steal muggles tech and make it their own. (Many years after their invention, and sometimes many years after it's considered obsolete.) They just don't truly understand how it's made, and augment it with magic.

My rationale for it, anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if there is only one (very old) optometrist in diagon alley.

** Long hairs are usually associated with freedom and rebellion. Traditionally it is associated with wealth and power.

One of the most wealthy and arguably most politically stable person in canon had long hairs.

One of the most rebellious, easy going and free spirited character in canon had long hairs.

Other films, movies, animes and cultures have made it cool. Things like magical core, long hairs etc came from anime inspired fanficiton writers who pick up Harry Potter after writing stuff on franchises like Naruto etc.

** All of the above reasons, but also: when Harry was younger, Harry's hair was a symbol of his freakishness and subtle rebellion against his relatives..

It was always a little unruly. Always grew back whenever it was cut. Couldn't be styled or anything.

So I can see, if Harry is going full rebel, growing out his hair make a a certain amount of sense.

** As someone with long hair, I can also state a practical, though never mentioned reason. It protects the back of your neck from sunburn when you have pale skin. Or in particularly "goffic" edgelord fics, "sexy alabaster white vampire-looking skin"

** Long hair is generally associated with wealth and power - a statement that holds true in canon. Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy, for example, both had long hair. Dumbledore tucked his beard into his belt.

** Well, if I would write such a fanfiction I wouldn't care about hair (unless that detail has some influence or is useful in some way, like say as a disguise or to hide his scar) and that's coming from a guy who has long hair in RL and is not a rebellious teenager anymore :D

** The main 2 reasons I think its used somewhat heavily are:

1: It represents power, status, or wealth within society.

- This is not due to anything in modern times so much as a holdover from the past (in the real world) and since the Wizarding world is often seen as mired in the past or heavily connected to the past, this makes sense. In the political scene in the past in Europe, long hair was commonplace. As was long hair within the wealthy or royal circles.

2: It is used to represent a change in identity.

- Hair length and styles often can represent who you are as a person or to hide yourself from others. Wishing to change your identity can translate into a change of hair styles. Or if you wish to look for some anonymity or change who you appear to be to others, a change in hairstyle can also facilitate that. Often these hairstyle changes in the fan fiction world are accompanied by removal of his glasses, fading of his scar, change in clothes, and other things.

** Don't they always say it makes it easier to tame or something? Also, movie Lucius has long hair so maybe they think long hair is a sign of status in the magical world. I'm pretty sure it would've started with one indy!harry fic doing it and another author who likes the genre copied it and it just snowballed from there. But don't quote me on this.
