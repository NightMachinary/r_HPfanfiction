Harry is actually pretty intelligent and a cunning snake to boot,

when he is dosed with a babbling beverage lazed with veritaserum, his perfectly kept secret leave his mouth.

in classes he babbles out all his knowledge

all his thoughts on the wizarding world

how he follows the old ways and has learned dark magic.

his mouth babbles out everything and now heermione's being annoying, ron is niffled (how could you be doing all those dark stuff, mate!), dumbledore intrusive, and he has gotten the interest of nearly all slytherins (malfoy), many ravenclaws, and some hufflepuffs. Gryffindor isn't liking this new harry.

Theme: general with no parings, but if you must, then slash, plz

thx :)
