Never expected a click bait in this Reddit did ya?

I just got a question about the

BLOOD BOILING CURSE.

Was it canon?

Obviously the books didn't go to in depth into spells but alot of fics usually have that curse as a go to way to kill besides the ak.


** Nope. The Entrail-Expelling Curse is, however. It's apparently used for medical purposes.

**** I always thought it literally removed internal organs (it's why they think muggle surgery involving actually cutting people up is barbaric, they just bring the organs out), not just emptied them.

** Because I have higher pursuits than anyone on this thread, I assumed the suggestion was that the BBC should remake /Harry Potter/ as one of their television series, or otherwise create some /Potter/-related content.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
