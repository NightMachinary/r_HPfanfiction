So I've realized that I haven't really seen a lot of ao3 only fics. Can y'all recommend some?


** Definitely linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). I love the author's sense of humour, and he does a really believable job of redeeming Snape (and Draco, but especially Snape).

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
