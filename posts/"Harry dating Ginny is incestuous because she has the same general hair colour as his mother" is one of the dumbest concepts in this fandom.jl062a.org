** It's only a problem if Harry sits there, looking at Ginny, and smiles at her softly.

"You know, Gin, you look a lot like my mother."

Ginny smiled back. "I've been told."

"Yeah," he continued. "It's kinda hot."

"...What?"

"I mean, Dad had to fight off Sirius and Remus just to get a chance with her. And I saw Snape's memories, don't forget." He closed his eyes, lost in thought. "Mum had an arse that just wouldn't quit. It was really something."

Harry's eyes snapped open as the door to the dining room slammed shut.

"Ginny?" He called. But she was gone.

So black hair is also a no-go because it was his father. What about blonde ? Vernon and Dudley Dursleys are blondes, so, is it out, too ? Because they're family, too.

Also, brown hair is Remus' iirc, and he's kinda parental to Harry to. A bit. So brown hair are out, too.

Bald isn't an option too, because Voldemort, and by that logic, it way too close to dating someone like Voldemort, and it's weird.

Let's not even talk about other physical features. Among the Weasleys, The Marauders, and School Staff that care for Harry, and The Ennemies, no one is either an option because they'd share a trait that made it weird.

*** Alleles and phenotypes are two different things. It's possible for a brunette to have an allele for red or blonde hair, yet their phenotype will still be for brown hair because the brown hair allele is dominant over the alleles for blonde and red hair.

Realistically though, discussing the genetics involved in hair and eye colours at a surface level is bloody confusing because there is more than one allele pairing that affects what hair and eye colour someone ends up with. That's why we see eye colours like green and hazel, and not just the straight brown/blue dichotomy that high school science/biology teachers teach about. I personally like using ABO blood types to teach the concepts of alleles and phenotyopes because they are more strictly defined. The downside is that you can't see the specific antigen coating (or lack of coating in the case of O blood types) on blood cells in a classroom, so it can be a harder concept for students to grasp.

***** I remember first learning about genetics in high school, and it made perfect sense to me, but I was always inclined towards science in general and biology topics in particular. As a teacher in an education system that has mandatory science education up until the end of Year 10, I find it a very challenging topic to teach. Particularly when I've only taught students who are in a stream that indicates that they struggle with the subject.

I know there's genes for red hair kicking around in my wider family, but it only seems to pop up once every generation or two, if that. I have a cousin that had the most beautiful auburn hair as a child. I believe it darkened somewhat as she got older, but she dyes it so much now that I don't think even she knows what her natural colour is anymore. I also remember being told that my great-grandmother had red/auburn hair, but it was well and truly white by the time I came along.

I was kind of hoping to have a child with red hair, but my husband was blonde as a child, so that wasn't going to happen. I'm dark enough in hair and eye colouring that my kids both have the same hair and eye colour as me. One of them has my colouring, but very much looks like my husband facially, and the other one is the male version of me at that age in colouring and facial features, but has his dad's height and build.

Any other outcome is basically just the same as having them break up because, say, Ginny wears gloves or Harry hates sandals or whatever random reason an author might choose. Or, as you say, just more Dumbledore bashing... which is usually a nope for me.

And the reason why (1) is interesting is because of everyone else's reactions... compare this [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/377188][Rose/Albus]] fic (which is also an example of 2 actually and is the only incest fic I've read).

I don't mind it when fanfic writers use the canon relationships. What I don't like is just how poorly shoehorned in the romance between Ginny and Harry is. Like it just sort of appears out of nowhere in the 6th book. Before that, she was always just Ron's little sister.

THAT said, I could see the thought process being something Harry might use to rationalize to himself why he doesn't like Ginny /that way/. Like he sees Ginny, and hears all the stories about what his mother was like, and can't help but notice just how much Ginny reminds him of those stories, and he gets a little weirded out.

When you add up the fact that he only has a handful of pictures and MAYBE a page and a half of information for both of his parents. Watching his parents die in front of him. And his messed-up upbringing, this becomes more and more of a plausible reason.

Taking that into account, Harry also resembles his father a bit. Messy black hair, bravery, fighting death eaters, powerful(I always imagined James being quite powerful, as well as Lily), wears glasses, and some more. Again, blood status is different, and eye color(James has hazel eyes as I remember, and Harry has the iconic emerald). They were also both pretty mischievous, although Harry didn't have much time for tricks, what with dying and fighting Voldie as a kid.\\

What you said was:

#+end_quote

4th Cousins Once Removed are NOT close relatives. Not by any measure... as indicated by the genetic relationship.

Fleamont is James' father. Dorea is Charlus' wife. Fleamont's parents are Henry and some unknown woman.

There is no known relationship between Charlus, Fleamont and Henry.

I suppose you could have, as a headcanon:

Phineas > Cygnus > Dorea/Charlus > Henry > Fleamont > James > Harry

or even (with some cheating)

Phineas > Cygnus > Dorea/Henry > Fleamont > James > Harry

But either way would just be a headcanon. And one that raises the question of why Sirius doesn't point out his relatedness to James/Harry. After all...

Phineas > Cygnus > Pollux > Walburga > Sirius, or

Phineas > Sirius > Arcturus > Orion > Sirius

Also... Dorea's dates are meant to be 1920-1977 (admittedly I'm not sure where those numbers come from... HPWiki can be a bit circuitous with the Blacks) which would mean she was born whilst Henry was on the Wizengamot. And Henry and Cygnus are almost certainly contemporaries.

The most natural resolution of all the facts would be something where Charlus and Fleamont are siblings, or Charlus and Henry are siblings. [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/sort-of-a-harry-potter-fanfic-4327e9e0a821][My own personal headcanon]] uses the latter relationship.

And, again, we're talking about (hypothetically) FOURTH cousins (with a removal)... so it's not more than 0.2% shared on average and probably not more than 0.1% based on the other examples of removals in that link.

** It's my opinion that Harry highly benefits dating someone older, smarter, with knowledge and desire to teach him history, culture and power. Essentially his best match is an upper-year Slytherin.

A point of several Slytherin-centric fics is that practicing magic makes you stronger, and most students simply goof off outside of class instead of really putting in practice time.

Instead he ends up with a younger Gryffindor who barely has a personality beyond 'shy' until book 5 where suddenly a romance interest is needed. ...and again, if she spent her time learning from Molly about cooking, cleaning and such, she could be a domestic goddess, but that would be too much personality for such a flat love interest.

*** Let's not forget she was a fan girl until suddenly he had feelings for her in 6th year which is coincidentally when love potions etc got introduced in a major way outside of possible mentions with both Hermione and Ginny being curious about the ones in WWW as well as Slughorn having a cauldron full of Amortentia. Not saying she used one but to go from no interest in her and only seeing her as the shy fan girl sister of his best friend to loving her in the span of a short time is weird especially when he wanted nothing to do with his fame which she was all about from the get go. I feel a serious relationship for Harry would have been better if whoever he got with actually had some sort of ambition and knowledge about how the wizarding world works which certainly isn't a poor pureblood who has a crush on him just because of story books made up about him. Like I really don't see when he had time to get to know her without anyone else around really. Honestly Luna had more backstory and about the same amount of character building as Ginny as far as similar experiences outside of the whole Chamber of Secrets thing which honestly wasn't a lot then. Hell most of the time Hermione is the best potential relationship just because we know her and her and Harry did have a relationship in some form that was actually pretty strong compared to the fan girl, the airheads, the mentioned once or twice people and everyone else.
