Preferably not ones where Remus is in love with Sirius but uses Regulus as a substitute because Sirius is straight. Please and thank you.

*** It unfortunately appears to be much more rare than I would like. And sadly most of the fics I've come across are of Remus very expressly using Regulus to get over or get back at Sirius, or to be a substitute for something he can't have, which doesn't seem very Remus-like to me.

**** No problem, I love this pairing and it's far too rare. I think a lot of what does exist is still buried on personal LiveJournals, which doesn't help either.

xylodemon is one of my favorite Regulus authors (she's also written a couple fantastic gen fics about him, and more Blackcest than you can shake a stick at) and I liked both [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/468131][Whatever I Want (Whatever That Is)]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/317928][The Most Dangerous Star at the Dark Centre of the Universe]], though the latter strays more into the territory of using Regulus as a replacement for Sirius.

ignipes is mostly a Wolfstar author, but I enjoyed her Remus/Regulus fic [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13486][Castle by the Sea (The End of All Days Remix)]]

Spessartine was more of a Blackcest author, but she has a few Remus/Regulus, though unfortunately I've forgotten which was my favorite. Her fics are here: [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=spessartine&keyword=fics+by+spessartine&filter=all]]

The fic that originally got me interested in the pairing was [[http://librae.livejournal.com/20758.html][April Morning Almanac]]. It's Remus/Sirius but with unrequited Remus/Regulus.

You might also be able to find something here: [[http://crowned-moon.livejournal.com/]]

***** Thank you so much! I had read Whatever I Want (Whatever That Is) and The Most Dangerous Star at the Dark Centre of the Universe already, but not any of the others. I'm looking forward to reading these now =)

****** No problem, I hope you find something you enjoy!

And hey, if you find anything really great that I didn't rec, feel free to drop me a line. I'm always on the lookout for more good stuff in this pairing, too. :)

******* I've read through a few recently, my favourites (besides the one's you mentioned) are probably [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/698465][With Eyes Painted Blind]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5949424][In the Shadows We Meet]] (which has a bit of a different take on things than most of the Remus/Regulus fics I've read). I also enjoyed a lot of aspects of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1439002/chapters/3026566][Lady Stardust]], even if it does play into the "He was in love with Sirius all along" trope.

I've written my own one-shot for the pairing too, but it's not published yet.

I kind of wish some really great writer would write a phenomenal multi-chaptered fic about them but that person is not me and I fear I will be waiting for a very long time before I find such a fic.

******** Thanks!

Yeah, I think an epic could be really interesting, especially with the war going on. A relationship with Regulus could really drive a wedge between the Marauders and help explain how they started becoming distrustful of each other, not to mention being a good excuse to explore the Black family dynamics, the treatment of werewolves and other dark creatures, etc. Someday somebody will write it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

********* If you want to read my own fic, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6408157][it's up online now]]. I was planning to leave it at just the one, but then [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4cnc72/marauders_map_as_a_horcrux/d1jrfyh][someone sparked an idea]] that I'm probably going to write a fic based on, but because I like writing stories that would work alongside canon I can guarantee it's not going to end happily.
