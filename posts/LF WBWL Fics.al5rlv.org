Not POS, though it is a great fic if you haven't read it. 60k+ words. Well written. Doesn't have to be Slytherin!Harry. Thanks.


** linkffn(Antithesis)

One of my favorite fics. Be warned, it is an emotional ride. Very good quality, finished in the last year.

*** I second this. It is a masterpiece! It really acknowledges that growing up in an unhealthy, abusive enviroment won't make a mentally stable person.

*** Gonna have to second this as well, it was what immediately popped to mind when I saw the thread request.

Great fic, hard read; I wish I could experience reading this for the first time all over again.

#+begin_quote
  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

Takes some of the worst parts of most WBWL fics and creates a genuinely brilliant story on an epic scale.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
