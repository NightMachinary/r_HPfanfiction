I am in the middle of writing something, and having read so much fanfic, I want to clarify which abilities are canon and which are fanon.

In canon I think that the ability to teleport anywhere and tamper with existing magic slightly (bludger, platform barrier) are their most noticeable skills. They are seen doing some basic magic, and it is implied that they are good at housekeeping, but for all we know that is just practice.

Is there any canon evidence for the fanfic favourite of house elves being able to come when called? I don't mean things like Sirius shouting for Kreacher in Grimmauld Place when he could have just heard him, but the 'always know where master is' appear whenever their name is mentioned anywhere in the world sort of thing?

Also in terms of how much house elves can do. Hogwarts has 'hundreds' of elves, which within an order of magnitude an elf per inhabitant. The privately owned elves each served a small family, and as the Malfoys didn't seem to replace Dobby, the work they do doesn't seem to be irreplaceable, so is it fair to say that a single elf might actually be less useful than an average wizard in getting stuff done, i.e. their magic is different enough to break a few minor rules that wizards follow, but not particularly powerful.


** In Half-Blood Prince, Harry manages to summon Kreacher by calling for him. He also manages to get Dobby too, since at the time Dobby and Kreacher are fighting.\\
Later on in Deathly Hallows, Kreacher explains that he was recalled by Regulus after being used by Voldemort at the cave, and Dobby is able to pop into Malfoy Manor to rescue Harry & co., with a little direction from Aberforth.\\
 \\
As a side note, I notice that earlier in the book, when Dumbledore summons Kreacher, the way he explains things, Kreacher is bound to Grimmauld Place and was inherited along with it. There's a usable idea somewhere in there...

*** I feel that could still be construed as the 'master' actively notifying the elf that they are wanted, and it is up to the elf to make their way to them. Maybe they can find their master over short distances, but Kreacher would have already known that Harry was at Hogwarts and Regulus just called Kreacher home. I don't like the idea that house elves are always looking over their master's shoulder and will appear every time their name is mentioned, or can be used to immediately find anyone.

**** Even if Kreacher knew that Harry was at Hogwarts he wouldn't know where in Hogwarts, yet he immediately came directly to him.

And Kreacher made it pretty clear that he was able to return to Regulus because Regulus called for him, otherwise the cave could not be apparated into or out of.

***** It could also be that Kreacher was to come home after the Voldemort was done with his services.

If you think about the scenario like this:

Voldy makes Kreacher drink the potion and leaves him to die.

But Kreacher need explicit instructions that voldy is done with him.

Kreacher asks for help from voldy (cause hes just drank the equivalent of dementor spit).

And voldy is just like "lol. No. I don't need you anymore so just die quietly - m'kay? Cheerio"

So Kreacher takes that as "well he said he doesn't need my help anymore. Master said to come home when we're done. I can go home to master and 'die quietly' indeed. Prick."

Kreacher wasnt Called home BUT had specific instructions to Come Home.

** I dislike the super powerful house elves, who can magic food out of nothing and can basically do anything the master wants.

As far as canon goes, they can pop in and out of pretty much anywhere, or at least anywhere they have permission to be (or know of). Dobby knows Malfoy Manor, both of them were accepted into Hogwarts with permission from the Headmaster. We don't have any evidence if they can teleport anywhere they want to.

Apasrt from that and the ability to levitate and push with their magic, they don't seem to be able to do much (Dobby is stupid overpowered in CoS and then suddenly loses the ability to directly manipulate magic, if all elves could do that they would be used as untracable assassins and saboteurs, not as kitchen staff).

I always liked if the author shows the house elves actually doing things by hand, as in cooking or cleaning, not just by clicking their fingers. Most fanfictions makes them almost omnipotent, but the stupid purebloods never catch on to that, becaue they are bigots of the highest degree, and other such nonsense.

** They can teleport in and out of ‚Äúwards‚Äù (wards is being used as a blanket term for any security charms, jinxes or curses), they can be summoned by their master and can perform various feats of magic wandlessly. They still conform to the standard rules/laws of magic, for example they cannot create food using magic in accordance with Gamp's Law, as seen by the trio when they visited the kitchens in book 4(?)

*** For the wards, is that just that anti-apparition protections don't work for them as they do not use human apparition, but wards designed for them could. Also, owners can apparate into their houses and Dumbledore can apparate in Hogwarts, so maybe all the times we see them ignore wards it is just because they are explicitly allowed to. Remember Dobby used to be the Malfoy house elf, so presumably he had permission, and perhaps either the family forgot to remove him or they couldn't (would need to recast them entirely or for Dobby to be there in person maybe).

**** Weren't there anti apparition charms in the cave? If they were, Kreacher went through them because his master ordered him to "come home". I believe orders give them purpose, and purpose (intent) is a big part of magic. Dobby probably sees Harry as his saviour and values his directions as orders. When Harry asked for help in the mirror, Dobby heard and entered Malfoy Manor (probably, he was never ordered to not enter the Manor, or once allowed always allowed). Then Harry asked him to take Luna and Ollivander to Shell cottage and then go back. He then went for the trio, always under Harry's directions. When Harry called Kreacher in Private Drive, it was with the intent of him appearing, so it was an "order" and I believe it is what pushes Elfs magic to come to their masters.

That said, I do think they can be stopped. I don't think it possible for a wizard calling their Elfs to Azkaban to break them out. Either it has a "no Elfs can enter" ward or it breaks the link to their masters. You can probably make it up.

***** Azkaban itself is a very ‚Äúwarded‚Äù place as it was only found by accident. It used to be a lab of some sorts, that is heavily protected. While I do think the ministry would ward it further, they might not have bothered to ward it more. Also the wizards and witches that are locked up might not use the house elves as they might be under the impression that it won't work, in truth no one bothered to try. Thus is there no reason for the ministry to make sure no one escaped due to their arrogance. If that makes sense

I like to think there are house elves working in places other than the kitchens. The hospital wing, for one, might have elves helping out behind the scenes.

I'm sure they still have to do a certain amount of polishing, cleaning, etc. even allowing for Filch, cleaning spells/self-cleaning items, and cleaning products. Maybe Filch does the daily high-traffic cleaning (stairs) and the house elves do the general castle maintenance? E.g. cleaning the large unused portions of the castle. They also clean the common rooms (OOTP), and possibly the dormitories.

Where I suspect their magic works best is en masse, sort of like a colony of ants can devour an insect carcass far more efficiently than one alone.

I'd say so, yes. The most powerful thing we see Dobby do is block Harry's post. I imagine that house elves were probably like the elves we are familiar with (kobolds/brownies/‚Äòtraditional' elves who may help around the house/bring good luck if left offerings), but gradually became enslaved and then just became a status symbol/property of the house.
