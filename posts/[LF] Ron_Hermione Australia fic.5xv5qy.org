Are there any fics out there where Ron and Hermione travel to Australia to retrieve her parents only to discover that they have adopted a (preferably magical) child while their memories were erased? Came across this scenario in the fic linkffn(10292446) where this is the case, and I was wondering whether there are any similar stories out there? Regular Ron/Hermione goes to Australia fics are also appreciated. These I have read so far:\\
linkffn(11807757) In love and war\\
linkffn(7562379) Australia

  Hermione has resolved her war is not over until she brings her parents home to England. Ron thinks a summer on the other side of the world is a perfect escape. But transitioning from friends to lovers is not always easy, and some hurts seem impossible to forgive, as Percy Weasley knows all too well. Can the bonds of love and family mend the pieces of their lives torn apart by war?

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? WINNER BEST DRAMA MARAUDER MEDALS 2016!

*** Is this not ultimately a Remus/Hermione fic? I've come across the story a couple of times but been leery of getting into it for that reason.

**** Yes it is. Basic plot is that 23 year old Hermione, working for the dept of mysteries, accidentally travels back in time to her third year. The only way to get back is to use the time turner her younger self had after school is out. So she waits 10 months at hogwarts in hiding and because time travel rules, she can't tell anyone anything about the future. During this, she falls in love with professor Remus (a ten year age diff but nothing too crazy).

Then when she goes forward in time, the story follows Remus and Hermione in present time through the rest of canon. Everything is canon canon compliant except that Remus survives the last battle. So Ron and Hermione start a relationship just like in canon. Probably over 100k words has a Ron/Hermione pairing and the relationship is good - there's no bashing. The fic is a WIP and where it currently is, only Remus still knows about Hermione going back in time because current Hermione hasn't gone back yet. Based on the time line, we are about to see Hermione going back in time in the next few chapters, at which point the pairing will switch again.

Anyway, I think if you tend to be a canon pairings shipper, you'd still really like this fic. It's an interesting what if.

***** Thanks so much for all the detail. Will keep an eye on this fic and see how it develops. Ron/Hermione is my favored pairing and I guess I'm just concerned that to get to Remus/Hermione, the former relationship will be diminished. Anyway, thanks again!
