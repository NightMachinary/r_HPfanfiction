Looking for any and all fics where one or more of Voldemort's Horocruxes turn against him.

Bonus points if they also don't ally themselves with the Order or Harry and friends kinda like the diadem in Magical Relations where the horocrux possesses a student, regains a body, chooses to remain dark, and opposes the original Voldemort.

I've read Seventh Horocrux already, so no need to rec that.

Thanks in advance!


** Well, strictly speaking he is not aligning with Order or Harry, but with Luna Lovegood, so it probably counts as the same, in linkffn(12407442), but it is so delightful cracfic, that I just have to mention it here.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** You know, I've yet to read a really good Ginny!Morte, but it seems like that would be the perfect setup for something like this.

Harry's interference in the chamber interrupts Riddle's attempt to use Ginny's lifeforce to create his own body and his only option is to absorb/replace the girls spirit. Using the trauma of the event to hide from Dumbledore, Riddle suddenly finds himself in a very different situation. He is a wizard of good breeding (if a 'blood traitor'), in a house that values ideals and bravery (easily manipulated), early on in his education (can play a long game).

He has access to groups and ideals he never had as a halfblood in slythern. If you take the view that Riddle was an oppertunist (not really a blood purist, simply using the issue of the day to secure fanatical loyalty), then you can easily imagine him slipping into a similar role with slightly different ideals.

He sets his sights on becoming queen of the lions in a few years and views Harry as a tool to do that. And doesn't take kindly to other Voldemorte's trying to recast Harry as the primary protagonist. After all, he is the true center of the story, Harry is just a side character. (And any feelings he might have about said side character are obviously leftover feelings from the takeover and mean nothing).

  “I'm Harry,” she finally offers when the silence in the cupboard feels like it's going to overwhelm her. “Harry Potter.” There's a warm sense of satisfaction resting in her stomach, not her own, and Harry doesn't know why Tom seems so smug. It's wonderful to meet you, Harry he practically purrs, sounding like he's whispering directly into her ear. Harry twitches, a small smile starting to grow on her face. “Are you going to help me, Tom?” If you'll let me. I'll take very good care of you, Harry. Tom Riddle starts talking to Harry when she's six.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]
