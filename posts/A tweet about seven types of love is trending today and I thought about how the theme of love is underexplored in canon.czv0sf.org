Having seven types of love, seven horcruxes, and an unfulfilled promise of Voldemort being beaten by love seems to naturally inspire an alternate horcrux hunt where Harry beats each horcrux with the help of each type.

1. Eros - The diary is only mostly dead at the end of book 2. Ginny still has some connection to it and has to help Harry finish it off. In the course of that, they get some nice romantic moments, Harry can acknowledge his feelings better than he does in canon. Additionally, this should be part of the DH horcrux hunt, and there should be some portion where it's just Harry-Hermione, Harry-Ron, and Harry-Ginny, with Ginny joining the default set.

2. Philia - During the break-in for the cup Harry has some moment where he believes he'll have to die in order to get Ron and Hermione out safely.

3. Ludus - Uhhh this is really the odd one out. Maybe some kinda prank at Grimmauld Place results in the locket being uncovered. Or the locket gets fused to someone after putting it on and it can only be removed if they have a serious hearty belly laugh.

4. Agape - Harry lets himself die to save everyone at the battle of Hogwarts. Solid.

5. Pragma - When Harry arrives at hogwarts for the diadem, Snape leads Harry to it, being killed by a thousand cuts and explaining his history with Lily as they make it through the death eaters to get at it.

6. Philautia - Actually Neville pulling the sword out of the hat to kill Nagini is pretty good.

7. Storge - The ring is somehow involved in Tom's revival ritual. Harry somehow gets his hands on it scrambling around before the priori incantatem. He drops it, it tumbles three times, his parents come out and they tell him to direct the priori-beam at it. This destroys the ring and causes an explosion that enables Harry to get at the portkey.


** I do kind of like this idea, but the first thing I thought of when I read the types was that "Harry Potter and the Pillar of Storge" suddenly makes WAY more sense as a potential title for DH. Parental love had pretty much everything to do with Harry's journey.

*** In canon as it stands they could replace the word "love" with "storge" and I don't think anything would change. (If storge were a well-known word)

** I like the narrative concept... but the whole 'X greek words for love' thing is bullshit. /Ludus isn't even Greek/. It's Latin for 'game'.

(You see /Mania/ and /Xenia/ pop up in some other lists. Those don't mean 'love' either.)

From what I can tell, only /Philia/, /Agape/, /Storge/ and /Eros/ in that list are legit. The English word 'love' can be used for all four concepts (although it probably wouldn't be the best translation for /agape/ or /philia/).

** Hmm, you could almost fit them into canon, with a little stretching of concept...

Eros - Ron destroying the locket while confronting his fears over Harry/Hermione. He achieves confidence in his passion for Hermione and hers for him

Philia - The diary, the cup, the locket, and Nagini could all work here. The cup is my current choice through a process of elimination

Ludus - Dumbledore and playful love would seem to go together most naturally, but it isn't really involved in the destruction of the ring. This one is a stretch, but the more playful/childlike way 2nd year Harry and co approach the puzzles of the diary and the Chamber would seem to fit best

Agape - I agree

Pragma - The story of the diadem is tied up in the feelings of the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron towards each other.

Philautia - The locket could fit here too, but I agree that Neville and Nagini is the most apt

Storge - No parents were really involved in destroying horcruxes. Dumbledore, as a surrogate parental figure, fits best though. His self-sacrifice with the fake locket fits pretty well, and is also wrapped up in what he did with the ring, so we'll shove the ring here and call it a day
