This is my first fanfiction, and it's garnered a decently large following so far on FFN. It's based around the idea of Death taking a personal interest in Harry (Helene's) life and pushing her onto a darker path that she wouldn't have taken otherwise.

I'm always happy to receive constructive criticism, and that's pretty much the basis for me writing fanfiction in the first place. It helps to have a community of (rabid) fans to kick me in the head every once in a while and help me hone my writing skills.

So, if you guys are interested in a fic that involves a very dark protagonist, a bit of mild clich√©, and a healthy dose of brutal combat dealt out by a ridiculously strong lesbian dark lady, I've got your back.


** I just read through it because it has a lot of stuff I like. Dark magic? Time travel? Fem!Harry? Femslash? Fucking /gimme./

And I really enjoyed it. I like the interpersonal relationships and how you're developing Helene as damaged but healing.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Future femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.

*** Yeah? I thought I'd branch out and start advertising the story a bit.
