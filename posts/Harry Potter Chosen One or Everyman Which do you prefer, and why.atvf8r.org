In the books, Harry can be defined as either one of the following: 'The Everyman' or 'The Chosen One'. Towards the end of the series, many -- including myself -- felt as though Rowling became unsure about how to portray him.

Is he special -- with feats like producing a patronus at /thirteen,/ the prophecy etc.? Or is he a slightly above-average student?

Personally, from onwards of book 4, Harry should have dropped the characterisation of 'the Everyman'; the shit that went down at the graveyard would have served as an excellent motivator to becoming something more proactive. Regardless of the validity of prophecy, Harry should have trained and travelled all over the world, to become a greater wizard. He might not be able to handle Voldemort in a straight-up fight, but he would have definitely been a credible threat to the Death Eaters. If Harry (our main protagonist) takes several levels in badass, then it makes Voldemort a more dangerous antagonist.


** I think that because the books are largely from Harry's perspective he's a bit of an Everyman. But zooming out or looking at it from different characters perspectives he's most definitely the Chosen One.

*** JKR obviously wants the Trio to get all the accolades, and thus writes good adult guys as basically useless idiots. Where you can excuse Dumbledore's behaviors in first three Books as typical children's book shenanigans, his behaviors in Book 6 amount to total criminal negligence and incompetence. Heroic deeds by other students get skimmed over in a few paragraphs and completely ignored in Movies.

But she doesn't want to write the Trio as competent either. They have no coherent strategies whatsoever and only reacted to whatever their enemies threw at them. Tactically, JKR goes all in the “good guys don't kill” trope and prevents the Trio from putting any of those sadistic genocidal terrorists permanently out of business. As a result, they can only win through literary weapons such as Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope. Bad guys have to be dumbed down to room temperature IQ for them to even have a chance.

In the end, it doesn't really matter whether Harry is written as Everyman or Chosen One, getting rid of tired literary tropes is the key.

*** This is where I stand, no question. It's not difficult when reading the books to take some of Harry's narration as truth, but honestly he has a pretty skewed perspective of himself and his own abilities. I see the question of 'how powerful was Harry, really?' come up quite a bit, and the consensus usually seems to be that he was a pretty average wizard who was capable of defeating Voldemort simply because the prophecy predicted itself. But I don't think that's true. There are endless interpretations of the prophecy at this point, but to me it seemed pretty clear that it was made in the first place /because Harry was coming into existence./ Harry is, in fact, quite a unique person (the prophecy simply provides him with tools to help him along the way, e.g. Parseltongue, a psychic/soul connection to Voldemort). He's got a huge heart and a remarkably calibrated moral compass despite all the horrific trauma he goes through (something Dumbledore stresses often in his attempts to convey to Harry that, yes, the power of love is actually A Thing), and apart from that he really does seem to possess a lot of raw power.

Like OP stated, Harry produces a solid form patronus at the age of thirteen, something Wizarding adults are always to quick to point out as extraordinarily impressive and surprising. Despite the perception of Harry as an average, perhaps even lazy, student, he achieves high marks in all his O.W.L. exams that require magic, even passing Astronomy after witnessing Professor McGonagall being attacked during the test - his only failings were Divination (self-explanatory) and History of Magic (which IIRC he collapsed half-way through due to the vision about Sirius Voldemort sent him). There's even a scene at the beginning of book 5 where he performs wandless magic (when the Dementors are attacking and he's dropped his wand, he says 'Lumos' and it lights up even though he isn't holding it). Everyone from Dumbledore to Hermione to Viktor Krum believes that Harry is a skilled, clever, and talented wizard, in spite of the fact that Harry himself has trouble believing this:

  “Play to your strengths."\\
  "I haven't got any," said Harry, before he could stop himself.\\
  "Excuse me," growled Moody, "you've got strengths if I say you've got them."

​

#+begin_quote
  Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

  "You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?"

  "Yes, Harry," said Hermione gently, "but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said [...] Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang."
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  "Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit."
#+end_quote

It's also not a fluke that the most obviously powerful wizards in the series are 50/60+ years of age (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Slughorn, McGonagall, etc.), and explains why students who show early promise like Hermione, a young Dumbledore, and yes, Harry, are considered so exceptional. It takes time and practice to develop and cultivate a wizard's innate magical powers. Harry /was/ training and being proactive in books 5 & 6; he was at Hogwarts getting an intensive magical education, he co-founded and taught and led Dumbledore's Army, he personally went up against Death Eaters and came out on top, he was decisive and assertive in making his political standings apparent to the Minister for Magic and making it clear he wasn't going to be used, he received lessons from Dumbledore imparting important information about Voldemort's history and activity and psychology. We didn't see the boot camp-like training regimens of fan fiction, but that doesn't at all mean Harry wasn't growing into his role of the 'Chosen One.'

He was very young, sometimes I think people forget just how young, and he wasn't afforded the time to grow into a wizard who could have matched Voldemort blow-for-blow in a duel (though I believe he did, later in life). In fact, I was just thinking about this today, about the final battle between them and how cool it would have been to be able to see Harry win in a spectacular duel like that. But, at seventeen, as skilled as Harry was in Defense and dueling for his age, he knew he couldn't have done it, and he relied instead on his instincts and precision ability. The scene in DH of Slughorn, McGonagall, and Kingsley dueling Voldemort simultaneously and failing, and then Harry stepping up and finishing the job with one expertly-aimed Expelliarmus that reflects Voldemort's Killing Curse back onto him, to me, is like that scene you get where there's a big archery competition, and the contenders are doing their best, slinging as many arrows as they can, and then up walks this kid, who takes one shot and splits the arrow in the center of the bullseye straight down the middle.

Because that's what he was born to do.

** The Everyman thing usually ends with the villains being comically incompetent when it comes down to fighting. It also involves a lot of Deus ex Machina and even more dumb luck. We've all read the Atrium battle between Albus and Voldemort - there's no way an everyman can last a minute if Voldemort decides to actually use even a tenth of the magic he used in that fight. In canon, the series ended had Voldemort's intelligence and ability being nerfed down to Crabbe and Goyle levels.

The Choson One works better, if only because you're not giving the villains a huge handicap.

Besides, having the potential to become Voldemort's or Albus' equal does not mean that Harry is their equal when he's a teenager.

** For Harry Potter, chosen one works better. Chosen one is basically a justification for plot armor, and everyman Harry has no business doing what he does every year with just a bit of luck as justification.

In general I deeply dislike the chosen one trope, but everyman in a heroic context is even worse. You can't be fucking both at the same time, they're in direct opposition and together they make characters incoherent (like Harry going from great feats to idiocy depending on plot requirements).

  Up to book three Harry as an everyman works.
#+end_quote

How? Harry is put in situations where an everyman has no business coming out on top, and he DOES come out on top, through a shitload of plot armor (fight against the basilisk), fateful interventions (Fawkes, mommy's protection) and inherent power (repelling 100 dementors), neither of which fits everyman narrative. Harry is really in no way ordinary. Well actually everymen are often plot bulletproof, but that's bad writing imo.

I guess you could have written the first three books with Harry as an everyman, but they'd have been pretty different. The actual books certainly don't fit.

** Quoting Enembee's profile from ff.net, which I think summarizes everything for me:

#+begin_quote
  "The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation."
#+end_quote

Harry Potter the actual series seems to rely for its popularity at least partially, (I think) on the fact that Harry is /not/ special. In fact, he's Dumbledore's puppet, especially in the last book where it feels like the entire sequence of events has somehow, improbably, been set in motion by Dumbledore who knows /precisely/ what will happen even after his own death.

I think most readers find it easier to sympathize with a character who has very little in the way of special talents. (Even his "capacity for love" seem pretty run of the mill.) Characters who are super hard-working and/or very talented are not much like the average person, and so many people have trouble projecting themselves in their place and aren't very interested in reading about them.

When a character is enough of a cipher and sufficiently mediocre, though, it's insanely easy to see yourself able to do the same things (even if you yourself aren't particularly mediocre), and as the story is told almost entirely from Harry's point of view, well, this makes it pretty easy to see yourself in the story.

That said, my own tastes are pretty different.

In canon, as skillfully as it's written, Harry isn't a player in the events at all. He's a pawn in a game between Dumbledore and Voldemort, with neither particularly much free will nor particularly much character growth.

Or, as Enembee hints, what you're promised at the start of the novels is a bildungsroman about a wizard who starts as a child but ends being able to defeat a powerful evil opponent. You're given a strong hint that Harry will struggle and grow and eventually be capable of overcoming Voldemort. Instead, what you get is the PoV of someone whose only real hope of winning is that Dumbledore did a good enough job predicting and manipulating the utterly unreasonable series of events that he clearly somehow set up before his death in book six.

Although I really enjoyed canon, it wasn't because this was a particularly satisfying result, at least not to me.

I like seeing people who are competent. Not superpowered, not gods, but smart and hard working and willing to make some effort to succeed. It's also nice when they have troubles, when they have flaws, but they pull themselves together and struggle forward anyway.

So, one of the things I like in fan fiction is seeing my itch scratched: to see a Harry who is a hero and not Dumbledore's wind-up toy, which is to say, seeing a competent Harry, a Harry who, through long and very hard work mixed with some talent, manages to go from being a child to becoming an older teen powerful enough to be an actual player in the events. I want a real coming of age story.

I thus prefer fan fiction where, instead of being led by the nose and being unremarkable, Harry instead (not easily and not quickly, but eventually) grows into someone who is capable of overcoming Voldemort on his own.

(Sidebar: there's a very real sense in which I find Snape and Hermione the most compelling characters in canon; Snape certainly has the most interesting plot arc, though it's underplayed. He's done something pretty much no one else could have done (acted as a spy for years, deceiving Voldemort all the while), sacrificed incredibly deeply to atone for his misdeeds, and yet, at the same time, he's tragically caught up in a past that never was, mourning an unrequited love decades after it became hopeless. And Dumbledore doesn't help him get over his unreasonable attachment to a destroyed friendship and unrequited love, he instead uses Snape as a weapon. Snape's a /really/ interesting character, and quite underused in canon.)

** I would have loved to see Harry develop into a powerful wizard (or typical Chosen One) by the time of the 7th book, if only to see Harry performing incredible feats of magic from his own perspective and the extensive process of him reaching that point. One scene in the books that will always stand out is the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Ministry, and having a version with Harry doing something similar at the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a joy to read (in the end it still could have been the elder wand trick that won him the duel). Now, it's difficult imagining Harry in canon being capable of such magic, but it would have been incredible if done right.

But at the same time, having Harry be The Everyman by the end of the story was incredibly powerful in its own right (and might have been the better choice). Seeing that in order to defeat Voldemort, it doesn't take a powerful wizard like Dumbledore and some complicated magic, but simply an extraordinary individual willing to sacrifice everything to save those he loves, is some deep stuff. Harry was the Chosen One in a way--his death being the key to Voldemort's defeat--and not needing to level him up to some Wizarding God in order to show that is a testament to JK Rowling's work.

Though I do agree that I think Rowling was torn between the two up into the 4th/5th book. It's the 6th book with Harry struggling with silent spell casting and magic in general that we see her really embrace The Everyman.

** Everyman. Hands down. This is probably a side effect of reading a lot of fantasy as a teen, but i am really sick and tired of the chosen one theme. It always feel like polot conenience, and in my opinion cheapens the sacrifices of the protagonist. Because they are destined to fight the big bad there was only one option.

Which is probably why I stopped enjoying HP halfway through book 5, and stopped reading after a few chapters of book 6.

** I prefer something in-between. I'd like for Harry to get stronger, but not significantly so. If he gets too strong, it messes with the dynamics of the trio imo. The thing I liked from canon was that Ron and Hermione were never really sidekicks. They never needed to hide behind Harry or be told what to do. There were even occasions where Harry was saved by them.

Canon!Harry wasn't really an 'everyman' to me. By the seventh book, Harry, and the trio in general, were holding their own against death eaters. They really only struggled against the most experienced ones (Bellatrix, Dolohov, etc.).

** I despise "Chosen One" narratives, but in Harry's case I think it worked mostly because he was always less formidable than his reputation. Sure, he pulled off some impressive stunts when he had to, but he was never the Great Invincible Saviour-Hero that the public hailed him as. It was one of the few things I actually found interesting about him...

That is actually something that Harry has in common with Dumbledore. Both have a reputation of being more than what they actually are, though since Harry's the main character this duality's a lot clearer.

** If I had the choice it should be a bit of a split, 70/30 Chosen one over Everyman, this kinda creates a third selection best described as a Badass. To me Harry should always be depicted as a tough and strong person. But Badass Harry should be someone taken seriously by both sides. He should been seen as the next Moody, some one who is considered powerful and dangerous but not godly like Albus.
