I just finished reading this fic, and my eyes are killing me right now, but I wanted to write this while I was still on my post-fic high. So, very long, disorganized post ahead.

*Mystery & Plot* This fic really kept me on my toes. I had no idea how it was going to play out, and while I guessed correctly on some parts, others came as a real surprise. I think the courtroom drama was also done really well. One of my favorite parts was also how the author built up the magical side of the wizarding world. There is a sense of wonder about magic in this fic, but it doesn't go overboard with 'So mote it be's and so forth.

*Characterization* I loved the characters, even the villains, because they were really fleshed out. It's hard to go in depth without spoiling the plot, but even the OCs were done well.

I really liked how Harry, Ron and Hermione were portrayed. They've definitely grown up, flourished in their chosen careers, and I really felt that they were adults in this story. I usually don't care about Ron, but he was great in this fic, and I loved the Ron/Hermione interaction here.

You can really see the difference in what they are able to accomplish as adults compared to when they were children. They have connections, power in their own right, decades of experience - they can take the offensive rather than just react.

[[/spoiler][I prefer fics that feature Harry choosing another career. This one has Harry working with magical wooden furniture/trunks, etc.]]

*Romance* If slash is a major squick, this fic is not for you. But if you don't mind it, then I really recommend this for all the other reasons I mentioned above. I like slash (I like almost anything done well), so this wasn't an issue for me.

*TL;DR* - I loved everything about it. It's a really long fic, so it's perfect for reading on the plane/on vacation. Basically, it's Harry Potter and Friends Saving the World as Adults. Post-Epilogue, mostly-canon.

** Saw the pairings, ^{nope^{^{nope^{^{^{nope}}}}}}

But that's just me. Snape slash ain't my thang.

*** No problem with that, :) I usually don't like Snarry, but the story was too good to skip (for me).

***** I did notice some scenes where I felt that there was too much explaining going on... But I don't know if that was a good or bad thing.

  but so far I've enjoyed how laid back this Harry Potter has proven to be in a lot of ways
#+end_quote

That was one of the things I really liked about this fic. Throughout the books, I've always felt that Harry's dream is to be 'Just Harry', and he's achieved that here. And as the story goes on, it's like his kids are seeing another side of him, the 'Vanquisher of Voldemort' side.

*** I just want to make sure I'm reading the bot right. It was published on July 3th, 2016 and was completed on July 7th, 2015. That's a grand total of five days (including day of publishing). And it has ONE HUNDRED FIVE CHAPTERS, and not bullshit chapters because of it being over 500k words.

******* The story had been posted over a period of time in another site years ago ([[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=35725]]). The author must have just re-uploaded it to AO3.

** If you enjoyed 'Fate', then you should read "The Apple Tree" by Philo. Equally as long. Equally as good. I don't know if it's up on Ao3 and I'm too lazy to look, but it's also on HPFandom. [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708]]

*** I actually read that first, it was recc'ed here a few days ago. When I finished, I looked for other works by Philo, which is how I got to Fate.

Overall, I liked it, though there was a part of it that I wasn't comfortable with [[/spoiler][The 'accidental' rape]] and the age difference. Same ship, but 47/67(approx) doesn't sound too bad to me compared to 17/37, lol.
