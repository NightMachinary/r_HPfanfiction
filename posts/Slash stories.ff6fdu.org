Please recommend stories between Harry and another male. Preferably something over 20k words. Bonus: if it is light hearted


** You're not gonna find many slash fics on the official HPfanfiction reddit unfortunately. In fact they tend to get downvoted. I'd check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][the HPSlashFic reddit]] for some really good recommendations.

**** Quite a few people on this sub tend to downvote slash regardless of how high quality the fics are. That sort of voting behavior comes down to a selfish (and counterproductive) desire to get rid of anything that does not appeal to their own personal preferences.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678135]])

Some of the fics might be sad at times but I swear all of them have a happy end.

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Very sweet. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15857595]])

I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

A Draco/Charlie Weasley fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1907331]])

Snarry once again. Post-war. Harry and Snape swap bodies. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16848688]])

A fun Drarry fic (Draco pov) post-war. Where Auror Harry gets deaged. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/391640]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Harry worked for W.A.N.D., the Wizarding Association of National Defence. He liked his job, and he liked being a lonely, miserable, old bugger. But when he's assigned to protect Tony Stark he's unprepared for what he'll have to face: a nosy, interfering superhero intent on getting Harry a life, or perhaps just getting himself one.

  “So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.
