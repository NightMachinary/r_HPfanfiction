I'm very new here, but not so new to fanfiction. I really liked the fanfiction while I was waiting for J.K. Rowling to publish the rest of her books post-GoF and wasn't very picky on what I was reading. Granted, it has been quite awhile since I've returned to the world of fanfiction, but recently discovered a lot of things have changed. Now that the series has concluded, I tend to lean toward canon compliant fics. In particular, I love reading fics between the end of DH and before its epilogue. I feel like there can be a lot of ideas for fanfic writers to create one that includes Rolf/Luna but surprisingly when looking I've come up short.

As for linking fics and using bots(?), be forewarned I'm hopeless.\\
I have luckily found one great Luna/Rolf fic though! Wandering Wonderer by seaori linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/220312?view_full_work=true]]) It was also found on fanfiction.net. linkffn(3862725) The site seems to be down right now or else I would provide the link. It is the same title but with a different writer name, something with roses I think.

In short, any good Luna/Rolf fics out there like the one above or one just in general that piqued your interest? Thanks!

  Luna deals with life after Hogwarts, and is surprised to find Rolf Scamander far easier and less pleasant to come across than a single Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Completed.
