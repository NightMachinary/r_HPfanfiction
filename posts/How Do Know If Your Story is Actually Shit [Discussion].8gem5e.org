I've been having quite a bit of fun with my only HP story, and I've been blown away by the positive and constructive reception I've gotten on it despite only 4 chapters being out.

But in my quieter moments - tired or drunk, but probably just a bit tipsy - I can't help but wonder if it's actually somewhere between average and shitty. Maybe writers can't help but cringe when they consider their own work, but it's hard to tell if you're really being fair to yourself and, hey, reader reception might just be an echo chamber where only the nice ones bother responding.

Does this even matter? I don't know

** Just keep writing and stop worrying too much about quality. It's a common enough insecurity, even amongst professional writers. You just have to persist; do it because you love it, do it because you need to write, but don't let your inner voice overwhelm you. Maybe it'll always be in the background but just push past it.

Though if you're concerned about the quality of your writing at all, you're probably on the right track. It means you're thinking about ways to improve your writing. It means you're not stuck on a delusional island where you're convinced your work is the greatest thing out there and as close to perfection as anyone will ever see. It means that you can and will get better.

** Write some more and then go back to your early works. You will eventually find them shitty, don't worry. Best you can do is to go over your older works and improve them as you get better at writing.

***** Good to see I wrote something at least a little better when I was 16 (and a virgin).

Now (22) I'm just disappointed that there's warnings about porn being unrealistic everywhere, yet no-one warns about sex in written fiction.

All those drawn out worshippings of bodies? Oral sex where a man seems to read his partner's thoughts (or, er, her appreciative moans) and vice versa?

I must have lovers that suck, or lack imagination, or maybe I can fix it by shoving my most beloved romances underneath their noses.

(Huh, if they're attentive enough, maybe that last one actually has a shot of working.)

** If it's only the nice ones responding, you're doing pretty damn good. Or you're not being very polarizing, but "not polarizing" doesn't mean "bad" in any way.

And yes, FFN reviews are hardly the peak of literature critique, but unless you're going to pay a professional editor, I really wouldn't worry about it. Average is on the higher end of quality when it comes to fanfiction. And people will let you know if it's shitty.

You good, fam.

This is true for FanFiction.net but /only/ to an extent. I think it depends on the story itself and who the story is targeting. I've come across quite a few Draco/Hermione stories where the writing is truly atrocious, meaning poor spelling, bad grammar, run-on sentences, and the like yet all of its reviews (of which there are many of them) heap praises on it. And I ask myself: Did they read what I just did? And then you have the other reviewers who only post negativity in terms of nit-picking particular items in your story. (/I can't believe you made Hermione so stupid! She's the brightest witch of her age!/) Lastly, and this is a bit off topic, but what does "You good, fam" mean?

**** True, true.

And "you good" means "you are doing well/ok/fine" and fam is slang for someone close to you, like a friend or family member.

Can you even hire an editor for a fanfiction?

Because I would. I'm working on a three-year project and my perfectionism just perked up its ears from this.

**** It'll probably be a freelancer and you'll want to tell them up front that it's fanfiction, but I doubt anyone is going to turn down a paying job, much less an editor. Though you'll want to shop around on rates, I imagine. I don't know what professional editing costs these days.

****** They may or may not reject the job based on their personal views. That's half the point of freelancing, you get to choose your work.

Mostly it's just polite so they know what they're dealing with going in.

They wouldn't have the legal standing to sue you anyhow... They're not the auther of the original work, and you're just asking them to edit it, not publish it.

** That's pretty normal until you write something that just BLOWS you out of the water. But, if you're writing a story YOU like,and You are enjoying and liking it. It isn't bad. I'm a firm believer of writing for yourself. You keep doing you, noble creator!

** If there is one thing I've learned on the internet it's that someone is always willing to tell you your work is shit. But that doesn't mean a lot. If you have a fragile or delicate ego, fanfiction isn't the realm to get into. Do it for fun, and don't worry if you suck. Sucking is the only way to get better.

That is really true. There should be something of a health warning. But then I don't think you necessarily know how fragile you are until it's too late. And once you've posted something, you can't unpost it. You can delete it but it will still be there somewhere.

** Really there's no way of knowing, because as a writer you'll always think your story is either complete shit or a literary masterpiece. By my experience, reviews on FFN, are always some twelve year-old praising your story to the ends of oblivion or the sort of person that belongs on [[/r/iamverysmart]]. You'll see this trend by looking at the reviews of stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9474009/][this.]] If you're really interested in improving your own writing or having somebody judge your work starting a WBA thread on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]] will help you.

On the serious side, I should also note that by positive reception I was also including views and favs and such, so thankfully I have another avenue to cut through that sort of thing.

** It only matters if it matters to /you/. I would say if people are enjoying your work and telling you so, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. However if your long term aim is to improve as a writer then fanfiction can only take you so far. It is, as you say, an echo chamber; and although a well received story is probably not terrible, it isn't necessarily very good either in terms of the writing. It just means that it's scratching an itch for the readers.

There are places you can get serious critiques if that's what you want, but you have to look for them and work for them. If you make it clear in your profile and author's notes that you welcome concrit, you might get the odd unsolicited concrit review though they are few and far between.
