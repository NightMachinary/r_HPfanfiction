Hi, I just finished reading a fanfiction where Regulus Black goes back in time. I really liked the fic so I want to see if there any Regulus-centric time travel fanfictions.

If there isn't, I would love if someone would recommend me a fic where one of the main Harry Potter cast preferably (Harry, Severus, Hermione, Draco) travel back in time have romance or a good friendship with Regulus and take Regulus away from that path.

Hopefully I can get some recommendations. Thank you in advance.


** Have you tried face death in the hope by LullabyKnell? Harry is the one who time travels, but Regulus is the other main character.

I'm sorry about the formatting; I'm on mobile. Here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** Does it have to be time-travel fic? If yes, then I have only one to recommend:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23874001/chapters/57388117][a shrike (to your sharp and glorious thorn)]] - after stealing the Horcrux, Regulus time travels to his 5th year.

I haven't seen many of "Regulus travels back in time/to the future" fics.

**** Yeah, Regulus is my new love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1800187][birds of the feather]] - series, Regulus wakes up just before Harry's 3rd year and becomes a Care of Magical Creatures Professor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1698382][out of the lake]] - a series of one-shots. Tragic.

one-shots:

** I haven't seen many Regulus time travel fics.

Do you like Snape as well? There's a really good one I've been reading the last few weeks that has Regulus as a main character and I actually prefer Regulus story in it to Snape's one, especially in the new chapters that are coming out now.

It's a Snily, though, in the beginning which might put you off. Basically, Regulus survived the war and has set up an organisation that stands against Voldemort and he has lots of people trying to kill him. His characterization is the best I've seen of him so far in fanfic.
