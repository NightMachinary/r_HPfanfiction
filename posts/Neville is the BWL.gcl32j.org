  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

** The very AU linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) fit. Neville is the BWL, but Harry is Dumbledore's apprentice (and quite a badass.) Unfortunately the third part of the story was never written, but they're a pretty good read all the same.

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)

  Magic is an eco-system, and the magical world has been culling magical people and creatures for generations. It has finally gone too far - and the collective consequences are finally being felt. When magic starts disappearing, crumbling quietly in post-war Britain, it causes a cascade effect across the wizarding world. Not a single magical child has been born in almost a decade.Twenty-three-year-old Harry Potter discovers this when the wards of Diagon Alley literally come crashing down on top of him. So ends the life of the Boy-Who-Lived. Yet again, he returns to the station between life and death.With a new chance in a new world, Harry - now eleven-year-old Harry Fleamont - is given a chance to figure out how to save his dying world. In a new world that seems much more perfect in every sense of the word, Harry is faced with a growing threat from a much more dangerous Voldemort, and the reality that jumping universes just makes vulnerable and poor wizards who just want to eat a regular meal and afford to buy a pair of Merlin-damned socks.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
