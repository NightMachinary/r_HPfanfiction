I'm largely new to Harry Potter fanfiction. I used to read Naruto fics, but I recently thought that since I'm more than familiar enough with HP and there's even more fanfics from this series than Naruto that there'd be a good number of really good ones since I hadn't read even one before. I tried looking around on here, I found a few other "best" posts on here, but I've run out of a consistent source which gives me exactly what I'm looking for. For the most part I'd prefer Harry-centric stories (though I read that one excellent Hermione fic where she's in Slytherin and enjoyed that as well) that are rather long, around 100k or more, less is fine though.

Here's a few examples of ones I particularly enjoyed:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

The Alexandra Quick series (no idea why the author isn't posting when they've got nearly 200k words done, despite them probably wanting to post when it's complete)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness]] (and its sequel)

I probably listed more than I should have and there's a few others I rather enjoyed (Slytherin stories seem to be a favorite of mine and tbh stories are more interesting when they start their own way instead of starting smack in the middle of canon). Either, way I'd really appreciate some help as I'm having a tougher time finding what I'm looking for than I'd like. Crossovers are ok (though I'd have to be familiar with the other series), but I'd rather stick to HP for the moment. There was one LOTR one I really liked (though Harry was a bit too OP at times)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Check out anything by Jbern. Seriously, linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle) was absolutely amazing and has a completed sequel that's just as good. Also, linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is great, and his other stuff is good too.

Other great reads include linkffn(A Black Comedy) and linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) by Nonjon, each having hilarious comedy and interesting plots.

I really enjoyed The Psychic Serpent trilogy by Barb, sometimes called The Triangle Prophecy trilogy. Not quite on the same level as the above stories, but it had me captivated throughout and the ending was satisfying and heartbreaking all at once. It is three books, years 5-7, written before HBP came out, and gloriously complete. Not on the usual sites, I don't think, but google should work fine.

Oh, and I almost forgot linkffn(Backwards With Purpose: Always and Always). Best time travel fic around.

linkffn(Delenda Est) kicks some serious ass as well. Harry and young Bellatrix Lestrange wage war on Voldemort across time. Their relationship does not stay platonic forever, but it actually makes sense. The really good stuff is the politics and magic they use/are involved with.

One last one, I almost forgot my favorite Jbern story, linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) is so freaking cool in so many ways.

All these stories are complete, because WIPs drive me crazy no matter how good they are.

Oops, seriously this is the last one, linkffn(Aspirations by megamatt09) is a pretty good story made awesome by the comic book style vigilante arc.

Read all that, OP. Now. Go ahead, I'll wait. I can't wait to see what other people recommend, it's been too long since I found a fic I really loved.

Sorry Mr. Bot, I hope you can parse all these links. I didn't plan on including so many, but I just kept remembering more of my favorites as I went.

P.S. Best crossover I've seen is called linkffn(Wand and Shield) and has HP in the Avenger's universe from the movies. This one is, woefully, regretfully, /frustratingly/ incomplete and likely to stay that way. Despite that, I will grudgingly admit that this story is very well written and fun.

*** Great post and I haven't read most of them either (though I've heard of almost all of them). I started on Bungle in the Jungle and had issues with the 2nd person POV, I hear it gets good, but I think I'll wait on it for now and try some of the other ones. I generally don't do 1st person either, but I'm willing to make exceptions for that like Seventh Horcrux, which had me laughing non-stop for the first half of the story.

I don't mind WIPs either, but of course I'd prefer there'd be an ending or just more updates. I've read some really special fanfics that just stop, but that doesn't make them less special (a Naruto fic called "Naze?" always comes to mind when I think about that).

I forgot about that 2nd person POV thing in BitJ, that is definitely annoying at first but I think I stopped noticing it at all a few chapters in.

I agree, I should have made this post a while ago, it's much better than going through other recent posts which generally don't have stories at quite the level or just the kind that I want in general and since reddit is what it is it'll just help whomever needs it in the future which is really nice.

** GenkaiFan has great work. If you haven't read it, go read linkffn(Poison Pen)

A long, well-written one is linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven) but beware that it feels /horribly/ cliché at times. If you can look past that, you have 400k+ words of well-crafted story.

Another good one is linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor), though its warning of an Evil!Dumbledore is certainly warranted.

An oldie, but goldie, is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change), though an age warning is appropriate here. It's still well-written (especially the romantic development), but it hasn't aged gracefully.

linkffn(The Greatest Prank) is a hilarious crossover with the comic /Looking for Group/. It's not very long at 43k words over 17 chapters and still a WIP, but it's good.

There's more, obviously, but I don't know how many links the ffbot can handle before it gets parsing errors :p

I haven't read most of these either, though I was looking at Summer of Change earlier today as a possible read. I appreciate the help and if you're willing I'd always like to hear about more. I'm a really fast reader so I go through fics rather fast.

While I share your distaste for Evil!Dumbledore, I found the one in Junior Inquisitor to be a well-written one, though admittedly I haven't read the fic in more than a month.

The Summer of Change's romance with Tonks builds from practically the first paragraph, and it progresses really naturally as far as I can remember, nor is it the main focus of the tale. It's about Harry finding a place in his life, and a girlfriend is just one aspect of it.
