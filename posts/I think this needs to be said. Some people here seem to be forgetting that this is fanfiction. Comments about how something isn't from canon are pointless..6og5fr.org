** Two things:

1. Lots of people prefer fanfiction that maintains, at least in part, some aspect of canon characterisations and worldbuilding. So for those people, failure to follow canon is indeed a valid criticism.

2. Among those who do like fanfiction that changes canon, they do not have to like all changes to canon simply because they're different. If you're going to change some aspect of canon, you still have to change it /for the better./ I.e. it still has to be a justified change.

**** Ah, I see the problem. You're expecting people not to be idiots. A long study of human history has shown this to be a futile hope.

** You don't give an example so that makes any kind of discussion hard, because normally the problem isn't that people change canon, it's that they do it without telling or explaining it to the reader. If you do change canon in a certain way it should be clear why this change was nessecary or why did you did it.

Most changes are the very core to the story, which is most obvious in big AU stories. But to often a change is either done because the author missed something or for his convenient. And if that for example makes a a figur being out of character it can greatly decrease the readers intrest in the fic.

**** But not all changes make sense given the circumstances of the fic. Lets say your idea is to write how Harrys life would have changed if Sirius would have been kissed at the end of PoA than this is what intrests the reader, that is what he expects and if you suddenly let his forgetten sister appear, or turn it into an indy!Harry fic with all the tropes that come with it, you better have a damn good explanation in your story or people will ask wtf you were thinking.

And while I belive the point of your thread are smaller kind of changes (atleast I guess as you have not provided examples), it works the same way for everything, we expect change, hell we want change to canon, thats why we read fanfiction, but try to keep your story sensible, and close to canon where possible, because in the end, we read HP fanfiction because we love the original books.

** Well duh, but I think the important distinction here is whether something differs from canon on purpose/intentionally (an AU) or whether it's fanon ideas that are creeping into canon. Prime example of this is stuff like "Snape is Dracos godfather", most people who use this aren't writing an AU, they just don't know that this isn't canon.

**** I totally get that, but there's a lot of misconceptions and it's difficult to keep them apart from consciously deviating. If you use something like magical cores (which I don't even hate like most of this subreddit) or "Snape is Dracos godfather" I want you to be very explicit that you understand that you're deviating from canon. I don't care how you do it, just communicate it to me in some way (even if it's through an A/N, but that's least preferred).

For example an A/N from "HP and Future's Past":

#+begin_quote
  That Ragnok is the Head Goblin is NEVER stated in canon. In fact his name is only used because Bill tried to recruit him, but since it is common in Fanfiction to use him in that position I did so instead of creating an entire different Goblin name.
#+end_quote

That's great, now I know and can move on.

****** We are going in circles... I just explained why. You're not going to have to explain anything when Harry is suddenly a girl, because that's obvious AU... I can't imagine anyone complaining "That's not canon!" in such a scenario.

** The problem is there is AU which is fine, if we understand it we can follow. Then there are mistakes, people who try and get canon but get it wrong.

Its about what breaks the immersion? I read a lot of AU and for the most part I can role with it. What I struggle to finish is when they change one small thing for no story based reason but simply because they think its' cooler or more fitting. What drives people nuts is when canon is wilfully misinterpreted to justify something that is very much not canon.
