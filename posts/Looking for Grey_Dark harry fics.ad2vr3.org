Recommended fics where Harry is grey or dark And has his own side or he changes Voldemort to his side


** *Gray Harry*:

linkffn(For Love of Magic)

Warning: This one is very controversial because it has a lot of anti-religion stuff, so it's not for everyone. Also, it has underage boys having sex with adult women , so it might not be your cup of tea. Harry is a total jerk in this one and I dropped it because I found him annoying, however, he's definitely "gray".

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

I haven't finished it yet, but Harry is not evil. Maybe he's a bit of a psychopath, but he's not hurting innocent people or anything so I would describe him as gray.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)

Harry wants to be ruthless against the Death Eaters. Dumbledore and the Order don't like that he's willing to kill in order to defend himself.

linkffn(Blood Crest)

Harry is not really evil, since he's a child. His guardian is definitely evil though and teaches him the art of necromancy.

*Dark Harry*:

linkffn(Too Young to Die)

Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived. After his sister dies, Harry wants to use necromancy to bring her back. He eventually does completely evil things in order to achieve his goals, like opening a portal to hell which threatened the whole world, sacrificing his own parents for the ritual to bring back his sister, killing multiple people etc.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

Well, he's not evil in this one but he does become evil in the sequels. Harry becomes extremely cruel and there are a lot of graphic violent scenes so I would not recommend it to everyone. Basically, the Malfoys slowly brainwash him to hate the muggles. When Voldemort returns, he realizes Harry is a horcrux and decides to forcefully recruit him. Harry eventually becomes addicted to the dark arts and starts liking his role on Voldemort's side.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
