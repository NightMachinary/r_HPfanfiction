I'm looking for fanfics about students who have PTSD or a severe anxiety disorder facing a boggart? I remembering coming across one a long time ago, but there might be more as well.


** That lesson is one of the least discussed fridge horrors in the series.

"Ok, class! Today we bare our souls to the world by revealing our innermost fears in public with no expectation of privacy! This surely won't have negative social consequences at all. I'm sure there are no bullies in the student body that will cheerily use the information to torment you."

*** Snape does wind up pissed at Neville, but that was mostly because of how he beat the boggart rather than the form it took.

I do feel like you're missing the point of the exercise, which is /publicly conquering that fear./ How's someone going to mess with Ron using spiders if Ron steps up and does the spell to turn it into something silly?

Hermione is an outlier because her fear is stupid. Valid, of course, we can't help what we're anxious over, but still pretty dumb.

edit: You know, for all that people were scared that Harry's boggart would turn out to be Voldemort, why did nobody think 'Hey, what if it's the fucking MURDERSNAKE with DEATH EYES and POISON SO POTENT IT CAN KILL HORCRUXES that Harry fought last year? You know, the one that almost killed him?

Are you fucking serious? Riddikulus will do jack fucking shit to actual spiders (or dark creatures, in half of the class' case). Harry doesn't learn to deal with dementors after that lesson, does he? And Neville certainly doesn't lose his fear of Snape either.

If the point of the exercise was to conquer fear then Lupin clearly missed it too when he kept Harry from performing it. Or is Voldemort a fear that shouldn't be conquered (both by Harry and the class)?

Nah. The point of the exercise was learning to face boggarts, and the way Lupin did it was nothing more than a massive and completely unnecessary (since it could certainly have been done individually) breach of privacy.

***** It's about getting over the fear, obviously, not about learning to fight actual acromantulas, which Lupin would cover in another class. They are there to learn to defend against boggarts, not anything else. Neville doesn't get over his fear of Snape because Snape hears about himself getting put into a dress and deliberately targets him from then on.

Harry never actually sees the Dementor in that class. Lupin stops them before the boggart can target him, because he thinks it's going to turn into Voldemort.

Uh, do you think that a vastly powerful and murderous wizard represents a bit of a security risk in the classroom? Lupin could jump in front of most threats and have the boggart turn into the moon. Voldemort would just kill him immediately.

Not really. The boggart dementor just stood there instead of trying to kiss Harry. Snape boggart just stood there silently. None of the dark creatures were mentioned doing anything. Hell the moon dementor didn't even make Lupin tranform. If Boggarts could actually behave as what they mimic, they'd be extremely dangerous, not annoyances.

Dementors drain your happiness until you're incapacitated before they try to Kiss you. Whenever Harry passed out, Lupin repelled the boggart. It never had the chance to Kiss him.

"A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.

Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.

‘R-r-riddikulus!' squeaked Neville.

There was a noise like a whip-crack. Snape stumbled, he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and swinging a huge crimson handbag from his hand."

They /are/ extremely dangerous. I assume the fact that the moon didn't work is due to some kind of aspect of the curse, but the Dementor can still make Harry hear his parents' death.

If you're willing to assume everything that doesn't make sense to you is incompetence on her part, I guess. I really don't see any reason why my points are invalid or wrong. Lupin literally says that the more people you have around you, the weaker the boggart is.

If there could have been anything useful to making this lesson a group exercise (how hard is to make everyone to step out of the room while one of the student is fighting the boggart?), it would be having someone's worst fear actually be Voldemort. Fear of Voldemort is so entrenched in the wizarding society that they cannot even say his name, so finding ways to make fun of him would do everyone good.

And I doubt boggart Voldemort could actually kill anybody. Boggart moon certainly doesn't make Lupin transform

Yes, it's the point of the exercise, but it's a bad point that would create much more problems for the students than it may or may not solve. Imagine some kid's boggart turns into their drunk father, for example. They can turn it into something funny, but the fear would still be there, because their actual drunk father is still as much of a problem for them as ever, only now everyone in Hogwarts knows about him and mocks the kid about it because children and teenagers are cruel like that.

He's talked about it beforehand, Fred and George know the story of how it became a fear in the first place and might tell it just to embarrass him, and he could always, like, see a spider and get visibly afraid.

The lesson is about being able to cope with your fear, so presumably being able to conquer that fear in class means that taunts would be less effective in the future.

Alternately this is just how wizard CPS works. "Afraid of Dementors? Okay, that makes sense. Afraid of sharks? Sure. Afraid of your babysitter? Let's sit down and talk a bit after class."

****** I still think it's a bad strategy to learn to cope with possible future tauts that may not happen by inviting taunts in the present.

And do you really think Ron is now cured of his agarophobia? Only now except Fred and George, Malfoy and Co. are free to sneak spiders to him.

I do think Lupin's lesson would be good for "monster in the closet" type fears some children may still have. Like, if somebody's boggart is werewolf because of the children's story they've read, sure, publicly confronting it would be useful. But if it's because they were or almost were bitten by one? It can just make their legitimate trauma worse.

******* There's a difference between being able to deal with a phobia and being able to work around it. Did you know that one of the most effective ways to overcome phobias is exposure in controlled circumstances? Actual psychologists do that on the regular.

Plus, if they had a legitimate 'worst fear,' like a basilisk or werewolf, then they get an opportunity to challenge a weaker version of it with someone who can beat it right beside them.

That's obviously better, and he actually does do it in his final exam. The issue is that A) they might not have that kind of time, B) I think it's explained that the boggart is significantly weaker in the classroom full of people because it can't lock onto someone to target effectively - look at the one in Grimmault Place effortlessly fucking up Molly Weasley, and C) frankly, it's the class about harsh lessons. Moody certainly knew that. If you honestly couldn't deal with your fear, you ought to have asked not to be included.

** Off the top of my head, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) has that, and the lesson itself is handled much better.

I hate the way Lupin handled that lesson in the books. Malfoy mocked Harry's fear of Dementors enough as it is, imagine what he would do if Harry's worst fear was, say, Vernon shouting at him something like "Get back inside your cupboard, freak!" The only reason the lesson didn't end in disaster was that most students except Neville still had some general fears, and for Neville the lack of privacy probably meant that Snape doubled his bullying for the next weeks. Great opportunity to face his fears, thanks, Professor /s

What if a student had a fear like Molly's, their loved ones dead? Or something embarrassing or traumatic they don't want in the rumour mill?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

That same author also has a headcanon that Remus "calibrated" the Boggart so that it would only transform into things that were appropriate for a Third Year class. And Snape calls him an idiot for it. linkffn(Calibration)

  Remus knew what he was supposed to do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine. Have her write "I will not skip class" five hundred times, then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: through avoidance and denial. Except he knew where that path lead.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus trains the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)
