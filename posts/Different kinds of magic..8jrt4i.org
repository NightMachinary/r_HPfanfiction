It hit me while I was thinking about my own fic. Now bare with me: Magic that isn't just tied to canon properties. Not a simple latin or greek word, but perhaps spells specifically made for certain people?

Like Parselmouths, a secret tome bursting with ancient forbidden spells that only Parselmouths can recite.

Or spells in the form of music, like the gods of old, arcane spells that take the form of music sheets and are summoned by preforming the music, or being old hymns that were passed off as simple songs, but they hold actual power to them.

I'd love to know if there's fics out there that pertain to this, because I need some research for my own work. I have a perfectly good idea how to do this, but I need examples.


** I've always liked the idea that wand magic is like the Windows OS of magic. That there are all kinds of ways to use magic but wands are the most user friendly and widely used and thus also becomes the most developed system with the widest selection of spells that others have made.

Sure you can use another OS but "programs" aren't cross compatible. Less usage = less collective man hours invested on a societal level = less developed. Not necessarily worse or not as powerful, just less researched.

**** If I were going to invent a Linux spell system, hrm...

A complex ritual compiles a spell into a usable template that is then stored in the casters mindscape. Supplying mana to the spellform (template) activates it.

Imagine a room with runic script running everywhere. When the caster completes it all the runes seem to glow and then flow from the walls into the casters head leaving the entire room bare of any runes.

Spellforms don't require a wand to use but there is no customization to a compiled form. It always does exactly what the ritual was designed for. Pragmatic but not artful.

The strength of a linux wizard is how many spellforms his mind can hold and how versatile his ritual making skills are for producing spells with variable effects.

** linkffn(12104185) has that version of Harry exploring a more animistic, intuitive, and emotional way of using magic that was lost to the ages, eventually named in this fic as “helian” magics

** It's magic. You can do whatever you like, that's the beauty of it. I did write a story where a traditional Muggle ritual song was a spell of sorts but it's hardly a new idea. I wouldn't use fanfiction for research though.

** The Black Queen series linkffn(8233291) has a fem!Harry trained in a different magical tradition, which involves rituals and sympathetic magic (using a replica of something to cast spells on it from very far away; archetypal example is voodoo dolls).
