Hi! I started reading a fic at work incognito and closed out of it before I wrote the title down again (dumb).

It had Harry and Hermione both sorted into Slytherin and how they were coping with it... I don't remember any pairings (it was first year) or if it said it was going to evolve to any pairings... It was super well written and I was enjoying it.

Please Help <3

*** I admittedly didn't get super far in it since I was at work, but at the time I was reading, the Slytherins weren't overly friendly to Harry and hostile to Hermione. Draco was definitely not their friend.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle*Warning: Rating R*DISCLAIMER: I do not own Harry Potter. I am only writing this for my amusement, and for others amusement. I am not writing this for a profit of any kind.DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of the images used.

  Can a child, raised to believe that he is worth little more than the dirt he sleeps upon, find the courage to rise up and face his destiny or will the weight of the entire Wizarding world that rests upon his small shoulder be the final straw that breaks him? (This is a seriously abused Harry - forget canon Harry! Abuse is not overcome in a few months time)

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/270848][Session Transcripts]] - Written in transcript format; brain damaged Harry and transgender Hermione are sorted into Slytherin.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8493628][Silver Trinkets]] - I haven't read this one, and it's tagged with Good!Malfoys and Manipulative!Dumbledore, so I'm not sure that's what you were reading.

If those aren't what you're looking for, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dark-and-or-Slytherin-Hermione-Stories/115252/][here's]] a ff.net community for dark/Slytherin Hermione.
