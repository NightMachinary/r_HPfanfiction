I just kind of like the pairing, but everything I manage to fine either almost entirely excludes Ron as a character or has him be an utter asshole, it's the same with dumbledore really.

I generally like longer fics too.

It's just kind of painful to like Ron as a character but also want to read something with Hermione and Harry as a pairing.


** Here are Harry/Hermione fics where Ron is not bashed. He is not a prominent character in most of them though, but he stays their friend for the most part.

  Harry had always had nightmares as long as Hermione had known him. But after the Battle of Hogwarts, they took a new, terrifying, potentially magical form. But the one thing Hermione wouldn't do is let him suffer alone when she could help him.
