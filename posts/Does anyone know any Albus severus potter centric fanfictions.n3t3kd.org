Ever since I watched/read the epilogue I wanted to know more about his story and the cursed child ruin his and Harry's story.

I was wondering if anyone knew any Albus Severus Potter centric fanfictions.

** I tried to find it to link, but couldn't.

Amyway, the only good ASP fic I've ever read was the one where Harry abused the shit out of him as a way to get back at Dumbledore and Snape. Only time I've ever been able to tolerate Harry giving one of his children such a stupid fucking name üòÇ

** From all next generation stories I like ‚ÄúRaindrops on Roses‚Äù by backinyourbox linkao3(373224) the most. There is also ‚Äú[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/47462][Roses Trilogy]]‚Äù by Realmer06, which is not bad, but I prefer the former one better.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
