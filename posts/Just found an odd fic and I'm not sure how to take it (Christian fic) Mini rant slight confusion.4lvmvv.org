First of all I'm on my phone so some of this might be a little bit odd to read just a heads up.

So I just found this pic that is supposed to be a crossover between Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. A friend of mine just a couple weeks ago got me hooked on these kinds of stories so I have been watching to see what showed up. I happened to stumble or more kind of fall on my face what I found this story. I guess this is more of a discussion or more of just kind of venting my confusion. I barely got halfway through the first chapter before kind of just not sure if I should continue or not.

The basic idea as far as I can put together they are that the Greek gods and goddesses and all of the demigods are devil-worshipers or something like that. I'm not even sure how Harry Potter fits into this. It's just kind of weird. Like the whole point of Harry Potter is to be about magic and mystical things. The whole point of Percy Jackson is to talk about gods and goddesses. I guess I'm just kind of thrown for a loop because this idea of everybody being purposely evil or just misrepresented is for lack of a better word confusing.

I think what gets me the most about this is that it gets me thinking about all of the fiction that is just kind of out there. I understand the whole point of fanfiction is to take characters and put a new spin on them or add a new what if element. What I don't seem to understand personally is why someone would take this particular route. I know that a while back I heard about a story being written that was supposed to take out the Magical elements or something like that of the Harry Potter series. Something about God or whatever. I guess I'm trying to get at is it seems like these stories are written to be critical of the regular Cannon work. I don't understand why people write them. I've seen many people joke about that don't like don't read line that is added to a lot of stories, and I can understand the sentiment in which it is given. I probably won't be reading more of this. But I felt like I should at least get my thoughts out and see what other people thought.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807606/1/The-Prayer-Warriors-Saga]])

Tl:dr found the story that is supposedly written by a Christian who criticizes some Cannon work. I just don't understand why someone would do it. I also don't know who this sort of fiction is geared at.


** That summary sounds like satire.

Also, what is this cannon you refer to?

As per Internets, I suppose some of that stuff is satire, some is genuinely trying to convert people or just for the author to give themselves a pat on the back. The latter is obviously geared at people like you. Clearly, you have not been enlightened.

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

*** That really is a thing?

Damned, (some) believers are batshit-crazy and should be in an asylum IMHO -.-

I mean I've heard that something like that exists, but I've never looked for it (and I will sure as hell not read it - especially because that kind of people thinks that I am the devil incarnate anyway (I am an Atheist!) and because people who want to ban books (yes, even fucked up shit like "Mein Kampf" writen by the German Dictator, Monster and over all subhuman asshole Adolf Hitler) are people I will never support or like: "With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably." Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdom and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged." - thanks Jean Luc Picard (Star Trek: The Next Generation) for saying what I want to say way better than I can on short notice!)

ps: @thread-starter: I'd stop reading that (doesn't sound like something I'd enjoy, so why read it? It's not like I payed for that drivel...and even if I had I'd probably stash it somewhere and not look at it again!)

** A bit of a nitpick: it's “canon”, non-capitalised, derived from the word “canonical” which ... basically meant and still means “written in the book called «Bible»”, but now also means “compliant with the source material” which is the meaning we want.

That nitpick aside, as mind-boggling as it is some authors simply do not seem capable of fathoming that a series in which religion itself is irrelevant or close to it does not need religion to be and to show what it was meant to show. You can observe the same thing with the people who (often aggressively) go on about how one cannot be a good person without religion; it's wilful blindness of a certain sort, plain and simple. And thus, since they cannot see the image the original author had created, they put some inane colours on it because that makes them feel better.

And no, I am not against religion itself. I may not agree with some things, but if you look at the balance of good things versus bad things religion isn't actually bad (though some religions specifically might be; I am looking at you, Khorne worshippers), even if some people are. Point is, religion-related things are simply easier to find cringe-worthy if they are nonsensical, but you can find enough nonsense that puts you out of it enough to stop reading even without religion (badly written romance, anyone? Yeah). And as for the aim of such stories, honestly, those people write that stuff first and foremost for themselves, I doubt there's any intended audience (outside of “everyone, because they have to see The Truth™”, but I'm sure we all ignore this inanity) for it anyway.

a case could be made for Joe Campbell's writings but I think HP is a not very subtle retelling of the passion.

#+end_quote

I'm both enraged and amused by this summary. Does the writer think atheists are stricken down by lightning when they try to click on the link or something?

As a Catholic, I've seen a lot of people try and 'Christianize' Harry Potter into an 'acceptable' story (which is ridiculous because it already has Christian undertones), and I can honestly say 99% of them truly believe they are improving the story or evangelizing the masses. It's obvious this writer is killing two birds with one stone by attacking the 'pagan' tones of PJ and 'improving' HP into an evangelizing tool. Personally, it's basically just an attempt to grab onto a cultural trend or popular work to spread the 'word', and they never had any true desire to enjoy HP or PJ in its original format.

Sidenote, my mother was rather conservatively Catholic when the books first came out, and she made me wait until I was older (10 or 11) to read them so I wouldn't be 'confused' into believing witchcraft or fantasy was real, as the Vatican was wary of the series when it came out and was pushing parents to keep it from young minds. It didn't really hurt anything, since comprehension on its fantasy elements would have come pretty quick, though I still think it was odd. She now admits it wasn't one of her soundest conclusions.
