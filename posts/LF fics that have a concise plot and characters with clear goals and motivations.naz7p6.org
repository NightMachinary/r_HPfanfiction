Honestly, I'm getting tired of reading fics which are hundreds of thousands of words long and cover years 1-6 at Hogwarts. I've read so many of them that I can't take it anymore.

What I'm looking for are fics that have characters with clear motivations and a clear and concise plot and don't drag on for years (hundreds of thousands of words) on end.

No romance centered fics please. I don't necessarily care if it is AU, canon compliant, or anything else really. As long as its well written and interesting. Any main character, doesn't matter.

Thanks.


** Here are a few shorter, non-romance ones that I think are done well in terms of concision.

/Conditionally/. So I don't usually go for "Snape is Harry's biological father" fics, but this one is succinct, poignant, and generally razor-sharp in its treatment of character and pacing. I didn't love the representation of Sirius, but I understood the author's choices. It's definitely not Snape-positive or Dumbledore-positive, but I didn't think it bashed them either. It covers years 5-7 with what I think admirable brevity. It says 'Independent Harry in the tags, but this isn't Indy!Harry. linkao3(19456585).

/The Unforgiving Minute/. It's been some time since I read this one, but Harry time travels and has something like one day in the past to fix everything bad that happened. It doesn't go as planned. The restraints on time make for an extremely concise plot. linkffn(6256154).

/For Lack of Bezoar/. I really enjoyed this one. Single point of departure: Ron dies from teh poisoned wine in sixth year. Harry and Hermione go balls out in the war as a result. It replays the war succinctly with important changes based on altered character motivations, and it does so relatively believably as it explores what the loss of Ron would mean for Harry and Hermione. linkffn(13108396)

/Business/. This oneshot explores a (rather ridiculous for an 11 yeard old) Harry who lacks the moral code of canon Harry and sets out to take control of (and create) a magical underworld. Suspending disbelief is necessary, but it's an amusing and succinct take on the criminal Harry trope, though it does move through years 1-4. linkao3(1113588). Lots of other oneshots by esama may also be too your liking, though sometimes the veer into Dumbledore-bashing more than I like.

Also, while I stan the Second String like crazy, I don't think it really fits OP's request, since it is very long (though I found the pacing excellent) and there is a relationship (that is secondary to the main plot). I rec it highly, just not for this particular request.

** linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary)

It sounds crack-y but it's very well-done. Most of it is in the form of text written in a diary though so if you're not a fan of epistolary works then it's not for you.

linkffn(Petrification Proliferation)

A great for want of a nail fic based on the premise of Dumbledore taking the Basilisk more seriously.

** linkao3(There's a List for That by GatherYourStrength) has Hermione going back in time to make sure that Voldemort is well and truly dead before the Second Voldemort War happens.

linkao3(Hermione Granger: Tomb Raider by Artistia) has Hermione as a treasure hunter that was hired by Fleur to look for a special veela artifact in order to stop a civil war. Fleur and Hermione have crushes on each other but nothing overtly romantic actually happens.

linkao3(Death's Gambit by MagdaTheMagpie) has Hermione travelling through time to look for the Deathly Hallows as part of a deal she made with death. Slight Crossover with Avengers but it's insignificant enough that you don't need to know anything about the franchise to follow the story.

  Redirected and rebranded, the Death Eaters have dismantled and destroyed everything the Light holds dear. With their society on the verge of extinction, Hermione is the only one who can fix the future. At least, that's what she keeps telling herself. Armed with plans, lists, books, and a house elf, she won't stop until things have been set right. But what will happen when she doesn't arrive at her intended destination? Will her plans to work alone still hold water? Or will she sink among the endless waves of memory and regret?

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

** *Blood and Water* and *Victoria Potter* have some of the more efficient pacing I've read in fanfiction. *Alexandra Quick* is quite long, but it's not set at Hogwarts and is decently paced (you get a lot for the length) and extremely well-written.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
