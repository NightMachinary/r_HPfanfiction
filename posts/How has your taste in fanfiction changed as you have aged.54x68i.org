Personally I have been reading Harry Potter fanfiction since about 2006, and I will tell you, I use to absolutely eat up rebellious Harry fanfiction, and one true love in Hogwarts stuff. Now though, I tend to roll my eyes at Harry rebelling and knowing everything, and I breath a sigh of relief when characters break up in stories.

I think the thing is, fanfiction is escapism for me, as a teen I wanted to rebel against authority, find my true love in high school and have lots of kinky sex. Now, while the kinky sex is the same, life is more casual, and one night stands and brief romances are the norm for my peers and myself. Romance still exists, but it isn't easy to read these perfect stories with easy love, even though I want to escape, I can't get immersed enough if love isn't hard, the character's need to work hard at romance to make me really into it. As for poor rebellious Harry? Well I shake my damn head at him, his life is bad, but he usually makes all the wrong decisions, or all the adults are practically cartoon villains. I just can't enjoy that.

Now a days I enjoy more family oriented stories, where Harry forms tight bonds of friendship, and has at least one adult confidant they can talk to, I also am starting to love post hogwarts stories with more personal problems, like bills, children, and friends growing apart. These stories use to drive me crazy as a teen.

I rambled a bit, but the overall question I have is: how has your taste changed over the years, and do you think age is a factor in that?


** Age is a factor, but I have found that the bigger factor is "the more I read, the less I forgive weak writing."

Cheap tricks, bad characterization, obvious trope abuse, overly-powerful/clever/whatever characters - these are all stuff I used to eat up, but now I'll put a story down right away if any of it comes up. I won't even give a story a shot if the first paragraph describes the weather.

*** And I'm more willing to read fics with premises or summaries that aren't the most appealing to me at first glance, if they're supposed to be really good (trying out Turn, even though I don't ship Drarry, and read Seventh Horcrux, despite disliking that style of summary).

** I've only been reading HP fanfiction for about a year now, but I've gone through hundreds of fics -- a 150k+ might take me two days. I'll give anything a chance still, though bad grammar and spelling might make me close out a fic.

I can't think of too many tropes or styles that I really can't stand -- maybe when Hermione reads like a boy-obsessed middle schooler when she's supposed to be 17 and has lived through a war. Or when the protagonist continuously makes bad decisions and doesn't learn from their mistakes. Characters need to make reasonable decisions based on what they know at the time. Extreme OOC also will make me drop a fic.

The biggest change in my taste seems to be sex scenes. If a man's penis is said to be coming from his waist, I just roll my eyes and close out the fic. Come on people, that's basic anatomy, you obviously have access to the internet to post the fic, look up a picture of a naked person if you haven't already seen one.

My favorite sex scenes are the more "realistic" ones. Give me slightly awkward first-time sex, someone getting a cramp, the girl not always having an orgasm (or multiples), someone complaining about sex being messy, or characters that are supposed to be comfortable with each other being able to laugh with each other when someone falls over changing positions. Finding sex scenes like any of those are rare, though, so I make do with what I can find.

** I only started reading around 4-5 years ago, and that was mostly Buffy fanfic. I've always been a massive bookworm, and an English major, so I had somewhat high standards(read:always hated bashing).

Did the same for Buffy, and I only read a few fics that had the common badly done tropes,(Buffy and team fix everything, everyone else is incompetent etc). I learned how to read the warning signs after a few stargate crossovers and one harry potter crossover. Then I found out about the tvtropes rec lists, and read a ton of Buffy fanfic from there. Read HPMOR, which I liked(in parts, not the ending and definitely not the beginning).

Then I got into Worm and Worm fanfiction for a few years, and the standard of writing was way better, and I enjoyed even the fix fics,(because the original story is kind of depressing, especially if you marathon it). If anyone knows sites with similar or higher standards than spacebattles and sufficient velocity, please tell me. Any fandom goes.

I only started reading Harry Potter fanfic properly after Seventh Horcrux, Harry's Island Home, and Applied Cultural Anthropology. I only read fics that are recommended here(and some authors' fav lists) now.

I still like almost all the fics I used to, except the tropes I feel are overdone. Rather than age, being repetitive puts me off of some stories. Some I've barely run into are Master of Death Harry, and marriage contracts. Might be a few stories I could enjoy in there before I get tired of it.

**** I mostly read buffy fics on Twisting the Hellmouth, so a lot of crossovers were involved. The stargate crossovers have all blended in my mind, but here's some others.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16369/DaveTurner+Fidelia+Venetrix.htm]]

Faith centered Rome crossover. Requires little to no knowledge of the show(I thought it was massively overrated), haven't read the sequels.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm]]

Ginny becomes a Slayer during the battle of Hogwarts. Diane Castle is a good writer, and has that rare ability to write long fics without it getting tiring.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

This one is pure Harry Potter, without the magic. Sounds horrible, but it is good. Slightly OP Hermione, but it makes sense in the setting.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27400/DianeCastle+Xander+and+Yet+ANOTHER+Demon.htm]]

One of the few Stargate crossovers that isn't total crap.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417335/1/Martian_Manhunter]]

One of the few time travel fics that is good. Veronica Mars crossover. Only nitpick is that the villain doesn't feel world ending.

Mediancat is also a decent author. The best way to look around is to try a few stories, and then check out the authors and their favourites.

Sorry for the short list, but it has been so long since I've read any Buffy fics, and I didn't have an account to keep track of stuff. There was a Star Trek crossover where Buffy is brought out of cryostasis, a couple of decent Firefly crossovers featuring Spike and Faith I think, one where postcanon Xander joins the Stargate program after he escapes possession.

Finally, here's a Worm crossover that is sadly unfinished. I never rec unfinished stories, but this is one of my all time favorites, and has so much potential.

** My taste has changed quite a bit since I started reading them 2 years ago.

I used to gloat over Ron bashing, but no longer, and that's why I soured on quite a few of my former favorites.

I began to despise canon rehash a while ago. Now this has become my greatest pet peeve, especially in time travels.

I started out as a dedicated H/G shipper, but after reading a few great H/Others fics, my mind has changed. Now I'm fine with any non-slash Harry pairing as long as Hermione, Ginny, or Ron are not bashed.

***** The only thing that comes to mind at the moment is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826429/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic]] by Sage Ra.

It features a psychotic, magic-obsessed Harry who wishes to force the world (or the wizards anyway) into a situation to prove whether or not they deserve the gift of magic.

It's still in progress, and Daphne hangs around a bit, but Harry isn't at all interested in romance or dating.

I thought it was pretty entertaining for a while, but I'll probably wait until it completes (assuming it gets completed) to reread it all rather than keeping up with the updates.

** I won't tolerate fridging or certain types of sexism these days. I'm almost to the point of rejecting overly generic female characters, but that would leave me with very few fics to read. I pretty much automatically reject harem fics, in part because it's almost invariably blatant wish fulfillment in lieu of proper character motivation and in part because it usually devolves into generic girlfriends differing mainly in hair color.

I analyze fics more. I'm searching more for originality. I've become sick of fics with Harry Potter as the main character.

I also dislike canon more and more, and I prefer fics that diverge from it more. Single point of departure early on or everything's different, either way.

** I started really young with Sailor Moon fanfiction. I cared more about adventure than romance and I liked het best, also being extremely young I only wanted young characters. Then I got into Gundam Wing fanfiction and discovered slash and romance. Once I got into Harry Potter I was sort of a veteran Fic reader, but it still took a while for me to care about adult characters. I still prefer slash over het any day and I have a higher standard for quality. I used to be able to read anything as long as i got more story and now if it's badly written I'll quit it immediately without thought.

** I've been reading HP fanfic on and off since 2003, so quite a while, I suppose. I was a teenager when I first got into it, and I had a crush on Snape, largely because of Alan Rickman, because that is the kind of teenager I was. Hermione was the most eligible female, and as a teenager, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with that pairing. The schoolgirl fantasy, I guess? An early attachment to nice girl 'tames' bad boy clichés?

I can't read that pairing any more. I'm an adult now, and...yick. Even if Hermione can be excused for her hormones leading her to questionable ground, Snape is the adult - even if it's 'twoo wuv', he should be laying down the law, don't stand so close to me until you're old enough to worry about having grandkids before your parents kick the bucket.

Not to mention that the seventh book served as a wake-up call for me about Snape, and I lost all interest in him save as a side character.

These days, I'm more likely to read gen starring Harry that isn't too dark nor too fluffy. I'm not too picky about the writing except that the plot has to make sense and I hate cheesy dialogue.

It's not a judgment on the people who do like the pairing, it's just how my relationship with it evolved until we broke up. ;) I can see where your younger self would have rejected the Hermione/adult pairings, but it would be interesting to know what drew you to it later, since my experience was the opposite. I suppose if you don't know, you just don't, though. Liking something is a lot harder to quantify than not liking something, I think. I certainly couldn't explain why I love most of my favorite fics if I had to.

***** I guess as I got older my thinking became less black and white and allowed for a bit more grey regarding student/teacher relationships when the teen in question is older and already thrust into adult situations (dodging death, trying to save her world). But I think it has to do with the fact that I liked Hermione a lot as a character and was really unimpressed with the canon romance between her and Ron. As an adult I'm more into reading fics with a "star crossed lovers" angle (where character development and the journey of something that seemed impossible from the beginning is more important than if the two end up happily ever after), and this ship tends to have that plus the fix it aspect of giving Snape (another favorite character of mine) a little bit of a break compared to canon. In theory I should like Dramione too, but I find canon Draco unappealing and haven't found enough gems that successfully address his weaknesses of character. There's an older (albeit long winded) [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/granger-snape.html][essay]] on the appeal of SSHG among older fans by Red Hen that I found pretty interesting.

** My taste has gotten objectively worse, I think. Thanks to stuff like Kindle Direct, when I want an original novel or work of fiction, I have hundreds of times more options than I did in 2001. So that means I'll no longer read stuff like /Alexandra Quick/, because when I want a Harry Potter fanfic, I want it to star /Harry Potter/! If I wanted an original work, I'd go and read an original work for free on Kindle unlimited. Back when I started reading fanfic, that just wasn't the case. Also, now that there's just so much well-written fanfic around, I've become so narrowly focused on reading only fics that do exactly what I want it's probably unhealthy. If your Harry/Hermione fic has just one thing I didn't like, I can drop it right away, because I've got thousands of other Harry/Hermione fics to choose from. When the fandom was knew, that wasn't the case. Instead, I'd have to be a bit more forgiving of authors, and maybe broaden my horizons a little bit. Nowadays I find reading fanfic is an extremely self-centered act of wish fulfillment, rather than the act of exploration and discovery it was previously. I'm not sure how to change that; the non-challenging, fast-food type of fanfic is so easy to find, and so enjoyable and tempting to me, that I doubt I'll ever read a challenging fic again. So I guess I've become a worse person as I got older! Isn't growing up supposed to go the other way?

** Age wasn't a factor for me. I started reading fan Fictions 2 years ago and I was around 20. My taste at that time was Harry/Hermione mainly. I enjoyed Harry Crow. I went through the top favorites fics pretty quickly.

Over the short period of time my taste did change. If I a see overly helpful goblins, Lords and Ladies, rebellious Harry then I know that the fic is a cheap immitation of higher quality pics. I know not to read them. So in a way I did move on.

Now I enjoy something different. I enjoy rare pairings. Recently I am reading one with a female Voldemort. Overtime I have noticed it has gotten harder to please me too. So that's another thing.

** In some ways I have gotten more discerning in my fanfic. I personally enjoy divergence fanfic and will just drop a story as soon as divergence points are added that aren't included in the premise (i.e. what if harry was sorted into hufflepuff, oh BTW in chapter 4 I'm gonna just throw in an older Malfoy sibling just cause.) With so many stories out there I don't suffer through hoping it will turn out well eventually, and instead move on the next.

In other ways I have gotten less discerning. Two ideas stand out, one being the pairing focus of the story, as now I will branch further out from what I initially liked, probably because I identify less with any given character so the pairing doesn't have to center on them. The other is an acceptance of lower quality mechanical elements of the story, such as spelling and grammar, up to a point. The content of the story has become more important than the periodic use of an incorrect verb tense.

** Almost everything has changed. I started out fascinated by dark!Harry fics where every character the author didn't like was bashed into oblivion. Most of them were Harry/Hermione, which has also changed completely, as Hermione is a character I'm not particularly fond of nowadays.

I think the biggest determining factor that changed over time, apart from my ability to recognize quality writing, would have to be my choice of setting. I severely struggle to read fics set in Hogwarts these days; they all read like the same thing, and I have a hard time getting interested in them. Because of that I tend to prefer fics that, whether post-war or contemporaneous to canon, take place elsewhere.

I also made complete flips in my opinion of certain characters, primarily Dumbledore, who is now my favourite, as well as Snape and Draco, who are firmly in the dislike category where they belong.

I'll still give almost any fic a chance, though. It's kind of hypocritical of me, but even after talking about learning to recognize quality writing, I still get the days where I just want to lie down and read a nonsense soul-bond fic.

** Well, I've only been into it for about half a year, but in the beginning I prefered "lost moments" kind of fics, like /Not from others/ and post-war canon fics, and then I moved on to time travel fics, but now I prefer AUs (those that go off a tangent at a certain point) invovling some of the following characters: Sirius Black, Narcissa Malfoy (like in The Merging), N. Tonks (girlfriend, mentor, "big sister", whatever) and Remus Lupin.

I've still got a weakness for the "Marauder's Era" time travels though, as long as it's not Harry going back and calling the teenagers Lily Evans and James Potter "mum" and "dad". Turning of the Sun, where he's a Ravenclaw in the year above them (and Dumbledore's a really cool bloke), whose best friends are Xeno Lovegood and other Ravenclaws, as well as Frank Longbottom, Edgar Bones and ... Bellatrix Black (I don't think even the author predicted that one), is my favourite at the moment. And I enjoy A Mishap and an Opportunity too, where it's him (a 'partial' metamorph this time) and "his twin sister Jocelyn" (Tonks) who are going back (131k words in and no one's the wiser about their identities).

As for ships, my preferences have gone from Harry/Ginny to Harry/Tonks. Ginny's still a better match than Hermione though, at least towards the end of book 6, after the sectumsemprea incident.

** I started reading fanfiction in the summer of 2005. Originally I was there for smut under 10k words and tended to read stuff based on live action Disney shows.

These days, I tend to set my minimum word count at 100k and search by characters I hope are interesting, usually based entirely on separate or at least lush canon. If i try to read short things, what I seem to find are a great premise that started well and died in the summer after book one; it is just so infuriating to have your engagement and time investment squandered!

I have noticed that my amount of time reading fanfiction and number of quality friends are inversely proportional. Cutting off friends due to substance abuse problems has really stepped up my reading with no signs of slowing.

** I used to like fics where everyone lived happily ever after. But as I grew older and started writing my own short stories and began attempting a novel(Still in Progress), I discovered that I have a penchant for quite downtrodden endings, or even just realistic endings based upon events. So fics where after 7 years of war, trauma at school, many years of an at least negligent if not outright abusive family, Harry just wants to escape, or has a total mental breakdown that's great it's realistic, and a bit depressing, cause you now what, life often is depressing, it's how we deal with it that makes the happy moments. If Harry and Co. deal with their issues like adults than that's even better.

It's one of the things I've actually come to dislike about canon, very few of the things that Harry has occur to him affect him on a deep emotional or mental level, 10 years of negligence bordering on abuse, nah it's cool I got friends now, oh shit a teacher died cause of me, not gonna be erased by one platitude from Dumbledore. It goes on like this throughout Harry's time at Hogwarts and there's some mental backlash in Order of the Pheonix over Cedric's death, and then again over Sirius' death, but not to the level it should be.

** I'm with you I have been reading since 2008 and have found that my taste in fanfiction stories has changed a lot. When I first started reading like you I was rebellious but I was also dealing with depression so many of the fics I read had themes of depression.

As I have grown older and become more mature I think my taste has changed as well. I now love fics where Harry finds family or goes back and is a father figure. I think age is a factor in the way that most people mature as they get older and find their tastes changing.

** When I was new I was naive. Soul Bonds, Lord Potter, I'd read it and most likely like it. My favorite pairing was Harry/Hermione (still is, but more on that later). Nowadays, I'm more selective. No soul bonds, marriage laws can be done well (but usually are not), and maybe it's just me but if I have a Lord Potter fic, I'd love to see a Harry who really has to deal with the mess that is politics. I don't necessarily beleive he should have the full rights as a lord/member of the Wizengamot/what have you, but still. Legal age of 17, so I don't think him getting involved at 16 is that unheard of.

On pairings. I'm not as hardcore Harry/Hermione as I once was (Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne can be fun too). I guess I'm looking for fics that are more in depth. A bit more adult, if you will.

** It has and... it hasn't.

I was into fanfiction before HP was even published in the states. (Yay reading geocities fanfic sites on dialup - fun times!)

My tastes have changed in that I like different kinds of stories now than I did when I was younger. I don't read as much drama or angst stories these days. Today my preference is more for humor with a little bit of romance, with a healthy dose of adventure as well.

But I still go back and read some of those old stories. My current ffdotnet account dates back to 2002 (though I had one before that that got hacked and I lost it). I still have stories favorited from that time 14 years ago. I even still reread them once in a while.

Some of the old ones have held up, some haven't. I try not to reread the abandoned ones that were good because I just get disappointed that they were never finished. I don't delete them though because, well, I /did/ enjoy them at one point and they've even given me ideas for my own fanfics.

I certainly come and go from different fandoms with my reading preferences. I usually come back around to a core half dozen or so (of which HP is a member), but I branch out into quite a few. After nearly 700 favs on ffdotnet, I have quite the collection built up!

*** Sounds like we have similar fic backgrounds! Cut my teeth on all kinds of geocities and ff.net trash in the early 00's (Digimon Forever lol). Wouldn't read anything diverging from show's canon or my OTP. Once HP got ahold of me my interests remained similar although I never developed an OTP and I think that lack helped me branch out into other pairings and non-canon. I know what you mean about keeping old stuff for the sake of it. Sometimes I peek at my original ff.net account and cringe at the stuff I put up and favorited haha.

**** Probably! I'm a 90s kid through and through. I've still got copies of fanfics saved on /floppies/ so that I could read them offline.

I prefer canon pairings but will read others, and I've never been /too/ picky, but there are certain genre's I don't like that I've always stayed away from. Never been a fan of horror for example.

I started off with Sailor Moon fanfiction, then DBZ, and then other shows. Once I started reading HP I was all for fanfics of it.

I'm still using my second ffdotnet account (like I said, lost the first) and though I cringe at some of the fics I still have fav'd, I like to keep them as kind of a memory of where I was and where I am. I know it sounds silly, and some of my old favs may be lost forever, but I think it's good to go back and look at them now and then.

I think fanfiction is part of the reason I ended up with the degree I did, though I've always loved reading even before I found fanfics.

** I started reading fanfiction when I was 12, which is 12-13 years ago. I would sort by pairing and then browse through all 40 pages of hermione/Draco on ff.net and read through every summary and click anything that was remotely interesting. There was no sort by reviews and i read sooo many bad stories lol.. The first story I ever followed was linkffn(parenting class by icypanther) and I used to wake up early every Monday or whatever before school to read her update. She was always always on time with her weekly update lol!

Then I started getting into Harry/Draco in high school and reading more rated M stuff because a lot of my friends were into Yaoi. And I guess due to teen angst I became drawn to really dramatic fics where Harry is traumatized and I stopped reading fics with pairings and only read Harry abuse .... And when I became less angsty I focused on friendship or family themed fics which led to time travel and AUs so Harry could meet his parents ... Which led to getting interested in political fics and crossovers.... And then master of death fics since MoD!Harry is featured in a lot of crossovers ...

In the beginning, I read basically any fic with any plot but now I like to read canon-compliant fics or EWE out of loyalty to the books I guess. I also used to read character bashing but I can't read that anymore and love to see a close knit trio. And I don't like to read romance unless the characters are of age. I can deal with poor writing and love cliches though, hehe

** When I started reading fanfics I was very particular to the type of fic I read. It was almost all straight laced Harry/Ginny. It was a very formulaic, and frankly, a very boring taste. That must have been about 4 or 5 years ago. By that point I had read the Harry Potter dozens of times each. I was reluctant to see the status quo change much, if at all. I didn't want to read something new, I wanted to read Harry Potter. About a year after that I got /really/ into the MLP Fandom. For me a new Fandom means a chance to delve into new fanfiction. The way MLP fanfics worked was so radically different to Harry Potter, due to what the source material is. One is a book series with a set overarching plot. 99% of Harry Potter is variations on a theme: killing Voldemort while Harry goes through Hogwarts. The difference is interpretations of character. An author would start with, "If I change Harry to be this, then..." My Little Pony was rather different. It is an episodic kids show that often plays with a variety of styles and plots. Characters in MLP fanfics are pretty static throughout the entire Fandom. Their personalities rarely change from the outset of the fic. Therefore MLP was less about different variations of characters going through the same plot, it was rather the same characters going through different plots. The pure /variety/ of bad guys, conflicts, and settings are something I've never seen in any other Fandom. I now once again almost exclusively read Harry Potter fanfics, but the desire changed. I crave both setting changes and character changes, but paradoxically I love the structure of HP fanfics. I know that the end result of almost every fanfic is going to be, Harry defeats Voldemort and gets the the girl (or Draco). I want to know the journey, I want to know who's taking that journey, and what motivates them. Above all I want to read something I've never read before. Even if the whole thing stinks of cliche if just one element is new, then I'm happy.

** When I first started reading Harry Potter fanfiction, some 7 years ago, I loved canon compliant, clearly based from the books fanfiction, preferably focusing on Hinny or not showing the romance at all. (I never could stand Romione)

Then after six months or so, I got sucked into different stories that didn't so obviously play to the canon, as that is very stifling to ones creative sense. I reread the books during this period, and began to see things from a Harmony point of view, because as a kid, I had always figured Hermione and Harry would get together (and reading the sixth book, I had thought this would happen when it showed Ron and Lavender acting like their only source of oxygen was each other's mouths), and in the earlier books it could have so easily gone either way.

Which, rather unfortunately lead to my love of bashing fics, as they were the ones that tended to mainly be Harmony, and focus on those two, rather than canon pairings. They remain my guilty pleasure, and I can't help but love a good bash fic every now and again.

Which leads to my newer tastes in the fandom, mainly crossovers, crossovers, and more crossovers. The Girl Who Loved, is one of my absolute favorites, but the story that really lead to my love of Harry Potter crossovers, was some RWBY/HP crossover that wasn't particularly well written, and was Harry/Yang/Blake, it was bad, but it opened up the world of crossover, and from thereon in, I was hooked.

Crossovers are still my favorite genre of HP fanfiction, but I also love fix it, redo, or time travel stories, especially ones where Sirius lives, if nothing else, and my Harry ship still tends to be Harmony, but I am leaning more towards just crack ships, or Harry x girl from whatever it's crossed with. (HARRY X USAGI 4LYFE)

I cannot stand slash though, and I'm bi. It's weird, I just hate it to the point it has ruined otherwise perfectly good stories, except the slash destroys it.

I guess too many of them are just "Oh by the way, Harry is gay, oh by the way, Harry is gay, oh by the way, Harry is gay" or they just destroy Harry's character and make him submissive or overly dominant, and just generally don't know how a gay relationship works. (HINT HINT IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS A STRAIGHT ONE WITH DOUBLE THE PENISES!)

Oh dear lord, this isn't a comment, it's become an essay, with a writing style stolen from Rex Harrison.

** I don't like things that are super dark and violent. I used to be ok with sad endings. Not anymore.

Of course, I never got to really read fanfic as a kid or teen. But I played a number of imagination games involving fictional characters, so I think that counts.

As an adult, I like complicated characters who all think they're the main character of their story. Even villains have to have a good motivation for their actions.

Any story that is basically just a soap opera bores the hell out of me.

** I've been reading HP fanfiction almost continuously since I was 12, and I'm 26 now. My taste in humor has changed of course (the parody fic my flair is from used to be my absolute favorite, now it barely gets a chuckle but I just like the nostalgia), and I rarely read comedy fics anymore. I've always liked reading about Tom Riddle, but in the last couple years I've been focusing more on Harry after always ignoring him. I've also gotten less forgiving of things like casual sexism in fics and lack of characterization.

Unfortunately, it feels like I've read all the good ones, so the only thing left now is to write some, while halfheartedly exploring in new directions...

I doubt Harry could have been the heir to Gryffindor and as far as the Peverrel line, well according to JK, every wizard is related if you go far back enough. But there is something interesting to me about a Powerful MC, if done right the fic can be really good, yet there are only a handful of fics that do so.

I like extreme AUs, crossovers, OCs, short fics, and crackfics more than I used to. Part of this is probably because they tend to be more inventive than /Canon Rehash No. 9286/.

Bashing and senseless OOC is a good way to get me to stop reading. Same goes for cutesy author's notes that have more plot than the story or aren't otherwise treated as footnotes or update notes.
