The low cost of a wand (7 galleons for Harry's) has been a noted flaw in canon. Assuming that Ollivander sells 50-60 wands based on Hogwarts class size for a year plus a few extras, he simply would not earn enough. Seven galleons may not even be enough to cover the cost of materials, let alone the cost of labor, time and expertise. And he has competition too.

Fanon had usually solved this by raising the cost of wands, having the Ministry subsidise first wands or by having wandmakers sell other stuff along with wands.

What would you think about a world where young witches and wizards are expected to craft their own wands sometime during their school years? Because, say, the best results will only be obtained by wands crafted by their own hands and it also is a sign of a capable witch/wizard?

They would buy suitable wands from shops that they would use till they craft their own. Older wizarding families would have their children reuse the suitable wands of dead family members and so on.


** I had written a few paragraphs comparing prices and explaining my headcanon of JKRs mistakes (I'm a firm believer that the Knight Bus was meant to cost 11 knuts) then just before posting I saw this marked as Request, not Discussion.

****** Understandable that you see it that way, considering most authors don't go beyond wands or explore magic in general very much at all.

But to think that some primal supernatural force that you are literally born with can only be used by speaking a dead language and waving a wooden stick is, again, just so dreadfully dull, so limited in imagination.

Now that I think of it, I'd really love the see elements of Avatar incorporated somewhere; like a wizard can train to wandlessly create and control elements, and become progressively better at it. That'd be really fucking badass!

******* I think I'd like to read something where wands are used for things that need more control then power. Wands can shape the magic for things like transfiguration or maybe alchemy, which in my mind are more focused on control then power. I've always viewed wands as like a sword for instance. You can kill someone with your bare hands and you can kill someone with a sword. One is better at it than the other. But a sword isn't needed. Or another way to look at it would be wandless magic is a hiltless sword. You can use a sword holding the blade but you're liable to hurt yourself and have less control.

******** I think linkffn(Denarian Renegade) had a similar distinction between "true" magic (evocation) and the magic of wizards with wands. It was explained pretty similar to what you're saying.

Except it wasn't "wandless" and "wand", it was literally two different types of power, although the evocation magic was described as lacking in finesse, but having much more power.

There were actually 3 books - Denarian Renegade, Denarian Knight, and fuck me, I forget the last one.

But sadly, I'm not quite sure it ever played that big a role, but I haven't read those in a while. And the final book really left me wanting more, felt like there were some unfinished things.

It's an old one and you can feel its age. It starts with some terrible tropes but it's fun if you can get past that. I'm not sure if he builds his wand in this one or its sequel though.

It's a trilogy however the third part is abandoned.
