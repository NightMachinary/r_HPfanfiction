I'm going to rant, sorry if it upsets anyone.

I've been reading a story by this Author on Fanfiction.net... she's not a Romione shipper writer. In any case a few days ago she published a new story inspired by Adele's /Rumour Has It/... with Ron thinking Hermione cheated on him but it turns out Ron's the one who cheated.

In any case, she's been getting a lot of flack and negative reviews on the story because it's "Ron bashing" (even though it really doesn't seem like bashing to me...).

The majority of people who are leaving negative reviews are people who keep repeating "J.K. Rowling is law. No stories outside of canon should be written" blah, blah, blah.

I know some of you may agree, and that is perfectly fine. I'm not a Romione shipper, and yes written some Ron Bashings myself (I believe... it's been a while)... however FanFiction is just that. FAN. Fiction. The reviewers are telling the author that she's not a true Harry Potter fan because she doesn't ship Romione. Every Harry Potter fan adores Jo. We do. We love her, and she is Queen... however we all have different opinions on how the books could have gone, and Fanfiction lets us get those opinions out. Flaming a story because you don't agree with the pairing is not right. At. All.

Fanfiction in and of itself is AU because it's NOT being written by J.K. Rowling. I believe Jo has said somewhere that she loves that fans write fanfiction about the Harry Potter world because it means they love it that much more.

Those of us who don't like a certain Canon pairing accept that that is how it is in the books, and officially that is how it will stay. It won't change. But in our AU universe we can write and read ANYTHING we want because it's AU. It's not supposed to be like reading a book... if you want to read something like the book, then just read the damn book!

Okay, my rant is done. Everyone have a nice day.

(I'm sorry this just really got on my nerves... link to reviews-and the story- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/r/8367146/]])


** I definitely agree with all that you've said. Personally, I've never even read a Romione fanfiction, all of my ships, including my OTP are non-canon. It's just sad when people go out of their way to flame a story because of who is in a relationship with who. It also sucks because I took a look at the story mentioned and the author does clearly state that Ron is shown in a negative light, so why do people bother to read the story and then flame it if that point is made clear? They should just leave it alone. And some of the reviews are just awful and totally unacceptable. It's worse than just leaving a rude remark about the story, some people take it too far.

** I agree that some people were ridiculous, but some people had valid points. It was very poorly written. The only reason she wrote this is to justify Hermione and Lupin getting together.

** Rant accepted for what it is, but if flames bother you, why not do your reading at a site like HPFF or Sugarquill, where the moderating is more assertive?

FF.net is like the YouTube of the fan fic scene. At least once a month, an author I know from another site has to complain to FF.net because somebody plagiarized their work and posted it there.

*** I've tried HPFF but have never heard of Sugarquill... i'll check it out though.

I use FFN because of how many stories there are, not to mention I like the filter system, and it's easier to read on my phone.

Flames bother me period, due to the fact that they really aren't necessary. If you don't like it, don't read it. If you read something you're not going to like, that's your own fault.

Plagiarizing happens to everyone, even FFN authors,

By that logic, there shouldn't be any fanfiction at all.

I feel your pain. I love Harry-centric stories no matter who he's paired with. I don't know who are worse - the Draco/Hermione people who hate on the Harry/Hermione authors or the ones who hate on the Harry/Draco writers.

For a fandom centered on a series of books whose basic premise is love, there certainly is a lot of bitching about who should romance who!

*** Exactly! I find it really weird when people have AU in the summary... it's fanfiction, unless you're copying the book word-for-word it's AU, do you really have to classify it as such?

I personally am not a fan of Harry/Draco (or any story where Hermione isn't THE main character... there's just so much you can do with her...) but that doesn't mean I hate it... it's just not my thing just like Hermione/Snape or Hermione/Tom Riddle Jr are/is not a lot of other peoples' thing... and that's fine.

And I personally think that Harry/Hermione is MUCH better than Ron/Hermione... Harry and Hermione seem to "click" more...

In a world based on love, why is there so much hate?

**** Well, I've always interpreted the term AU to mean that the fic takes place in a setting that is fundamentally different from J.K. Rowling's canon world in some way. Maybe Harry's parents survived, or Lily chose Snape over James, or maybe McGonagall came to Privet Drive instead of Hagrid, or there's an OC defense teacher fifth year, or whatever. Large or small, there must be some event that contradicts canon.

On the other hand, non-AU fics happen in the canon universe. The events in canon are treated as truth, perhaps in the future or the past of the fic's setting, or perhaps it is the same events being told from another character's perspective. A canon fic fills in details without rewriting "history", as defined by JKR.

I don't mean to be pedantic (or a hater!), but I don't think you can say that there is no such thing as a fic that is not AU.

Personally, I appreciate it being in the summary of a fic, assuming the author is using the term properly.

** 1) Flaming happens on both sides of the pool, not just on non-canon fics.

2) The people that leave negative reviews based on pairing are either morons or trolls, and they will continue to flame fics no matter how much 'ranting' you do.

So, /basically/... pointless thread is pointless.

P.S. - There are only 2 pages of reviews, 50% of which are good. I wouldn't call that 'a lot of flack'.

P.P.S - This is a one-shot with less than 1000 words. No one cares about one-shots.

** As an author who has been flamed on multiple occasions because stupid people don't get that it's fan fiction, I thank you for doing this.
