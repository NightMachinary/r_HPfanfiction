** Parts of my story "Patron" take place in Magical France, Bulgaria, the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire, and Scandinavia, with a focus on the different cultures. Though the main part is set in Britain.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** My Darkness!Harry story takes place in GB for the seven years of Hogwarts but then goes global then interstellar after 1998 but it's still pre-hogwarts at the moment.

There're quite a few Crossovers that expand on where the stories take place.
