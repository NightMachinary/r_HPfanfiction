I got bored and decided to try my hand at a hp fanfic to get my creative juices flowing for my other stuff. This is basically the first chapter of the first book, but on the idea that voldermort chose Neville Longbottom as his nemesis instead of Harry. Enjoy.

Harry potter

Chapter one.

Mr. And Mrs. Potter, of number four privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they had worked very hard on creating that facade.

Mr. Potter worked for his sister in law's husband, Mr Dursley, at a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. Mr Dursley was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mr Dursley didn't much like his brother in law, and had made it quite clear on numerous occasions that he was only doing his wife a favour in hiring him. Mr Potter on his half, agreed, but tried his best to emulate Mr Dursley in an attempt to fit in.

While Mr. Potter toiled away at Grunnings, Mrs. Potter worked hard on been perceived as the perfect housewife. After spending an exhausting amount of time cleaning she would than spend the afternoon entertaining her sister, who would spend most her time criticising the cleanliness. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. Mrs. Dursley also liked to regularly point out that the Potters wouldn't even be able to live at number four Privet Drive if it was not for them graciously letting them rent it cheaply from them. Although Mrs. Potter knew that the ‘cheap' rent the Dursley's charged them was in fact more expensive than any other rents in the surrounding area, she kept quiet. She had to fit in.

The Dursley's had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. In the Potters opinion, Dudley was a spoiled brat who paled in comparison to their own well behaved son, Harry. The Dursleys would often complain about the bad influence of Harry on Dudley but they would still bring him over and force the large boy to play with his cousin.

Even with all the hassle from the Dursley's, the Potters had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out they were actually wizards and were in hiding in the muggle world.

When Mr. And Mrs. Potter woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that their secret would soon come to light. Mr. Potter hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, something he knew Mr. Dursley would appreaciate, while Mrs. Potter wrestled a grumpy Harry into his high chair.

It was only Harry who noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window, who pointed and bumbled something incoherent. At half past eight, Mr Potter picked up his briefcase, pecked his wife on the cheek and tried to kiss Harry, who dodged it. “Excellent reflexes.” laughed Mr. Potter as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number fours drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something perculiar --a cat reading a map. For a second his heart stopped, he craned around in his seat to get a better look. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, a small map laid out before her.

Mr Potter knew this cat, realising if she was here than something was wrong. He turned his car around and quickly made his way back home. His heart was racing, had their cover been blown? His first thought was to grab Lilly and Harry and make a quick getaway. As he jumped out the car he thrust his hand into his suit, in a hidden pocket inside he withdrew his wand. An eleven inch mahogany wand with a dragon heart string core engraved with spider webs. Mr. Potter burst through the front door eliciting a gasp from Lilly, who was busy feeding a surprised Harry.

“James?” she asked worriedly.

“Grab Harry, we need to get to the portal key, now!”

Quickly reaching into the kitchen draw Lilly pulled out her ten and three-quarter inch wand made of willow. Moving faster than what was healthy, snatched young Harry out of his high chair making him cry. She clutched him close, her wand up and at ready.

James raced into the living room, quickly followed by Lilly and the still crying Harry, who was now wiggling around in her arms, both had wands at the ready. James flung open the doors on the small cabinet that the television rested on then stepped back in surprise. The small cabinet was supposed to be empty; nothing in it except the small blue vase they had enchanted to be a portal key, their quick escape. Instead they found, toys, specifically Dudley's action figures. No sign of the vase.

“That little bastard!”

“James!” Lilly gasped in surprise as she tried to shield Harry from the bad language.

James was about to apologize when there was a sharp nock at the door. They froze. Lilly's eyes were wide, without the portal key there was no way out. The sharp nock came again, this time it was more forceful. Cautiously, with his wand held out in front of him James made his way out of the living room and towards the front door. Never before had he been afraid of his own front door but now it seemed to loom in front of him all foreboding. Lilly edged out behind him, Harry still struggled in her arms, he was now trying to reach for the wand he held at arm's length, pointing towards the door.

“Lilly,” James didn't even have to ask, they were a well oiled machine.

“Alohomora.” She whispered and flicked her wrist. James poised to strike. The door swung open revealing a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses and a long emerald cloak. Her hair was drawn into a tight bun. She held both her hands up to show she was unarmed.

“Professor McGonagall, I thought that was you I saw reading that map.” James said, he didn't lower his wand.

“I had to, these muggle streets all look the same.” She said curtly.

“Why are you here?” Lilly asked from behind James.

“I don't suppose you heard the news yet? I know owls were sent out, but I am aware that there is an issue with some getting lost along the way.”

“What news?” James asked suspiciously. He still hadn't lowered his wand, with his only son in the house; he just couldn't take that chance.

“He-who-must-not-be-named is dead.” Than McGonagall did something that both surprised and disturbed him. She smiled. There was a small silence before Lilly piped up.

“How?” that really was the biggest question, how had the most powerful evil wizard the wizarding world had ever seen, the one that currently had them hiding out in the muggle world, been defeated and by whom?

“May I come in?” McGonagall asked.

Nodding slowly, James motioned for her to come in, refusing to lower his wand or put his back to her he motioned for her to head into the living room, there was still a chance she could be under the imperius curse and this could be a trap.

McGonagall, sat on the edge of the green leather sofa as Lilly, with Harry in her arms, sat on the chair just off to the side, James stayed standing, mostly occupying the space between McGonagall and Lilly, his wand was no longer pointing directly at her but he still grasped it tightly.

McGonagall sat and patiently told the story of what had happened to He-who-must-not-be-named. Apparently in the early hours of the morning, He-who-must-not-be-named had made his way to Frank and Alice Longbottoms home, were he had met his overdue end.

“Frank and Alice killed them?” James, couldn't believe what he was hearing. He knew the Longbottoms from their time in the order of the phoenix, the task force that was assembled to fight He-who-must-not-be-named. Both been authors, they liked to chronicle the stories of its members, they were both very competent wizards and good fighters, but James couldn't get his head around the fact they had bested Voldermort.

“No, Frank and Alice sadly passed away. It was their son Neville that killed him.” McGonagall let the statement hang in the air. Lilly and James both looked at each other confused, Neville was the same age as Harry, how did a toddler kill the most powerful dark wizard in the world?

“How?”

“According to Dumbledore, it was old magic. As He-who-must-not-be-named used the killing curse on the boy, his mother Alice dived in the way taking most the blow and imparting some type of protection on the boy that not only saved him but somehow fired the main force of the curse back onto him, killing him instantly.” Lilly sat, dumfounded, it was the act of a mothers love had destroyed him. She knew deep down that she would have done the same to protect her precious boy.

“Neville survived?”

“Yes, though he is left with a small scar on his forehead.”

“That poor boy,” Lilly hugged Harry closer; the thought of losing him was too much. “What will happen to him?”

“Dumbledore is taking him to his grandparents, though how he will grow up handling his new found fame, well, who knows what will become of the lad.”

“So that's it? That's the end of it? We can come out of hiding?” James was suddenly planning the future, planning on moving back to the wizarding world, he could finally stop pretending to be a muggle.

“About that...” McGonagall tried not to meet James gaze. “He-who-must-not-be-named may be gone but his followers are still out there and some of them would love to get their hands on anyone from the order, especially the Potters.”

“So what are you saying?” James was getting that sinking feeling.

“Dumbledore believes staying where you are until his followers are rounded up would be the best thing for you and,” McGonagall looked at Harry, he was still fascinated with the wand in Lilly's hand. “Your family.”

James knew she was right. He knew it and he didn't like it. That moment of freedom was snatched away as he was tied down with his muggle chains.

“Great.” He said glumly.

“I'm sure it won't be for long.” Lilly said, as she gave James a small smile.

“Yeah. It doesn't matter anyway, as long as I'm with you and Harry I'm happy.” James sat on the arm of the chair and put his arm around his wife.

“Well I must be going, the whole wizarding world is celebrating and I have a party to go to. I'm sure Dumbledore will be in touch soon, look out for his owl.” McGonagall stood up, James and Lilly walked her to the front door.

“It really has been a pleasure seeing you both, out of all the people I have met, I'm glad nothing bad happened to you.” McGonagall said as she paused at the door. James smiled.

“You too.”

“And, I guess I'll be seeing you soon.” She motioned to Harry. “If he's anything like his father, you will have your hands full.” Lilly said with a smile.

After McGonagall had finish saying her goodbyes she disappeared into thin air with a slight pop. Not sure what to do now, James shut the front door.

“What now?” James asked Lilly as he turned around and rested against the door. He just couldn't believe Voldermort was dead. Before she could speak, the house was filled with the shrieking sound of a ringing telephone. Heaving a heavy sigh he walked over to the small table in the hall that the phone sat on and picked it up. He would be glad when he didn't have one of these anymore.

On the other end of the phone was Mr. Dursley, he was swearing blindly up and down about James not turning in for work, while also complaining about lots of strange people dressed in cloaks happily roaming the streets. James sighed again.

After a twenty minute conversation with his brother-in law, most spent trying to convince him that he was in fact very ill and couldn't come in, James headed into the garden, leaving Lilly in the living room playing with Harry. He needed a bit of alone time to de-stress, god how he wanted to turn Mr. Dursley into a pig. Not for ever of course, just for an hour or two. He hated this, this wasn't the way it was supposed to go, after Voldermort was dead, they was supposed to go back to their normal lifes, not get stuck pretending to be muggles.

It was here in the back garden, while he was sat on the step of the backdoor, that the large tawny owl that had flew passed the window earlier in the morning hopped up to James. In its beak was a rolled up parchment, taking it from the owl he thanked it. With barely a glance the owl opened it's wings and flew off.

James unrolled the parchment, ‘Voldermort is dead. Party at yours?' it was signed, 'the Marauders'. James leaned back and called into the house.

“Honey, I think we have some guests coming over!” James smiled to himself, they hadn't all been together for a very long time. Tonight was a night to party, tomorrow, he could start planning his escape from muggledom.

**** I'd have to know more about the plot... but how about Muggle Masquerade? If the point is Harry growing up with his family pretending to be muggles, that might work!
