:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This fic takes place during fifth year, Hermione is already in a relationship with Harry. Her facial features start to change and she gets darker hair. She then finds out that she is Voldemort's and Bellatrix's daughter, but everyone else thinks she is Malfoy's daughter and eventually find out otherwise. She is really good at occlumency and legilimency and uses it to manipulate Umbridge into becoming leader of the Inquisitorial Squad. When Umbridge catches the DA and brings everyone to her office, Hermione uses legilimency to possess Ginny and convinces Umbridge to go to the Forbidden Forest. Over the summer, She goes to train with Bellatrix and Voldemort and we learn she has a affinity for fire magic. There was one scene where Hermione demonstrates the blue ring of fire just like the ring of fire created by Grindelwald at the end of “Crimes of Grindelwald.” Later in the story, death eaters attack the Burrow with fiendfyre but Hermione takes control the fiendfyre and burns the death eaters instead. Thanks!
