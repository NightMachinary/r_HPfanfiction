What a fantastic read. Zombie Apocalypse meets Harry Potter with a blend of politics, murder and scandal. I was honestly blown away with how much I enjoyed this and am currently floating in post-read bliss. Cannot recommend this enough.

** It's a very well-written fic, probably one of the best in fandom. I almost feel bad for not enjoying it all that much. I guess zombie apocalypse just isn't my thing.

*** I suppose it's not exactly a standard crossover xD But I definitely agree with what you said about the standard of writing!

** Only issue I have is that there never really felt like there was a sense of urgency, or impending doom due to the zombies. Sure, there were brief moments where there was a death or whatever, but I felt like the actual zombie stuff took a back seat to everything else, except that the "everything else" was kind of boring political stuff that didn't really feel like it belonged in that type of story.

*** Yeah I do agree that the focus does switch away, but the switch of focus is dealt with in the plot. In hindsight though, I think a better summary for it would be: 'Wizarding world reacts to Apocalypse' rather than a direct zombie/harry potter mashup as you are right- describing it like that might misdirect the reader's expectations.
