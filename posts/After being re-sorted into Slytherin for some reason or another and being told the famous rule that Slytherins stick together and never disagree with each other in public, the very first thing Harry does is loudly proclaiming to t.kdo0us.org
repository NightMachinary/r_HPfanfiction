******* Probably? Draco was probably learning as he went and we really don't get much of a notion about how is the technical knowledge of the characters since it would be extremely boring having to waddle though oceans of notes in magical theory between nanoscoptical islands of plot. Botton line is that if Draco was capable of it and there was no mention of him being particularly gifted in it then chances are that his year-mates would have pretty much the same theoretical background.

And actually an argument could be made about Harry and Ron being able to do it faster based on nothing other than a lighter workload (even more so if Harry decides to do what Hermione accused him of and use the HBP book to pass potions without putting any true effort on it).

*** And thus the Malfoy had proved his worth, and his role. The Slytherin students present nodded along, though only as much as needed. They didn't speak much, nor did they provide clarification. Instead, they lounged in the shadow of Draco Malfoy, who had just drawn all the attention to himself - and away from them.

It would be puzzling, normally, how a house named Bad Faith rose to prominence and had not,in all its existence tried to change that appellation.

The reason for both would be pretty simple. Each house of Albion provided a good of service which, while not fully monopolized, no one could compete with. It could be reagents, harvested from magical creature farms. It could be potions. It could be enchanted objects if some kind.

The Malfoys provided the image. They played the same role as the Slytherin family used to. They looked guilty as sin, and yet avoided any punishment. Whenever there would be a disputed bill, they would support it. Whenever there would be a novel.idea that threatened status quo, they would drive it to.the ground.

In doing so, they would provide the other families with protection. After all, the Wizarding World had already found their villain.

AKA, Malfoys are professional scapegoats :P

Fex.: Draco was actually looking to mend bridges with the Weasley family by dating Ron, so he did it by showing how much of a catch he really was and how much Ron stood to gain by flaunting his wealthy in comparison with Ron, remarked about Ron's father low political capital while his father could get away with pretty much anything, talked about how he had a connection to Voldemort's side of the war (so as to either be a spy or to protect him) and tried to show how he walked in a more financially and politically more powerful circle of friends by insulting Ron's (since he could find nothing truly good to say about Crabbe or Goyle).
