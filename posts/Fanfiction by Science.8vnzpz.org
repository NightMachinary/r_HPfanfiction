So as to not bias responses, please complete the stickied survey before reading. And remember, if any part of this is bad, it's y'all's fault for voting for it. (Symmetrically, I will be more than happy to award the sub credit for any parts that happen to be good.)

--------------

"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."

"What do you mean, 'better'?" Harry asked.

"There's a politically powerful magical nobility," Draco said matter-of-factly. "This means that wizards who are part of the nobility are better than others."

"Huh. I guess I must be set to inherit significant magical power if you want to be my friend so badly."

"I wouldn't say /significant/ political power. However, when you vanquished the Dark Lord, you formed a soul bond with every witch whose parents he killed."

Harry blanched causing Draco to burst out laughing.

"Just kidding! There's no such thing at romantic soul bonds. Not in reality, anyway, just in trashy romance novels. A word of warning, though. Some witches might try to convince you that you have a marriage contract with them. Don't listen. For you to be part of a contract, you have to assented to it. You can't be bound by a contract you haven't agreed to; not only is that contracts 101, it's chapter 1 in contracts 101"

"So, for instance, if there were to be a dangerous tournament, and someone else entered my name, since I never promised to compete in said tournament, I categorically could not be part of a magically-binding contract."

"Exactly! In fact, in such a situation, you should be extremely suspicious of anyone who tells you that you had entered a magically-binding contract. In fact, such a person is likely to have been the one to enter you."

--------------

Despite having only inherited a lesser noble title, in the few months Harry had been at Hogwarts, he'd learned that there were other ways to power: after all, Dumbledore had immense power despite no noble name. Harry was doing quite well along that front. A contingent, lead by Ernie McMillan, was now convinced the reason Voldemort had targeted Harry was to take out the competition preemptively. That, however, would not dampen Harry's enjoyment of the Halloween feast.

(Feast comes from the Latin festa, meaning holiday; wizards celebrate Halloween as a formal holiday because they observe a pagan calendar.)

"There's a troll downstairs!" +Professor Quirrell+ Tom said lowly.

There was only a split second for commotion before several firecrackers from Dumbledore silenced the room.

"Prefects will guide students back to their dormitories. Staff will join me on a troll hunt."

On the way back to the common room, Ron grabbed Harry's sleeve. "Hermione doesn't know about the troll!"

Harry glanced at Percy disdainfully. Years of abuse and authority failing to help had taken their toll. Harry had no faith in the rules-loving Percy to effectively find Hermione and guide her to safety, especially when time was of the essence. Instead, he grabbed Fred and George and pulled them into an empty classroom they were passing.

"You two have an uncanny ability to figure out where people are. I'm not going to ask you to give away any secrets, but Hermione doesn't know about the troll and we can't spare the time to search for her."

Fred and George exchanged serious glances, turned their backs, pulled something out and a few muttered words later, Harry knew exactly where he needed to go.

"We're getting this place some real health and safety measures" he muttered to himself, pulling on the cloak. "When I'm done here, I'm going to rally the noble houses." Malfoy, whose father was head of the board of governors, would be an easy target; Dumbledore had sent Slytherin right at the troll. Muggles had figured this stuff out ages ago; it spoke to the pervasive pureblood culture that the muggleborns hadn't managed to push through commonsense regulations that would keeps trolls out.

--------------

"...And when the troll tried to get a rise out of me (inspired by the levitation charm Ron had used), /I didn't reply/, and it vanished!" Sometimes, Harry really loved magic.

"Blimely. Weren't you afraid you were going to run out magic?" Colin Creevey, who started Hogwarts a year earlier so I'd have a muggleborn who could ask this question and plausibly not already know the answer.

"Wizards cannot run out of magic," said Hermione. "I read it in /Hogwarts: a History/." Everybody respected her as the best-read (if not most magically genius) member of the house; despite being backwards in many ways, the wizarding world at least didn't have strictly-enforced gender roles.

(I usually don't write fanfiction because I suck at characterisation, so "I read it in /Hogwards: a History/" is as close to "in-canon charecterisations" as you guys are going to get.)

--------------

"There is only power and those too weak to seek it," Tom said energetically/timely.

"Like the philosopher's stone?" Harry asked, tossing it in the air and catching it. "I was wondering: how does it determine where an object begins for purposes of turning it to gold? If I were to try to turned the banana into gold, for instance, would it turn the whole banana into gold, or just the peel?"

"Actually, the turning to gold part is pretty underpowered. Only matter that actually touches the stone gets turned to gold, so you can only turn the surface of an object into gold," Tom said guiltily.

"Huh. In that case, I guess it's not much use to me. You take it," Harry said. He threw the stone at Quirrell, casting a spell at the same time. Quirrell recognized the stone as a distraction and dodged the spell. Unfortunately for him, the spell was the distraction and the stone, accelerated by a nonverbal banishing charm, caved his head in.

"So, what are you going to do next?" Harry asked turning towards the spirit rising from Quirrell's corpse.

"Go to my father's house, possess the gardener," Tom said, deciding to be frank. "After that, I should get a servant to replace this one" Tom said remembering. "But until then, time to take advantage of not being weighed down by flesh," Tom said lightly. He flew away.

"...Something has really messed up his reasoning," said Harry to no one in particular.

--------------

"Voldemort is my past, present, and future," Tom's Alzheimer's said.

--------------

As the robed figures approached Harry, he began to hear screams. A cold, high-pitched voice cut through them.

"Stand aside, you silly girl. Leave!" Tom said dismissively.

"No, not Harry! Take me instead!"

"Avada Kedavra!" Tom cursed.

The curse rebounded on him. "Alas, I am slain!" Tom croaked.

--------------

Hermione, having had little success in getting Gryffindors to join SPEW, was hoping that Hufflepuffs would find the cause more worthy. With all of Hufflepuff united behind Cedric, she'd only need to convince him instead of an entire house. This, however, was proving harder than she'd anticipated.

"I find," Cedric said, "that wizard's do not have a clear and unambiguous moral duty to unilaterally free all the house elves."

--------------

"Two of them? Well, we only need the one; kill the other," Tom said sparingly.

--------------

And when the creature spoke, it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move...

"Kill me now, Dumbledore," said Tom possessively.

--------------

Voldemort was enjoying spinning Charity Burbage around when he heard a munching sound coming from his right-hand woman. "I had wanted the last pumpkin pasty," said Tom belatedly.

--------------

Harry looked around Kings Cross, marveling at how clean it was, before looking back at Dumbledore. "I can appreciate that, on balance, your actions made the wizarding world better off, but I think, in the end, they still made me worse off."

Dumbledore sighed. "I'd like to think that I made the wizarding world better off, but my dear boy, I truly am sorry for the toll it took on you (by a very narrow margin that might reverse depending on future responses.)"

"Future responses?"

"Ah, I shouldn't have said that. Being dead, I'm clairvoyant, but since you've chosen to come back to life, there are some things you are not allowed to know. Obliviate!"

--------------

"Gee golly gosh gloriosky" thought Harry Potter as he stepped into the Head Auror's office. "Here I am, the youngest Head Auror of all time! (Nota bene., to comply with the rules, let it be known that I am past the age of majority across every jurisdiction)" Ginny (also past the age of majority in every relevant jurisdiction) came up to him with census data (medium population; America not a magical utopia.)

"Oh, Head Auror, I love you madly. Will you come to bed with me?"

"Hell yeah!"

"Would you like Draco to join us?" After that fateful night that Dumbledore had died, Malfoy had turned spy for the Order. He and Harry were best buds now.

"Not this time."

"Flawlessly logical. I admire your mind."

And then..... we began to french passively! He was so sexy my body got all hot kind of like an erection only I'm a girl so I didn't get an erection you sicko. (AN: clitoral erections exist and I'm told they are important, although, as a single dude, I couldn't tell you firsthand---but I'm still in school, so maybe we'll cover that in detail at some point) And then... we HAD SEX (c is that dum). I was beginning to have an orgism!

--------------

While Harry's out of the office, Hermione used it to have hot femslash sex with Luna. (Both, obviously, were past the age of majority in every relevant jurisdiction.)

** I love the Cedric line because it is simultaneously something you wouldn't be surprised to find in a badly written fic but at the same time is worded too ridiculously to actually appear in one.

Idk if that makes sense, but whatever top quality crack 10/10
