Also, does anyone know of any stories where Sirius kidnaps Harry,


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]] By MarauderLover 7

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6036153/1/Torn][Torn]] by Neurotica

Both writers are superb and all characters are in-character
