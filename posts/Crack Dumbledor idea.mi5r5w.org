Once out of the hospital wing, after talking to first year Harry, Dumbledor loses his carefully practiced cool and gags at the earwax flavored bean he'd just eaten.

I KNOW IT SAID EVERY FLAVOUR BUT IS THIS SOME KIND OF FUCKING JOKE! I mean err... Alas,... Earwax... sorry Harry, but you can't know about my loss of control. Obliviate"
