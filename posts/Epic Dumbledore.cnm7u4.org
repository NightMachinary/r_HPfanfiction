Like the title says, anyone knows any fic where Dumbledore shows off his strength and intelligence? I'm talking Denarian series levels of badass if possible

PS: Albus or Aberforth I don't mind


** I mean technically linkffn(The One He Feared) is this, though with something of an twist to that though.

Additionally, the snippets of him in linkffn(What You Leave Behind) certainly fit his nonchalant badassness to a tee.

Would also say linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) though you have to make it to ~Chapter 11 for it to really get epic (can you say undead Basilisk anyone?).

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

***** It had all these amazing ideas and as usual was very well written but I think Harry instantly integrating Dumbledore's skills and personality doomed the story from the beginning. It was never going to have a satisfying climax as Harry became instantly OP.

I think if someone picked up this idea and made the integration slower or less consistent it could be a decent device for an improved 7th year.

****** The One He Feared was intended to be a story about two inter-related things:

1. Defeating Voldemort.

2. Harry finding himself through the fog of Dumbledore's life experiences.

If it were just an action story, then you'd be correct that an anti-climax was inevitable. But the climax to the story was always intended to be an emotional, character-based climax in which Harry found the balance between Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore.

The first four chapters are very much the "Dumbledore" arc, in which Harry completely relies on Dumbledore's knowledge and world view. This arc culminates in Harry losing a duel with Voldemort, sending him the message that /being Dumbledore is not enough/. Therefore, to defeat Voldemort, Harry needs not only Dumbledore's skills but must also re-discover those parts of Harry Potter which Dumbledore lacked.

******* You are the foremost expert on the topic "What [[/u/Taure]] planned to write", and your plan for the fic sounds amazing. In my defense I would just say that as a reader I can only judge a fic by what's written and not what's planned. Also, you rock and your fics have brought me and thousands of other much joy.

Do you have a seminar on how to portray Dumbledore in a fanfic? Because I think it's badly needed by many many authors.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.
