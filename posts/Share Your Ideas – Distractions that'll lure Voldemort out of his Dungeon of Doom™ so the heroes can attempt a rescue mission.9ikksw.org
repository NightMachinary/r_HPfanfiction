So, pretty much what it says on the +tin+ title. Share everything from the canon-plausible to the truly outrageous. Go wild with all your ideas.

/Disclaimer: I'm looking for help with my fic. Credit will be given to anyone whose idea I use. For settings more specific to my needs:/

- DH level of social setting; i.e. Voldemort & Death Eaters are running things
- You have about eight hours to prepare
- One person can stick around to prolong the distraction
- You have Dobby to help set up, but he's part of the rescue team so can't stick around
- Minimal collateral damage preferred, but if a building or two gets levelled and a dozen +NPCs+ innocent bystanders die then *shrugs*


** Are the eight hours the deadline before prisoners are executed or what? That could complicate things.

​

However, my idea would be to kidnap a high profile Death Eater with the Dark Lord's trust, use his hair for Polyjuice potion and then publicly go against Voldemort, renounce him and kill a Death Eater or two.

Then while Voldemort goes to deal with the Polyjuice!Traitor your rescue mission commences.

​

It's a more magical solution than using a bunch of mundane muggle firesplosives.

*** The eight hours is just the time between when they decide they're going to do a rescue, and when I want them to do it. I could probably push it to twelve, but no longer because I want things to happen between the time of the rescue mission and an event which happens four days later.

But I do like your idea, that would work for me.

*** If said high profile person doesn't resist it then why polyjuice when you can imperius.

** If you are willing to put a limit to the number of horcruxes one can create, then you can have someone destroy all the horcruxes then let Voldemort know that one was destroyed, Voldemort will go and check on them giving you a certain amount of time.

**** I always thought that the only person Voldemort cared about was himself, we also saw it in DH that as soon as he discovered about the break in at Gringotts he left to check on the Horcruxes.

** - Travel to an Army base in the former Warsaw pact and use shiny golden coins to buy plenty of weapons, preferably machine guns and mines/C4. Go full Lord of War

- Set up the mines and machine guns to create a killing field

- Trigger the taboo in the middle of the mines, apparate to the machine guns a few hundred yards away.

- As soon as the Snatchers arrive, mow them down. They should not have time to realise that they are in a killing ground before the bullets hit them. In case they actually manage a Shield (and it can withstand your firepower), blow the C4 or wait until they walk into the lamdmines.

- Hide the bodies, Transfiguration is key here

- Repeat a couple of times at different locations until Voldemort realises that something is amiss and decides to take matters in his own hands.

- He is now outside of his throne room, so the rescue mission is a go.

** Alright, I'll add a little something to this. I'll ask some questions as well.

*The Base*

Where is Voldemort's base of operations? Is it Malfoy Manor again? I'd advise against that, since we've seen it before.

When you say "collateral damage" must be avoided, does that included the base itself?

Or is it somewhere else? The Ministry of Magic? Are they operating out of the Department of Mysteries?

*Rescue*

Who's captured? Hermione? Ginny? Luna? Neville? Ron?

Are they tied up? Were their wands destroyed? Have they been tortured or otherwise disabled?

Are there any guards? If so, who?

To use one example, Greyback's relatively low on the totem pole, he could be a useful guard, especially if it's the full moon, and he's taken Wolfsbane Potion. Remember, Greyback likes the Wolf, but without his human mind, he's little more than a bomb. With the Wolfsbane, he isn't a bomb, he's a knife.

Or is Harry himself captured?

Has Voldemort taken his wand, the twin core away?

Does he have a guard or is Voldemort unwilling to let Harry out of his sight?

*Distraction*

Hmmm....

Set a fire at the Ministry. A big one. Very big.

Use Fiendfyre.

*** The captive is Harry, held in a non-canon location, heavily tortured, wandless (holly wand is destroyed), no guard on the holding room itself, but he's chained and there's always a few Death Eaters about the building even if Voldemort himself is not (though he regularly is).

I don't know that it's pertinent, however; I know how the rescue itself will go (a quick in-and-out extraction, at least that's the plan), it's just a plausible distraction that I was lacking. My rescue party (which is all of two people) know they can't take on Voldemort directly, so they want to get him (and, preferably, as many DEs as possible) out of the base before they attempt to sneak in.

"Collateral" mostly refers to anyone/anything unrelated to the Death Eaters and their base which might be hurt/damaged. The "heroes" don't want to actively do anything that would result in a loss of innocent lives, but if things get out of control and shit happens then they aren't going to be completely broken up about it.

**** "After finally being taken into police custody, the Joker has his henchmen rig up a devilish no-win trap for Batman involving the “love of his life” (Rachel) and his hope for the city (Dent.) They're both trapped in different locations rigged to blow on the same timer, and Bruce can only rescue one. Joker offers him two addresses but, inexplicably, switches who is where.

Bruce believes he's chosen Rachel, but ends up saving Harvey. Meanwhile, the GCPD, believing they're rescuing Harvey, end up making it to Rachel too late. She dies in the explosion and Dent is left traumatized, scarred --- it's his first real step into his Two-Face persona in this universe --- and believing Batman made the wrong choice."

(from: [[https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2018/7/18/17578680/the-dark-knight-batman-rachel-death-scene]])

So have Voldemort come out by making him chase after something important to him (the Horcruxes perhaps?) but everything is trapped.
