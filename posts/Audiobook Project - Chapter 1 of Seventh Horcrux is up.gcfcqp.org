Hello, all,

​

I have just uploaded Chapter 1 of Seventh Horcrux to the podcast feed. It can be found [[https://anchor.fm/hp-fanfiction-audiobook-project/episodes/Seventh-Horcrux---Chapter-1-edhpma][here]] as well as Spotify and Google Podcasts.

​

I've also made an informational google document detailing information about the project. The link is below.

*** I'm assuming you mean the one to the podcast.

I took it down because there were some things wrong with the sound. I'll put it back up once I re-record it.
