**** I don't know why; all I can tell you is what I've seen and they were minor notes in their respective stories anyway (Snape sighing about the old coot for mooning over him). I suspect someone heard Dumbledore was gay and decided to make him appreciative of most other men. And ignored the ugliness or made it a kind of "homely ugly" that has its own appeal.

And let us not ignore the tales where Snape is handsome (if he'd only wash his hair) with a gorgeous voice and thus is metaphorically beating women off with a stick. Such is the way of some Snape fans.

(I know I saw one--just as an example--where Dumbledore hired Lockhart because of his reputation, his similarity to dear Gellert, and a willingness to play games, so there is a group that likes to show him dragged around by his hormones. Can't remember what story that was, but I read it sometime this past year.)
