Unfortunately I failed to find anything readable. Either protagonists are superpowered and everything goes without any opposition (so there is no need for a rescue in the first place), or story is not completed or story is really bad (massive OOC, bashing etc).


** It's a Dramione-centric fic with original characters, it's one of my favorites!

** Lol @ these recs. The summaries make me want to stay as far way from them as possible.

In any case, the only good fic you'll (probably) find in this genre is linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodwoodpecker). It is very well written, has no OOCness or bashing, and actually deals with the matter somewhat realistically.

It is, however, incomplete. It has a good 200k words before abandonment though.

EDIT: linkffn(Exile by bennybear) also has a hurt/comfort theme, dealing with Draco's recovery from the war. It is quite well written as well, and I'll recommend it if you don't mind Draco. WIP, updated last month.

Is it still worth reading? Some abandoned stories may easily pretend to be completed, some are stopping after cliffhanger.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** This will probably not be what you're looking for: It's slash, contains liberal body horror and angst and almost the entirety of the fic is focused on the awful pain filled rescue. It's /very/ dark as far as I remember.

linkao3(333775)

This is the only one that comes to mind immediately. Hoever, I've had a phase in which I read fics like that obsessively in order to work through my own problems, so I've read a lot of them - I just can't think of them rn. As soon as I remember more, I'll post them here.

If you're really desperate for that sort of fic I'd go as far as suggesting checking out different fandoms. Harry Potter fics this dark tend to be written by rather young and inexperienced writers who don't really know much about trauma anyway. Marvel is a rather widespread fandom that contains a gold mine for fics like that: The Wintersoldier character in particular has the biggest amount of well written trauma centric fics I've ever seen in a fandom.

Good luck with your search!

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** This isnt a harry potter fic, this one is actually a slash omega/alpha fic from supernatural, but you don't need to know the supernatural fandom at all to enjoy. Alpha/omega literature has a lot of dark undertones to it - you'll find a lot of the themes you're looking for there, as long as you can get beyond the genderbending and 6 different gender combinations, as well as the male pregnancy. Some people can't get beyond that and its fine - but its worth a shot to see if you enjoy it. Here's the best omega/alpha fanfiction I've ever read.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.
