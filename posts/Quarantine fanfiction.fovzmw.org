I'm looking for any (good) fic where there's a quarantine OR a Hogwarts lockdown.


** There isn't a quarantine (more like a brief mention of a stay-at-home order), but there /is/ a pandemic in Sole Survivor. I feel it's very well written. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6888519/1/Sole-Survivor]])

** Linkffn(Ignite by slide) is what you want; you get both in one! It's the first book of a trilogy and my favorite fic ever. It's next-gen tho, be warned. But go read it, seriously.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** The only fic I came across a Quarantine is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]. And that is only briefly. Essentially, the Second Voldemort war gets so bad that the ICW says "fuck it" and magically quarantines all of Magical Britain. Nobody can enter, nobody can leave. Not sure if the muggles were also included or not. But the whole plan was to quarantine them and let them rot for a hundred years or so. Let them kill themselves out and/or keep them away from everyone else until they die out.
