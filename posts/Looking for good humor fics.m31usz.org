I'm looking to just read something funny. Would prefer there be no pairings at all, or just at least no focus on romance or harems or something like that. Would prefer it not have any bashing as the basis for humor as well.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15889737][*Remus Lupin, a Werewolf? Gasp! Who Knew?*]] *by LullabyKnell:* The clues were there and they were not impossible to put together. A person didn't have to be breathtakingly clever and named Hermione Granger to realize that Professor Remus Lupin was a werewolf. The regular absences were covered up well and then explained away with the dismissive ease of someone who had been making these excuses all their life, but there were still students who could take a break from their own busy lives just long enough to make the necessary leap of logic. (Some snippets of realization with some random Hogwarts students.)

Reformed, Returned and Really Trying Â» AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.

I insert the little prologue so you see the type of humor it is so you would know if you want to give it a try or if it's not your thing

PILOT PASSAGE*

J:Really? REALLY?

T:What?

J:Do you realize how absolutely terrible of an idea branding all your followers on the arms is? And that - what type of design is that? Snakes and skulls? So tacky. You guys look more like a biker gang with matching tattoos than an actual conspiracy.

T:Well, how else am I supposed to distinguish between my side and theirs?

J:Oh, I don't know...how about designing a magical seal or whatever that only those who possess it can see? Or, better yet, just put it in a place not generally displayed to the public!

T:...Wow! That actually makes sense!

J:Yes. That DOES make a lot of sense. And on that note, maybe you should throw away the whole "dark army" idea, too.

T:Why?

J:Gee. Someone trying to take over the world by starting a war. What a Slytherin thing to do.

T:How else would you take over the world?

J:Puppet the governments of the countries that matter, and buy out the governments of the ones that don't. But you better hurry. World War I just ended and there's a slew of war-torn, weak, newly created little states that haven't had a history of self-rule for hundreds of years.

T:That sounds really smart! That way, I won't have to deal with a bunch of stupid minions groveling at my feet, either - the already set bureaucracy will take care of that for me, and I'll only have to deal with my puppets directly. Also, if anything goes wrong, they'll revolt against the puppets, and not me! I can't believe I didn't think of that before. But how would I get around to doing all that?

J:You could start a Confundus Chain.

T:A what?

J:You know...Confund someone to confund someone to confund someone else to confund someone who really matters.

T:That's amazing. And then I can also make them Obliviate themselves afterwards so they can't trace it back to me. We're a genius. Thanks, alter ego.

J:And by the way, Horcruxes aren't a good idea.

T:Why not?

J:I don't know about you, but insanity is never useful to someone who's about to conquer the world. It's not easy to make smart decisions or try to predict your enemies' movements when you can't even take care of yourself.

T:That's absolutely brilliant! I should totally try to find a different, less costly way to engineer my own immortality, such as uploading my mind to a computer or something.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

THE JOYS OF HAVING A GENRE-SAVVY VOICE IN YOUR HEAD
