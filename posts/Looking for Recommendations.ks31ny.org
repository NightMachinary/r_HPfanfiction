I want to start diving into Drarry but I don't know where to start?

Help, any favorites?


** Personally not a fan but [[/u/Technichal-Goal-9437][u/Technichal-Goal-9437]] posted his favourites [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ks908l/best_drarry_fics_here/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][here]]

**** The series goes over six years, that was just supposed to be a link to the first one but apparently the bot isn't working. Here's the link to the series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

** I'm blanking on the name, but it's a series on Ao3 called something like 'The Flower Chronicles' and all the fics in the series have some kind of flower in their name. The writer is pretty well known, and it's one of the bigger Drarry fics. Harry goes and lives on the street for awhile, and ends up selling jewellery to Remus on a streetside blanket once.

There's also Hermione's Hogwarts Crammer, which is fun.

**** Found the first one. It's called 'The Secret Language of Plants' and it's by Endrina. It's long, yes, but it's definitely worth a read. I'm not a big drarry fan generally, so it takes a good fic to get me interested. :)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Turn by Saras_Girl, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][it's on ao3]] Here they are both adults, have children. It's heartbreaking and so different from all the other fics I've read.

Twist of fate by Oakstone730, also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506][ao3]] This story starts in fourth year and continues on. I must warn you, its sad, but also absolutely beautiful and amazing. Definitely worth reading.

Vera verto by [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4543611?view_full_work=true][shewhxmustnxtbenamed]] This was one of the first drarry fics I've read and it has a special place in my heart. This is after the war, eight year at hogwarts.
