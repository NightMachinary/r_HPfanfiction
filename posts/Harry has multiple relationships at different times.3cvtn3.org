** Check out Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent. It is the first of a completed trilogy which includes Harry dating at least 3 girls that I remember. More believable relationships than most fanfics IMO. Also has good action, cool new spells, and a plot that sucks you in completely.

It's by Barb, and was written before HBP. Sorry, I can't link right now because I'm on my phone and I don't know if it is on any sites supported by the bot. But a quick google should turn it up in no time. The series as a whole is called "The Triangle Prophecy trilogy", so that may help you find it.
