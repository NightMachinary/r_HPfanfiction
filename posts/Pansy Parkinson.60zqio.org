I recently began reading /Patron/ by Starfox5, and the concept of a competently manipulative Pansy intrigued me. Anything where she isn't portrayed as another gormless Malfoy hanger-on. Romance is fine.

  Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

  Being sixteen is hard enough without your mother meddling in your romantic life - especially if that mother is hellbent on you marrying Draco Malfoy. As if oily skin, unbearable classmates, endless school projects wasn't enough, Pansy Parkinson must now face an overwhelming sense of darkness both around her and within her. Her suffering is inexplicable, and everyone around her is at a loss when it comes to lessening her agony. Though, shagging does help.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
