Lately, for no reason, I started to ponder about the nature of the killing curse. We all know what it is intended for, considering its name and label as an Unforgivable. However, this then led me think of the scientific effect of it despite the magical nature of it (because why not?).

Here's what I read when I started to research about the Killing Curse:

#+begin_quote
  The Killing Curse is described as a jet or flash of blinding green light that "illuminates every corner of the room"[11] followed by a rushing sound, which causes the victim instant death. Victims of the Killing Curse are identified by the fact that they simply appear to have dropped dead for no biological reason. Indeed, victims seem "perfectly healthy" apart from the fact that they are dead.[10] This lack of visible injuries is one that had confused Muggles throughout the years of its use, requiring many Ministry of Magic officials to modify memories. Wizarding authorities, however, could tell at once of the curse's usage due to its somewhat unique nature.
#+end_quote

So does this curse simply stop all bodily functions?

I also read that the brain function does not die immediately after the heart stops. Basically, the conscious remains even after the heart cease beating. Well, temporarily at least. Though, this theory is debunked (sort of) according to Wiki which said:

#+begin_quote
  The biological reasons for the victim's death have never been fully explained. In any case, it is something that does not affect the health of the victims, as Muggle autopsy show that there is no change aside from outright death. It may simply be that the Curse just causes every organ in the body to instantaneously "shut down".
#+end_quote

Theoretically, is it possible to “shock” the body back to life with immediate Muggle medical attention with the modern 21st century technology? Or, does the idea of souls in the HP universe affects a person's ‘life force'?

I'm curious what others think of the theory behind the Killing Curse.

** I see all three Unforgivables as the quintessential Soul Magic. The Killing Curse, like a Basilisk's Gaze, sends a jolt of magic through one's body that instantly kicks your soul into the beyond and shuts down the entire body's processes. (A miscast curse, like reflected Basilisk's Gaze, could have erratic effects such as Petrification.)

I would say that it is probably impossible to shock the body back to life from a Killing Curse --- if it did anything at all, the result would be a mindless shell like the victim of a Dementor's Kiss.

*** The explanation, would contradict canon, though, if something has been done to every organ, to every cell that would stop it from working, as you call it forgetting how to work, to the point that electrical stimuli would do nothing, I´m not sure if that´s what you meant, the body wouldn´t be considered healthy, you have to fundamentally change a body to stop it from working, even with outside stimuli. I have two theories how the Killing Curse could work, the first is that it stops every electrical impulse and nothing else, which would mean cpr would work, I say even if the shutting down is only a side effect of removing the soul, the soul would come back to the body, if resuscitation is successful, and it should be nearly 100% successful, if it starts in a timely manner, by people who know what they´re doing, especially because the body shouldn´t be damaged. The second theory, which was inspired by your headcanon, is that Avada Kedavra is an enchantment, that only works on living beings and backfires on non living objects. The enchantment absorbs electrical energy and stops the cells from absorbing oxygen. The body would appear healthy, but no muggle doctor could possibly find out the cause, the problem would be that wizards should be able to detect the enchantment, you could explain it that this enchantment is almost impossible to detect, but I think this would be just explaining it with more magic, it could be though that the way the spell acts precisely isn´t taught to most, because it is for most people useless knowledge, Aurors and civilians only need to know that the spell kills people, and this only really comes up in academic conversations.

***** That´s where, I´m not sure if I understood you right, I understood that the organs aren´t capable of doing their function, at all, even with the help of outside stimuli (electricity,cpr). I stumbled on your explanation, that it removes hardcoded stuff, but that´s not quite how the body works. I`m no expert, but to simplify it, you could say that the brain is like a computer and the rest is a simple machine(of course it is more complicated and not a 100% true), like a clock work, there is nothing programmed in it, it can only do what the brain says, if you want to inhibit the clock work you have to damage the gears. What you call hardcoded is the structure of the organs and if you erase the hardcoded stuff, you damage the very structure, it has to be physically changed. While I singled out the brain, it doesn´t actually work much differently everything it does works because of it´s very structure, electricity for the most part is just the fuel, cut it off, and the machine stops working, switch it back on it works like before, our very memories are stored physically in our brain, it just needs electricity to gain access. To make a body forget how it works, you have to fundamentally change it´s structure, and such a body wouldn´t be considered healthy, maybe on first glance, but with further examination, you would find out that there´s something fundamentally wrong with the body. Then again I´m still not a 100% sure if I understood you right and again I´m no expert.

No. CPR is used to get the heart running again, to get blood running throughout the body --- not permanently either, but rather to give the person enough time to get the real help they need from a medical personnel. That's all.

CPR doesn't get your brain working if it's already dead. If the electric pulses between the neurons get extinguished, there's no bringing them back. Theoretically, there could be a way, but our modern science isn't that advanced. It isn't as simple as zapping someone with electricity.

Three things happen when you die.

1) Your heart stops.

2) Your breathing stops.

3) Your brain stops.

CPR can fix the first one, but only temporarily, and rarely. The only way it would fix the second one was if you had something stuck in your throat and the pressure from CPR dislodged it. It wouldn't do anything to the third one though.

*TL;DR:* If your brain stops working, you're fucked.

********* You use cpr to get the heart beating so the cells are getting supplied with oxygen, so the brain doesn´t get irreparably damaged, because of a lack of oxygen. If, your heart stops beating, the brain shuts down completely, then your basically dead, and your gonna stay that way, if you don´t get a cpr. If you get brought into hospital the personnel doesn´t do much different than continuing the cpr, they may use machines or drugs to raise the chances, but they´re pumping until the heart starts beating on it´s own or if so much time went by that, resuscitation is unlikely to work, the important part is to supply the brain with oxygen before it takes irreparable damage. The chances are slim to come back after the heart stops beating, but not impossible. Also one of the first thins you do when finding an unconscious person is to check if they breathe, and even before that you make sure that nothing is in the mouth, if there is something you have to remove that, if there´s no breathing after that, you start with the cpr, because either the heart stopped beating or the person has ventricular fibrilation, for the latter an AED really raises the chance of survival. Also people don´t breathe long after their heart stops, maybe a few seconds, that´s why mechanical ventilation is important after the professionals take over, because the body usually has enough oxygen in the blood stream that pumping is enough until an ambulance shows up. Usually if you get the heart to beat by itself again, breathing should also start by itself except something´s stuck in the wind pipe, but this isn´t much of a concern if you provide first aide, paramedics can intubate or just use tracheal tube, heck I´m allowed to use a tracheal tube after my last course. Um, I went on a tangent there... TL;DR: If your brain stops working, your only mostly fucked. Also I had to look some words up, so there might be some mistakes, also because I found out Wikipedia isn´t clear on it, intubation is a way different beast than just shoving down a tube someones throat and sticking an ambu bag on the other end.

No, you're wrong. Your brain doesn't shut down completely if your heart stops. It can stay alive for around 6 minutes without oxygen getting to it. It starts to die only after those 6 minutes. This is the point of CPR. You cause the blood to make its way to the brain, supplying it with more oxygen. If you stop CPR, the person will eventually die if help is not reached quickly.

The rest of your comment isn't even disagreeing with me.

*********** The cells start dying after 6 minutes, but brain activity stops a few seconds after the heart stops beating there are cases were brain activity lasts up to ten minutes after death, but those seem to be outliers, it usually seems to be 20-30 seconds. Though I give you that, this data comes from experiments with animals and may not apply to humans, right now there seems to be more interest in studying this, so those 20-30 seconds could be wrong, but this is still the general assumption. There are also cases were people who were declared brain dead woke up, but those could´ve been simple misdiagnosis´s and even if they´re not, they´re outliers. Quite frankly we´re both not medical professionals, at least I assume you aren´t, so our knowledge is limited to what we heard before and everything I heard comes from people for whom it, is irrelevant if the brain activity stops after a few minutes or a few seconds because it doesn´t change what they have to do to save lives, so I guess it is presumptuous of me to say something is certainly this way, even though I´m no expert and even the professionals aren´t completely sure. So what I want to say is maybe you are wrong, maybe I am wrong, so sorry for wasting your time and the commas are a bad habit that I try to fix :D

** A levitation charm has the target pass from a state of "not levitating" to a state of "levitating"; in the same way, the killing curse has the target going from the state "not dead" to the state "dead": ot only has the soul left the body (as it would have after a Dementor kiss), but the body left behind is dead by all known measures : the heart does not beat anymore, synapses are not firing anything, every single biological function has stopped. Shocking the body back to life won't work anymore than shocking my fridge to life would (probably less, depending on what may be living in my fridge).\\

*** Interesting thought about that- do you suppose that having a horcrux makes Voldemort impervious to the Killing Curse? Or at least, leaves him able to return and re-inhabit his body within moments of being 'killed', making it little more than an inconvenience?

If so (and I'm warming to this as headcanon), would he still feel the pain-beyond-pain that happened when he failed to kill Harry, or would it only be a very difficult Stunning spell for him?

Most people just die when hit with that curse. They don't go to dreamland. The book quite explicitly suggests that he's being sent to a kind of purgatory where he has a choice to return, why would you assume that's not what happened?

** This question makes a mess in my head.

The first problem is obviously that "dead" and "alive" are just definitions that don't refer to an actual state of being, but to a complex mess of processes that science has only recently been able to define as anything but the rather magical definitions of "dead" and "alive". You have to remember that death and life and the soul are nothing but a bunch of archaic hypotheses for how this thing we call "life" actually operates.

So then what does a curse that changes these states actually mean in real life? Well, rather little I imagine. There isn't actually such a thing as dead or alive, that's just a convenient word we use do describe states of what we call organisms. We don't call a boat "dead" or "alive", but we might as well as the moment where a shell blows a hole in its hull that leads to catastrophic failure is pretty damn analogous to "time of death" in humans if you think about it. Or at least the moment it's underwatter is.

And to stick with the boat analogy. Even a sunken ship can theoretically be lifted out of the water, repeared and made sea worthy again. (though would it be the same ship? now there's a question.)

So by analogy, a dead human can be made to be alive again with a little imagination. Anything absolutely preventing this is just a forced plot device in my opinion, although I can only think of one fic that took this to its extreme and actually completely revived a person that had been dead for half of the fic in a non spooky necromantic soul magicky way.

So, to get back the the question, what does the killing curse do? The answer? It's up to you! If it weren't for the whole kings-cross return from the dead scene, I'd say that it's a lack of knowledge and a false assumption of death being absolute that leads to the wizarding worlds understanding of how the killing curse works. I'd say "the light going out of someones eyes" is the probably the light of recognition, and death is the lack of the experience of life in the victim of the curse. So, complete brain shutdown most likely. The fact that the heart doesn't beat either (presumable) makes me thing it achieves this through a stop to all electrical processes in the body, including the heart's pace-maker. I don't know enough about medicine or biology to say how this could be reversed, but I see no reason why any such method wouldn't work on a victim of the avada, except for some connection to soul magic. The just add the resurrection stone to the mix and bob's your uncle.

** I've thought on the mechanics of it. My head fanon is:

In a world where souls exist the body physically develops to depend on them in some way. In the case of HPverse the neurotransmitter exchange that takes place within nerve cells to communicate information does not add up to the result that is produced. If technology could account for all molecules in the human body muggles would discover that the body should not actually function. The soul is an unobservable quantity that makes it work.

The killing curse places a soul ward on a body that prevents a soul from occupying it. This results in a lifeless corpse but also less well known it also results in a corpse that cannot be possessed because it is warded from soul occupancy. You could technically batter ghosts and other spirits with a corpse that has been killed like this because the body is completely solid to them. You could also hypothetically transfigure one of these corpses into a sword and the sword would work on ethereal undead.

This also means that when muggles get to star-trek levels of technology they will be able to extrapolate the existence of souls from the information that is missing. The same way you know the shape of a missing puzzle piece.
