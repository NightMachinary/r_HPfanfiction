So I'm getting a little burned out on all the Dumbledore bashing in stories I've read recently. I'm looking for stories where Dumbledore honestly tries to help Harry as best he can instead of being the manipulative old man he is in many fics. This can mean anything from never leaving him with the Dursleys to simply realizing his mistakes and doing his best to correct them.


** This is my list of fics with competent Dumbledore:

*** I don't think "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure" should count. It reads more like a Dumbledore-bashing fic, where an alternate Dumbledore takes over the place of the canon one because the canon one is an idiot.

***** Yeah, but usually in those fics, the super!indy!grey!Lord Potter is still supposed to be "our" Harry, just one that got the breaks and chances to become the super-uber-mega-awesome OP badass that he always had the potential to be but (usually through no fault of his own) never became.

This Dumbledore is very blatantly not the same Dumbledore, and the canon one is bashed pretty mercilessly. Alternate Dumbledore is brought into the canon world specifically to tidy up the mess left by the canon one, whom (so we are told by the Powers That Be) was an incompetent screw-up who just made everything worse.

Once Alternate Dumbledore steps over into the canon world, he spends a lot of time musing what a stupid, lazy douchebag the canon Dumbledore was -- and to top it off, in the afterlife canon Dumbledore, renamed "Wulfric," is watching from the afterlife and mentally ranting about how his great plans are all unravelled while all the dead souls heap praise upon Alternate Dumbledore and spending a lot of time insisting that "Wulfric" sucks.

This is bashing. This is blatant "canon Dumbledore sucks, look how much cooler and smarter and greater and more badass and just BETTER my own version is!"

** Well... I don't know if this would interest you at all, but I've recently started an extremely AU fic called "Holly Potter and the Witching World," where 90% of the magical world (including Harry, who is "Holly" in this world) is female and polyamory is the norm as a result.

So far, Dumbledore plays a fairly large role in the story, He is still male, and still gay... which makes him a bit of an outcast, so he's not the headmaster of Hogwarts. (The Headmistress is Ariana, who in this universe is alive, well and sane.) Instead, he works as a private investigator, with Hagrid as his assistant, and essentially he does his best to help fellow outcasts.

Granted, I'm only on chapter five, so he hasn't had a chance to do that much yet, but the plan is that he'll be either involved directly in the plot or have vital side-plots that parallel the growth and adventures of the titular character..

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her Aunt and Uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about?
