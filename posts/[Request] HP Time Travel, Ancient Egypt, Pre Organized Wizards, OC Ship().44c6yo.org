Read part of this fic, and the world building was excellent. Searched both here, and fanfic.net but I can't find it, I'm hoping someone here has it.

Additional details: Harry Potter is exploring an Egyptian tomb with Charlie, gets lost, is attacked by a cat, gets sent back in time, rescued by two people (male and female), and he begins improving the quality of life of a nearby town. Eventually he goes to the largest city in Egypt at the time and becomes a jeweler/enchanter without revealing his magic. Eventually he is summoned by the current pharaoh and after a trial of sorts is taken as the court magician/wizard. I can provide more details if necessary, but this is generally what I recall.


** Is it this one?

linkffn(The Wizard from Earth)

There's no Charlie though, so probably not.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

*** Another one with a similar concept is linkffn(A Long Journey Home), though this one is fem!harry and jumps between time periods a lot. (It shows time in Egypt, Medieval England and again in England shortly after her departure to the past)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
