Always wondered if any fanfics like that existed.


** There's a shortish Peggy Sue fic where Peter goes back in time to before his betrayal and flees the country instead. Would that qualify? I forget the name sadly.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** in linkffn(Many Thanks) his betrayal is prevented, sort of.

A short snip where he explains his "betrayal" them can be found in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/35/Odd-Ideas]]

And another, longer, where he both did, and didn't betray his friend, in: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/108/Odd-Ideas]]

*** Many Thanks is not half bad but OMG the H/Hr fan service drives me up the wall. James and a lily named their children Harry, Charlus and then decided on HARMONY? I'm surprised Hermiones parents aren't Dan and Emma.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE
