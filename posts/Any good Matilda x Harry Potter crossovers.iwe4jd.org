  Everyone knew Matilda was a rather extraordinary child, but even she didn't know she was a witch. Matilda Honey receives her Hogwarts letter in the year of the Triwizard Tournament, and soon, she will leave her unique mark on the magical world.

** Never seen one before but now you've caught my interest. In which way do you mean crossover? Is Matilda a witch that goes to hogwarts or simply meets Harry while they are little and they discover their powers together? Or possibly Harry developing similar telekinetic powers as her? maybe a reincarnation or possible a dream/mental connection to one another to help each other cope with their individual issues?

**** Haha no worries, ive written a fair few fanfictions (many were deleted over the years) in my time and it takes time to come up with new ideas. Do you simply want a story where she goes to Hogwarts or do you wish to create your own?

***** Maybe just a story where she goes to Hogwarts? That would be awesome, especially if you took the whole wandless magic thing and ran with it.

****** Book or Movie? There isn't much difference between the two when it comes to Matilda but there is some difference. Such as, when Miss Trunchbull runs out of town and Matilda lives with Miss Honey, she looses her abilities due to advancing to a much higher grade, thus taking up all her focus. Personally, I find this explanation as something rather impossible. She was self studying at home and training her power, so she obviously should still be able to if it became her main source of study.

Thoughts?

******* I feel as though the movie would be better, since you can't really lose magic. Also, it would be interesting if Matilda recognized the signs of an abusive(emotional) household with Harry's â€˜family' and was able to change his situation for the better

Professor McGonagall Delivers A Letter: Exactly what it says on the tin. A quite cute one-shot where Professor McG goes to deliver Matilda's Hogwarts letter.

Matilda Wormwood and the Forbidden Forest: A more "full-bodied" crossover about Matilda going to Hogwarts around the time of Harry's third year. Unfinished as yet, but last updated within this month so at least it's not abandoned.
