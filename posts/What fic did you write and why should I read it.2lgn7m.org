However, the one piece I think you all should read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6328732/1/Underground-Man-Visits-the-ATM-Machine][Underground Man Visits the ATM Machine]], a Dostoevsky fanfiction drabble.

Why? Because it's goddamned literary. (And really short.)

I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]], a post-HBP continuation where Harry inherits (and absorbs) Dumbledore's memories from birth to 1945.

You should read it for the character interactions. Everyone is as close to canon as I could make them, except for Harry of course, who is a mix of Harry and Albus Dumbledore. You might also like to read it for the history, the magic, and the look into Albus Dumbledore's youth.

** - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7086910/1/Retroactive][Retroactive]] - a nearly canon-compliant short story about Harry and Luna hijacking the Time Turners at the end of the Ministry battle in order to change the outcome. It's funny, includes some nice world-building info and good characterizations. Bittersweet ending.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7199124/1/Wordhammer-s-Mad-Ideas][Mad Ideas]] - a collection of story stubs, but the real value comes from the 1st, 3rd and 6th chapters, about Harry trying to use a Dementor to destroy the locket horcrux. As Harry says to Ron, "Things didn't go as planned. Are you really surprised by that?"

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]/[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5073471/1/Spiral-Tangents][Spiral Tangents]]/[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6844334/1/The-Spiral-Path][The Spiral Path]]/[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1727183][Holly Polter]] -

My first story, and the one I'm still writing- [[http://Harry+Lily=Holly][spoiler description:]]

*Why you should read it* - for every complaint about typical fanfiction abuses, this story tries to correct it. Goblins are evil; adults are functioning as adults from the beginning; learning Occlumency takes time and doesn't solve everything; exploring the Dark Arts takes time and doesn't solve everything; not everyone likes the main character- most everyone doesn't like her at one point or another, including her intimate partners; there isn't 'one twu wuv'... well there might be but it isn't Holly's first and they don't get there without lots of other encounters; people act with varying levels of intelligence; magic is explored and leveraged; vows are both used well and nerfed; money is an issue; killing people has consequences; justice does not prevail; most importantly every choice has consequences (and this is why the spiral pattern is the theme of the story)

*What people who drop it have said was their problem with it* -

- Main story is in journal format, often making the structure of telling the story confusing and making it harder to get 'in scene'. Given the next complaint, this may have been a blessing. (I just wanted to concentrate on dialogue and plot point evaluation as my descriptions were very weak. This was my first story, after all.)

- Main character is a girl going through an exaggeration of puberty, putting the reader in the unenviable position of identifying with her

- Main character suffers, regularly and horribly, in both physical and emotional wounds

- Women are raped (and depending how you look at it, so is Neville)

- Sexual activity starts way too young (13-14)

- Holly, despite all the above, is considered a Mary Sue. Also a hypocrite.

They're almost right. She's evil, in an 'I had reasons!' way.

*** /Spiral Path/ is one of those rare stories that, in addition to being written well technically, showcases what fanfiction is capable of, transcending canon themes and ideas and becoming something unique unto itself. It's one of the handful of stories I'd point at when the GRR Martins of the world go off on their high horses about the alleged inferiority of derivative fiction. (Hint: Shakespeare wrote fanfiction.)

I'm rather picky about the stories I list among my favorites; yours, despite a few minor hiccups, is definitely deserving.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320684][Detox]] - Set immediately after the war. Draco Malfoy struggles to rebuild his life after the war.

** I'm currently writing Let Us Cling Together Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9843978/1/Let-Us-Cling-Together]]

Why you SHOULD NOT READ:

- Frankly, I mucked the flush at the start. I was new to fanfiction, made a lot of rookie mistakes. Things such as Harry suddenly developing feelings for Hermione, a soul bond (again?), things that people like you hate.

- Lack of grammar/editing correction in chapters. I proof read every chapter before I submit something, still little bits here and there I miss out. Need to iron them out (which I will sooner or later).

- Not the finest writer. There are people far more talented than me who write on FFN.

- Frankly theres a lack of development/involvement of other characters. Looking back on it now I haven't really touched much on anyone else, looking to rectify it a bit.

Why you should read:

- Because I'm not going all cliche with the Tri-Wizard tournament. Someone other than Harry is competing. And I think the story finally comes into it's own during those chapters

- H/Hr without crazy ass character bashing

- Hermione isn't some wallflower who sits there nicely and supports Harry. She's her own independent person who kicks ass

- Quidditch! Scouts! Games! Action! As a huge sports fan, quidditch HAS to be part of HP.

- I haven't pulled any stupid goblin shit that I seem to read in every fanfic. Such as 'Oh hello Griphook' and his eyes widen as he realises HP knows his name.

- Because I praise the sun, do you?

You shouldn't read it. It is forbidden for you to read it. If you do read it, the sheriff's secret police will be sent to relocate you to the reeducation facility in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town. That might not be all bad, though -- the abandoned mine shaft has been used for illegal detentions for so many years, it now has amenities such as king sized beds, free wifi, HBO on demand, and torture cubicles.

It's clumsy, angsty for no reason and juvenile beyond belief.

I'm not sure why I changed it but I'm sure there are still some elements of slash sprinkled throughout.

In my defense I think I was, oh I don't know, fourteen when I wrote it? After I actually finished it it took another two years or so to actually release it's monstrosity to the general internet populace.

I have a bunch of written and half written fanfic stories saved on various harddrives that probably total 200k that I've never released. Maybe one day I'll fix them up and put them out.

Boy who lived: "lived" as in "lived at some point but is now dead" as opposed to "survived and is still living" and "either must die at the hand of the other": "either" as in "both of them" as opposed to "one of them" (for me as a non native speaker, finding out that it can mean both was strange enough - or my dictionary just tells strange things)

I don't think any of these stories stand out in comparison to any others, but these should give you some of an idea about my style.

You should read my stories if you like humour with a slight tinge of seriousness underneath, and if you like short stories and one-shots, and if you like canon compliant or close to canon compliant fics.

My favourite genre: Humour

My favourite character: Ginny Weasley.

Most of my stories involve at least one of those two elements.
