I can't remember anything else except that Draco and Harry were sorted into Slytherin, and Hermione gets resorted after awhile


** Resorted? That's rare for most fanfiction.

** linkffn(Nobody Cared by etherian) has Hermione resorted in Slytherin. It's a raising-Harry fic with Dad!Snape and Good!Malfoys though..

** Okay, I'm not sure if you are looking for a specific fic or just any, but "The Avalanche" (I think thats the name) is a LOTR/HP fic where Draco,Harry,Hermione and Luna are sent into the LOTR-verse. They build a city for themselves etc. It's a great fic, but I gotta say that it's a fem!Harry one, so if you arent into that :/
