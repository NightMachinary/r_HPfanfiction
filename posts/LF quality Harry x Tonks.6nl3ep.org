Preferably where Tonk's age is unchanged from canon or at least maintains that older woman dynamic that is one of the reason I love this pairing. Keep in mind I've read most of the higher rated Honks stories on ffn so a less well known story would be appreciated.

*** I read something like 10 chapters of that and It moved far too slow for me. I'm all for long fics as a cadmean victory is one of my all time favorites, however so little emphasis was put on the relationship that it just bored me. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the genre in hpff, if I want to read a crime/drama there are much better books to read. Thanks for the rec though!

**** As a Harry/Fleur fan, is A Cadmean Victory worth the read? I heard it was angsty Harry/Katie for a lot of it.

***** You will find very mixed responses. It is one of the most liked stories on FFN, wether that is a good thing or a bad thing is up for you to decide. I personally found it terrible, the pairing never feels natural or good, I felt more for Harry/Katie in a single chapter than for Fleur in the whole story. The fic is filled with bad tropes that are executed badly and has really nothing that makes it stand out. Back when it came out an advanage was that it was updated every day. It should tell everything when this becomes the selling point.

I would rate it 2.5/5 at best and not recommend it to anyone.

***** Absolutely worth it. Personally I can only handle a limited amount of angst and the drama that relates to katie is all believable and only serves to strengthen harry and fleur's relationship. To be fair it takes roughly a quarter of the fic for them to get together but before that is filled with some of the best au gof I've ever read and a brilliantly written indi!harry that has a believable and natural progression of abilities and power.

***** A bit edgy at times, but it was a fun read. Features a powerful harry, but the author made it work. Most of the complaints come from the fact that the protagonist is mentally unstable and the sprinkle of 2edgy.

***** IMO it's great for a single read through. Some of the dialogue is very cringeworthy, and the power ups he gets are kind of questionable in how they work. Overall though, I'd say it's great for that first read through.

** I really liked [[http://frowl.org/transformation/index.html][Transformation]] by Amalin. It's a 6th year AU Honks and then later a Drarry. It follows canon through OOTP, but where it goes in 6th year feels like canon even though it's all totally AU. Draco's characterization is spot on and the author doesn't try to redeem him with OOC fluff. Also, in this Tonks and Harry hook up (maybe just make out?) randomly in the summer and when the DADA professor doesn't work out, Dumbledore hires Tonks to fill in. She then has a taudry student/teacher relationship with Harry.

*** Thanks for the rec. I'm not really a fan of slash though. That honestly brings me to question what the demographic for hpff readers is like. Personally I'm a straight man and I tend to read only het pairings. Do fans of slash tend to be either female or gay men or is there a community for straight men who read slash as well. Just curious.

**** Straight man, more or less. Have read and enjoyed slash, but not recently and not in this fandom. None of the males of Harry's generation are that interesting, frankly.

***** Also a straight dude and while I'm not against reading slash I just prefer het stories and like you mentioned there aren't many interesting dudes to pair Harry with. I can't read the pairing of Draco and Harry because frankly Draco just pisses me off and I can't imagine a realistic scenario that would lead to them getting together (I'm sure there are fics that handle it well but I guess my personal distaste for canon Draco can't really imagine it)

Harry and Ron... it's just weird to think about, their relationship never had an romantic undertones for me and frankly I can't think of any other Males (similar in age to Harry) who was focused on enough on in canon for me to give enough of a damn to go looking for a good fanfic of said pairing.

TL;DR what the dude above said

**** That's a good thing, there's too much sexuality-change fanfiction out there anyway :) (note: I don't have a problem with gay characters that are gay in their respective canon stories (like say Dorian in Dragon Age: Inquisition who's a gay man), but changing a characters sexuality? Damned, that's like mutilating the character's fucking BRAIN with a chainsaw!...can't stand it! In comparison: Making a character more intelligent is just "tweaking" said brain :) )
