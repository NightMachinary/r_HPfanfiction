The Harry Potter books would be an amazing ploy for revealing magic to muggles.

Take a sensationalized biography of a pro muggleborn rights war hero, print and seek it as though it were fiction, and then wait 50 years so that all the children who grew up enamored with the wizard of world are now the people in power before revealing that it was all real.

P.s. On this note if I could time travel and release the HP books myself I would 100% do it under the name or Roy. E. Guild, and then buy and construct the leaky cauldron, staff it with people in character and disgruntled by “that idiot lockheart”, who are just there to throw people out, and gaslight the world into half believing that it's real.


** Except for those children now are all grown up and plenty of them think the wizarding world is either hopelessly backwards or outright horrifiying.

"Tadaaaah, it's all real!"

"What the fuck, you just stand idle when there are millions dying in war, famine, terror attack and pandemic?"

"Do you still wipe people's mind willy-nilly? Has any of us ever got raped then mindwiped?"

"How many murderers you let go because they claim being imperioused" hmmm?

*** I mean, it's pretty evident that they're not that bright, so I'd say that its in character.

  COMPLETE! What if the magical world DID exist? What if Harry Potter and the major characters from the books were real, and there was a very real threat looming from the magical world?
