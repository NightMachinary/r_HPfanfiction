**** It's more that she won't bend the law, no matter what - and no matter the law. As she sees it, refusing to enforce a law passed by the legal authorities and in the correct fashion would be putting herself above the law.

****** Not at all. "Rules-abiding Hermione" is a fanon invention. Hermione broke every rule (and every law) as soon as it got in her way in first year. Lying to teachers after the troll? Check! Snape might be trying to curse Harry? Set him on fire! Hagrid has a dragon? Help smuggling it out after curfew! Neville tries to stop them from breaking curfew again? Petrificus Totalus!

Hermione never met a law or rule she wouldn't break if she thought it would be justified.

******* It's funny Harry tried to justify that he broke too many rules in canon to be prefect, when Hermione arguably has an equivalent or worse track record. Especially sixth year.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
