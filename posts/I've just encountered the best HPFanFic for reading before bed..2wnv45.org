It's called Harry the Hufflepuff. This shit is hilarious.\\
Harry is the laziest motherfucker I've ever read about, and I've written whole sentences about myself. This is great. You should give the first chapter a read.

Some quotes:

#+begin_quote
  Harry leaned heavily against the glass in front of the massive reptile tank and looked longingly at the huge snake snoozing under the sun lamps. "Lucky bugger," mumbled Harry, watching it enviously. "You get to lie around all day doing whatever you want, with no chores or school, and get all of your meals brought to you. That's a neat angle you've got going on there, aside from idiots like Dudley annoying you I guess."\\
  The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\\
  Then it winked.
#+end_quote

and,

#+begin_quote
  "Lock me in my cupboard then," he said with a shrug.\\
  Getting a chance to lie down in peace and quiet for a few hours, maybe even catch an extra nap, was a close second place to watching TV or playing computer games for Harry.
#+end_quote

and,

#+begin_quote
  Getting fitted for what was basically a dress should have worried Harry a little, but since all the other guys would be wearing the same thing, he found he wasn't really that concerned by it, and it did mean one less thing to worry about: trousers.
#+end_quote

and finally,

#+begin_quote
  Harry showed his best fake smile and kept his mouth closed.\\
  Arguing with idiots was more than a waste of effort, it sometimes felt like it sapped your own intelligence. Better to slap one of Dudley's moronic smiles on his face and stop listening, lest the sheer stupidity of anything the git said somehow infected him.\\
  At least he didn't have to worry about trousers anymore.

Also, chapter two "closer to the door" had me almost pass out laughing. Fell on the floor.

*** Two weeks in the alley was fantastic. I couldn't find Almost a Squib funny. It was sad, and I never thought that I'd find Filch likeable. Thanks for the recommendation, it's a good read.

*** No, he covered that. Harry puts in a shitload of work to avoid doing any actual work (reminiscent of that one wizard in Moving Pictures), and has never shown loyalty, only because there was no-one to show loyalty to.\\

**** Without spoiling too much, the Marauders snap and go on a killing spree. There's some black humour (pun intended) in it but it's very different to his purely crackfics. It's also well written.
