  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

** The only one I've read much of is the linkffn(Innocent) series, where he escapes from Azkaban five years early (with accidental magic in his sleep). I like it for just having them as people, no secret Black family magic, no inheriting Lordships, just Sirius doing his flawed but sincere best to look after James' son.

Draco becomes a sympathetic character eventually, but there's no pairing for Harry as yet.

First book is pre-Hogwarts and is the longest, the others cover one year each. Book five is in progress.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
