Random thought, are there any stories where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and the house...Not sure how to word this...corrects his behavior?

Like I was thinking he's a bullied (abused) kid, that's never had friends, been shown real affection, and probably has zero social skills, and in Slytherin's they have specific rules or expectations and Harry wouldn't get them or agree with them. I'm picturing Harry maybe sitting with Hermione or Ron and the others (Slytherin's) coming up and dragging him away telling him that's not allowed. And since it's Harry and he's nice he keeps trying and keeps getting pulled away. Maybe them whispering threats or warning in his ear (when he does something wrong) while outside the common room, cause you know Slytherins don't fight amongst themselves, unless behind closed doors. Maybe his year mates or the older punish him, like detention or extra lessons (these can change as he gets older) but in the common room or some shit, so no one else knows. And Not just who he hangs out with but his behavior, posture, speech, classwork, homework whatever. They along the way teach him politics, people reading, dark magic...idk Slytherin/pureblood stuff.

Now because I like darker fics, dark/gray Harry, and character bashing Harry changing and adapting to these new lessons or way of life would be awesome.

If there are no fics like this any one wanna write one? I have idea to help lol.

Hufflepuff is there for kids like that. It's the house of friendship and loyalty. There's a fic I won't name where the sorting hat tries hard to convince Harry to go there, Harry refuses, so the hat picks Slytherin.

*** I always honestly wonder how much Harry's introduction to the wizarding world was stage managed to make him want Griffindor. What he needs most is social support and someone to temper his suicidal bravery, and he's not getting that with the lions or snakes...

**** He doesn't need to lose the suicidal bravery though, he needs to keep it because the future of at least Britain, and possibly a larger chunk of the world, depending on Voldemort's ambitions (because he absolutely could have taken over the world, he has the power and skill and magic is pretty terrifying), safe. He's got to fight Voldemort, and that's something that needs suicidal bravery because the guy can fight Dumbledore to a standstill while Dumbledore has the unbeatable Elder Wand, so fighting him really is suicidal.

** there is one fic where he does this form of accidental magic to make him unnoticeable. I stopped reading because I couldn't stand the hazing, but it involves the Slytherins being excited because he's â€˜a blank slate'. Maybe someone will know which one I'm talking about, because I can't find it

  When he's little, Harry discovers something Very Special: he can make his wishes come true. Literally. Cue the chaos.In which a young boy discovers a way to slide under the radar and the profound consequences that follow. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable?Tone changes from childish to mature as Harry ages. Rated M for a lack of moral conscience, the occasional murder, and a graphic dark theme here and there (because why not?). Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.

  HPTN, AU. Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus, concerned that Death Eaters might find him, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was too powerful, and made people forget about Harry when not directly interacting with him. Harry is content...until the charm breaks. 7 parts. COMPLETE.

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?
