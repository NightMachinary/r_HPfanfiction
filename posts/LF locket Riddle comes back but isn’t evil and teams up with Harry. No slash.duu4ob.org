Perhaps Riddle went insane after his numerous horcruxes, but teen once teen Riddle sees what his future self has become he decides to work with Harry maybe even mentor him. Bonus if there's an evil Dumbledore as well and Riddle and Harry form a third side against Voldemort and Dumbledore.


** 3 Slytherin Marauders. I don't have the link on hand but this is definitely what you want. It revolves around the idea of Magical Dudley, Harry, and Petunia fleeing to Snape when Vernon is drunk and tries to kill them before dying. Tom eventually is put into the story and brought to the side of Severus. Dumbledore, alas, is not evil, but he does get a good dose of bashing at the beginning.

It also features Good!Lucius, Good!Draco, Evil!Narcissa, Lucius/Petunia, and Snape/Rosmerta, OH! And Tom/Tonks. It sounds weird but is probably one of my favorite fics. Warning, its quite long.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
