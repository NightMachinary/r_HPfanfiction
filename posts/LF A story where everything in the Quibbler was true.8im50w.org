I remember bits of this story very vividly, but the premise is exactly as the title, where everything we know the Quibbler wrote, as of Book 5, was actually true. Sirius Black's alter ego of Stubby Boardman, Fudge wanting to bake goblins into pies, and various other random bits, with a fair bit of popular fanon articles. The whole thing was done in one chapter, snippet style, showing the progression of the story through letters, and magazine/newspaper articles.

It ended with Xenophilius being declared Minister of Magic, and Harry Potter being given awards by the Queen.

Please help me find this, It was one of the earliest stories i read in fanfiction!

EDIT: Thank you to Corisilvermoon for discovering the story I was thinking of, but i got it mixed with another story! I'm afraid the Quibbler articles being real took place in another story, and my mind mixed it with the Xeno becomes Minister story, my apologies!

The Xeno becomes Minister is "How Xenophilius Lovegood Saved Britain" on Fanfiction.net!

  The newly appointed Prime Minister, Mr. Antony Blair, has retained in the new cabinet the Minister Without Portfolio, Lord Lovegood. Lord Lovegood, who was called to the Lords and appointed to Cabinet last year by the outgoing Major government, which was defeated in Thursday's general election, is said to be a nonpartisan expert on what are described as "special matters", and Mr. Blair said it was essential to retain his judgement in the new government. Inside sources on the left of the Labour Party, however, state that certain elements of the Labour Party upset with Mr. Blair's vaunted "Third Way" and "New Labour" positions, described Lord Lovegood as a "demented Tory hack", and said it simply showed how bad things had got in the party since what they describe as the halcyon days of Michael Foot.

**** It was definitely the story i was thinking of..I think my memory mixed it with another story, though...

From the other story, i remember, specifically, Fudge saying the goblins should be baked into pies, Sirius being Stubby, and Heliopath Armies.

I did notice my big mistake though. In the linked story, Harry writes a letter saying that Luna was right about everything! And throughout the story, there are very subtle references to the various Quibbler articles (Sirius is on Tour, Fudge is charged for violating the Food Safety Act...)

Now i must search for the other story, which was much more overt from what i remember..
