** This one fits your criteria, although it might not be what you're looking for if you want a longer, dark story. Basically, Dumbledore asks Newt Scamander to help when he realizes Harry has become an Obscurial. It's rather short at about 12k words, but it is complete.

  FANTASTIC BEASTS SPOILERS! What if the Dursleys had been a bit more devoted to beating the magic out of Harry?
