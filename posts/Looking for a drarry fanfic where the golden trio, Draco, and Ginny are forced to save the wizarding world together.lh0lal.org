Draco is still an asshole at the begining (he's kind of acting like he doesn't wanna be there with them) and he develops over time... With romione in it ofc. But no hinny or dramione or anything like that.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
