Hey guys, could you send me the best swordsman Harry fics that you have ?\\
What i want is not some fic where he just carries a sword arround, i want something where he frequently uses a sword. (Does't have to be Gryffindor's sword)\\
I have tried to read Harry Potter and the third key, but Harry in that history was just annoying, he just accepted everything bad that people did to him ven having more power than most, so i droped.\\
Send me your best fics where Harry uses a sword, and i want something like the sword being his main weapon.\\
No Slash or FemHarry\\
I don't like bashing, but i don't really care either, it just need to be well written.\\
Nothing of the sorts of Harry and Ginny and Harry and Hermione for the pairings.\\
Crossovers are okay.\\
That's it!

#+begin_quote
  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
