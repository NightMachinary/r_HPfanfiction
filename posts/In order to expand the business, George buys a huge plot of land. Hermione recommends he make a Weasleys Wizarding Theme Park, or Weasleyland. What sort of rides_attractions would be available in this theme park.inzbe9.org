I love going on theme parks so much, so I wonder what a theme park made by magic would look like. The rides would be a thousand times more thrilling, I suppose. I'm thinking of making a short fic, without any plot really, just exploring this idea, as well as a bonus chapter of George, Hermione, Ron, and Harry exploring some theme parks such as Disneyland or universal studios looking for ideas. Any creative ideas for rides?


** Dangerous Dares (safety charms required): I think theme parks would be more a collection of areas where things can be experienced. Rides in the muggle world replicate experiences. Why bother when magic means you just experience it directly? With exceptions, of course.

Daring Drops - you floo to a platform suspended in the air. You jump off. At the end, someone casts immobulus so you don't die.

Brawling with Beasts - you're put into an arena. Someone transfigures an animal (so it's ethical) and you fight it. You can even get prizes if you choose to make it harder by not using magic and using muggle methods (guns, grenades, swords, etc). Quidditch is basically a blood sport.

Goblin constructed rollercoaster - even wizards can appreciate a good rollercoaster with no safety precautions.

Flying on literally anything - why bother with a ride when you can just stick people onto thestrals with a sticking charm and give them the scare of their life flying on an /invisible flying horse that eats flesh/? Or giant transfigured birds. Brooms. The list goes on.

Swimming with mermen - self explanatory.

Jungle Quest - try and get through a jungle filled with plants, mundane and magical.

Daydream Charms Area - perfect VR that lets you experience anything. Want to kill a dark lord? Pretend to be Dumbledore at magic?

Another actual ride - entrancing experiences - sit on a ride restrained that moves through a bunch of alluring enchantments.

*** The thestral idea is actually genius lol. Though everyone who had gone through the war would automatically be exempted from entry since they'd see the thestral.

**** They're the true daredevils. They do it blindfolded and petrified for the true flying experience.
