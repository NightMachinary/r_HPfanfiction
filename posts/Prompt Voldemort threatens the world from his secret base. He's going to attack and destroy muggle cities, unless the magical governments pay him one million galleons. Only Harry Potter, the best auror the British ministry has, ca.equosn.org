#+TITLE: Prompt: Voldemort threatens the world from his secret base. He's going to attack and destroy muggle cities, unless the magical governments pay him one million galleons. Only Harry Potter, the best auror the British ministry has, can stop him, but he's too busy with his man wives.

Malfoy reports in on the financial situation and doesn't see the point in asking governments for money. Bellatrix admits that when Voldemort disappeared, she used a dark ritual to get herself a son of Voldemort, and he's a teenager now, and he's constantly criticizing Voldemort's actions.

Basically, the entire thing should be named I can't believe it's not Austin Powers.

*** Basically, all of that happens in the first movie, only with cheesy Bond Villain plot and characters rather than magic Private School.

Cheesy-AF bond Villain from the sixties time travels to '97 and hasn't really picked up on the fact that it's been thirty years and shit's changed. He threatens to use a laser on the planet (IIRC, it's some kind of weird superweapon thing at any rate) and asks the UN for a million dollars, which they laugh at because a million dollars is chump change these days. Also, governments are broke and corporations are where the real money is at (#PoliticalCommentary).

Austin is a manwhore who'd rather chase skirts than bud guys.

The supervillain's main female agent in-vitros herself with some of the Villain's sperm and creates him a kid that's basically a Linkin Park nerd from the 90s who'd rather be at the Arcade instead of stuck in his dad's secret Evil Genius lair.

**** You have to admit, Scotty Evil had more common sense than his dad's entire organization. "Why not just shoot him? Why bother with the deathtrap?"

***** More common sense, sure, but absolutely no sense of tradition. If it was good enough for Great-Grandad Overlord of all Evil, then it's good enough for us. :)

** Harry's man wives would I guess be all the Weasley brothers, Neville, Dean, Seamus... The Creeveys would want in... Idk, maybe if Harry and Draco simultaneously lost bets he could get in there, and he'd have to bring in Crabbe and Goyle if he did
