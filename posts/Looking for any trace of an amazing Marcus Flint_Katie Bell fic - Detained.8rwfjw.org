There is probably no way this will yield results but I'm trying to find out if there is any possibility of finding this fic.

The title is Detained and the author seems to have gone by a few different names. On FFN it's under the name se1ge but it was also posted under the username 'jenszabo' on LiveJournal, and I was able to get my hands on a copy of the story which listed the author's name as CeeJay (possibly also written CJ). There are I think 10 chapters up on FFN, 12 on LJ, and the copy I was able to get included a 13th chapter. It was last updated in 2009 so this is a crazy long shot but from what I gleaned from the author's LJ, the fic had been previously posted on a site called Chasers and she/he was gradually reposting it after Chasers had been taken down. So there is possibly more out there that someone has a copy of.

Again, I know there is only a slim chance but I have been reading and rereading this fic for almost 10 years and it is driving me insane that I will never know how it ends. If you happen to have a copy of however much was posted at Chasers or if you somehow know the author and know if they've stopped writing for good or there's a chance they'll continue - I just need closure!

And if you happen to be a fan like me and you've been searching for that elusive Chapter 13 + snippet, send me a message and I'll hook you up.

  Marcus is becoming obsessed with Katie. The last thing he ever plans to do is let her know. Katie is becoming obsessed with Marcus. Her life would be far easier if she weren't.

** Personally never read it but I just did a bit of quick snooping and found that someone called Katterrena wrote a story based on Detained on Chasers (which you can view a bit of on the Internet Archive). They left a couple links to the story on the ffn.net upload of their omake, but they are both unfortunately defunct. There's an AO3 (and a twitter, lj, etc) account with the same name, maybe you could contact them, see if they have a copy? [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Katterrena/pseuds/Katterrena]]

*** Thank you! I'll give that a shot.

Edit: Extra thank you because I just realized this was a fic I had been looking for years ago but I thought it had been deleted.

** I made a reddit account just to share with you that I have experienced the same struggle. I managed to get Chapter 13 last year and I'm still dying for more. If you ever find anything please let us know! I hope the author knows just how fantastic their work was, that people like us are rereading it after 10 years.
