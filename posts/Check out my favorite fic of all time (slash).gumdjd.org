I just wanted to give a shout out for MayMarlow's “A Train to Nowhere.” They started writing it in 2011, took a long hiatus, and I was so excited to see it's been getting recent updates!

It's over 400,000 words, and it's just so well written. Makes my day every time I get the update notification. Please check it out!

If you've read it, let me know what you think of the story so far!

Here is a link and summary:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501]]

“In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name ‘Tom.'”


** Oh my god. THIS. I started reading the fic yesterday, after seeing this and it's so amazing. I'm not sure words can describe it, but I love this fic so so much! Thank you for your suggestion; if you have any more recs then I'd love to know--- I'm open to most pairings and partial to most slash except draco/harry and ron/harry.

*** I'm so happy you loved it too! I'm always so impressed when I see such phenomenal worldbuilding in a fan made work. And instead of declining in quality, in my opinion, the recent chapters have got me even more on the edge of my seat.

Likewise, let me know if there's anything you'd recommend to me! I'm open for anything, but my favorite is TR/HP

Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head except for one of MayMarlow's other fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]]

And also

Dark_Cyan_Star's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5745418/chapters/13239679][His Slytherin Descendants]] is a favorite of mine, but I definitely hold MayMarlow in a separate league. I'm such a huge fan.
