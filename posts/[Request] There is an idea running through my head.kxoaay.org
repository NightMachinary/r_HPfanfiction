I had a dream last night about a story in which the protagonist is portrayed as a great hero, but in reality he is the villain of the story without his knowing it.

Is there a fic with a similar theme ?, Please, although it is Spoiler, that the protagonist kills the antagonist before discovering the truth.


** Don't know about fanfics, but you might enjoy Mikhail Lermontov's /A Hero Of Our Time/.
