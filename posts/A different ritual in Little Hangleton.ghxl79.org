We all remember the ritual Voldemort used to regain his body in GoF;

"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe."

I was taking one of those stupid "only Potter geniuses will get all answers right!!!!111!" quizzes (you know the kind I mean, super easy and silly, usually on Buzzfeed), where it asked what the 3rd ingredient was - and the 3 incorrect options (mother's hair, lover's heart, foe's tears) had me thinking what it would be like to have a different ritual...I played around with the wording, and reversed the qualifications of the canon ritual (so unknowingly to knowingly, willing to unwilling, etc). This is what I ended up with:

"Hair of the mother, knowingly given, you will renew your son! Heart of the lover, unwillingly sacrificed, you will revive your beloved! Tears of the foe, willingly given, you will resurrect your enemy."

Obviously some things would have to be changed to allow this - maybe Merope left Tom with a lock of her hair in a cheap-ass Muggle locket, and when he realized she was a witch but died anyway, he was furious and packed it away or threw it away - and then had to track it down for the ritual.

To me, the real potential for a good story lies in the 2nd two ingredients. Bellatrix is likely the closest thing Voldemort can claim to have to a lover (or maybe Nagini??), or at least someone who loves him; it would be cool to seeone of them go from totally devoted to his cause to panicking because they don't want to die after all. Or more horrifyingly, if it's Bella - say Voldemort doesn't want to lose his most devoted follower, so devises a way for her to live - but she doesn't know that, and is thus unwilling to die. When she lives, she's not quite right (Well, more than she already was), and branches off on her own/betrays him because, in her crazy mind, killing her to deprive her from serving him eternally is a betrayal anyway.

Third ingredient has the most potential to be SUPER dark - WILLINGLY given tears. If we take it to mean tears of sadness, not pain..given freely and not with an ounce of fight left in him... "Worry not, Potter. You'll give the Dark Lord your tears, and very, very willingly. You'll BEG to cry for him soon."

I'm sure others can come up with a better story than I could, or a better interpretation of the 'new' ritual! I know it may take some stretching, but I thought it was a fun idea to play around with. Thoughts?


** linkffn(The Impostor Complex) indicates that in order to adjust the horcrux ritual to make multiple anchors, sixteen-year-old Tom had to do something special for the first one: he had to sacrifice not just a random person, but someone who actually loved him. And so he deliberately groomed a girl to fall in love with him, and on some level he loved her back. And then he went ahead and stabbed her anyway to attempt immortality.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
