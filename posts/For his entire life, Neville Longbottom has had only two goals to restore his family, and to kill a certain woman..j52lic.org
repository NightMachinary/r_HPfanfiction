** Considering that woman was his grandmother, it seemed like those two goals were at stake. But it had to be done.

** When Sasuke Uchiha died he didn't expect to be reincarnated as someone called Neville Longbottom. But when his new family gets hurt he knows it is no coincidence. Once again he will get his revenge, and this time around, he will enjoy it.

Now, if only voldymore, voldymarte or whatever-his-name-is stopped getting in the way, that would be nice

*** I imagine it as Harry's pov. Dunno why.

"Did you guys hear---" Fred? started.

"---what happened yesterday night at the Slytherin common room?" Probably-George finished.

Harry Potter stared at the third years in front of him. Yesterday night? He had spent the last two entire nights at the hospital wing. Had Snape gone after the philosopher's stone while he was asleep? Did someone from the Slytherin house try to stop him? It seemed unlikely, the entire house consisted of evil slimy snakes.

"If mom is sending another howler, we are running" Ron warned, not really wanting to hear whatever his brothers wanted to say.

"We didn't do anything!" Fred defended hastily. Yes, that one had to be Fred. Probably.

"Although we definitely would love to take credit of anything that traumatizes the Slytherin" George added.

And that did get their attention.

"Malfoy decided that pestering the Longbottom kid would be a good idea" Harry turned towards the Slytherin table. He recognized the name. Everyone gasped when Longbottom was sorted into the green house, from what he had gathered, everyone expected him to be Gryffindor, like his parents before him. "and no one really knows the entire story, but Neville did some weird wandless magic and suddenly Malfoy was in the floor, sobbing." Fred was enjoy this way too much. He agreed though, Malfoy sucked.

"Brilliant!" Ron laughed. "Maybe Longbottom isn't as bad as I imagined. Bloody scary though."

"Wandless magic at eleven?" Hermione sounded unsure. "That's impossible."

Harry ignored her. If Neville didn't like Malfoy, maybe not all Slytherins were that bad.

**** After that morning, Harry started hearing Longbottom's name everywhere he went.

"Did you see him in Defense? He is so fast!"

"Neville is always at the library, he is so smart!"

"He never talks to anyone in class," Lavender lamented. "He probably feels lonely, maybe I should try to become his friend!" Padma laughed out load.

"You already tried, he ignored you" Lavender blushed and Harry decided he didn't want to listed to that conversation anymore.

But it was at the end of the year when everything went south. While they were waiting for the potion class to start a sudden explosion was heard and the entire building roared.

"It was insane!" Susan bones said, five hours later "At first we thought he was barmy, but he kept on yelling at Quirrel and ranting about how he was going to have his revenge. He said that if he couldn't kill Bellatrix yet, he might as well kill the man she worked under. And when he did manage to take the professor's turban off, he was right! It was he-who-must-not-be-named!" Susan continued.

"It was really him?!" Lavender gasped. It couldn't be, Voldemort was truly alive then? Snape wasn't after the stone?

" Yes" the huffepuff continued soberly. It was obvious she had spent some time crying. "And he tried to kill Neville too. Theodore tried to get in the way, but he couldn't do much. Neville then did some weird magic and suddenly he threw him a lightning, of all things. It was terrifying."

A lighting? How did that make any sense.

"The Daily Prophet is going to have a field day tomorrow." Padma added. "But his spirit really did go out of his body?"

Susan nodded, it looked like she was about to start crying again. Harry could relate.

"It did. Dumbledore is probably going to address the topic once the aurors leave his office. But whatever the case, it's obvious that Voldemort isn't as dead as we thought"

** He trains throughout the years, ready to kill Bellatrix when given a chance.

Too bad Bella only did what she did to save him from being targeted by Evil! Manipulative! Ruthless! Headmaster because they're parents were considering switching sides. And after Voldy is blown up there's no1 to protect them from Him.

After learning this while Bella lays dying in his arms, Neville slowly leans forward , presses a kiss to Bella's forehead and vows to destroy the Headmaster and his Light! Side for conspiring against his family.

For he was an Avenger! He will get his vengeance!
