I'm looking for any fanfics where instead of Harry being famous simply because he survived the killing curse, he is instead famous for his skill at magic or his prowess in battle, etc.

** By the Diving Light by enembee has a skilled Harry who journeyed into the 'Old World' with Dumbledore for.. well, I don't want to spoil it. In its sequel, Conlaodh's Song, he seems to be well-known for his magical prowess in Hogwarts. Hogwarts Battle School and Wit of the Raven have a Harry known for his magical skill.

If you mean Post-Hogwarts fics, there's Catharsis by Nuhuh where Harry is known for being a Grand Sorcerer, what that is, before he ended up in an alternate dimension as the squib brother of the Girl-Who-Lived.
