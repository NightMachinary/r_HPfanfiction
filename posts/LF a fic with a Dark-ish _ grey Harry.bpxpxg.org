I've been really enjoying Slytherin!Harry fics lately, where he doesn't fight aimlessly for the light. I read one a couple days ago where Harry made a vow with Voldemort that neither would actively try to kill one another, and I really enjoyed it, so does anyone know anything similar? I'd prefer them to either be completed or updated pretty frequently.


** linkffn(The Bitter Hug of Mortality) has an interesting dynamic between Harry and Voldemort

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
