Harry potter and shield crossover where shield decides to use there technology to track the residue energy of the tesseract. Little did they know, the core within a wizard/witch emits the same frequency/signal. This revels the wizarding world or at a minimum shows thousands of people holding aka tesseracts on them.


** So that's where Dr. Strange learned it all...

**** It's a slippery slope. I mean so version have jugernaught being a mutant while others have him being an archeologist who discovered a mystic item and gained his powers (in the cartoon it's his helmet and he loses it and some nerd gains his powers), or if mutants like Apocalypse or Storm are magic or mutants. No wants to say really because it closes off a door they could use later.

Meanwhile DC is like "Magic exists but everyone just accepts it; except Batman"

** Not your prompt, but there are a few Hermione/Loki fan fictions thatI liked, I can't link right now but look at that pairing on Ao3. They're mostly romance with a side action plot, so they don't delve into specifics about magic and all but it was still fun to read. There's one where Loki has been captured (he's on earth locked in a cage, a bit like the beginning of Thor 2 - I think, could be avengers). She's asked to watch him and to try and understand what he wants, etc. He's curious about her magic. Then aliens attack and there's action.

Another one, where Hermione is tasked with stopping Loki from causing chaos and mischief, they play a game of cat and mouse, she catches him but once imprisonned by SHIELD he escapes and she has to catch him again. In this story, she's hurt and in the hospital and Loki is bored without his "nemesis". I liked the story and the writing.

You'll find both on Ao3 IIRC, but I can link them tonight if needed.

** I love this. Would it be from the points of view of shield agents? Or wizards? Or neither?
