1. Ron makes a mistake at the chessboard and Harry gets taken out. Now Hermione and Ron have to proceed without him. Declaring Hermione is better than him in magic it is him who stays behind to take care of Harry while Hermione if facing Quirrelmort. (--> Voldemort doesn't know about the blood protections) Hermione burns Quirrelmort with her fire spell/fire glass and the professors are in awe and slightly concerned for her mentality for killing a man. (Or how else you want them to react to it. Just any reaction to the fact that it wasn't Harry who went after Voldemort)

2. Harry gets the brilliant idea that the monster is a snake since he can always hear a creepy voice before someone is petrified and gets turned to stone himself after he went to the library to get more information. No one beliefs anymore that Harry is the heir. Ron already learned a few Parseltongue words and can open the 'door'. After Lockhart tries to wipe their memories it is Ron meets 16 years old Tom and fights against the Basilisk. The entire school hails him as their hero for killing it. He gets a confident and self worth boost and is less jealous of Harry.

1. Pretty much the same. Make differences as much as you want, just Pettigrew must escape. I would like a story where Percy isn't made a complete jerk and where he repairs his relationships with his family. The end of the second year should be a good start for that.

4. The school is less inclined to torment Harry because they are still feeling guilty of thinking he was the heir in second year or because of changes in third year. They are more cautious around Moody because they are smart enough too see a pattern of DADA teachers and attacking them. They learn some very useful spells and get stronger in general. Either the resurrection of Voldemort fails because of the blood protections or they don't even get to that point because Harry manages to stun them into oblivion before they can do anything. Like killing Cedric. Or Harry was faster than in canon and the Hufflepuff wasn't even with him.

Rest is open to you.
