*** I'll do my best, it's been like 8 years :( Its an AU story. Harry is in a group that uses very dark magic to fight Voldemort. The war is on a much larger scale, other countries getting involved. Harry has missions and the story deals a lot with how killing effects him. Its a lot of fighting fire with fire. However the order with the usual cast doesn't approve obviously and harry is having a secret relationship with Ginny. The group somehow has access to more power I forget how, so it's defiantly powerful harry but he learns it which is good. It's pretty dark but very enjoyable.
