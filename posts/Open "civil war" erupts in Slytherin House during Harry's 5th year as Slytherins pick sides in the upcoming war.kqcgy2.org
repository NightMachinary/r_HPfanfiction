It would be out of character* for Slytherin House, but it would be interesting to see how it plays out and affects the rest of Hogwarts (and outside Hogwarts).

*Out of character in the sense that Slytherins like to keep their internal house business private and out of the Hogwarts rumor mill.


** I don't think it's out of character at all. We know of like 10 characters from Slytherin house and it makes up 1/4 of the school. Most of them are assholes but even assholes can be fight for good

*** Sorry for being ambiguous with my comment. I was thinking out of character because they like to keep their internal house business private and out of the Hogwarts rumor mill.

***** Rowling also said all dark wizards are Slytherin, just like the betrayer of friends, right hand man of Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
