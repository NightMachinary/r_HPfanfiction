*Hello how are you?*

Well, what are your favorite fanfics? I will list my top 5 for you! (I don't know how to use the bot, so I'll leave the link anyway, okay?)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*1- The Darkness Within*

/What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*2- Love and love again*

/Lily and James survived Voldemort's attack, but their infant son was believed dead. Twelve years later, Harry Potter is found and brought home, but the real struggle has just begun. Ensemble fic about a family's recovery as old enemies return./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again]]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*3- The prince of Slytherin*

/Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James)./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/01/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*4- Light up the sky*

/Lily and James are still grieving twelve years after Harry's death. He'd be 13 years old if he were alive. The war against Voldemort is more intense than ever. Three mysterious young Death Eaters keep helping the Aurors out. Read the full summary inside./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6079331/01/Light-Up-The-Sky]]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*5- Everyone Lives AU*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/111713]]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, these are my favorite fanfics, and now I want to know yours! If you know of any similar to the ones I mentioned, I would be very grateful! : D


** If you want to use the bot you have to write where to link from "link + either ffn or ao3" and the title (with or without the author) or the number in brackets

E.g. linkffn(the darkness within)

If you want to link something within a word or more, that it's blue and you klick on it and it opens the page, you write what you want to see written in [these brackets] and the link in (these brackets) one after the other without anything in between.

So [[https://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3003][your sentence will become blue and you can klick on it]].

** I really like the */A very Slytherin Harry series by geoffaree/*.

Another take on retelling Harrys story. Severitus and later on a Harry/Blaise relationship. It's still ongoing. There currently are 7 parts and in year 5, if I remember correctly. (I'm waiting for more chapters to read in one go.)

I don't know if the bot can do series but I'm going to try.

Linkao3(A very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree)

If that doesn't work (edit: it didn't) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][here is the link]] that brings you to the series.

And here is the first story of the series linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree)

  Harry and Jax's third summer at Spinner's End and first as part of his new family. With fourth year comes a few surprises and an exasperated Harry that wishes for once that he could just have a regular school term. Or at least one that did not involve actual dragons, too many people trying to nose their way into his business, and the intrusion of far too numerous and unexpected emotions.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
