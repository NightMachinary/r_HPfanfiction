**** Thanks, too bad it seems abandoned.

Do you (or anyone that will read this) know any other fic where the DA is started earlier (not necessarily in first year) than in canon and evolves in something more?

***** No, I wish I did...

There's linkffn(the art of war by thegirlwithfartoomanyideas) but that starts in book 5, the DA does evolve and become a force to be reckoned with

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
