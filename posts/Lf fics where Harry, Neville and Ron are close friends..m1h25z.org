** This happens in my story (please forgive the shameless self-promotion). It's not the main focus of the story, but both boys are close to Harry. I love Neville AND Ron, so they're both part of Harry's circle of friends. I'm guessing this question spawns from a desire to see fics where Ron is actually acknowledged as the good friend he was to Harry in the books instead of being some kind of horrible, rude, prejudiced idiot.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.
