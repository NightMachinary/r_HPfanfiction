Give me Luna was a dark side spy all along. Give me Hagrid is Salazar Slytherin reincarnated. Give me Vernon Dursley is secretly a Sith Lord.

Not as the basis of the story. Not when it's already revealed in the summary. Not as an unsatisfying ending.

Give me the permanent death of a main character out of the blue. Give me a shocking revelation about Ron Weasley's past as a child model. Give me Draco Malfoy and Susan Bones' torrid love affair.

Give me your best-executed plot twists that you /never/ saw coming.


** Maybe not the best executed, but probably the least expected.\\
I remember a multiverse fic (or at least pretty sure it was) where Harry ends up in a world where he either never existed, or died a baby. In this world, Sirius Black is living in a secluded home, taking care of Lily Potter who litterally lost her soul, and James Potter who is crazy (he would act if him and James were still teen, having only some moments of clarity before losing it again).

In one of the last chapters I read before dropping it, Voldemort came back and summoned his best lieutenant, among the Death Eater : James Potter, a deep sleeping spy.

​

1st (and probably only) time I see this, too bad I disliked the rest of the fic and dropped it.

*** I've read a fic where this literally happens exactly, but the MC is a complete insane!Harry. It didn't include that dimensional travel or anything, but Lily lost her soul, James was insane and balding and acted like they were in school, and Sirius took care of them in a secluded home. Did Lily die at Harry's hand in a mercy killing type of thing in the fic your talking about?

**** I think she does. Probably the same fic and I mistaked the dimensional travel for another fic. If what came back to me is true, the whole fic is insane with pureblood using Muggle bombs and Harry worshipping deserts

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

** I think this will fall under It Was His Sled for how often it's talked about here, but linkffn(A Black Comedy) throws a twist at you that I /really/ didn't see coming when I first read it. Doubly unexpected considering that it includes a lot of lowbrow humor.

The identity of "That Fucker" is Diary!Riddle after successfully taking over Neville's body. He opposes Voldemort.

** The fic itself kind of sucked, and the twist was honestly more of a copout/have my cake and eat it too thing than anything else, but the only twist I can ever remember being genuinely surprised by in fanfiction was an evil!Dumbledore fic in which it turned out, at the very end, that Dumbledore himself wasn't evil, but was actually being possessed by Grindelwald via the Elder Wand, which he'd made into a Horcrux. Harry doesn't realise this, but uses Fiendfyre to fight Dumblewald (seewhatIdidthere) and inadvertently destroys the Horcrux, allowing Dumbledore to take back control and apologise for not realising the wand was a Horcrux until it was too late before he dies.

** I think my personal favorite (the one that sticks with me as most memorable anyways) was in linkffn(Time, Mr Potter? by Twi5ted) when Harry actually ends up beheaded in the middle of the fic by our very own Mr. Riddle, and is promptly raised as a fucked up Inferius by the good Headmaster Dumbledore. There is then a weird angsty segment (which is honestly a weak point of the story) followed by one of the most badass Battles of Hogwarts I've ever had the pleasure of reading, by virtue of Harry simply being dead already and negating most of Mr. Riddle's spells right there. The end ritual is pretty cool too though.

Actually, now that I thanked about it that fic has some of the better battle and fight scenes I've read. Should go back and read it again some time.
