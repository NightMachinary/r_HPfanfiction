I'm looking for fanfics along the lines of The Arithmancer or Applied Cultural Anthropology where Hermione is the main character and starts growing.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch queen) I like the story. YMMV. Not sure she is the main character but she at least shares double billing.

***** At almost 2 years since update, I think the hope is rather slim. TLPG appears to have quit the sub not long after he quit the story. It wouldn't surprise me if he had abandoned the fandom.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Quite a lot of [[/u/starfox5]]'s stories have a strong protagonist Hermione. My favourite (that I'm up-to-date on) is linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5), a Ron/Hermione story set in an AU and with those two characters as the protagonists, although Harry and Dumbledore get some 'screen time' - for lack of a better word - as well.

I've not read linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari) yet, but I enjoyed some of the author's works in other fandoms a lot, and based on their other writing, as well as how it was recommended to me, I think it's the sort of thing you're after - but if someone who's already read it disagrees, let me know.

*** That looks like an interesting premise. I doubt the author chooses to pursue it this way in later chapters, but I am imagining Voldemort getting turned into a symbol, almost a figure of religious aspiration, whose existence must be "proven" through dedication to the cause. I suppose bad guys can have martyr inspired fanaticism of their own.

**** That line was a lie cooked up by Lucius Malfoy, and his entire rule was built on lies. [[/spoiler][As the story stands now, Dumbledore just had him and his family killed. Yes, Dumbledore in that story was one mean manipulator]]

***** I love Dumbledore in that story, to be honest. There's a certain character type (weary old mentor with power that they prefer not to use, but feel like all the alternatives are worse, plus really competent at politics/manipulation) that I absolutely adore, no matter what fandom it's in, although I'm not sure why. Maybe from reading the Belgariad and Mallorean during my formative years?

***** Oh, I read up to the current chapter last night. It was nice, to find another little pocket of decent storytelling in the fanfiction community. It seems like it's always right before I'm about to give up finding another good story ever again that I seem to stumble across new worthwhile recommendations.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
