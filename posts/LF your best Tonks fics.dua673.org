Hi all! In all my time reading fanfics, I don't think I've read many stories where Tonks is something more than a clumsy yet talented young auror side character and/or romantic interest. So ideally what I'd like to read is a Tonks-centric story that can showcase her abilities and personality or puts her through some interesting situations. Any ship, or none at all, is fine. Any length is fine too. Also not picky on completion status either. So send me what you got! :)

Bonus points if it's a suspense, mystery or hard-boiled fic.

Thanks in advance!

I decided to poke some fun at the Order and their guarding scheme. Harry disappeared and Tonks, as the newest member, gets the "worst" search assignment.

I have also a few other fics where Tonks plays a major role, but not as the MC. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758/][No Longer Alone]] has her firmly in the big sister role.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has disappeared and the Order of the Phoenix is just one of many groups desperately searching for him. Being its newest member, Nymphadora Tonks got the worst assignment, or at least that's what Dumbledore told her in a sad tone. However, the place might have changed a little since his last visit in 1897.

  The situation, Tonks surmised, was indeed bleak. She had no wand, no contact with the Ministry and no way off the remote Scottish island that held her prisoner. If things went according to plan, she'd be dead within the hour.

** A couple of good ones that involve Tonks being undercover as a student at Hogwarts:

Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass by Temporal Knight: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/]]) : Tonks gets thrown back in time by the DoM battle and tries to figure out how to stop it. Honks

Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard by MazzyStarShip: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13065793):]] Tonks is undercover as student 5th year, and has to deal with Umbridge. Supposedly Honks, but it isn't there yet.

I also think there was one more like this but wasn't Honks. Harry knew about his bodyguard and she spent a lot of time teasing Neville?

Another interesting approach involve kid Teddy going back in time. Teddy's Excellent Adventure by ReluctantSidekick: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13021745/1/]]) He sees his Dad as Harry (for raising him), His mom as Tonks, and resents Ginny/Lupin. So he proceeds to play matchmaker. Honks.

  During the Battle in the Department of Mysteries Nymphadora Tonks finds herself thrown back to the beginning of Fifth Year. With two Tonks walking around and her faith in Dumbledore eroded what's a Metamorphmagus to do? Protect Harry Potter at all costs, that's what! Tonks ends up crafting a new identity for herself and infiltrates Hogwarts to fix the future. Pairing: Harry/Tonks.

**** I don't think so? I recall Teddy's Adventure to be pretty.. straightforward. It is pretty short

​

Honestly, I liked the idea but i felt Teddy Lupin was a bit too... manipulative for a 6 year old. Think it would have been better to go for the misunderstand angle: Teddy describes Harry as his father and Tonks as his mother because that is what they are to him, reguardless of biology, and everyone else just doesn't know he is adopted.

​

but still, a fun read.

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) isn't Tonks-/centric/, but it's so long that it's still able to give her quite a bit of character development, especially since Remus gets a lot of screen time and their relationship is kicked off early. Actually, it does some good worldbuilding for a whole bunch of older characters.

** I think its the Summer of Change by Lorddwar. Tonks is a secret unspeakable and takes Harry to them to become one. Also has a Harry Tonks Pairing and was alround a pretty good fic. Definitely worth reading. Also, how do you link a story, Instill don't understand that.
