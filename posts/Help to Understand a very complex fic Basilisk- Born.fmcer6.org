Hello. I am writing this in the aim of asking for help from you to understand a particularly complex fic : Basilisk-Born The time travel or time loop and immortality has guaranteed for me that I do not know who is who : Harry , Harryjames or Salazar or Altr. I do not know from where side pick the rope. Very good fic for Hogwarts Independence .


** They're all the same person.

*** Which is dying ? Who is the one holding the castle energy ? Who is the mentor ? It is impossible that they are the same person because Harry is speaking to them.

**** Again. They are all Harry. Harry's mentor is Merlin. Otherwise, Salazar, Salvashar, Harry, Harryjames - all the same person.

If you keep reading it explores how Harry became unstuck in time.

******** I'm not going to summarize and recap the entire fic for you. Harry refers to Merlin as father (atr) just as Harry's kids do for him.

******** That guy has it a bit wrong. Atr to Harry/Sal is Merlin who adopted him in the beginning when he was first sent back in time. When Merlin dies in defense of Camelot, which becomes Hogwarts, he becomes part of the wards referred to as soul wards.
