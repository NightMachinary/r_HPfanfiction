As the title says, I wrote this a while back, as the beginning of an Elemental!Harry story. I don't have any plans of actually writing more of it, but I came across it and thought someone may like it. If you do, anyone is welcome to take the idea and run with it.

Waves crashed against the cliffs as thunder shook the black sky. It was the storm of the century, the news reports said, battering the shores of South-West England with torrential rain and vicious winds interspersed with near constant lightning strikes. The cloud bank had formed quite suddenly and unexpectedly, and had then defied all predictions of its movements and behavior. Meteorologists and climate scientists scrambled to track and explain a storm that by all evidence, should not exist or behave in its current manner. The street-preachers and doomsayers claimed it was an act of God, punishing the world for its sin, while conspiracy theorists called it proof of government-run weather machines. All of them were wrong.

A great intelligence did indeed command the storm, though it was no mad scientist or vengeful deity. It was an ancient being, last of its hallowed kind. A spirit of thunder and wind, taking flight on the wings of a great bird. The Algonquians of North America had once worshiped this great being as the Onimikì. The Thunderbird. He bore little resemblance to the electrifying cousins of the phoenix that made their home in the American Midwest, who evoked images of immense white eagles. No, this elemental spirit was the dark grey of the storm he surrounded himself with, sharp talons of jagged blue lightning tearing at the clouds as black-tipped wings blasted the world below with gusts of wind. He was a force of nature in the purest sense.

This spirit, so far from his native home of North America, had crossed the great ocean and brought his power to bear on England's West Country for one reason. He was dying. Thousands upon thousands of years had he reigned over the skies, protecting humanity from the vile Mishiginebig, the Horned Serpent who conspired to devour the world. But the serpent had vanished, many years ago, and left Onimikì without purpose. Denied his duty, he had begun to fade away, until he was but a fraction of himself. It was a fate that had befallen all his siblings before him, prideful Anzû, wise Simurgh, mighty Ra, enigmatic Faravahar, and even the vile Huitzilopochtli. There were others of course, but none so dear to him as his lost brothers and sisters.

Now he followed in the last of their legacy. His body would fade away with the breaking of his final storm, but his spirit would live on in a new form. Reborn into the world in a new body, a new life. It would all end soon, then it would begin again, an endless cycle. The storm raged on, waves battering the shore, wind tearing the trees and shredding the turf. Onimikì flew across the moors, his wings flattening the grass for kilometers as he dived and crested. He let loose a cry of joy as he sensed what he was looking for, the thunderous sound shaking the world around him.

There, down below, lay a small human village, sheltered from the worst of the storm by tall hills and strong trees. In a quaint cottage near the center of the town, an altogether different kind of storm was building. Two bodies crashing against each other like waves on the rock, lightning surging between them as they cried out in their own thunderous voices. Their passion raged like the storm-torn ocean, rising to a crest as their hearts beat in unison. As Onimikì cried out again, shaking their cottage with his joy, the thunder roared in time with their love. They reached the crescendo they both longed for, and as their hearts stopped for a mere instant, the storm broke.

The skies began to calm as James and Lily Potter clutched each other tightly, whispering their love and joy. As they drifted off to sleep in each others arms, they were unaware of the gray feathers falling around Godric's Hollow, feathers that would disappear with the morning sun as muggle scientists tried in vain to explain how the impossible storm had broken so suddenly. They were also unaware, though not for long, of the new life they had brought into the world...
