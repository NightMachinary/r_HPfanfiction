:END:
I'm looking for specific FanFiction story on fanfiction.net that has Lucius Malfoy/Sirius Black and narcissa Malfoy/Severus Snape as a couple. is a dark Harry/Voldemort and dark Sirius story. And before Voldemort died on Halloween 1981 Sirius was only with the light because he loved James as a brother. I was reading it and really loved it but I lost the story and I would really appreciate it if somebody could help me find it again. Thank you very much

PS I don't know if I did this right this the first time I posted anything ever and English is not my first language
