[[https://mymodernmet.com/inner-monologue/]] Prompt inspired by this article and the fact that apparently only about half the population have an inner monologue (I don't! So I always thought it was funny and just a creative liberty when authors described characters as thinking things and then things like "shit hope she didn't notice")


** Huh. Favorite character is Neville Longbottom. Second favorite depends on which fic's I've been reading, but Hermione is the most likely, even if the fanon for her is typically drivel.

I imagine that Hermione's the one who has the internal monologue going and Neville's just listening to her madness because she rants and raves in her head about the silliest of things and has the oddest of secrets. He's honestly quite scared of her, really, after hearing her thoughts...
