I have always wanted to read a fic about life at Hogwarts during the 80's and whether or not muggle fashion influenced the wizarding world.

Wild hair, neon accessories, leg warmers, the muggleborns obsessed with someone named "Michael Jillson".

If we need a lead to follow how about Bill Weasley? He went to Hogwarts starting 82 and graduating in 89.

I would love to see what you guys come up with! :D


** That's a great idea!! I would love to read a fic like this!
