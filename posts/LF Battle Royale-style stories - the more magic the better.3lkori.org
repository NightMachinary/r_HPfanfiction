I would have said Hunger Games as well, but I've neither read the books nor watched the films yet. Ideally they would have either access to wands at some point, or other magical items/ingredients throughout the game. Haven't had much luck in this venture, unfortunately. :/


** Hogwarts battle school is sort of similar - hasn't been updated in a while though

*** I don't think he meant a fic like that. I think he meant a fic focusing one single game which has 1 single survivor.

** I recall seeing at least a few one-shots like that, but none of them were good enough to stick in my mind.

** Honesty I don't know of any; but I would recommend checking Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero, and Fate/Extra Crossovers for something similar.

** Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality has several chapters dedicated to battles between "armies" led by students. There are some very entertaining one-on-one fights within the battles, so maybe this could be up your alley?

**** I loved it, and friends of mine who have read it also enjoyed it quite a bit. You have a few upvotes, so you're obviously not alone in disagreeing with me, but would you care to explain why you think so?

***** For a lot of people, it's less of a fic than one-part "fix-it" story, one-part Author Tract. Harry's character appears to be transplanted directly from the author's own views about science and philosophy etc.

***** it's not the story itself, but the attitude of the author and fans on this site that have turned so many here against it. I agree with you that just as a fanfiction story it's quite enjoyable, however, those proselytizing it as the one true light of rational thought have made HPMOR fashionable to hate on this sub, much like Twilight is hated on the rest of reddit.

** Have you read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? It's not Hunger-Games-esque... But it definitely has gritty fight scenes.

^{[Just a warning, and don't bother with the sequel; it's not as good.]}
