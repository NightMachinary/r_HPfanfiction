I just want to see them get together /because they want to/ for once. Circumstances forcing them to interact are fine as long as it's not "and once they kiss/have sex/fall in love they will be free".

Thanks in advance.


** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon have been my favourites for over a decade now. (/Beautiful World/ is a heartbreaker, though! Have tissues on hand.) Some others I quite enjoy:

- Here's the Pencil, Make it Work
- Then Comes a Mist and Weeping Rain
- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/metisket/refraction.html][Refraction]] - this one's a bit weird, but I enjoyed it.
- [[http://dragongirl16.livejournal.com/95485.html][Faith]] - this one has bashing, just in case that's not your thing. Also *warning for some serious violence/gore*. (And it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1318020/1/Faith][on FFN]], but I don't know if it's the updated version or not so you might want to read the LJ version which I first linked.)

  Draco has to face the truth of who he is. The truth has long hair and slobbers.Request: Fluff, humor, angst (but only if it's resolved with happiness at the end), happy endings. Getting-together-fics [. . .] If there's plot, that is even more exciting, [. . . ] clueless!Harry . . . dragon_charmer, there was going to be more of that plot thing in here, and also learning to be an Animagus for plot furthering purposes, but said plot sort of went crazy, and in the end I had to reduce the original outline for the story. Even though this is really, really long, it's mostly character studies! I hope it gives you something of what you wanted, anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a trainee Auror, and Draco is living at Malfoy Manor, bored and petulant with nothing to do, and no career prospects. Draco's attempt to heal himself via Muggle psychology -- including writing a series of 'why I hate you' letters to Harry -- backfires when an overanxious house elf delivers the results to Harry. Harry is bemused, Draco is angry and together they have a lot of issues to work out.

*** I havent read Beautiful World, although it is on my list, but I have to disagree with the rec for Beneath You. Beneath You is a bond-fic (although not /really/ non/con), where Harry and Draco start writing back and forth in a journal together and due to a potions mishap the ink kinda puts them under a bond-type thing. I actually love bond-fics (although OP does not seem to like them) but this fic's execution just wasn't the best. I didn't even finish it because it got pretty boring. I think that it is one of those from early(ish) fandom that just doesn't hold up.

Love a bunch of your other recs though - of the ones I have read. Just my two cents :/

**** Fair enough, to each their own. :)

I forget about the bonding in Beneath You because it's not the huge focus. I know it plays a factor in the ending, but I guess I never really thought of it as a bond-fic. But then, I'm not that familiar with the genre; there's only one I've read because the concept has never appealed to me.

I'm happy to come up with a few "curated" recs, but if you aren't sure and just want a bunch of choices you can check out my ao3 bookmarks which is where I keep all I've read with notes and recs. Just filter by Harry/Draco. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]

*** Well I dropped the pairing (and the fandom mostly) for a few years and was getting back into it over the last month. I found out that I cannot stand non-con or bashing, that I prefere at least Harry to be a self confident character and that I don't really like children enough to want them around in an FF all the time if they aren't the main characters (especially child OCs), though I can get past that last one. Other than that I will read almost anything from Pre-Hogwarts fluff over war time angst to post-war redemption to non magic AUs or time travel. I will read almost every plot if it's well written and has good charactarization.

If you have any stories that you specifically liked than I'd be glad to hear about them but for now I'll look through your bookmarks list. ^{^}

**** Okay some that come to mind off the top of my head that fit your criteria are the following:

Recently I loved the *Gentlewizards Club* and the sequel *A Madness Most Discreet*. The Draco in this fic is so lovable you will smile a lot while reading it. linkao3(6148987) (linkao3(2106744)

A cool fic I recently read was *Eye of the Beholder* by pir8fancier - linkao3(639538) This fic was really unusual and well done - it reads like a portrait of Draco Malfoy. It is written in the first person (Draco's) and is an introspective and detailed account of Draco's whole life - his motivations, his thoughts and opinions, his participation in the war, his relationship with his son and wife and how he came to discover he was gay. The relationship between Draco and Harry is well done, although it felt pretty secondary to the rest of the story - which was also somewhat a breath of fresh air for H/D slash. This fic is also totally epilogue compliant and reads like a well done version of the author's head canon on who Draco is/was and how he turned out within the confines of canon.

*If the Sun Goes Black* and the prequel *There Is Always the Moon* are really good mystery-ish fics set a few years after hogwarts. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098). There is Always the Moon is one of the best fics I have read this year - if not the best.

Probably my favorite of all Drarry fics is *Twist of Fate* by Oakstone730 - Linkao3(473335). In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Snape forces Draco to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This story is expertly woven into the fabric of canon so much so that part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but it is also pretty heartbreaking..

*Friend Like Me* and the companion piece *Friend Like You* are also really heartbreaking angst fests. Friend like me is a haunting and beautiful short that goes in depth into a daydream that Draco has where he and Harry became friends first year. It is really sad and really beautifully written. The companion piece is from Harry's POV. linkao3(495908)

*The Printed Press* by Soupy_George is another favorite. It is an incredibly cute and well thought out fic where Draco is hired to write Harry's memoirs. I love journalist Draco (probably because of TURN) and this fic was angsty but not too crazy, well written and sweet. I also love that the plot device of the memoirs forces Harry and Draco to talk about all of the things that happened at hogwarts year by year - it is so cathartic for a Drarry fan and suuuper well done. linkao3(1124273)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy Until the Sun Rise]] - This is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done.

Okay that is so many fics - I could seriously put so many more, but I already linked my masterlist of recs so that I dont spend the afternoon linking.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** As gotkate86 said, there are a lot of great Drarry fics that don't have those tropes.

Some fics I enjoyed were:

*Turn*

*Must Love Quidditch*

*Chaos Theory*

*Tea and No Sympathy*

*In Pieces*

There are many, many more so just let us know what in particular you are looking for (Hogwarts, Post Hogwarts, Aurors, Time Travel etc.) and we can provide more links!

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

** [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=330][Vorabiza]] is great for that. /Secrets/ and /Malfoy Flavor/ are two of my favorite novel-length fics (despite the atrocious title of the 2nd - try it anyway). There are a couple of fics with other pairings there, but most are Drarry.

  This is the story "The Things That Voldemort Took" written from Draco's perspective. It would be sporting to read that one first. Draco and Marcus swear excessively. Hence the M. Sorry, JKR. At least I don't make money from this.
