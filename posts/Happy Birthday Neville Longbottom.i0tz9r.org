To celebrate the birthday boy, give me some fics with a badass Neville. Whether or not he is the MC, I don't care about pairings, I just want Neville Longbottom kicking ass and taking names.


** I seem to remember one where he was with a magically enlarged giant Trevor, kicking death eater ass in Hogwarts during the battle, and also travelled back in time.

I think it was also a HP/DG pairing too but cant remember. Anyone knows what im talking about?

*** I recognize that one. Doesn't the castle itself get animated as well during that battle?

.... I can't for the life of me remember what it's called @.@

  The resting place of stories that started out strong before the muse that was driving them took off for parts unknown. All of these are up for adoption, if they appeal to you, and you think you can make them work, have at it. Let me know when you publish, so I can see how they look when they grow up.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
