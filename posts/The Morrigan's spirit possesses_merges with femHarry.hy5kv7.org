I have had this premise in my head for a while now, but I don't want to overwhelm myself with too many WIP-fics (except I know I will start writing this sooner rather than later).

In case you don't know:

#+begin_quote
  The Morrigan (also Mórrigan or Morrigu) is one of the most mysterious figures in Irish mythology.

  The name Morrigan means 'phantom queen' (or 'great queen') and describes a Goddess from old Ireland that was very associated with war, destiny, fate and death.

  She was a shape-shifter and frequently appeared as a black crow, an ominous sign for those who saw her prior to battle. Legend has it that the Morrigan was in fact a triad of sisters, often named as Badb, Macha and Nemain, while the Morrigan is also remembered as the triad of the land Goddesses Ériu, Banba and Fódla.

  Such was her influence over the land of Ireland that it is from áariu that the word 'Eire' and 'land' ('Ériu-land'), developed into 'Ireland', in effect naming the country!

I think this could be a very interesting and unique premise. I imagined the Morrigan banishing the Horcrux and grooming/shaping fem!Harry by teaching her obscure and ancient magics. The dynamics with all sorts of characters would shift, the way the war plays out.

You know what, I'll just write it, but I will leave this prompt for anyone who thinks this could be something for them to write and for anyone else to expand on it!

I hope some of you will find this interesting!

** I've had a similar idea strike me where fem!Harry becomes the Morrigan after collecting/mastering all three hallows.

I conceived of it as a marvel crossover where the celtic pantheon (taking stuff from british/welsh mythology as well as irish) had been allied with asgard against the giants & fomorians before Hela went mad and turned on them, 'killing' most of the pantheon off. The Morrigan survived by creating the Hallows.

The problem for me is that i can come up with ideas all the time, but im sh!te at actually writing stories

** There is a Ginny-centric trilogy that centers on this! Very well written but I think the third fic was never finished. The first two were excellent, though.

linkffn(the rebirth by Irina) is the first one.

  A thousand year old power is reawakened and Ginny must decide--how much is she willing to sacrifice for her destiny? Romance, adventure, drama, cosmic fate, and a scary Celtic goddess. [Part one in a trilogy - COMPLETE]

*** Dagda would be a must since, apparently, he is said to be her husband and they had a child together. Her mother is said to be the mother-goddess Ernmas. Not sure about Ériu, Banba, and Fódla though. Are they seen as separate entities or was Morrigan believed to be them? Same with Badb, Macha and Nemain. There are also the Fomorians, whom Morrigan fought together with the Tuatha Dé Danann.

Of course, my knowledge comes from Google research, so no clue how accurate any of this is. I'd try to be as faithful to Irish mythology as possible, but also take some liberties, obviously. At the end, it is a prompt and depends on what those, who are interested in it, want to make of it.

***** That would be fem!Harry, obviously, though how far others will go depends on them. With what I have in mind, at some point, the Morrigan will merge with fem!Harry so fem!Harry will become (the next) Morrigan. Before that, the Morrigan will replace the Horcrux by destroying it. I don't plan on any other wizards or witches getting that role. It would take away from the premise and the unique situation fem!Harry will find herself in, IMO.
