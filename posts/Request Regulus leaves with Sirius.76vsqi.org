Always wondered what would happen if Regulus left with Sirius when Sirius left his home. He could end up as a spy, helping Dumbledore with Voldemort or living a more peaceful life then he was or whatever.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather it be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

  Even before he goes to Hogwarts, Regulus knows he wants to be a Gryffindor. There's no way he'll let himself be a snake, like his mother, his father, his aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and every other person on the family tree. He likes Sirius much better than the rest of his family, anyway.So when the Sorting Hat asks him where he thinks he belongs, Regulus knows what to say.AU where Regulus is sorted into Gryffindor. This doesn't actually really discuss their school days, it'll jump right to after Regulus has graduated, but I do want to write about his time at Hogwarts at some point. Also PSA, this is unedited, so I'll be going through and changing things that don't make sense or are otherwise inconsistent. If you see something confusing or weird, please let me know so I can fix it!

***** It's rated T as well, which is odd given that warning. Hopefully some other brave soul will click and report back what this means.

****** I got about five chapters in before I gave up. Don't like the writing style. And I backed out before the spanking... Based on what I did read, I'm fairly certain it's not sexy spanking... It was going to be Sirius disciplining Regulus. Which is where I think I'd nope out anyway - 17 year old spanking his 14 brother? Nah, I'm good!

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.
