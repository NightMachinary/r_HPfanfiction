Looking for any Snape/Lily fanfiction where Lily breaks it off with Snape BUT doesn't get alone with James regardless. The two however make up after Hogwarts (Or maybe just a year or two later while they are still attending Hogwarts?). Good Writing and Plot would be awesome as well. I don't read first person perspective >,> so pls 3rd person. Oh also, not looking for a fic where Severus is an idiot and keeps doing things he shouldn't xD. I would like one where he has self control. Also don't want any time travel fics >,>


** Do you mind reading a redo fic? As in Snape dies but is reborn in his teenage body?

The most famous would be The Moment it Began linkffn(3735743), but I feel like it went downhill towards the end. Also, it focuses a lot on Snape rebuilding ties with his family. But it is the most famous Snape/Lily fic so it would be foolish not to mention it.

I'm reading a very good one now called The Peace Not Promised linkffn(12369512) , which does focus more on the Snily Romance, with Snape trying to reform the Slytherin House from within. It's ongoing but 40 chapters so far, and there's a lot of emphasis on Dumbledore too. This fic is unique in exploring his past without bashing him. I love this one because Snape acts like his cannon counterpart and doesn't become an OOC marshmallow at the sight of Lily

If you like dark fics, there's an amazing AU called Puzzle linkffn(6622580) which is a want of a nail story in which Lily is spared, but Obliviated of her memories of James and Harry. Voldemort has won, and Muggleborns are treated as slaves. Once she regains her memory, it's her mission to bring down the Dark Lord. With the help of Sirius and Regulus (somehow still alive), and Severus they hunt down the Horcruxes

*** Idk. Tbh I used to really like time travel fics but then at a certain point, I started thinking that it was kind've weird. Like physically it isn't weird probably but mentally to me is a little... pedophilia? Idk I just stopped liking those types of fics as much. This is probably my one and favorite fiction with time travel involved Come once again and love me linkffn(7670834) It had a good ending with angst. Something like The path not tread would be awesome. I used to like that fanfic but lately, to me, I don't like the increase involvment of Remus, and it feels like the plot isn't advancing as fast as it should, it's mostly character development of the 3 together last time I was updated on it

**** I agree it is odd, and it gets weirder when the author acknowledges it's weirdness. I guess it's why most of these Snily fics are quite chaste. Nothing sexual happens, and Snape whinges for 20+ chapters. I'll see if I can find a regular teenage!Snape, but I think Sindie created a bad precedent. I've found one where Snape is a teenager who receives nightmares of the future and uses them to change his destiny linkffn(12129370)

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** linkffn(8134710)- "a dream carved in stone"- is your best bet.

linkao3(14046060) also comes to mind.

linkffn(404166; 6613973) are also good but they have some James/Lily.
