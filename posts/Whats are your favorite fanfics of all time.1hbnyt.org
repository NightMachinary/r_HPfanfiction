** The Hogs Head by MyGinevra was the first fanfic I read, Harry/Ginny and set my penname in homage to the author than got me hooked.

Vox Coporis for showing me Harry/Hermione (turned me into a Harmonian...too bad about the penname)

Hope, White Knight Grey Queen, stick in my head because they showed me other pairings that could be better than cannon and make as much sense as H/Hr. Also Hope with the age difference showed me what a perv I am about age differences... still not sure it was a good thing but I enjoy Harry/Gabby with a passion.

Sorry for no links, but I'm lazy. This thread has been done before, but I am also to lazy to reference the others even though they have great suggestions.

** I'm going to take this opportunity to gush about the brilliant fanfic, The Knight Errant Chronicles by Guernica Shaw.

It's a very long adventure romance story starring Snape and an OC. When I was a teenager, I read the whole thing (thousands of pages, over a million words) several times because I was completely fascinated, awed, and obsessed by this author's portrayal of Snape.

The story is just so long and full of life and action and color and genuine emotions. It does a good job of characterization of the OC, Lucius Malfoy, and Snape, making them fully rounded people. Action, spying, social and political intrigue. And really excellent and memorable sex scenes. The Death Eaters and Malfoys and all believable people. EXTREMELY highly recommmended.

Throughout the three "chronicles," this creative and long-winded author draws many comparisons between Snape and Hamlet, by introducing a story arc where where Snape was in a difficult relationship with Bellatrix Lestrange, who betrayed him and caused the death of Snape's best friend (echoing the way Hamlet's mother betrayed his father). It goes into a biography of Snape's life as a child that goes beyond what is canon-compliant because it so awesome and magical, describing him as growing up in the Orkneys and becoming familiar with the mythological creatures there.

As a note, this fanfic was written before DH, so it chooses to make little or no mention of Lily Potter, instead using story arcs with Lestrange and the Death Eaters to explain most of Snape's baggage.

Even though I love this story, I admit that it is not perfect. It has flaws. The POV character is an OC, who does have many traits in common with a Mary Sue. She is a fairy warrior who comes to teach self-defense at Hogwarts after she was exiled from the fairylands, and as a representative of her country, she gets involved in political intrigue in the conflict with Voldemort at a high level. She's beautiful, good at sword fighting, teaching self-defense to Snape, saves innocent victims from death, the works. But the author is also intelligent and aware of the Mary Sue-like tendencies, and she really does make a dilligent effort to write a character who also human and flawed at times. She and Snape do NOT easily get together, they are constantly fighting, in fact they take thousands of pages to really get together. And the payoff is IMMENSE. So for that, I say any mary-sue-like weaknesses can be forgiven and overlooked.

This story would also be great for fans of Lucius Malfoy. The main character gets romantically involved with him as well, since they know each other from his visit to the fairylands; and their relationship gets twisted and gets darker and darker as Malfoy violates her boundaries and she finds herself starting to become ensnared in both the conflict with Voldemort and the Malfoy family.
