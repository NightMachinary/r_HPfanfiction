So I'm sure a lot of us have found stories where Harry becomes an Animagus via accidental magic or some shit at a young age, and its treated as just another ability. But what if there is a reason people advise wizards and witches not to become Animagi when they are young? What if when a person becomes an Animagus as a child or teenager, that animals mannerisms and features start to bleed into the human form? Like, turning into a cat form and disliking water in human form, and making developing sharper teeth and slightly cat-like eyes. Maybe even having to deal with animal instincts in human form, or even having trouble turning back into human.

â€‹

Would make for a more interesting story than "Harry becomes a wolf animagus and it's nothing more than a parlor trick for the entire series"


** It's been a while since I've read it but I do believe you're describing the plot to linkffn(6690487), Growing Up Kneazle wherein Harry gets stuck for a good few years in the magical cat form and ends up at Hogwarts more cat than boy much to Dumbledore's distress even seeing another cat in the mirror of eriseD.

I agree it's more interesting, too many fanfics treat it like just another transfiguration- Perhaps Animorphs should be required reading for any animagus fanfic author.

** Indeed. I generally assume even when your older when you achieve the feat, it influences you in human form in my stories. Hermione was quite catlike, for example, including instincts, in Lady Thief.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I remember reading a story that was posted on this sub, a one-shot about Sirius living disguised as Ginny's pet dog for months, which causes him to get stuck in dog form forever. Sorry that I can't remember the title.

** I think that children seem to be much more influenced and adaptable to things than adults, meaning that he might get stuck that way/

*** Oh most probably. I can see Harry being discovered in his animal form, then getting forced out of it and having to deal with living as a human, all the while trying to figure out how to turn back xD

** I hate it when a fic spends 3 chapter making Harry an Animagus before completely ignoring it.

I won't say the principle of Chekhov's gun is perfect and anything that doesn't follow it is trash, but if you only add something to a fic to "make this character cool", it can probably be ignored.
