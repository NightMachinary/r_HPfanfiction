Rule 9 now states:

#+begin_quote
  No Request thread bashing. Do not utilize a request thread to make negative commentary on the subject or linked fics. Note: If the requestor has marked the request thread [No Discussion], all comments besides links to fics will be removed.
#+end_quote

The rule change is not as far as some people wanted, but I think it's a fair compromise.

Regarding the [No Discussion] tags: I am going to respect this when people mark it, but I will refrain from using it myself. I'd implore you all to do the same.

Let's thank our mods for taking an honest look at this. I appreciate you guys.

Edit: Regarding this:

#+begin_quote
  Do not utilize a request thread to make negative commentary on the subject or */linked fics/*.
#+end_quote

I've spoken to [[/u/the-phony-pony]] and they reassured me that this was not intended to disallow a negative review/discussion of writing quality or opinion, and the wording will be looked at to remove any such ambiguity.

#+begin_quote

  - You may say </Fic Title/> is a Hinny, but I disliked it for various reasons

  - You may not say </Fic Title/> is a disgusting piece of trash and you're sick if you enjoy it
#+end_quote


** So what you're saying is, if I thought that the Harry Potter and the Never Ending Summer is bad because of the many mistakes made by the author like Orion Black not being the father of Sirius, both rather an original character. However, I can't say that it's awful and that people who enjoy it are awful too. I assume I'm correct on this matter?

  However, I cannot just outright say Summer of Change is garbage, and for five year olds, correct?
#+end_quote

I'd argue you probably can say that if you provided a reasonable justification. That way you aren't just being a dong and are inspiring discussion. Certainly in a discussion thread you could say this.

Nobody is saying you have to be an emotionless zombie. Just don't shit on the things other people love for no other reason than to antagonize or disparage them. It's not a hard concept.

*** Unless I'm wrong, the "discussion" under, er, discussion is discussing /the Request/, not the quality of any of the recommendation answering it.

Why would you ever want to do this? Maybe just let people enjoy what they want.

**** We as a team have seen *several* instances of an OP requesting specific fics and being called horribly derogatory names, sick, disgusting, etc for thinking about, liking, and wanting to read fics of such nature.

It's happened for slash fics and people looking for non-con/dub-con smut stories. In short, people suck. And unfortunately a lot of us forget the human behind the screen.

***** I would like to request certain types of fics, but I know I'm going to be trashed to death. Some stuff doesn't seem to be regarded well in this sub, no matter if it is in the rules.

**** I wouldn't, but I'm more or less trying to understand reddit as I go along. I was just using that as an example to understand. Although for it gain enough recognition for it to be acknowledged and furthermore help prevent that means sadly a lot of people do it. At least, enough to cause a problem.

** Thank fucking christ. Not being able to do anything but link to fics in those threads was moronic. Yeah, the bashing is awful and needs to not be there, but no discussion at all? Give me a break. Having to make an entire new thread just to say something about a different thread showed no one actually thought that rule through.
