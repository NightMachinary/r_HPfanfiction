I'm looking for a fic that has a similar tone as Deliberate by sifshasowheart. It doesn't have to be a/b/o verse mainly because I think this is literally the only story I've read in that genre I've enjoyed ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜†.

I love stories where harry gets lost in time or another dimension etc (I'm not picky) and figures shit out from sheer stubbornness. Falls in love etc. Only pairings I'm not keen on is Harry/Hermione or daphne/harry but I've been known to make an exception for a really good story, and my queer soul loves a good slash pairing. I feel like I've read everything lol

Mentioned story for those that are interested ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20069950/chapters/47532337]])
