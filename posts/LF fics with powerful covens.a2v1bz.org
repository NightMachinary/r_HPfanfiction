  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] This is the only other fic I can think of that involves powerful covens. But it's very different from The Reclamation of Black Magic, and not for everyone. TW: a dark fic, rape/torture/etc.

** There's a 'coven' in my OC work: linkffn(13098062). They have only a couple scenes so far, but will feature more prominently later.

#+begin_quote
  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.

** I'm also writing a fic centered on the concept of a coven, if you don't mind the bit of self-promotion. The whole story is about how the coven is formed and develops, and centered around female characters (will be Powerful!Hermione, which I just saw you like). If you prefer AO3, it's also there, same title same author name.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, "And what you don't realize is that we are not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

**** Oh, great! What a coincidence :)

I've to tell you though, the romance comes a bit later on in the story. First part is more about how the coven comes to be.
