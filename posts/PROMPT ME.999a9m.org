** Hmmmm....I'm better at prompting one-shots, but try this on for size:

- During the events of /Prisoner of Azkaban,/ Hagrid comes across a large, black dog. Hagrid decides to keep him for a new pet.

- Near the end of /Chamber of Secrets,/ when he receives word that Professor Dumbledore has returned to the school, Lucius Malfoy arrives five minutes early and comes face-to-face with the Weasleys.

- While stargazing, Hermione and Luna see a UFO

- While attempting to frame Hagrid for opening the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle is bitten by Aragog.

** An idea that I just thought of, not sure if it's any good but could be funny:

#+begin_quote
  Ron's an international chess champion with a sizeable fan base. Harry (Hermione or Ginny as well) weren't aware of this. Someone comes up to Harry asking for autographs and he thinks he's asking after him-but they're actually after Ron.

*** I think it would be a little better if somehow Ron was also ignorant of his fans - the entire group is taken completely by surprise.

Maybe he got magical chess set for christmas and didn't bother to read the manual. He assumes it's just enchanted to play against him, like an AI.

Turns out it actually connects to other chess sets and he's been playing against progressively better players, and the games are also recorded and tracked by chess fans. He's worked his way up the rankings to the point that he's got his own following. Hell, maybe he even has some respectable winnings waiting for him in a vault.

***** Thanks, I thought it would fit pretty well, and it seemed like a way of accomplishing it without Ron coming off like a complete idiot.

At what point in the story do you think it would be best for this to be revealed? I was thinking year 4-5.

****** In my head I was definitely imagining Year 6. In Year 5 Harry's hated a bit too much for autographs. Year 6 he's the talk of Hogwarts again.

Year 4, could definitetly work though.

** - Harry runs into Tonks at Kings Cross instead of the Weasleys, resulting in him ending up a Hufflepuff because she spent most of the train ride telling him funny stories about her previous 6 years there. He also gets introduced to Tonks' friends (6th and 7th years from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw) and the whole group ends up taking Harry under their wing. NO ROMANCE, no encounters with Malfoy or Ron on the train.

- Hermione is bitten by a werewolf (by Lupin in book 3 or somehow in book 5) and everyone either treats her like she is about to die or is just a worthless, mindless monster now. She merely rolls her eyes since a night a month as a werewolf isn't the end of the world and tries to continue her life as before while everyone keeps talking about packs, choosing an Alpha and all those crappy tropes common when it comes to werewolves. Harry, too, is confused why everyone stopped treating his best friend like a human and tries his best to help. Turn that into a romance if you like.

- Harry asks someone besides the usual suspects to be his Yule Ball date and acutally has a good time with them. Suggestions for rarely used characters: Katie Bell, Padma Patil, Lavender Brown, Fay Dunbar, Hannah Abbot, Megan Jones, Sue Li, Lisa Turpin or Morag McDougal. Those are all pretty much blank states, so try to come up with something original while not turning them into supermodels or porn stars when it comes to outward appearance.

- Slytherin Harry, but as he is the one who caused Voldemort's downfall, pretty much everyone there hates him. He makes one friend (Millicent Bulstrode or one of the Carrows from the year above him) and they stick together while facing a united, hostile house. Maybe have them switch out of Slytherin at some point (towards Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw).

** Lily Potter was once known as Lily Aldrin, and now Marshall, Barney, Ted, and Robin raise Harry. Make it as comedic as possible, and full with wacky adventures. Also make Harry be the Ted of Hogwarts, he's always looking for miss right(Ginny, or Hermione being the eventual miss right). Basically How I Met Your Mother - Magical Teenager edition.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** Its been a nearly a year since ginny died. Its been seven years to the day since harry gained mastery of all three hallows. His dreams have led him to believe that he can trade the power of the hallows for one wish of anything from power to money to bringing back someone who's dead. What is his wish?

(My thought would be to spare teddy being an orphan and bring back tonks but your choice)

** Hogwarts, which has always been sentient though benevolent, turned into a monster after the Battle of Hogwarts and eat people.

Another one: Mary Lou Barebone-esque uprising or underground movement but Golden Trio / post-DH era.

** A story where Harry's not a natural at flying. So during the first Flying class, when Draco flies off with the remembrall, Harry tries chasing after him but crashes. Without catching the remembrall, Harry wouldn't have made it on the quidditch team. I've been wondering what effects not being on the team might have.

I've always actually felt that his team had far too little influence. I've wanted to read a fic where the quidditch team is a tightly knit group that matters off of the pitch.

**** I was thinking more along the lines of how he might perform better academically, but I agree with you too. I don't think I've ever read a story where his teammates have anywhere close to the influence Ron and Hermione have on him.
