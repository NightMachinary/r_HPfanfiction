With Friends, i mean its not necessary that Draco and Ron are as good as Canon Harry and Ron, but atleast the Blond isnt mocking the Redhead and treats him with more respect...sure this would lead into an AU Fic, im fine with that as canonically none of these 3 would have a Family Business, but Draco. Its fine if Draco and Ron are adressing themselfs with their Family names, like in Canon, but this would be more in a "teasing Friendship" way, than with a mocking intention. If Tom is in those, he might be interested in a Corporation (or not) or possibly acts as some sort of "Teacher" about Business.

â€‹

It doesnt matter if the Fic contains smut, or if the 3 of them are married, but i would like them to be single for the time being. Possible having Fun with some Women and maybe later on do marry.

Hmm, now that i think about it....one or 2 of them being Gay or Bi would also be ok (maybe he can "convince" Tom for a corporation with him/them).


** Innocent by MarauderLover7 has the kind of friendly mocking between Ron and Draco, but it's still in 4th year and Draco's family business is spying for the Dark Lord while Ron's is helping Harry and helping Draco's secret role as double agent.
