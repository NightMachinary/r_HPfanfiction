Update: Changed some of the things that were not correct as I thought they were and explained some of my points better.

The education system in Harry Potter has always been a keen interest of mine. From what I understand there are no places of learning after Hogwarts. So the only formal education a witch or wizard of any background will ever get is at their school. Which makes it even more important that their school be the best of the best and give them the proper training. I honestly don't think Hogwarts is that great of a school let alone the best in the world. So I will breakdown this discussion into two parts. Hogwarts and where I think it fails as a school for promising young wizards and witches.

#+begin_quote
  */Harry Potter and the Ridiculous School of Witchcraft and Wizardry/*
#+end_quote

This is more of a mishmash of what I don't like about Hogwarts. For one, the is no formal introduction of muggleborn students into the magical world. From Dumbledore introducing young Tom Riddle Jr. we know that a teacher is sent to explain magic to a muggleborn child. But what about everything else? There is so much that needs to be told to them before they are thrown headfirst into a world that they've never known.

#+begin_quote
  Like how to use quills and parchment for one. I can barely use an ink pen without covering myself and the paper in black. I wouldn't know where to start with a quill. You also need to learn how to sharpen a quill and the basic upkeep of it.
#+end_quote

- - The only example of a muggleborn student interacting with a quill is Hermione and I think she excels is things most mere mortals would struggle with. Just because we don't see a student struggle doesn't mean that they don't. While we don't use hunks of charcoal to write doesn't mean children don't need to be shown how to sharpen pencils or even replace the lead in clutch pencils. Self-inking quills exist. Which would imply that most common quills do not hold ink for extended periods of time. On that note, why would ink be necessary if the quills aren't dip quills. Just like with any new medium, students need to be give some instruction about it. Maybe it happens off screen when the students first get introduced to the magical world and we just don't get to see it. Who knows. Would be cool to see though.*

#+begin_quote
  Students are taught similar things about brooms. How to polish them, keeping their bristles straight and how to keep them from killing you by failing midair.
#+end_quote

- - [[/u/MahouShoujoLumiPnzr][u/MahouShoujoLumiPnzr]] pointed out that there are such things as broom servicing kits. Which include Tail-Twig Clippers and polish meaning that the brooms have more care involved in it than just learning to ride one. Which I would assume is taught in Flying class unless they just let students figure that out on their own. They might. Who knows?*

The same level of detail should be given to the basics for muggleborn students. An introductory course if you will. Magical Studies as opposed to Muggle Studies. Another thing, why only Hogwarts? Do other schools not offer a place for students from other countries?

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is a private institution of learning. You have to pay for it.
#+end_quote

/Not true. It is a publicly funded institution by the Ministry of Magic. Probably explains why the MoM had such a stake in it./

Then why is there only Hogwarts? Why aren't students given the option to attend Beuabaxton or Drumstrung?

#+begin_quote
  Also, why do teachers visit students? Shouldn't it be the job of the government of the community that they will become a part of?
#+end_quote

- - I get that people believe that McGonagall or Dumbledore wouldn't play favorites to their school but here's a question. Why wouldn't they? It is in their benefit for students to attend their school since the tuition is paid for by the MoM. The more students there are the more money Hogwarts receives. They may not be outright with their bias but I think they would definitely lean in on Hogwarts and not put as much detail about other schools.*

On the topic of teachers, why are there so few teachers and why do they all have so many responsibilities? Minerva McGonagall is the Deputy Headmistress, the Head of Gryffindor House and the Transfiguration Professor. Severus Snape is both the Potions Professor and the Head of Slytherin House. Pomona Sprout is responsible for being both being the Herbology Professor and the Head of Hufflepuff House. Filius Flitwick is both the Charms Professor and the Head of Ravenclaw House.

#+begin_quote
  These teachers have double duties that would conflict with one another as well as leave them open to favoritism.
#+end_quote

- - I can understand that Heads of Houses are basically glorified guidance counselors. And again, monetary reasons would play a role in not hiring additional staff. While majority of the oversight of students is done by the prefects and the head boy and girl, there are still issues that might require a staff member. Maybe I don't entirely understand it.*

The head of a house could favor their own in class as Snape often does (staying undercover notwithstanding). Then again, I don't think Snape should even be allowed to teach. Who knows how many Potions Masters' careers he had killed before they even got the chance to get started simply form his vicious attitude. Even McGonagall bends a few rules for Harry during his time at Hogwarts such as allowing him to be a first year Quidditch player. The head of house, in my opinion should be not a teacher and is there to offer support to the students full-time, much like a residential coordinator.

Also, why is your caretaker a squib? Is it necessary to torture someone who cannot even cast a single spell by forcing them to be in the presence of eleven year-olds that have more ability than they ever will?

Lastly, the classes. The core classes taught at Hogwarts are: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology. First years also have Flying lessons. In third year students can add at least two elective: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures.

#+begin_quote
  I find the fact that Muggle Studies is an elective to be ridiculous. The muggle world outnumbers the wizarding world and has become more advanced.
#+end_quote

- - The advancements being in weaponry. Muggles simply have better fighting power than wizards. Looking purely at numbers, Rowling said that there are approximately 3000 wizarding kind in Britain. One third are Hogwarts students ranging from age 11 to 17. Leaving the size of the magical community that could withstand an all-out war to only be 2000. Britain has a non-magical population of approximately 65 million. That is an insane ratio. The magical community is outnumbered by the British military. The best statistics I can find suggest that in 1990 the British military had 156,000. Even if half of the trained soldiers are taken out by the magical population, the numbers would still be against them. Say 1000 wizards cast 1000 killing curses, if they can, the most they will be able to kill is 1000 muggles. Muggles on the other hand have anything from guns to tanks to missiles and nukes. Take your pick of how you'd die. I'm not saying that muggles are advanced in every single way possible. There are obvious advantages of being a wizard/witch. Instant teleportation being one of them, not to mention advanced healing and ability to manipulate reality around themselves. What muggles have is war and lots of it. *

#+begin_quote
  Muggle Studies should be a compulsory subject for all students for magical families as Magical Studies should be for all students from non-magical families.
#+end_quote

- - I've read the argument that wizards do not interact with the non-magical world but I don't think that is the case. Heck, the first book starts with Mr. Dursley complaining about strange people out in the streets celebrating. The 90s were so innocent. There is the whole thing with King's Cross though. In the first book, the Weasley family is seen traveling through the King's Cross portal to platform 9Â¾ unprompted. They have a floo network connection in their home, why are they going the way of muggleborn students? Conspiracy theories of Dumbledore grooming Harry into a hero aside, this does imply that that is the only way to get to the platform since it would just be easier to take the floo. Not to mention the entrances for the MoM being a phonebooth and a toilet.*

*/The only thing negating all of these arguments is muggle repelling charms but that still requires the magicals to get to the area and they would still set off a few alarms./*

One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts has a room where ANYTHING can be manifested and they fail to use it as a learning tool. Use is for Astronomy so students don't have to be out of bed late into the night.
#+end_quote

- - Now, I understand that this room is a secret and for good reason. Yet, I still think that it's not a well utilized secret. Harry can get the room to supply him with books and tools in order to teach DADA. Someone else could easily use it to teach more advanced subjects or even simple ones like astronomy. If the room can create Dark Detectors, maybe it can copy the advanced replica of the milkyway that [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] mentioned.*

Also, what is the point of Astronomy? Divination seems to be only successfully used by seers and is a waste of a subject in my opinion. Also, History of Magic is one of the most important subjects. Especially for a world that seems to produce dark lords on a regular basis. But instead of teaching something valuable, it is taught by one of the most boring persons on campus. Binns only teaches one thing, over and over.

#+begin_quote
  Why has he not been replaced yet?
#+end_quote

- - I can understand the argument of money but if the ministry pays for the students to attend and the students bring their own supplies of books and materials, shouldn't Hogwarts be able to hire one new teacher? I mean I understand that Binns doesn't want to go anywhere but this is the ONLY school in Britain. Does no one care about the results of OWLs or NEWTs?*

These are just some of my opinions about Hogwarts. I would love to know what you guys think and what you would change about them. Heck, I would love to know where you think I may have drawn the wrong conclusion. I will probably make another post about all the ways I would reconstruct the teaching system in magical Britain soon.


** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?
#+end_quote

Money. In PoA, Harry sees a moving model of the entire Milky Way galaxy which is specifically noted could replace his Astronomy classes. But it was also noted to be expensive.

Incidentally, an accurate, moving, real time model of the entire galaxy is also something far beyond current Muggle cosmology or computer science. So much for Muggles being "more advanced".

I'm never quite sure what people mean when they say Muggles are "more advanced" than wizards.

Is it a reference to understanding of the universe? If so then surely it's a non-starter. In a universe where magic exists, any description of the universe which does not take magic into account is just fundamentally wrong. Muggle scientific theories may be useful (thanks to their lack of interaction with magic) but in terms of their truth value, they are simply not correct. The universe is a far wackier place than Muggles believe, and a far more anthropocentric one. It's not just that Muggles are factually incorrect - their entire world view, informed by the content of their scientific theories, is false.

Is it a reference to capabilities? Again, this seems odd. Wizards have instant transportation, can regrow limbs, can delve into the mind, can rearrange matter. If they had any use for one, they could easily create a perpetual motion engine - with first year spells. The only areas where Muggles have an advantage in capabilities are 1) information storage and retrieval, 2) large scale production, 3) making large explosions. But number 2 wouldn't transfer to the wizarding world, due to the fact that casting magic cannot be automated, so that one is less that Muggles are more advanced and more that they are operating in a different paradigm. A Muggle with knowledge of logistics and manufacturing methods would not be able to improve wizarding production. As for number 3, it's not clear that creating very large non-magical explosions is useful for wizards.

Is it a reference to civics? If so, then it misses the point that wizarding problems are a mirror of Muggle ones. The wizarding world doesn't have gender or racial discrimination, but it does have species and blood discrimination. The wizarding government detains suspected terrorists indefinitely without trial in inhumane conditions, as the Muggle government does. Wizarding politicians are self-serving and advance policies designed to pander to their supporters rather than to improve the nation, as Muggle politicians do. Mainstream wizarding press is misleading, gossipy, and overtly politically biased, as the mainstream Muggle press is. And so on.

Ultimately, I feel like most people are referring to aesthetics. Wizards wear robes. They occupy buildings that are constructed out of traditional materials and in old architectural styles. They have traditional forms of entertainment such as sports and tabletop games, rather than consumption of entertainment media and video games. But these are the most trivial bases to compare a civilisation on.

Not necessarily. The Wizarding problems are obviously a twisted reflection of the Muggle ones, but they /are/ arguably much more serious and backwards (as it is their very nature as satire to be, Doylistically speaking). Sure, Muggles detain prisoners in /bad/ conditions, but they don't /knowingly obliterate their immortal soul/. Yes, there's still some racism left in the world, but it's a cultural thing; the /legal/ aspects are mostly handled; House-Elf slavery or the Goblins' second-class citizenship are unthinkable in the modern world.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's one way to look at it, but somehow it seems hard to reconcile with your /usual/ stance on magic vs. science. You see magic as something that /supersedes/ Muggle science and the natural order, rather than an undiscovered /side/ of physics as Muggles know them; if so, why should magic invalidate Muggle science? This would be akin to saying that the existence of artificial genetic manipulation somehow invalidates evolutionist biology. Muggles don't know that there's a cheat code to kick the laws of the universe in the backside, but they /do/ know the laws of the universe; wizards are the opposite; everyone's missing some key information there.

Oh, also, unrelated to those two quibbles I think there's another element that makes people assume wizards are "less advanced" than Muggles: space conquest. Take any "Muggles are better" fic, you have /very high/ odds of the pro-Muggle protagonist bluntly informing Draco Malfoy that Muggles have gone to the Moon and everyone will go "/Merlin's nostrils, WHAT!? what have we been doing with our lives? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!/"

Mark that I don't think that argument's right, necessarily. We don't hear about it, but it is my belief that some wizards /have/ gone to space and perfected the process, but it was never made a big deal out of because it's not, at the end of the day, very useful (except for collecting moonstones in use for potions).

There's a few matters wrapped up in here:

1. I think describing what went on in Guantanamo Bay etc as "bad conditions" is something of an understatement. Being physically and mentally tortured for years on end is I think just as bad as Dementor exposure.

2. The wizarding analogue of Muggle racism is blood prejudice. On that front, wizarding Britain had a Muggleborn Minister for Magic in the 1960s. The idea of there being legal blood discrimination (except, of course, in Voldemort's Ministry*) is a fandom creation. In canon, blood discrimination is also purely cultural, and like racism in real life, not something that comes up in polite conversation. Note, for example, that Lucius restrains himself from making comments about Muggleborns in front of Fudge in GoF. Not because Fudge does not share the same prejudices -- we know Fudge is naturally inclined to favour pure-bloods -- but because it is politically incorrect.

3. The creature situations have no real Muggle analogy and I included them largely for compleness' sake. (The Muggle analogy would be if we discovered intelligent alien life that was weaker than us). There are real discussions to be had on those matters - Goblins are far from innocent in the conflict between them and wizards, for example, and granting your most powerful advantage (knowledge of wand magic) to a persistent enemy would be incredibly foolish.

*Voldemort's Ministry is something of an aberration, in that it was built entirely upon the personal power of a single man. Each time Voldemort dies, his movement immediately collapses and wizarding Britain reverts to its norm of being roughly equivalent to Muggle society. I don't think it really says anything about wizarding society as a whole - give a white supremacist all the power of the US military and you'd get a similar result. It's a risk inherent to the existence of magic, which can concentrate an absurd amount of power in individuals, that a single person can shift the direction of an entire nation against its will.

Magic is not an invention or technology though. It is part of the supernatural order, rather than the natural one, but it is something which exists independently of wizards. It's still part of the universe, it's just that the universe has two parallel sets of rules.

However, the fact that one of those sets overrules the other indicates that they aren't really parallel but rather that one is senior and the other is junior. So, for example, if wizards have a description of matter and Muggles have a contradictory description of matter, it is the wizarding one which tells the real story because, when the two come into conflict, the world will behave according to the wizarding understanding.

***** I was definitely referring to sentient nonhumans; I am quite aware that there is no legalized blood prejudice. But though Goblins may not be entirely blameless, the fact remains that nonhuman rights /is/ an issue where the Wizarding World is /unspeakably/ behind the Muggle one on the matter of civic rights.

I would say you are wrong to say they have absolutely no parallels, too; it seems clear there are /some/ kinds of comparisons to be drawn for Goblins, Centaurs and House-Elves, though not really for the more obscure ones (Erklings, Banshees, Yumboes...) and none as direct as with the blood-prejudice. Goblins' situation seems akin to the status of Jewish people in Europe for large stretches of history (disliked by most, second-class citizens at best, but still trusted with banking; stereotyped as greedy and dishonest; have a language that is proverbially unintelligible to those who haven't learned it), House-Elves have been compared with black people slavery but I'd also compare it to the apalling way European upper-classes would look down on servants up to the 20th century, and there are shades of Native Americans and other colonized so-called "savages" in the Centaurs.

But as you can see, all the parallels with the sentient nonhumans are /historical/ ones; antisemitism, classism and colonialism are not /dead/, but they are no longer the majority, nor /officially enforced/, as they are in the WW.

Hm... I don't think I quite agree with that. As I said, magic seems to me like "cheat codes" that override a video game's primary mechanics; in most cases, when the two clash, magic will supersede the natural order --- but magic is the active action of living beings. Left on their own, things work according to physical laws; and /if/ a magical creature interferes the laws of magic take over.

This is what I mean when I say comparisons aren't really good to make with these creatures: for all that we can see, there's a very good chance that the untrue stereotypes about Jews are actually true about goblins. They may in fact enjoy eating children, and they may be treacherous and greedy by nature. Certainly they act like it in the books.

Indeed, while the comparison with Jews is too neat to be accidental, I'm not sure that JKR was intending, with goblins, to have them be a sympathetic victim as Muggleborns are. Rather, I think she was doing something different with goblins: she's not positioning them as a wizarding analogy for a Muggle prejudices, but rather is doing worldbuilding such that the true stories about goblins were the historical origin of the incorrect stereotypes about Jews.

The point here is that, unlike all the targets of biotry in real life, /goblins are not human/. It's entirely possible that there are good reasons to be prejudiced against them. There must be a reason that JKR did not choose to introduce a single sympathetic goblin and that even the "enlightened" characters like Hagrid are immensely wary of them.

(Sometimes I amuse myself with the idea that Harry Potter goblins are the distant descendents of Lord of the Rings goblins - they certainly seem to share a certain innate evilness.)

******* Hm. I am immensely creeped out by the idea of an inherently evil sentient species, and I doubt that Christian J.K. Rowling would truly populate her world with such creatures. But whatever may be said of Goblins, she still presents House-Elves' abuse as unambiguously a bad thing, and the prejudice against Centaurs likewise; those are still things where the Wizarding World remains inferior to the Muggle world in the ethics department.

As to your pet-theory, didn't Tolkien say that he loathed to think of any sentient beings as inherently evil (much as myself)? That he once considered to have them be more like golems than real people to resolve that problem --- something that cannot be true of HP Goblins, either? And much has been made of the mention that "members of all races except Elves fought against Sauron in the final battle", which would imply some rebellious Orcs. Really, laugh all you like, my preferred view of Tolkien's Goblins, and one not far from his intention, is that presented in the Rankin-Bass film, with the /Where There's a Whip/ song. Beings of primitive culture who are born to serve the Dark Lord(s), but who don't necessarily /want/ to go out of their way to do evil individually, though some do and become the leaders.

******* Why would you think HP goblins are inherently evil? They seem to mirror wizarding society to me -- most of them put their heads down and follow Voldemort's rule, while a few of them refuse to do so and go in hiding with the muggleborns. If anything DH seems to challenge the concept, by bringing up cultural differences and Harry wondering whether the sword was rightfully Gryffindor's. Also, Hermione says (in reference to Goblins) /Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races/, establishing wizarding PoV as biased. Griphook dislikes Death Eaters in particular (screws them over with the fake sword), is brave enough to lie to Bellatrix's face, disapproves of house elf oppression and despises the idea of stealing what is not is. He is hardly good -- he dislikes most wizards for the oppression of his species -- but then, his views are mentioned to be extremist among goblins.

None of this makes goblins treacherous by nature, or make them close to innately evil. People are just mad Griphook made off with the sword before Harry could stab him in the back.

Hagrid is also immensely "wary" of Slytherins and foreigners. Hermione (in DH, not GoF) is sympathetic to goblins. I think by DH she's more reliable than Hagrid in these matter.s

Sure every once in a while someone will just be too good to be kept down, but mostly? You bet that if this bias is widespread (I mean even the Weasleys don't speak of their squib family member (the accountant!) because they frankly are probably disgusted (or afraid that asociating with that guy will make them more likely to have squibs or something!) and Ron wasn't punished or reprimanded for confunding his driving instructor!

Or even overtly mysoginistic laws, like in India, where marital rape is legal. I don't agree that the difference in scope is actually that big. Second class citizenship is unthinkable? Don't think so: in Saudi Arabia women aren't allowed to drive. If thats not second class citizenship then idk what is.

The current president of the USA was talking about "Mexico sending rapists" just last April. Thats as scary as a "Lord Malfoy" spewing bigoted bullshit. So no, i wouldnt say the legal side is "mostly" handled, when the most powerfull man in the world can spew openly bigoted bullshit and remain in office.

** The Head of Houses seems a weird criticism to me. Not that we ever took school houses half as seriously as Hogwarts but our Head of Houses were teachers (with student captains doing most of what the role actually entailed-cheering on students at sport events basically).

Other than what others have said. I think it's worth noting that Hogwarts is a bit of collection of the worst tropes for teachers-we've all had the 'boring history teacher', the Snape teacher, the absolutetly useless teacher (Trelawney) and so on.

Yes and no. There is a sort of apprenticeship-system. Once you enroll in your chosen career, if it's not a personal one like Diagon Alley shopkeeper, you'll have additional specific training (we see this for Ministry work, Healing, and Aurors).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You're thinking awfully Muggle. It seems obvious to me those quills are /enchanted/, not something plucked right off some random pheasant in the wilderness. So they wouldn't /need/ sharpening, and may even enable easy writing to an extent.

#+begin_quote
  How to polish them, keeping their bristles straight
#+end_quote

Again, you don't need to do that on a magical broom. There are Charms to keep it in pristine condition. If the Charms start to fail, then the broom is just too old for use, and that's that.

#+begin_quote
  and how to keep them from killing you by failing midair.

The teacher usually handling such matters is Professor McGonagall. Does she strike you as a manipulative type who would intentionally mislead the students? Really? I can't give you any exact quotes, but Hagrid, too, refers to Hogwarts as "the best magic school'n the world" or something of the sort when describing it to Harry. This, by default, implies there are others. If the child (or his parents) enquire about these, I find it hard to believe Hagrid, or Dumbledore, or McGonagall, would withhold information about them.

Wizards bandying about in public and in robes or celebrating major events by conjuring shooting stars in the sky (which end up on the muggle news, as in book 1)... it creates a problem for maintaining the Statute of Secrecy.

**** I think you overestimate the risks of a breach of the statute. In the HP universe, Muggles have a kind of in-built psychological instinct to reject the existence of magic even when it occurs right in front of their eyes. This phenomenon is referred to in many places: the existence of the book "The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know", the Pottermore article on wizarding radio and TV, and an entry in Fantastic Beasts about Muggles ignoring magical creatures.

The most extreme example, of course, is the Knight Bus, which we are told Muggles ignore simply because they are insufficiently observant to notice reality being rearranged around them (including entire buildings, occupied by Muggles, jumping around before their eyes).

For all that wizards in the HP universe are depicted as being silly, Muggles are depicted as being equally silly, just in the opposite direction.

His comment seemed more like an example of the dismissive view many wizards have about muggles. Getting rid of that and following the SoS carefully seems like a perfectly reasonable reason to make a decent, mandatory Muggle Studies course.

The Roberts in GoF had to be repeatedly Obliviated (even before the Death Eaters showed up) simply due to their growing suspicions about the odd things they were seeing and hearing (the one we see actually happen was done rather preemptively). It's probably more thwan most muggles aren't sufficiently exposed to magical phenomena to give it real thought.

** You can -sort of- justify the canon magical world that way:

Perhaps magicals doesn't want to learn more? Perhaps they are content the way things are? Why would magicals need to learn more? Even without an income, they can actually live quite comfortably with just their wands alone. Yes Weasley family was poor but they were not suffering. They just couldn't buy some fancy stuff.

Magicals can do those:

- Duplicate food with a simple spell, hunt/farm with the aid of magic much more easily compared to muggles
- Teleport instantly away from dangerous predators
- Transfigure/Conjure clothing
- Transfigure/Conjure shelter

So the rest is just cosmetic, psychological needs. We see a lot of fighting and stuff from Harry's perspective but general public didn't need to know so much obscure magical stuff to live. And Hogwarts is a school to prepare children for the real world. If a student wanted to learn more, perhaps teachers could give them extra materials to study. But Harry wasn't really interested in that so we don't see much of it. I don't remember the name of the fic but there was one where someone said that the reason they learned leg locking curse etc. was for children to protect themselves against muggles if they somehow found themselves against them during Witch Hunting period.

Magical world is small, magicals also live longer than muggles and as a result the magical world is traditionalist and stagnant. Albus Dumbledore was born in 1881 and died 116 years old. Not because of natural causes either. And try to imagine living conditions of muggles at that time. Medical advancements, technological advancements etc. everything that makes the current muggle world "comfortable" today is quite recent. And since magicals don't really interact with muggles, it should not be that surprising that magical world is still living in the past. The past where they were living in much better conditions than muggles. While muggles were thinking about what to do with their feces without modern plumbing systems, magicals could just remove it.

So many of those flaws you can see, they might not necessarily see them as flaws. In the end, it has been working for centuries. We know that there were two dark lords in 20th century but were there lots of dark lords before?

We still use Newton's formulas because they are 99.99% accurate in slow speeds but it doesn't change the fact that the are just producing approximations. Maybe Einstein's formulas are just approximations too but we don't have tools to measure that error. So even in our world, we don't know Laws of the universe.

Seven boarding school mystery novels. The plot of every book more or less revolves around setting up these mysteries for Harry and Co. to solve/figure out/deal with. Why send Hagrid to pick up Harry? He would end up hinting about the Philosopher's Stone and not explain things unless asked, leaving Harry, and the readers, ignorant until its time to advance the overall plot. Most of your contentions can be boiled down to, "Rowling invented a lot of her system on the fly, introducing new plot points to resolve later parts of the story, even if they create problems with past or even future story points."

Now as for the school system. Yes, its poorly thought out and run by a man who has at best questionable educational ideas for children. But there are reasonable explanations that could fit with canon.

Why is Muggle Studies not important? Schools try to focus on information that is important to functioning within THEIR society, not others. Education in Britain does not necessarily prepare you to function in Tunisia. By all accounts the Wizarding world seems nearly isolated from the muggles, with entire wars going on without there notice. Contrast this Astronomy, which has importance for other magics like potions, herbology and divination, several of which are important for potential careers in their society.

Why only Hogwarts? Well, there is only 11 schools according to Rowling, and the global population is not that large. At one point JKR stated there were 3000 wizards/witches in Britain, and considering people like Dippet lived more than three centuries, this makes you wonder how many students actually go to Hogwarts (she stated 1000 one time, but that seems implausible).

Why not get rid of X teacher (take your pick)? How many people can do there jobs or are even qualified to do them? In defense of the DADA position, how many qualified people can there be who can actually teach that course decently. Hell, Dumbledore put the Muggle Studies professor (Quirrel) in, probably from lack of willing candidates. And again I refer you to my previous point about the population. Same deal with History of Magic being taught by a ghost.

Why do they tolerate such blatant favoritism? Probably tradition honestly. A lot of stupid things are maintained for centuries because its the way they did them in the past. Plus it theoretically encourages the students to work harder and be better at magic. The point system is kind of like demerits in muggle schools.

And the head of houses being teachers? I can see Dumbledore responding like thus "Why yes, as soon as we have enough funding to employ a living History teacher, I will get right on bringing in four glorified student counselors to the payroll."

And Divination? To be honest, divination is heavily implied to be valid (most of Trelawney's "hokey" predictions end up being true), but its taught by someone who reminds me of Bill Murray's soothsayer tv show in Ghostbusters 2. The course is supposed to be about interpreting signs and there meanings, not about laying out prophecies (which only seers can do). The trouble is, unlike the other subjects, the results of divination are open to interpretation and thus it appears fake.

Nonsense, it's mostly shown to be silly. Trelawney has like 2 or 3 instances where those goofy things came true, but that's because they were worded vaguely enough that they could easily be interpreted to come true with the slightest resemblance. At best we have something like what the centaurs do (broad predictions about historically important shifts on the horizon) and Seer visions.

***** *Women's Institutes*

The Women's Institute (WI), a community-based organisation for women, was founded in Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada, by Adelaide Hoodless in 1897. It was based on the British concept of Women's Guilds, created by Rev Archibald Charteris in 1887 and originally confined to the Church of Scotland. It later spread to other countries. Many WIs belong to the Associated Country Women of the World organization.

***** Point taken, though it's not really central to my overall point. Still, the other one stands. There are smaller magic schools which simply aren't registered with the ICW:

  There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, all of which are registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry

  Why is Muggle Studies not important? Schools try to focus on information that is important to functioning within THEIR society, not others.
#+end_quote

It's interesting that you raise this point, because Hogwarts spectacularly fails to prepare it's students for anything other than spellcasting. For its students to be prepared for adult life in magical Britain, the school should provide classes in mathematics, economics, civics, philosophy, anatomy, languages (including English), literature, etc.

In the muggle world, a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education][liberal arts education]]" includes these subjects because they are considered essential for a free person to know in order to take an active part in civic life. These same subjects are needed for a wizard or witch to participate intelligently in magical society.

A fairly normal school, then. Real life schools don't generally teach economics, philosophy, anatomy, or civics, at least not in the UK. 99% of what you learn at school, you never use again. Literature is of questionable practical use. And unless you go into a mathematical career, you don't really need to use much mathematics beyond arithmetic, basic statistics and percentages.

School is very much not a practical preparation for life. There are no classes on financial planning, how to pay a bill, how to unblock a toilet, how to perform well in an interview, etc. Education is academic, not practical, and largely imparts knowledge for knowledge's sake.

***** The subjects I listed are widely provided at highschools (age 9 - 12) in the United States.

I'd argue that people use everything that they /successfully learn/ at school. A good education doesn't just force children to memorize things, it shows them how to understand the world around them and apply reason to make intelligent decisions. Those skills are always "practical."

Literature is a very important subject because it gives children examples of how to effectively express themselves with words. It's also important as a taste of their own culture (English, German, Magical, etc.), of experiences beyond what they get in their normal life, of strong emotions and how to deal with them in a healthy way, etc. You mentioned preparation for job interviews: Literature/English classes usually cover persuasive writing, a basic skill which is key to writing job applications and presenting yourself well in an interview.

Mathematics is important to many, many different career fields aside from mathematicians. It's useful for daily life to balance a checkbook or understand investments. Even construction workers (such as electricians or carpenters) benefit from a good understanding of geometry and algebra.

In conclusion: knowledge for knowledge's sake is great, but all knowledge is power. A good education (including the subjects I listed) empowers children to be strong adults.

**** Right, but your missing something. Kids are taught elsewhere about the basics (or are supposed to be) prior to attending Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a public school as would be thought by muggles. It reminds me of older style boarding schools, where only a handful of subjects are actually taught, most of which have no bearing on any future endeavors.

Hogwarts almost strikes me as a traditionalist organization. Much of how or why things are done has less to do with it being the best way, and more to do with "thats how its always been done." It would not surprise me if those courses have been the same ones taught for centuries.

The curriculum at Hogwarts would make sense if that were the case, but we never hear about any lower-age schools in the wizarding world. The rich families seem to get their kids private tutors, but can poorer families (like the Weasleys) afford that? Not to mention, civics, economics and (magical) literature would be very useful for muggleborns who haven't had the opportunity to learn how wizarding society actually functions.

I agree that Hogwarts as presented in the books seems very traditionalist. I enjoy reading fics that explore aspects of magical education not covered in canon.

  Like how to use quills and parchment for one.
#+end_quote

A lot of fics say that there's a summer introductory thingy for muggleborns, and Harry didn't get into it due to a bureaucratic oversight.

#+begin_quote
  Another thing, why only Hogwarts? Do other schools not offer a place for students from other countries?
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is implied to be the best school in the UK, not the only one. What criteria does Hogwarts use in selecting which students get to attend? How bad are the other schools?

#+begin_quote
  On the topic of teachers, why are there so few teachers and why do they all have so many responsibilities?
#+end_quote

To reduce the number of characters in the story. A throwaway line about "Professor Withings, the other Potions professor" would have patched that hole (and probably introduced others).

If you look at it, the workloads for professors aren't /outrageous/... I mean, it's more than a 40 hour week for most of them, but different laws and all. The students, on the other hand, are in class about half as much as professors, which means they're unsupervised a lot of the time.

#+begin_quote
  All of these teachers have double duties that would be in conflict with one another as well as leave them open to favoritism. The head of a house could favor their own in class as Snape often does (staying undercover notwithstanding).
#+end_quote

And a Head of House that can discipline students of other houses can also exhibit favoritism. A professor who was a Hufflepuff but isn't Head of House could exhibit favoritism. You need firm oversight.

#+begin_quote
  Also, why is your caretaker a squib? Is it necessary to torture someone who cannot even cast a single spell by forcing them to be in the presence of eleven year-olds that have more ability than they ever will?
#+end_quote

It's a disability. Is it torture for a person who uses a wheelchair to see children running around? And Mr Filch doesn't seem to have a problem maintaining the castle.

#+begin_quote
  One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?
#+end_quote

A monthly outdoor lab (scheduled on a Friday evening) with a normal classroom lecture would make sense.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts has a room where ANYTHING can be manifested and they fail to use it as a learning tool.
#+end_quote

They don't know about it. Tom Riddle learned a fragment of its significance, and Albus Dumbledore learned a fraction of that. Circa 1996 they learned more, but that's too late in the series to introduce educational changes.

I mean, do you have any idea how complicated it is to make good schedules? The current ones were probably made in the mid-eighties -- the 1780s, that is -- and they're not about to change them because that would be weeks of hair-pulling work. They give kids time machines to attend all their classes not because they have too few hours per day, but because that's easier for everyone involved.

#+begin_quote
  Divination seems to be only successfully used by seers and is a waste of a subject in my opinion.
#+end_quote

The professor is necessary for narrative purposes, and the class is thematically appropriate. I would have added a practical use for it, though.

#+begin_quote
  Especially for a world that seems to produce dark lords on a regular basis.

Europe produced two Dark Lords in a century. I'm not sure that's "a regular basis".

** Filch and Binns exist to promote bigotry, same as why Malfoy is allowed to be a jerk to muggleborns without facing disciplinary actions.

Filch teaches mischievous students how learning magic allows them to outwit those without magic.

Binns teaches prejudice against muggles and goblins while also failing to deliver a civics studies class, thus educating students into supporting the dystopic government ruling over Magical Britain.

Binns class, the poor quality of the muggles studies class, the secrecy, the fact that electronics don't work and making it a boarding school all help to break muggleborn students from their original culture and encourages them to become obedient second class citizens in the Magical World.

If Hogwarts taught mundane subjects like basic anthropology/civics, maths, arts and basic science, then muggleborn students wouldn't face an insanely hard time if they decide they want to either return to the muggle world or at least be able to live in both worlds. And should they teach them civics, they may get ideas about separation of powers, elective parliament, due process and all that.
