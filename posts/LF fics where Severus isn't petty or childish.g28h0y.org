I don't want a terribly ooc (out of character) Severus Snape. I'd love if he were still cantankerous but was grown enough to realize the sins of the father don't belong on the son.

Bonus points if Snape realized Harry was being neglected/abused at the Dursleys and maybe does something about it? (This doesn't mean I'm requesting a Severitus fic, simply one where he takes his role as an educator and a head of a house seriously. If it must be Severitus that's fine.)

It doesn't have to be Snape-centric. I'd actually prefer Harry-centric fics. Completed works too, but if there's an abandoned work or a WIP that is absolutely great, I'd love to read them! Anything over 5,000 (completed) words and 10,000 (WIP/Abandoned) words would be fine. I do like long fics, though.

Thanks!


** linkffn(To Shape and Change) may be a bit OOC, as he's more of a role model, but I always enjoy reading it.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I always recommend The Best Revenge. Snape is in character but also matures and is not as petty or childish, as you put it. He has a great relationship with Harry, and it's just a lovely fic all around.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Sins of the father don't belong to the son - that is pretty much a given in Severitus fics, either bc Snape finds out he is Harry biological father or because for some reason or other Snape grows to care about Harry, often going so far as to adopt him.

Check out Blood Magic by Gateway Girl, Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd and (if you like really looong fics) the Like none other series by Aspeninthesunlight.

If you aren't requesting that you'd be looking at Snarry, is that something that interests you?

If yes, check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

Many are put-off by the main pairing and while I was aware of the fic, I generally hit the back button myself for years, especially seeing the length and the fact that at the time it was unfinished. But this is unjustified.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

It is a great "who-dun-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

It checks several of your boxes, especially family bonding, Ron is an Auror and actually good at his job, Bill and Fleur make an appearance and there is stuff going on with the Malfoys that I don't intend to spoil just yet.

Over 525k words and completed. Slash. linkao3(4267422)
