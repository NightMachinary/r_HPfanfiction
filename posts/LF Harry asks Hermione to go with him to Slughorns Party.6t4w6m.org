I recently remembered the Scene, where Harry asks Hermione in the HBP Movie to join him to Slughorns party. She responses that she could have thought that herself. Pretty Cute moment. However, i want to know if there are Fics where Harry invites/asks Hermione and she agrees (or vice-versa). Doesnt matter if its Book- or Movieverse, also doesnt matter if its H/Hr or not. I only know 1 Fic that contains this "movie"moment (but its happening in the common room), "With You" by SilverLunarStar. Unfortunetly its a Oneshot and doesnt show the aftermath (or how they named it "date") of their arrangement.

**** The thing is, I don't understand why there were no replies. I know I'd like to read some stories on this premise (and even though I've read multiple fics where this happens) I can't recall one that starts with this premise.

Oh well, repost here in case you find any good ones :)
