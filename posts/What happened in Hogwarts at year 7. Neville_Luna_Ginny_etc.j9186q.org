Hey, looking for whats in the title. The Neville/Luna/Ginny -part is not meant as a pairing, just any story featuring the 7th year at Hogwarts is fine.


** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/6246406/chapters/14311300][Not from Others]]: Canon-compliant narration of what happened at Hogwarts while the trio were out hunting horcruxes. Ginny POV. Deals with the revival of the DA, and a few mysteries. (132k words)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] by Annerb covers Ginny's sorting (into Slytherin) to the end of the war, but the events at the school during *that* year are really well done in this I think. Luna and Neville feature quite heavily, there's a lot of DA stuff. Ginny's years 1-5 have a chapter each to get through, then her sixth year is over five chapters.
