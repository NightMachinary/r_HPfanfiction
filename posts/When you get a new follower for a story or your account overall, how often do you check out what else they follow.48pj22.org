Do you feel good when you see your story amongst other stories you enjoy?

Do you feel weird weird when you see your story amongst stories you wouldn't read to save someone's life?

Or do you just avoid looking for some reason you may want to relate?


** All the time. It's a great way of gauging how valuable their follow was as well as how intelligent they are. You might be happy at gaining a new follower for your story, but when you find out that they have also followed another 4000 stories and at least a few of them are fics by terrible writers, it quickly loses all meaning.

** I never did, I just never crossed my mind. But now, I'm a little bit afraid of what I'll find.

** I used to, but after a while it was a bit difficult. Now I take a look at people that leave reviews. Or if they go through and fave or follow a bunch of my fics.

Yep, that creates a nice feeling. And I can't say I've had the other happen often. But then, people that like cringe-worthy stories just may not leave reviews.

** I just went and did this, and it turns out about half the favourites my longest story has are from people with hundreds, if not thousands, of favourites. It's a bit shocking to see some peoples' profiles, to be honest, and some of the crap written on there makes me feel uncomfortable with them reading anything I write (one comment in particular, when explaining their favourite pairing, was 'i [sic] find incest sexy').

edit: just to be clear, since I realised this is written somewhat ambiguously: the comment was written on their profile, and not related in any way (pun intended) to anything I've written.

** I don't. When blessed with a review, I check after replying.

** I thought you could only see favorites of other people?

I don't want anyone judging me of my follows, I follow a lot of terrible fics out of morbid curiosity.

*** I'm pretty sure you can only see favorite stories and authors not follows. I follow most stories I've read to the most recent chapter just so I know when it updates, I'm not sure if I actually favorited any authors or stories at this point

**** I favorite a fic if it is finished, and is something that I would probably want to read again. The first one really knocks a lot of fics out of contention.
