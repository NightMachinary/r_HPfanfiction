I'm looking for a fiction where Harry works as a blacksmith during the summer. I can't remember the details but I think he had a trunk or something where he went to work in his own workshop when back at school


** Sounds like this one:

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
