** Well, I prefer it to Harry/Snape and Harry/Draco, that ain't saying a lot since I hate those pairings but still.

*** Is that a real thing? Additionally, please don't let it be a real thing, bad enough that there's a Winky/Harry fic.

** Even though it's a troll post I'd honestly like to see something like this /written well/.

We've seen the Endless7 do a quasi Harry/femVoldemort so anything is possible. The sad part is any Harry/Lily is likely just smut, poorly written smut at that.

*** Meh. [[https://xkcd.com/1989/][IMHO]] Albus Severus Potter/Griselda Marchbanks is far superior.

*** At least the Lily Luna ones are not harem fics... which is really just a small saving grace.

** I just had the craziest idea about how Harry is his own farther, James Potter never existed and it was Harry all along. Explains why they are so alike, huh. (inwardly cringing)
