Feast your eyes upon a wholesome, parent!Voldemort who's retired from Dark Lording! He assumes a new identity and becomes Hogwarts' DADA teacher just in time for Harry's second year. Voldemort just wants to have a quiet retirement, but a certain Boy-Who-Lived keeps interfering, as does a certain diary. Overall very funny and wholesome. I highly recommend!!

One of my favorite quotes:

#+begin_quote
  /The Chamber of Secrets has been opened/, the wall reads in blood -- or at least in red paint. /Enemies of the heir, beware./

  Oh, for fuck's sake, Voldemort thinks.

** Thanks for the recommendation! I had an enjoyable evening reading this series. It's lovely! I wish the author made one big file though, because I usually sort by kudos and smaller stories didn't get my minimum amount of kudos. I missed this gem :(

*** No problem! I like to sort by kudos and filter using the most recently updated date so I get newer fics. Glad you liked it :)

** Why have half the authors on Ao3 never heard of chapters? I download fics to read them later, and for these kinds of series I have to do many times the work.
