Obviously, only a very small minority of HP fans read fanfiction and it's sometimes very apparent how different the community is from the rest of the fanbase. For example, Harry/Fleur is a pretty popular pairing around here, yet I've never seen so much as a mention of it outside of fanfiction. Not even a single piece of fan art. I think it's fair to say that if all HP fans delved into the fanfic world, that pairing would be shoved to the side, apart from the odd piece of smut. What else do you think would change? Would the highest rated fics be filled with much less crap? Would most of the focus be shifted to only canon pairings instead?


** It would be the same except for

a) There would be more of it (probably because more people would want to write it)

2) It would be read more than it is.

There is nothing about the nature of fans of the Harry Potter books and Harry Potter fanfiction where having the entirety of the former will change the nature of the latter (beyond how it currently does so with a fraction of the HP fans).

EDIT: Formatting.

*** Not really. There would probably be a loooooooot less smut (in proportion), given that the majority of incoming readers would be kids.

***** Hmmmm...according to my calculations, if we stop all kids born from this moment on from discovering Harry Potter until they're sixteen all of fanfiction will be nothing but cringe-inducing, badly-written smut in two decades' time :D

** I disagree with your assessment of this pairing being shoved aside. I think it's discussed so little because people don't really think about it until they start reading fanfiction. I certainly didn't.

Additionally, I think nothing would change in terms of highly rated fanfiction. Most "top" fanfiction in terms of favorites in the Harry Potter fandom is utter tripe past the first page or two.

If anything, I would be horrified by a sudden influx of more Harry Potter fans. Just the very thought disgusts me. Communities who receive a lot of new people quickly lose a lot of quality. I'd rather see a slow and steady trickle.

For every 10 stories that these new fans would flood the community with, 1 of them (on average) would be an interesting piece worth reading. Given some time, we'd eventually end up with a lot of new reading material worth recommending.

**** I suppose, but I think that it wouldn't even be 10% of them being at least average. What I mean to say is that much less of this percentage will be good. I think the people inclined to write good fanfiction will already be in the fandom. We would get some good new additions, but even then it would take quite a lot of time. If you've ever looked at an author's writing early on, it's often pretty meh, or even bad. They need time to hit their stride, read a lot of fanfiction, and realize what makes good or bad fanfiction.

** Exactly the same, if not worse. As a standard rule for anything, quality almost never increases as whatever in question becomes more popular/accepted; you should count yourself lucky if it doesn't get worse. It would maybe create a few more niche reads that are really good, but the top fics would remain largely the same: shippy, wish-fulfillment-y fics, because that's what most audiences want out of fanfiction, and what many people want out of original fiction, as well.

As for canon ships? Maybe. But I don't necessarily think that would be a change for the better. The narrowed focus would just "saturate the market", so to speak, where canon-pairing fics are concerned. We'd just have to wade through more poorly written rubbish to get to good stuff. And, the infestation of shit fics that would make up the H/G and R/Hr archives would probably end up creating a backlash to the canon pairings, which would cause writers to start experimenting with other pairings, which would eventually lead back to where we are now.

This actually makes a fair bit of sense.

** I can think of one fandom which has already experienced this (fanfiction becoming mainstream and seen widely) and that would be the original Sherlock Holmes stories. So what could we expect:

- Updating the books to be more modern ([[http://imgur.com/m8d9ogz][mobiles and the internet]]), or the future ([[http://imgur.com/gWkXvKZ][robots etc]])
- Changing the [[http://imgur.com/RyfLGCN][setting]]
- Moving to [[http://imgur.com/qdU1bD5][AMERICA!]]
- Changing the [[http://imgur.com/AegjtNi][sex]], [[http://imgur.com/YEEAER6][race]], and/or [[http://imgur.com/gds2Mcb][age]] of the major characters.
- [[http://imgur.com/Vy7htaX][More romance]], or at least the [[http://imgur.com/Gn1R0kv][suggestions of it]], especially between [[http://imgur.com/bO9h7y4][the main characters]]
- 'Twists' on canon, for example (*spoilers* for Elementary and Sherlock): making a [[http://imgur.com/BzuY7hc][friend an enemy]] (or the other way around), or giving a boring character [[http://imgur.com/qefuPde][new background or motivations]]
- Changing genre, for example making it a [[http://imgur.com/FA6JT1k][comedy]], or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Emerald][horror]].
- Changing [[http://i.imgur.com/VK64a87.gif][species]] of the [[http://i.imgur.com/zlhaX1j.gif][charcters]]
- More [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beekeeper's_Apprentice][SI]]
- More [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552534.Good_Night_Mr_Holmes][minor POV]]

But not really more smut. Nor extensions of canon (there is [[http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Silk-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/0316197017][some]] but for the most part /new/ writers adapt rather then add). The same sort of pattern is seen in other out-of-copywrite stories, like Pride and Prejudice or Wizard of OZ.

** I think fanifiction would more closely resemble cannon. The only unifying trait of the new hypothetical fandom outlined in the OP is a love of the HP cannon. Contrast that of the unifying trait of the current real fandom: People who like HP cannon but want more out of it in one way or another.

** Eh, I'm not a huge fan of Harry/Fleur but even if 100% of Harry Potter fans read fanfiction, nothing would really change unless a large amount started writing too.

I'm not sure much would change to be honest- super powered Harry and Hermione/Harry fics abound due to wish fulfillment for an even larger amount of fans. General fans tend to have less in depth knowledge of the universe too so if everyone read/wrote I think we would have a harder time finding deep/complex settings and characterization... Maybe I'm being cynical, its not like it is crazy common now, but I just think we would have a lot more crap to shift through to find good fics.
