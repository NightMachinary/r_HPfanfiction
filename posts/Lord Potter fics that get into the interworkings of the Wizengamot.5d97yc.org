Like, normally the only thing we ever see is Harry going to one meeting, wrecking everybody, and then no more Wizengamot.

Are there any fics that have it more realistically? Meeting every week, voting on new laws, Harry both winning /and/ losing, etc?

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire.

***** Actually, it was way too often, to the detriment of the story. I don't care about the spanking itself, but it wasn't serving any purpose in the plot and began to feel like somebody's kink, even though it was not written as sexual.
