I've read several fics where Harry becomes the Master of Death, and it has some significant drawbacks.

For example, he no longer ages. Queue angst because all his friends are gonna die and he's gonna be alone forever.

I've read On a Pale Horse, and it's great, but doesn't really count either. MoD Harry in that is rather insane and has that touch problem.

I'm looking for any fic where Harry becomes the MoD and it is nothing but awesome. It upgrades him in some way that's very useful and powerful. And obvious, I don't want it to be something subtle to Harry. He should be fully aware of what it is.


** Boredom is Deadly, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455]]) , which is crack. Also Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/]])

  Boredom is Deadly
#+end_quote

The fic's initial premise is that he's bored as hell with the MoD job, which is /ridiculously/ boring, which is why the previous occupant gave him the job. It's not entirely awesome.

**** While that is true, he's also upgraded in a way that's incredibly powerful, and there's no real angst, considering that he can see anyone he wants basically whenever he wants. His job's dull, but doing /anything/ for a basically infinite amount of time will probably be boring.

*** I read Boredom is Deadly and didn't much care for it. Harry just seemed really annoying. I think I dropped it when he began to reveal his power to punish Flint or some other older student in front of a bunch of professors.

Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is was pretty good, though.
