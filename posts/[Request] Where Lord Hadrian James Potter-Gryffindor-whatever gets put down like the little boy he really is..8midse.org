I mean, no one with half a brain would take an 11 year old child Lord seriously. And why are they always so wordy? Kids are barely articulate at best.

"That's nice dear. Now, do be quiet, the adults are talking."

Please tell me someone's written about that?

** Being honest, all child rulers over the ages have had a regent, even if they are an orphan. Most people that write the whole 'lord and lady' stuff seem to skim over important details, such as the fact that a child cannot actually inherit any title until they are sixteen. They are, in every sense, an heir.

The regent of the title would hold the choices about everything and nothing would change that. However, I'm sure if an heir did say something, people would listen, but they would simply smile and then turn to the regent.

Except for all those times in canon when he was

- Removed as headmaster of Hogwarts by Malfoy
- Removed as chief warlock by Fudge
- Removed as Supreme Mugwump, also by Fudge
- Had to swallow Dolores Umbridge's presence as a teacher, with no power to stop her effectively running the show.

Many times Dumbledore had terms dictated to him with seemingly nothing he could do to stop that.

The running theme in all those situations is that it's clear that Dumbledore is still in control - that he could, if he wanted, flip over the table and ruin his opponents, but that he /chooses/ not to and instead to respect artificial limitations on his power. No one has ever /forced/ Dumbledore to do anything, except where he allows them to do so.

******* Well, firstly, the overblown fanon melodrama that it was "torture" is a characterisation I reject - it's not really any more severe that corporal punishment, which was the norm for most of history. Unpleasant, but torture is massively hyperbolic.

With that out of the way: what I am saying is that Dumbledore could have stopped Umbridge at any time he chose. If he had decided to do so, what could she have done to stop him? Nothing. Send Aurors to arrest him? They wouldn't stand a chance. Ultimately, political power reduces to the monopoly on force, but the Ministry does not have access to the force necessary to overcome Dumbledore, if he had been set against them. Just as they did not have access to the force necessary to overcome Voldemort.

The only thing stopping Dumbledore from intervening is the same thing that always stopped him: the fear of seizing power. Stopping Umbridge would have started a conflict between him and the Ministry, a conflict which he would have won, but in doing so he would have done the thing he was determined to avoid for moral reasons: using his power to place himself at the head of the Ministry.

Plus, of course, the whole issue of wanting to win over the Ministry so that they could fight Voldemort together. So his hands were also tied by strategic concerns, as well as moral ones.

********** *School corporal punishment*

School corporal punishment refers to causing deliberate pain or discomfort in response to undesired behaviour by students in schools. It often involves striking the student either across the buttocks or on the hands, with an implement such as a rattan cane, wooden paddle, slipper, leather strap or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include spanking or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the elementary school level.

In the English-speaking world, the use by schools of corporal punishment has historically been justified by the common-law doctrine in loco parentis, whereby teachers are considered authority figures granted the same rights as parents to punish children in their care.

Remember how Filch was so happy to /finally/ be allowed to whip the kids in the 5th book thanks to Umbridge? Pretty sure Dumbledore had outlawed (?) that.

And the mail was monitored, so it's an acceptable guess that no one outside Hogwarts knew about it.

Presumably both twins, but that was in the context of Arthur catching them in the act of trying to give Ron an Unbreakable Vow.

That's an outlier.

Edit: somehow the first part got lost. It was about how Nobility is not canon, so Lord Potter isn't a real thing. The only "Lord" was Voldie and that was because he was a megalomaniac with an ego bigger than Hogwarts.
