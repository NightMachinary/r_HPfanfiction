I just finished reading the downward spiral series and really enjoyed it. Are there any fics like it that y'all would recommend? He doesn't necessarily have to join Voldemort, but I like the premise of a well done dark power couple and it's bloody hard to find fics like that, at least for me, so any help would be appreciated


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Borken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]]: Harry, Hermione, and Luna are definitely dark enough here, but their author Darth Marrs is always shooting his own great premises in the foot with ridiculous moments or plot arcs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]: They are never described as dark in the story itself, but I think their actions speak for themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]]: Powerful Harry and Ginny are quite into torturing their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Together they are unstoppable, and Ginny is a bloodthirsty one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and unleash hell upon their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: It's the dark Trio here, and they continue to fight for their canon cause, with different means against an incorrigible establishment.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]]: Still the only completed, non crossover "Wizards in Space" fic. Harry and Ginny are ruling their fledgling space colony with an iron fist.

*** The one that starts with Harry Potter and the Homecoming by BolshevikMuppet99. It's worth reading if you're into Dark!Harry. The first two books are riddled with grammatical errors so if you're a pedant skip to the third, but the characters are decently written and the plot is well though-out. Warning for gore and some v v dark themes though.

** Darkly Loyal by Kierra Marcos is a Harry/Hermione/Draco that I will never not recommend. They are in the service of magic and completely on their own side.
