Draco is frequently shipped with Harry and Hermione despite being a massive bigot, so there have to be some fanfics where he gradually stops being a bigot, right? Please recommend me some fanfics where he develops empathy and develops the understanding to not be a bigot. Preferably due to him changing his mind gradually due to various arguments instead of like Hermione saving his life or something like that.

**** True, but the root cause of his change is kind of disturbing. Since he has an older brother, his father decides to hedge bets and use behavioral conditioning to groom Draco for Gryffindor, in case Harry goes there and turns out to be someone important. Without Draco's knowledge. He just knows that his parents are treating him differently, which is confusing, and he seems to be given different rules from his brother, and he likes getting more hugs and touches from his mother, but he's not properly fitting in with his friends anymore, and not acting like a proper Slytherin should, which distresses him... And that's not even going into his mother's counter-plans.

*** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Sirius escapes from Azkaban a few years early with accidental magic, and not having any leads on Peter, he instead checks on Harry, finds him unhappy, and offers him another home. Which triggers a large manhunt in response to the "kidnapping", accelerating or derailing many canon events, but above all, Harry gets a few years of actual childhood with a flawed-but-caring parental figure.

Draco's redemption starts as a small sub-plot, but snowballs in the later books once they start at Hogwarts and he's shocked at being Sorted into Gryffindor (and his father is also shocked, but his mother is not).

** linkao3(survival is a talent)

The fic starts off second year, and the change starts off with something as simple as him still believing non-purebloods are inferior, but him not wanting anyone to die regardless. His friendship with Harry forces him into situations where he has to interact with his so-called inferiors, and he learns to care and even love them. The interactions between Hagrid and Draco are especially heart-warming. The soulmate thing may alienate some people, I started reading the fic with a lot of prejudice too, but it handles it well. Soulmate doesn't equal instant friendship or romance. Two characters with relatively large roles in the story are soulmates but not romantic partners, and both of them are in happy relationships with other people. Voldemort's soulmate is a pretty cool reveal, and it shows that the soul marks thing only means there is potential for a great relationship, nothing more.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
