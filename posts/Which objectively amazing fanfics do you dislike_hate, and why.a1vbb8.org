Do you have any objectively well-written fanfics that you dislike/hate? Despite having and/or being:

- Flowing, natural dialogue
- Superb characterisation and character development
- Engaging action
- Good/Great pacing
- Well-structured prose
- Complete (w/ completed or ongoing sequels)

If so, why? Why do you dislike the fanfic(s), if every objective box has been ticked? Is it the content, e.g. it is a Drarry fic? Does it go against the spirit of HP? Have you tried to get into it, only to give up -- for whatever reasons?

*** I liked the first half, I thought the rise of Voldemort was done really well and creepy, with the creepy cult-like meeting in the forest being the best part of it. But then you get that famous half-way point where it goes off the fucking rails. It's such a shame, cause the first half was really much better than the average fanfic. It was thrilling, intriguing and original.

But looking at the author's reaction to people's dislike of the second half, it seems they haven't really learnt from it, nor will they ever, because they can't take critique.

**** The way I see it, the second half just didn't have credible opposition. There wasn't tension. If you make Frodo a Jedi, then you have to give Sauron the Death Star, and the author...just... didn't.

And it would have been easy to do! It's been a while, but I remember thinking that there were lots of plot hooks that could have been used to really challenge the protagonists. The one that I still remember is, What if Voldemort and Co found their stashes and gained control of the Malfoy and Black vaults during their decades away? It's a real shame, because the first half was so good that I /still/ put it on my favorites list, and I'm pretty picky about that list.

******* The galleons thing was pointing out that the muggle world and the magical world offer different exchange rates between gold and silver.

So, if you buy some silver in the muggle world, take it to the goblins and forge it into 17 Sickles (plus their fee), exchange them for one Galleon, melt it down into a pile of gold, and then go back to the muggle world and sell the gold, you end up with more money than you started with. Probably two or three times as much.

There are real people (and computers) that watch out for similar situations arising in the world markets, and whoever is quick enough to jump on the opportunity first can make a pile of money before the exchange rates balance out. It's called arbitrage.

******** I refuse to believe that galleons, sickles and knuts are made of pure gold, silver, and copper. I always write that there is a small seed of the whatever valuable material in each coin that is valued at whatever the muggle exchange rate is i.e. galleons have a small seed of gold that is valued at approximately 5 British pounds in 1991. The size of the seed stays constant which is why the exchange rate between galleons and pounds changes over time. It's enough to discourage forgery (as there is a spell that checks how much gold/silver is in something) while making arbitrage highly unlikely.

**** No it's not. It is, for one thing, far more /competently/ written than the overwhelming majority of fics. I think even its greatest detractor would agree that HPMOR is objectively lightyears ahead of, say, /Harry and his sphinx/. Therefore it cannot be "absolute trash" while allowing that there is much worse out there.

Moreover, the three big complaints against HPMOR are that the protagonist is too unlikeable, that the pacing is off, and that the "authorial tract" aspects weigh the story down like an anvil. Those are serious, fair criticisms.

But these detractors don't (and couldn't possibly) argue with the fact that HPMOR does a lot of /other/ things completely right. It has a very compelling antagonist by all accounts, it has a lot of great jokes, it has extremely intricate plotting with stunning amounts of foreshadowing. The prose is perhaps not the best, but it's unfailingly serviceable, and has its own style, which is more than you can say for a lot of /published/ fiction.

Those are all objectively qualities for a work of literature, and they are all objectively present in HPMOR. Whether you think they're enough to save the story in the face of the above-cited flaws is another matter. But you cannot in fairness say that it's unambiguously "absolute trash".

** The Prince of Slytherin series. FWIW, the first chapter is intriguing and I was initially curious to learn 3 years worth of backstory. Then the first few chapters showing WBWL arrogance getting his comeuppance was amusing. It took an interesting approach while Severus actually rejected Lily because of how she neglected Harry in this timeline and that was a pretty novel perspective

But then it went a little off the rails when we suddenly started to see Slytherin kids acting all political, then we had 11 year old Harry also suddenly uncovering deep Slytherin secrets and well people keep saying PoS will deconstruct these "cliches", but wew the author overloaded on these cliches too much too fast and played it too straight and serious and i just nope'd out of there. I pop back in and skim the new chapters when they release and while they are intriguing, i cant get through the previous chapters

Also, i do wish the author had broken the chapters up into their seperate years, rather than still writing one giant fic, whose wordcount is getting pretty massive...

Oh yes, on the subject of Wordcount, If you are starting your fanfic from Year one and plan to go through all 7 years, as the author intends, I am skeevy of wordcounts that balloon past canon word count for that year. Like WIP epic series whose Year 1 fics that take 200k words of fanfic to go through leave me worried the author has decided to write about all the characters, all the magics, all the things about HP. I get queasy if the author ever hit the Voldemort years at how nutty the wordcount will certainly get.

Another fic that while i still like but am pretty lukewarm about is "The Arithmancer" series. The premise was pretty intriguing (Hermione is a math genius and will develop cool spells and serious magics? How will these change the series?) That series of fic unfortunately still sticks to the Stations of the Canon too much. Which means having to basically re-read a canon HP with some bloat up till Year 6, but with occasional spouts of extra booms and flashes. The plot and Fic!Hermione dont substantially diverge from canon until Year 6, but by then i was just down to skimming the fic and seeing if the plot was radically different from canon. It is still enjoyable and I quite enjoy Hermione trying to create new magics and dive deep into the fundamentals of magic. But the author kinda made sending her to Beauxbatons and all the extra words it took to get there pointless if he had to drag Hermione back to Hogwarts for the Triwizard tournament

I enjoyed it, but understand [[/u/FinallyGivenIn]] 's concerns. It is LONG, and there seems to be a dichotomy in Fanfiction where you either re-write the original canon to support your claims, or propose a change and present an interesting short story, with little in between. Both have merits, and I think people latch onto the long-form stories because they're both familiar and and their stories progress over enough time to gather a following, while the short stories and one-offs can be brilliantly written, but don't gain quite as much traction since readers inevitably don't get invested.

Shakespeare said 'Brevity is the soul of wit' and as a writer myself, I concur. Both forms are challenging, and as I share your voracity I think I can offer this as commentary: many long-form stories, whether they are fanfiction or original works, can almost always benefit from judicial editing, planning, and tight story-craft. I've read too many books that meander over details already established just to set the setting and characters already known, or too obviously jump in time and place when some scene would have been better suited to establish things. Well written short fiction hits you like a train, and well written long fiction builds you up and breaks you down in equal parts; two different skills that leave the reader with similar feelings.

Just curious, have you read short story collections? They can sort of accomplish both, where there is a running theme or a singular set of characters, accomplishing both the 'punch' of short fiction and satisfying the crave of knowing more.

I don't know whether people even know him today, but growing up, my favourite short story writer was this man called HH Munroe, who went by the pseudonym, Saki. If ever there was a master of this craft, he surely was one. His stories were full of black comedy and sarcastic quips and more importantly, there would invariably be an unexpected twist at the end. I later found out that he was gay and considering the repressed nature of the era he lived in (1870-1916), I could finally understand why the man's sense of humour was great, but also dark.

A good novel will utilize the elements of short fiction to its benefit, and some get very close to achieving that. One of the first books I read that made academic reading "fun" in high school was /The Things They Carried/ by Tim O'Brien. It was the first time I realized there was some middle place between genre fiction ("fun" stories) and capital L F Literary Fiction ("boring" drivel that teachers forced you to write essays on). Funnily enough, once I made this revelation I started noticing similar themes, conceits, references, and archetypes in genre fiction, as well as the usual tropes in literary fiction: they weren't very different, the distinction is usually use and attention to prose, and as we've explored, attention to detail. I think I've read /The Great Gatsby/ at least 4 or 5 times for school, and it got better every time.

I'm not surprised. Saki is criminally underrated. O Henry and Roald Dahl have written short stories in a similar vein and for some reason, have received significantly more praise and renown.

I always ask first time Saki readers to start with 'The Open Window'. I think this story basically represents the best aspects of the author. Then there are other classics like 'Dusk', 'The Interlopers' and 'Hyacinth'. And for a taste of his dark comedy, try 'The Gala Programme', 'The Toys of Peace' (the short story and not the collection of the same name) and 'Bertie's Christmas Eve'. I think you'll find all of them on the internet.

I, in turn, will definitely give Tim O'Brien a shot. I've always wondered about the kind of books that must be read for an English major.

When I was younger I never thought I would be one to re-read a book, there were too many I still needed to read, then I discovered Jonathan Strange and Mr Nortel as well as City of Dreaming Books and have been collecting stories worth rereading ever since.

#+end_quote

Not all of them, but some of them do get at least somewhat subverted later, like at the very end of the first book and in the second book. But yeah even then it does have a lot of the tropes.

Still it does a better job of subverting them than the copy of of PoS called Sarcasm and Slytherin which goes even more overboard with all the tropes and subverts none of them. That fic plays every single trope straight.

Not saying you should read PoS, if it isn't for you then it isn't for you. I guess this is sort of spoilers, but some of the tropes it does eventually subvert/explain which I liked how it did so are as follows. James atrocious behavior, while not justified, is sort of given an explanation. He's still shitty, and an Anakin level self fulling prophecy idiot, for reacting that way, but given context it's at least sort of understandable. The Dursley's terribleness is also explained. And Dumbledore in this fic isn't evil, which is a nice change from many WBWL fics where he is. It still has all the ridiculous 11 year old Slytherins being nuanced political geniuses who understand super complex subtext bullshit though. At least I remember it having that, it's been a while since I read it.

No, that's Sirius. Harry does give a fuck, and when things get serious he steps up. He's the one that does the auction, negotiates with Riddlebottom and Dumbledore, and when he realizes a mistake, he steps up and tries to correct it.

The "not caring"-thing is (in my reading of the character) a bit of a facade, a lie he tells himself. Of course, I could over-interpret it, but I'm pretty sure it's deliberate that Harry leads /all/ of the stuff that actually has consequences - and his mere appearance resolves a conflict that had been stuck and stale for over 10 years, basically.

It's immature, not that well written, and it has a very unsatisfying conclusion/resolution of the plot. That said, it is the most fun I've ever had reading a fanfic. I went in with almost no expectations and just had fun reading it. This sub sets readers up for failure with this story and Seventh Horcrux because they praise it so much. When someone starts reading it with high expectations, they're going to be let down because it reads like a Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson comedy movie. Will I recommend reading it? Absolutely.

  not to mention Ginny being reduced to a joke
#+end_quote

Okay, I wanted to write about this for quite a while, because I disagree: Ginny isn't just a joke, she's an amazing tool to explain Harry's relationship to women.

Basically, Ginny is a stand-in for a chunk of the wizarding world: Loved Harry from the beginning before they even met him because of what his parents did. Harry loves them back. And in the end they died for him - and now, figuratively and literally /haunt/ him.

Every time Ginny is on screen, it's a reminder for Harry what he lost, and how many people died for him - and he isn't willing to lose that reminder:

#+begin_quote
  "I know a tribal chief skilled in matters of necromancy and souls," Albus offered.

  "Believe me I've thought it about, often," Harry assured him. "But she usually behaves. And she was a good friend long before she became an ex."

  "You're haunted by an ex-girlfriend?" Albus clarified smothering his own amusement. "Say the word. I can send a letter to my friend."

  "Nah," Harry shook his head thinking how he actually needed Ginny's ghostly expertise. "She's a nuisance, but it's nice to have someone else who remembers our old world."

  Albus grinned as he felt the charm of brotherhood's nudge indicating that Harry was hiding something.
#+end_quote

Being this aloof about things is ABC!Harry's defense mechanism, because if he didn't have a defense mechanism, he'd go mad.

And one last point: The two women who loved him, his mother and Ginny, both died for him. Of one he had to literally destroy the soul, and the other is his ex-girlfriend. Of course he's going to be a bit fucked up in regards to relations to the other sex.

So yeah, I found it well executed.

********** Ah.

Well, for one thing, she goes back and forth on where the distinction between mind/brain and soul lies. On the one hand, having your soul sucked out by a Dementor makes you into a mindless empty shell; yet on the other hand, Voldemort can reason fine with one-seventh of soul --- although depending on your interpretation, his inability to love may be a result of the damage to his soul, rather than a "normal" feature of his character.

Similarly, being 'spirits', and capable of sentient reasoning, one would expect Dementors to have souls, even if they would have to be twisted, blackened ones. But she went and said in an interview that Dementors /don't/ have souls (except the ones they eat, obviously, which is something else entirely). So what are they using to think, then?

One time Snape says ghosts are just an imprint left on the world by the soul of the wizard who moved on, yet at other points, ghosts talking about their own predicament explain that they chose /not/ to move on, which was cowardly and something they regret and blah blah blah --- which would mean that they are souls who refused to move on. It's weird.

Exactly what happens to the soul-shards in the Horcruxes is inconsistent. Hermione states at one point that destroying a Horcrux will physically destroy the soul-shard, in opposition to a healthy soul's survival when its vessel is destroyed; however, during the "train station scene", Harry sees the physical form of the soul-shard that was in his scar, which is said to forever be stuck in limbo, unable to stay behind or move on --- but /not/ to be disappearing into oblivion.

Confusingly, later on, Harry seems to take it for granted that the master-soul, the one inside Voldemort's body, will suffer the same fate as his soul-shards, that is to say be stuck in limbo as flayed-baby-things forever. Dumbledore's shade said no such thing but it's clear from the way Harry says it that Rowling means the statement to be accurate.

So yeah, that's already a lot. And there's probably a lot more stuff I'm forgetting.

Later in Chapter 7 they hook up with some women they met at a muggle bar. They mention being careful not to talk about magic around one of them who is a muggle.

Also note, the section you linked was a case of the women seeing magic due to a mistake, not a usual occurrence. It's illegal for wizards/witches to introduce muggles to magic, so at that point they had no choice. Also in the same section Harry Obliviates Kreacher of something /he's/ not supposed to know. Memory charms are a running gag in the fic, used against multiple people, many of them male, so I wouldn't qualify Harry's indiscriminate use of them as misogyny.

The rest of your comment is veering into ye olde sex positivism vs. objectification argument, and I'd rather not rehash what has been said eloquently on both sides of that argument elsewhere.

A different redditor higher in the thread described them as "jerks and womanizers", which I'd say is rather accurate. Being an indiscriminate jerk to all genders and having lots of casual sex does not equate to misogyny, which is by definition hatred/mistreatment of women specifically.

**** How does the story glorify Nazis? Gellert isn't a Nazi - he's more a Napoleon type dark wizard - and while there are several dark jokes about his past atrocities, they aren't depicted as a good thing. Part of the story's plot is centred on the fact that while Gellert means well (this time), things still go out of control because he hasn't changed as much as he thinks he did, and his followers are as bloodthirsty as ever.

#+begin_quote
  “The Ministry doesn't really matter,” he said.

  “What?”

  Gellert nodded. “If it were important, Albus would have been Minister. It's obvious that he didn't consider the Ministry worth his time, and therefore losing the Ministry isn't a setback at all - it's an opportunity!” He smiled. “All our enemies will rally there, thinking that they have won - until we can take them out with one strike!” He nodded. “Fiendfyre should do the job.”

  “Fiendfyre?” That was Mrs Weasley again. She might be hard of hearing - no wonder, given how loudly she liked to discuss matters.

  “Yes, Fiendfyre,” Gellert repeated. “Since the Ministry is isolated, that should limit collateral damage.”

  “It's in the middle of muggle London!” the young muggleborn witch - Granger, he really had to learn their names one of those days - exclaimed.

  “Right. I forgot about muggles. They didn't matter fifty years ago.” The muggles were so busy killing each other, Gellert had been able to operate without any care for the Statute of Secrecy. As long as he killed any witnesses and then blew up the area. Speaking of... “We can still blame firebombs for Fiendfyre, can't we?”

  “What?”

  “Firebombs. Those metal cylinders filled with flammable liquid that muggles like to drop on each other. They were all the rage in Prussia last time.” Wasn't Granger a muggleborn? She should know these things. But judging by her flabbergasted expression, she didn't. “I guess they don't do that any more?” That would complicate things.

  “We can't unleash Fiendfyre in London!” Granger yelled. Was she related to the Weasleys? She would certainly fit right in.

  “Well, I think you mean we shouldn't,” he corrected her. “We most certainly can. But we shouldn't.” Albus had said something about that, too. Gellert blinked. Perhaps... “Does anyone know if Albus has used Fiendfyre lately? No?”

  Apparently not. That would complicate matters. A little. Unless flooding the Ministry with poison gas and then setting Inferi on the survivors was also unacceptable for some reason or other.

********** Hermione was the one who jumped at joining the fight - that was a comment about radicalisation and fanatism during a war - and she dragged Harry into it when she mentioned the prophecy and Albus's plans. Harry went along because he's not exactly the best thinker when it comes to such judgement calls, and neither are his friends - anyone who pissed off Scrimgeour when the man offered an alliance, and anyone who followed Harry into an obvious trap in book 5 pretty much can't be trusted about such things.

And it wasn't as if there were many good options. Harry lost Sirius, then Dumbledore, and is faced with fighting Voldemort with just Ron and Hermione at his side. Then, suddenly, Grindelwald appears and takes over the war - in the name of Albus, and apparently acting on Albus's orders/plan. By the time Harry started to figure out how insane Grindelwald was, he was already neck deep in the war. And even then - things kept happening, the Ministry fell, French support for Voldemort's straw man appeared, muggleborns rose in rebellion - helping Grindelwald was certainly better than letting the Death Eaters roam free or let them kill innocents. Grindelwald at least meant well, and usually only killed the Death Eaters and their supporters.

A theme is the loss of control - Harry pretty much could only go along and hope for the best. Grindelwald lost control of his followers early on, and never really managed to get it back. And in the end, Grindelwald fled back into his prison rather than taking control over the countries conquered in his name.

Grindelwald in this story, after prison, wasn't nearly as bad as Voldemort. Certainly still a monster given his dark methods - but he didn't strike at innocents and tried to follow Albus's teachings. Such as he remembered them. And his goals weren't those of a Nazi either - which even Harry could see. All Grindelwald wanted was to beat Voldemort to avenge Albus and redeem himself. Things didn't exactly work out as planned, though, for a variety of reasons.

But there wasn't a fascist "we need a strong, powerful leader" message - that was reverted since said strong powerful leader was insane, as was obvious in the story, and kept messing things up.

***** For me, it's because of what he was during Hogwarts. I can read some Drarry if there's a reasonable catalyst for Draco maturing/recognizing the problems with his beliefs. But this is the same character who at twelve gleefully informed his classmates that they'd be the next target of what turned out to be a basilisk. Not to mention someone who continually belittles Harry's best and only friends, plus his dead parents.

Someone who shouts “you'll be next, mudbloods!” is not, to me, a workable pairing. If you're reading it purely for smut, sure, go for it. But if you're actually reading it for narrative arc, Draco as a character is too much designed to be hated, and so much the anthithesis of Harry that opposites attract cannot even be a thing.

So for me, I can't really read it because Draco is just different for no reason or there's some hasty patching of his backstory to make it all better. And that just doesn't line up with who he is as a character.

My reason for dropping the story was simply that Charmbridge isn't charming - I /wanted/ to go to Hogwarts, psycho teachers and all. Charmbridge just seemed depressing.

What you propose is giving Dementors the space because you believe they will become good. That involves keeping them alive... with good souls. Human sacrifices. Evolution takes millions of years. So you want to give them human sacrifices for millions of years.

And I can guarantee you that Dementors don't evolve. They're a literary trope. And I can't say it often enough, /manifestations of pure evil/. They won't become good. There is nothing good about them. Not a single inkling of them is good. Nothing in them is there that can evolve into civilisation.

Transhumanism is simply the belief that humanity can aspire to greater heights, which it has in common with many religious and nonreligious philosophies, except that it is decoupled from any pretensions to the supernatural

#+begin_quote

Bayesian rationalism is just a heuristic; one that generally works fairly well to sift out decent hypotheses.

#+begin_quote
  Anti-deathism is also fanfiction and a cheap answer to christianity
#+end_quote

I really don't know what you mean by that, but suffice it to say that anti-Deathism is a response to all Deathist ideology, not just Christianity, and it is a response that is much needed. Nearly everyone accepts that they almost certainly will die. It's understandable, given how almost totally inevitable death is. That doesn't mean that we all should be expected to look forward to it though, or worse, that not looking forward to death is somehow a moral failing. Harry Potter itself has an explicitly Deathist message. All seekers of immortality are seen as evil, and all good old wizards up to Nicholas Flamel himself are seen to embrace their eventual demise.

#+begin_quote
  Scientific materialism is morally cold
#+end_quote

So is tennis. Scientific materialism doesn't address moral issues, because morality is not observable. You cannot derive an /ought/ from an /is/. That doesn't mean that scientific materialists do not possess moral beliefs or intuitions, but it does mean they don't pretend their moral intuitions are objectively true.

#+begin_quote
  hedonic ultilitarianism has lead to the degradation of the west

Clarify please, what this "degradation of the West" entails, and how it has been caused by the moral axioms "Pleasant feelings are good and should be maximised" and "Suffering is bad and should be minimised".

Why would it necessarily be a problem?

I can see ways it /could/ become a problem. If the author is promoting their story when it's actually not relevant. If they're hiding their authorship and saying "Check out this amazing story!" as if they're just a reader. If they're clogging up a thread with repeated links to the same thing.

But in the absence of those things, I really don't see much difference between repeatedly recommending a story you love, vs repeatedly recommending a story you loved enough to write it.

But if authors restrict themselves to self-recommendation in cases where their story is actually relevant to the thread, then recommending lots of times would mean either a) they've written a story that's relevant to a variety of readers; or b) people keep asking the subreddit for similar things. In either case, the author has nothing to apologise for.

*** Well, sure, not strictly speaking.

However, literary analysis is a respected field, and the basis of it is that while it's always going to be subjective, it /is/ possible to formalize analysis of various features of a story. Hence you can agree beforehand to some metrics by which to judge the basic quality of a story (quality of prose, length, structure, consistency of the characters), which will allow you to separate your impression of a story's /quality/ from your /feelings/ for the story.

The point of this thread is "what are stories your rational side agrees are well-written, but you just don't /like/ on an emotional level". Of course, opinions are always going to vary on what makes a story well-written, but it's still an interesting question to ask.

/Horcrux/ relies very heavily on the reader having a certain kind of sense of humor that not everyone shares, and rings sort of empty if you lack it.

/Lessons With Hagrid/ uses and helps maintain the annoying, inaccurate "Occlumency is building a crazy mind-palace full of monsters that will physically maim the Legilimens" fanon trope, even if it uses it better than any other fic that helped make it.

/Trial By Troll/ is funny for taking an idea from canon that everyone knows and nobody's used before, but it's by nature a novelty --- one might say that for a fanfiction to be objectively /amazing/, it would need to be entertaining even to someone who knew but the basics of the canon books, just based on its own literary merits.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** I think it was called The Black Heir, basically Harry was Sirius son and went to Durmstrang, Voldemort got interested in him and in the end they made a marriage contract where harry would get pregnant with Voldemorts kid. That is why I stopped reading it and why I dislike it. Back when I first read it, I didn't know what Mpreg means.

*** SAME! I skimmed over his homelife parts and prehogwarts. But I LOVED the way the author did his perspective on the canon events!
