I've been reading a few fics wherein Harry discovers his inheritance, his parents' will and everything that comes with being the heir of Potter family. Now, there is nothing wrong with that, but for the life of me, I can't comprehend why Harry would ask his friends to be there when his account manager reveal what is in his family vault or what is in it. Or when he takes them down to his family vault to help with sorting the things in there. I had thought bank or family matters should be kept private.What are your thoughts on this? Am I just nickpicking?


** Eh. It's not like Gringotts (and the way wills work in such stories) look anything like real-life British law, so I'll allow it. And there's something to be said for the fact that Harry views Ron and Hermione as, for all intents and purposes, a surrogate family.

** I'm personally mad that my bank didn't have a dragon guarding my money ¯_(ツ)_/¯. Fiction is fiction.
