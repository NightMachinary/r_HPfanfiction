** linkao3(Unseen Perspective) is a fic I'm writing where Voldemort isn't shipped with anyone. She's asexual and aromantic. She does have a teenage daughter, but said daughter was conceived through a ritual at someone else's behest.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

**** Oh, Bella did name her Delphi. There are blood magic rituals that allow two women to conceive together, and Bella strongarmed Voldemort into doing one.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos) is the only one I know of. It's been described as "Prince of Slytherin, but it doesn't waste your time," and while I think that's not entirely accurate, it should give you a general idea of whether or not you'll like it, assuming you're familiar with that fic.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
