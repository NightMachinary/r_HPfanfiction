Never really seen either of these. In the first year Voldemort had pretty much every advantage to kill Harry and steal the stone {thanks for bringing it up TV Tropes), possessing Quirrell and Harry not knowing he is the bad guy yet. Shoot, he could have put him in the room with Fluffy and Harry's death could be seen as due to adventuring in the wrong places. Fic can be a short one shot or multi chapter.

I've also never really seen a fic where Harry decides to stay dead after being "killed' in the Forbidden Forest (or it just kills him no questions asked) and everyone else has to find a new way to kill Voldemort.


** These two ideas are so interesting! :) I've never seen them before either! I would love to read them, or yes write them. :)

** Most authors don't want to kill Harry off. Perhaps not make him the main character yes, but straight up offing him? Not common at all. I'm pretty sure I've seen a few fics where Harry fails sometime along the way and dies, but it happens off screen, and Hermione takes over and then there's time-travel and everything else. Or else you have those icky, Voldemort wins, so mudbloods are now slaves to the Death Eaters and all the Draco or Snape redemption stories. I can try to dig up some if you want, but I think they're either rather generic, or pretty bad.

*** I figured it wouldn't be common to see fics that straight up off him. I'll give the generic ones a try if you can pull them up.

  Harry is "the" one with "the" power to defeat the Dark Lord. As in, the only one with the ability to do so. Featuring everyone being a bit smarter, and an education system that makes more sense.

*** Having just read it though, it doesn't really fulfil the request of harry staying dead. It was a fun read, all 7 chapters of unfinished work :(

** It didn't really matter that much whether Harry stayed dead in the Forbidden Forest or not. Harry's sacrifice already nerfed Voldemort to the point where his direct spells would mostly fail against Harry's friends.

Neville would still be able to hack Nagini's head off. Molly would still kill Bellatrix, and Voldemort would be destroyed by the collective efforts of Hogwarts defenders.

Without Harry leading the good guys, there could be a possibility of bad guys regrouping and clinging onto power after the War.
