Hey guys, new author here, and looking for some advice. I'm 9 chapters into my first multi-chapter fanfic. I started cross posting to ao3, and was doing some minor edits as I went. However, while I was editing/re-reading, I came to the conclusion that one of my chapters really doesn't fit in with the rest of the story. I had done a PoV switch, and I don't like it. So I'd like to remove the chapter from my FFN post... but I'm not sure what the etiquette is with that. Do I just re-upload the other chapters and overwrite it, or leave it as a "blank" chapter, or what? How does that effect reviews? Thanks in advance!


** Better correct mistakes early than never.

I would overwrite any changed chapters and put an A/N at the top.

** I'm like 41 chapters into my story and I still edit my chapters if I see any mistakes. You'll do just fine. Just put a note in bold at the end of the chapter saying what you edited and why.

There's no need to reupload chapters. FFN has a little red button on the far right in Content tab of your Story properties page that allows you to delete specific chapters.

  How does that effect reviews?
#+end_quote

Positively. I had a turnover rate of 45% from my 1st to 2nd chapter and 85% from my 2nd to 3rd chapter before I did my edits, and afterwards it went up to 65% and 95% respectively. If anything, improving the story increases traffic, which increases the chance of getting reviews.

** If you have a few chapters after it and don't want to rewrite them, I would change the bad chapter to an A/N explaining the situation and also put an A/N at the top of the next chapter explaining what happened. You might want to also take a look at how the chapters of either side transition into each other. It could lead to a rather jarring break of immersion, especially if you ever referenced something that happened in the chapter to be cut.

** Just overwrite it, even though you lose the reviews.

** I'd agree with the previous replies. Also answer any questions from your readers if they ask about the change.

** Notify your readers if you're so inclined, I guess. But the replace/update feature is there for a reason - authors (myself included) want to edit things all the time. If the change has a significant impact on the plot, then yes, inserting an author's note at the top would be worthwhile.

** Since you can delete single chapters from Ao3 stories (at least, I assume that's what the "Delete chapter" button is for...), I say just remove the chapter and then include an author's note in either the following chapter or in the latest one where you explain that you've removed a chapter and why you did it.
