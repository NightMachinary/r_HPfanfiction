At the beginning of 5th year, on the train to Hogwarts, they learn Draco Malfoy was made prefect. Hermione gets mad at the message that sends to the other students, to give a blood-purist bully power over them. Every non-Slytherin prefect signs a petition saying they will quit if they have to work with Malfoy. Some of the Slytherin prefects sign it too (everyone except Malfoy and Parkinson?) and when they're questioned, they say they don't like his bullying either - not all Slytherins are the same. They might take up a separate petition for the non-prefect Slytherins about refusing to accept Malfoy's authority?

After the Welcoming Feast, the prefects approach Dumbledore en masse. He tries to put them off but they say they won't escort the firsties to bed until Dumbledore hears them. They all go into the antechamber and present him with the petition/ultimatum. Snape snarls. Dumbledore gives them a sad speech about forgiveness and second chances. The Head Boy (possibly a Hufflepuff named Bob?) gives /him/ a sad speech about sacrificing other children for one's redemption. Dumbledore backs down and Malfoy is de-badged.

As you can see, I remember this moment clearly, but nothing about the rest of the fic. Anyone know it?


** This sounds interesting. If anyone finds it, I'd like to read it too.

** I remember reading this a few months ago. No idea what the title was, but I'll skim through my library and see if I can find it. Can't promise I'll have any luck but I'll give it a shot.

*** I remember a story where the Head Boy was a Hufflepuff named Bob something and I think it might be this one. I don't know why "Bob" though.
