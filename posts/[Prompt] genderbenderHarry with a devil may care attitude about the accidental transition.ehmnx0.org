I just read a one-shot and I think it has a great idea behind it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9461482/1/Harry-Potter-Gender-Swap]].

Harry gets into so much shit, this should seem like nothing to him and then he just goes on and enjoys trying out new stuff as a girl. I know it's unrealistic but I think itd be fun to read.

Biggest important point I think is to focus on the school life implications etc, just ignore all the Voldemort and horcruxes and stuff


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][The Archeologist]]

BAMF Curse Breaker Harry wakes up in an AU world as his sister... he does not really care about the gender swap, as he concentrates on other stuff.

This seems contradictory. Generally you either have "gender identity is a super big deal for Harry', and the fic puts main plot on hold to focus on the life changes, or you have the 'gender bender is interesting, but when you are fighting for your life and your arm just got turned into a bird wing, you have other priorities'

With a devil may care attitude, not sure why the plot would stop for it? If anything, it becomes interesting because of the lack of time Harry has to deal with it and having to deal with it on the run. (The same reason you can have good romance/friendship content when in a story where it is a low character priority).

The one that comes to mind is the one where Harry was a secret metamorph and goes girl for him and Hermione to hide at the French school.

I thought Harry's reaction to it was nice. I thought all the other characters reactions were *$#@#$. Hermione: telling parents how she was almost raped at school yet is worried if her father knew she escaped with the help of a different male friend. Her mother $@@#$ agreeing with her. Fluer's first reaction to refugee transfer students is that Harry needs lessons in female manners /rolls eyes/. Even if Harry played it cool, the rest of the world was forcing cliched gender bender scenarios

*** You're absolutely right but at this point I'm running out of good gender bender Harry stories to read that don't fuck up with the cliches too much. I liked the one shot I mentioned and hoped to find something similar.

The one you mentioned seemed nice, I always love it when Harry and Hermione are besties. Link?

*** I think they meant implications in the sense of what other people think or say. Like, Harry shows up as a woman one day, everyone loses their minds and promises to search for a solution, but (s)he's just completely nonchalant like "eh don't worry about it"

This was the only one I could think of. There are some nice sentimental moments but it's a lot of fun including Harry flirting with a flustered Draco and bonding with Lavender over makeup. For the most part, if I remember, Voldemort isn't a huge factor until the end.

This one's fun because Harry does choose to go with the transition but doesn't realize it's for a whole year.

****** Not with gender bending no :(

A lot of the stuff I read tends to lean towards Hermione/Harry for the most part. The only fic coming to mind with a strong friendship but somewhat lighthearted would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5938788/1/The-Thing-About-Contracts-Is][The Thing About Contracts Is]]. This one doesn't have as strong of friendship but it is lighthearted and Hermione is one of the few people that Harry trust. It's not as slice-of-life but the parts on Voldemort don't really come until the end.

Not sure about you, but my entire friend circle agreed that being magically turned into a girl wouldn't be bad at all. We played that scenario through a few times while drunk and the general plan of action would be along the lines of:

- Try out the new gear (to ensure that you are actually a woman)

- Dress butch (aka as usual)

- Find out where you can meet lesbians

- Business as usual

Other than having a smaller pool of potential partners, nothing else has changed.

*** I've read a lot of your fics I think! I also think the last time I posted about genderbenderHarry, you said the same thing haha. And yeah, idk of you read the one-shot I linked but it's showing Harry with the attitude you just said I think except she'd embrace the girliness. Tbh I kinda just wanted a fanfic using that one-shot as a starting point.

Edit: ps, I'm still patiently awaiting updates on No Longer Alone. Loved all your other HPfics

*** Same, honestly. Like, without all the stress a mundane transition brings, I'd be strangely ok with it. And I'd not consider myself trans either, I like being me, but it would be neat to experience life from the other side.

I think the biggest headache would be

- documentation, you probably need a whole new set of cards and a name and everything which takes time and money

- other people not accepting it because they're bigots

** There's one fic that I know of like this. It's a time loop fic and features Harry going a bit insane at the end, but he does transform into a girl and have a lot of fun while doing it. I realize that it isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it is well written and humorous, so I say it's worth a quick read. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6916042/1/Not-Again]]

** For your prompt, the best fic I know is Archaeologist by Racke, but that's been recommended already. On a less gender-related note, there are a few fics around where Harry specifically freaks out when nothing happens and only calms down when shit starts going horrifically wrong again. He's at a fancy party being uncomfortable, then it gets attacked and he's happy again, that kind of thing.
