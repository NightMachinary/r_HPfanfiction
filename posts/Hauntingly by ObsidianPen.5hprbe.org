I just finished reading the epilogue and I am /numb/. This story is incredible, and it actually finished. Those two traits rarely coexist in fanfiction.

Apart from the level of writing, which is the exact /opposite/ of shit-tier, the character development and sheer feeling made practically tangible through just a few words was... surreal.

It's 6:50AM and I haven't yet had my coffee, so take my ramblings with a grain of salt, but /this/ is why I read. Bad things happened. They were not glorified or lingered upon for shock value. This felt real, for better or for worse, and I really hope I can find something similar to it to fill this new void.

/Goodness./

*** Why are people so opposed to reading stuff that's slash?

I mean, if you know that it's good and it's highly recommended, what is it about it being slash that puts you off?

I ask out of curiosity, as I see a lot of people say "no slash" even when the fics might well be great.

**** Lots of reasons. I like to get into the head of the main character and find overly detailed descriptions of slash breaks immersion very quickly. I also find that the tropes and stereotypes in slash tend to be things I'm not interested in...hurt/comfort and angst are SUPER common in my experience. This is especially true in fics where Harry is the main character and is a sub or similar.

Quite a few slashfics tend to spend a nonzero amount of time talking about homosexuality and the issues/prejudices associated with it, which doesn't fit with my head canon of the potterverse (I tend to think there's basically no sexism, racism, and...gayism (?) presented in the books, so to agonize about how hard it is going to be to be gay is super irritating to me. I know it's a commentary about real world difficulty but HP Verse is not real life). Not to say that I avoid all things that diverge from my head canon, but that's another immersion breaker.

So in summary the content, characters, and canon tends to diverge from what I like and despite reading for years and years now, I have not reached a point where I ran out enough to NEED to start reading slash. It's just an easy filter that I can default to.

For the record, I really dislike romance in general, and almost nobody writes a non-romance slashfic...it's just not done. If you're writing slash, it's ABOUT the slash 99% of the time.

***** Ok, I'm a slash reader, but this is the best "no slash" defense I've seen.

Although really, it looks like you're "no romance" - and you're right, there are few slash fics that aren't romance (or erotica) as their primary genre.

****** I'll read romance on occasion, but slash tends to be a Venn diagram of stuff I really don't like.

There's probably a huge portion of people who are just squicked out by gays, but after I read a few I got a feeling for the genre and had a good feeling on if I would like more.

****** That's my big problem with slash too. The fact that slash fits almost always have at least a decent focus on romance and romance isn't what I like to read about, straight or gay.

***** I agree with Hurt/Comfort and Angst being my least favorite genres. Not because of the themes per say, but because it's usually terribly done. It's a really hard genre to tackle without going overboard, and maintaining reader interest.

I do find the immersion thing funny though. The ability to relate to characters living in a magical school filled with ghosts and spell casting, but not with attraction between two men.

Strange, isn't it? To be fair I also get sick of characters that are too childlike, too pompous, or too stupid for my personal tastes. Even more strange, I have no problem with women POVs...unless they're primarily romance.

**** I don't mind now, but this one I might skip because of the pairing. Also the romance tag, as I prefer gen fics.

I was one of these people, because I used to see slash as something written primarily in the interest of romance or smut, with an eye to pairing first and everything else later. I also skip most het romance/smut oriented fics(or the few scenes in them). I then read linkffn(10099028), and that was the end of that approach. I realized that it isn't all romance.

I read the entire sacrifices arc slightly after that, and although I skimmed over some of the smut and fluff I finished it for the plot, and the great writing. This despite all the problems I had with it.(too low on humour for me, the action interspersed with angst and fluff was not my cup of tea, and I wish it hadn't been so influential)

In my experience, many people feel it isn't for them, and is written with a specific audience in mind.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

**** It's just nothing that is attractive to me. I even find femslash to be quite entertaining. I happen to really like the Power of Love series by Philosophize. I'm just really not into two dudes snogging, no matter how well it's done. I have been accused of homophobia many times due to my dislike of m/m pairings. I hope this short explanation will suffice for you to not jump to the same 'conclusion' as many others.

** Honestly, totally agree. So many fics in this pairing are total crap, but this fic blows away even gen fics. I am super impressed by it and need to read it again.

This fic had me from the very first chapter, which contained probably the first proper usage of Pepper Up potion I've ever seen in a fic. I'm not super fond of the prequel (which I actually read after discovering Hauntingly), but it does explain a few things in Hauntingly. I'm definitely keeping Hauntingly, but not the prequel.

An HPLV with zero bashing or dark apologist crap... amazing by itself. But it's also a story where romance isn't the point, even if it is a big plot point. It's really so excellent I can barely believe it was actually Harry Potter fanfic.

  Alive. Hidden. Concealed in the metaphorical closet, and the ominous, creaking footsteps outside belong to a monster... He's sniffing the air in anticipation. He's craving more than the scent. Intoxicated by his own bloodlust, and a fleeting moment of weakness is all he needs. "Harry Potter...I will have you..." HP/LV/TR. In the most unhealthy, twisted way. Sequel to 'Mine'.
