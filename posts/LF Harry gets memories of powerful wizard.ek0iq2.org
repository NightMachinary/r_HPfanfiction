So I just read The One He Feared by Taure, and in it Harry gets the memories of Dumbledore. Are there any other stories like this? The memories don't have to be Dumbledore‘s, they could be Voldemort‘s or Grindelwald's or anyone's really.

** Oh, my. I literally just finished reading one of these called The Lesser Sadness. Very much years-unfinished, but the writer has apparently said elsewhere that nothing of theirs is ever abandoned.

Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before.

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** I'm reading one right now called The Partially Kissed Hero. It's total crack but super well written and awesome, with a bunch of minor crossovers. Featuring super duper evil Dumbledore (not typical “oh dumbles did bad stuff let's send him away”, more like he is the total evil master that no one realizes) with a side appearance of ‘Dark Muggle Lord' Colonel Sanders. Endgame H/Hr/Luna/Susan (mostly Hermione, others mainly political so not super harem-y, no worries). Harry is partially kissed by a dementor on the train to Hogwarts, and it shakes loose the Horcrux in his head, and the battle for control kills the fragment, while granting all its knowledge to Harry. linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero)
