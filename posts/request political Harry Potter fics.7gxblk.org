So I love the show House of Cards (ignoring what's currently surrounding it) and I want to read some fics similar to that. If possible, with either Harry or a Slytherin as main character. You know, something that focuses on the workings of the MOM. Also long or recently updated if possible. Throw in decent grammar too if you can. Although I'm practically making it impossible with that many specifications.

As an example: I once read this awesome fic by a political history student, I mean, it did end up with a bit of a dictatorship, but I don't mind, it was really great. So if anyone read that, I'd love to have something similar recommended.


** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) features Harry, Ron and Hermione in Slytherin. It's multiple POV and has a big focus on politics. It's a planned seven volume series (one for each year). The final chapter of volume one is going up this weekend along with the first chapter of volume two. Volume one will be almost 60k words when complete.

** This one has a good bit of politics in it, as a lot rests around the wizengamot, the noble houses, etc, but it may not fit your bill exactly. Central theme of the story is Sirius reshaping the wizard world to raise Harry. Harry and Sirius are main characters. Complete and VERY long. ~900,000 words.
