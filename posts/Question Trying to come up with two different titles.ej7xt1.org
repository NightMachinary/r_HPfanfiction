So; I'm not good at titles at all. I'm fairly good at coming up with different ideas, (At least I like to think so; anyway) but the titles always come out as really lame/stupid.

So for the first story: Dumbledore is furious at Sirius for the Shrieking Shack "prank" and decides to do something about it, while also doing something about Snape's home life at hand. It'll be set in the Marauder Era World, I have a good chunk thought out; but not sure on the overall pairings. I'd like to use the word fate or change in the title, but might be too generic? Any ideas? (Doesn't have to have the title as fate or change)

Another one is an AU sorting where the Sorting Hat is annoyed at being told what house to send the children; by the children, and decides to change things up. I'm honestly thinking Hufflepuff Harry, instead of Slytherin Harry for this one, the why will become apparent in the story.

Any ideas for a title for either story?


** is any of the first story released? It sounds really good.

Honestly, I suck at naming things or else I would help sorry.

*** It's not released yet, the way I do it is weird, I have it in my head, get a lot of ideas in my head for it; write it down, get someone to beta it and then I'll publish it.

I'll self promote it, if people are curious, once I do the first chapter.
