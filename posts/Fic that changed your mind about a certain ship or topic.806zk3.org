To clarify, you started reading a fic on Ao3 but you missed a tag or pairing in the description or you started reading despite that tag. The story makes you enjoy that thing that you previously despised and vice versa. Tomarry is my otp for this reason.


** Well, linkffn(Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) made me rethink my assertion that "all soul bond stories are shit."

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Actually it was one of my first stories I ever read for FanFiction. It's called Games are Afoot by grumpy grizzly. It was a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger story in which I completely missed the pairing noted. Before then, I never much was interested in Charlie but like Daphne Greengrass, he's a blank canvas one can work with. Of course, many portray him as some sort of sex god, a la Christian Grey, which is unfortunate but Games are Afoot does not which is why I like it so much. The story definitely opened my eyes to the Charlie/Hermione pairing in which one could make the case that they're rather compatible. It's actually my second favorite pairing to read now. However, the ship isn't terribly popular so the stories with them are far too few for my liking.

** For me it is linkffn(2473502) Oathbreaker. It has everything I typically avoid (Slash for the main character, some weird parings, some weird creature stuff). But damn, this story still rocks. It is one of the few where 'Dark Magic' actually seems dark and disgusting but still somewhat attractive. It is about a dying culture which is somehow on the one hand rotten and on the other hand very loyal.

It actually manages to build a living and breathing world, if you get what I mean?

** I can't point to a single fic, but I used to like Dramione fics. I got kinda lucky I think and only read decent ones early on (which I still enjoy, like Charicature of Intimacy mentioned by [[/u/LHPF]] ), but after a while I read more and more of the shitty ones (idiotic and submissive Hermoine with no self respect; leather-pants Draco who just wants to be loved and is simply acting out and pulling pigtails).

I just stopped reading the pairing because it's too much shit to wade through.

** Before "A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles" I was very iffy about Snape. You know, he was the mean teacher who killed Dumbledore. But that damn story made me think of him as a 3 dimensional character with flaws and redeeming traits and placed me firmly on team pro-Snape

** I never liked Dramione, I know it's a popular ship but I hated it with all my heart because of the way Draco treated Hermione at Hogwarts, then someday I was bored and decided to read a fanfic called A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3878384/1/A-Wonderful-Caricature-of-Intimacy]]) and started to love the ship.

And then something happened, and I accidentally read a Drarry fic.

It was good. Really good. Good enough for me to start not only tolerating the ship, but actively /liking/ it.

***** Is there anything you remember about it? Plot details, word count range, rating (even knowing if had was explicit/mature or teen/general, it's possible to mark multiple ratings at once in your search), any specific words or phrases in the summary, other pairings, most featured character, tags in the summary? Ao3 is actually really good at finding fics you've forgotton the title for, because of all the different filters, the tag system, and the very useful search bar. I've had an account there at least 4 years, I might be able to track it down. I would love to help, it's really satisfying to finally find a fic someone is looking for.

Draco commented something about Harry showing everyone he's a hero, but only shows him the traumatised solider out of everyone.
