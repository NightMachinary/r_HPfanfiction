How is Voldemort's permanent Death explained (no use of Horcruxes or the disability to use them)?

Is there a loophole in the general accepted (head)canon(s)? Or is it usuasly not explained at all?

I'm doing reseach for a fic in which Prongs tramples Voldie at the front door.

P.S.: Not sure, if I used the right flair... Seemed to me it was the closed one to 'Question'.


** The only Jily Lives story I ever read has the idea that Voldemort dying /on Halloween/ had some sort of significance that cancelled his Horcruxes' ability. Other than that, got nothin'.

** Not going to lie, but I've always thought "Jily" sounded like some sort of venereal disease.

** If it's your story, you can just say that Voldemort never made horcruxes. There are plenty of good stories without them.

Alternatively, Voldemort's soul is anchored but his body isn't. If your James can win a duel there's no reason his body can't be destroyed the same as it was in canon.

There's not really a single answer to this question because your story should answer it.

** You could simply kill his body. Sure, now you have fancyWraith!Voldemort, but that one is a lot less deadly. Keep repeating step one until he runs out of respawns (there's got to be a limit, right?).

*** Or if there isn't a limit on respawns, use the respawn time to hunt those mostly undefended horcruxes.

*** I thought Horcruxes did not work that way? They are not respawns?

**** There's got to be a limitation on how often they work, especially considering the unequal amount of soul in each of them.

***** If you consider how Dumbledore talked about toms death, along with how Voldemort acted himself after his death he obviously has re-spawns. This is true but the time it would take to re-spawn without help would be much slower then we saw in cannon which took 14 years for him to come back. I assume that having multiple horcuxes would exponentially add onto the time it would take to re-spawn. This would explain why Voldemort fled to a safe place no one really knew, if he thought as a wraith I only have to wait a month or something he wouldn't bother getting help. This is my head cannon at least, and it helps explain away some of the idiotic actions of the villain and cements Dumbledore reasoning for not recognizing why Voldemort used horcruxes until the second book as if it had a statement stating how it'll help the maker regain a mortal form if its destroyed and it obviously didn't for Tom well its why its my head cannon.

***** The horcruxes dont affect how he returns, they only tie his soul to the world. Voldemort can always come back as long his soul is tied to the world and as long he is able to create new bodies for himself.

** I read one fic where James and Lily had been too late to stop Voldemort from killing Harry, but did stop him from killing Neville.

Harry and Co show up from another universe due to exploding Time-Turners, and Harry has an /interesting/ reaction to the Unforgivables.

** In “Emperor”, James and Lily were a lot more paranoid and didn't trust Dumbledore at all. They got Voldemort with a nasty trap.
