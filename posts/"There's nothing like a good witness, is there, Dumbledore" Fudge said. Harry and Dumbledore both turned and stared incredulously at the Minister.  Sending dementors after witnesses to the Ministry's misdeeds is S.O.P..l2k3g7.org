:FlairText: Double Prompt
:END:
Prompt 1:\\
After having Barty Crouch given the Kiss before he could be further questioned, discrediting Harry over his claims about Voldemort's return, and trying to dismiss Mrs. Figg's testimony at Harry's trial, /now/ Fudge thinks there's nothing like a good witness?\\
 \\
Prompt 2:\\
Sirius Black; imprisoned without trial, sentenced to the Kiss after escaping Azkaban (note that the escaped Death Eaters two books later were not).\\
Barty Crouch Jr.; illegally removed from Azkaban by his father, summarily given the kiss after being apprehended, before being questioned.\\
Harry Potter; speaking against the Ministry, eyewitness to Voldemort's return, targeted for assassination via Kiss by Dolores Umbridge.\\
What if this is a trend and the Ministry has a habit of sending dementors after those that could tarnish its image?\\
 \\
Bonus points for combining the two prompts; Harry mocks Fudge for caring about witnesses /now/, asks a rhetorical question about him liking to have witnesses assassinated by dementors, before realising just who else could have ordered the attack on him over the summer.

** ... Thanks for that, now I've wound up with a scene. Not Harry specifically, but... well, have a read.

+---------+

"Yes, /Mr/ Fudge, there is nothing like a good witness," stated Megan as she leaned back against the wall, still not sure why she was there. "Unfortunately, you seem to have this bad habit of only getting useless ones. Maybe if you left the soul eating dread wraiths elsewhere, or sent them back to whatever hell spawned them, you'd have more luck with finding a 'good witness'."

She looked around the room, frowning slightly at the two Aurors and Umbridge, who had been the one to claim a witness. "After all, if you hadn't tried to get Black chewed, had Crouch killed without even talking to him and hadn't sent those two floating corpses up the Thames and thankfully into the traps set up by SPECTRE, you wouldn't be relying on a petty criminal that's probably had far too many knocks to the head or melted too many brain cells as a 'good witness'," she said.

"Yet you don't deny that you were in the Hog's Head on that day," Umbridge simpered, drawing a disgusted look from the girl.

Megan shrugged easily before frowning slightly, "No, I was in the pub, but I wasn't there for any of the bull crap Little Miss Brainbox was blathering about." Running a hand through her dark blue hair, she braced a foot on the wall. "I was there having a drink, a cinnamon cider, when that lot came in and started blathering. Most of them were having a gripe session about the lack of useful things in Defence this year; after all, I'd imagine some of the seventh years want to become Aurors or curse breakers or something after school."

Shrugging again at peoples looks, she continued. "I can't say as I know what Auror training is like, but Police training runs three to five years, not even counting the fact you're supposed to have a year as a junior cadet while in school, and those who get licences for batons, Tasers, pistols, shotguns, SMGs or night sticks..." she trailed off for a moment before shaking her head, "or some other things I can't remember, get a preferred run through the process."

Dumbledore leaned forwards slightly, his eyes seeming to twinkle in amusement at the way Fudge and Umbridge flinched at Megan's comments. "While I can't say how the Auror force is trained, Miss Jones, I think it would be more worth our esteemed Minister's time if you could tell us what you saw in the Hog's Head, after all, he is so sure that a good witness will help settle this matter," he said dryly.

“There's not too much to tell honestly,” Megan said. “Lilith, Sally-Anne and I went in to the pub to have some brunch and a drink away from the rest of the school. After they left, I lingered a while over my cider, long enough to see Granger and Weasley half-way drag Potter there in.” She waved at Harry. “They didn't see me and took a table further into the room, getting some butterbeers. A few minutes later a bunch of others mostly from third year up crashed the party. There was some back and forth while the red twins got drinks for everyone, much to Old Abe's disgust, once everyone was settled; Granger started having a whinge fest about reading Slinkhard's book.”

“I see,” Dumbledore said, looking somewhat amused, though whether it was due to his brother or Megan's comments she wasn't sure. “Did anything else happen?”

“Yup,” Megan said. Frowning slightly, she ran her fingers through her hair. “Granger said some things about having a club---” she ignored Umbridge's exclamation at that “--- for defence and claimed Voldemort was back.” Megan shrugged as several people flinched. “Smith started mouthing off about it, saying about how you'd only said Cedric had been killed the end of last year and how they had the ‘/right/' to pry into what happened.

“It was about that point I decided I was done listening to them talk rubbish and called Smith out,” she continued flatly. “I told Smith to shut his cake hole and called Granger a muppet and asked her if she'd lost the plot, or even had one, for dragging a bunch of gormless twits around to a dog's dinner. Potter didn't seem like he wanted to be about that bunch of anoraks, which I can't blame him for given they were staring at him like a piece of meat a few minutes prior.

“Granger asked me how I'd deal with that tosser, Voldemort, I told her, same as I'd done a year or two back when a vacation in New Zealand went sideways and we had a bunch of terrorists to deal. Put two in the chest and one in the head,” Megan said. “Smith decided to act an arse about then, so he got thumped and I left. Didn't hear anything about any club, not that it would be illegal anyway, this gannet can't exactly write laws for everyone, and even if she could for the school, it's still got to get past the head and the board, plus that ‘educational decree' might be /claimed/ to be law, but it's not legal without going through the full government and being implemented by the board and headmaster, not a made up title for a professor too big for her boots and too impatient to /earn/ her stripes.”

“So you didn't see Potter form this club?” Fudge asked pompously.

Megan gave him a flat look. “No I didn't, if it happened, it was probably a) after I'd left and b) mostly pushed by Granger,” she said. “Honestly, apart from claiming Voldemort's back, which... eh...” she shrugged.

“There's some ways to pull that trick off so it might be possible, he's not really been up to much bar being a temperamental Bell End, which could be hormones or something to do with the crud dumped on him. My therapist has mentioned sometimes you need ways to vent when things get wrenches in the works, or drugs, depending on how bad they are.”

She looked at Fudge, arching an eyebrow at him. “You might want to pick a date to see a shrink yourself, and drag her with you, can't imagine it's easy dealing with your shite particularly after losing several witnesses to things inexplicably. Might help her get over her strop as well, especially after several people walked from her classes and found better teachers.”
