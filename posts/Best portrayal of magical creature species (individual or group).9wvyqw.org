What stories have the best examples of magical creatures? Best lore? Best ideas that stood out to you? Best characterization? Looking for: Phoenix Basilisk Vampire Centaur Giant/Dwarves Goblins Unicorn Mer/Aquatic species Thestrals Dragons Werewolf. Can be a single story that answers only one of the species, or a story that is specific to multiple! Length doesn't matter! Everything is appreciated! Let me know if there's something not on the list!


** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; The Wolf Lord; My Brother; Chrysochlorous; The Beast Within; To Fight the Coming Darkness; 9893407; 12681634)

Eclipse is in my top 3 fav fics all time (which is funny considering I dropped halfway the first time I read, then I picked it up again during a drought and fell in love with it) and goes a bit into various magical creatures, but mostly the one that the author created, called Reach, sort of a energy vampire.

Wolf Lord has some things that you might like, a bit of pack-mind and stuff like that.

My Brother, after and during 3rd year has a lot of political and social discussions about werewolves.

Chrysoclorous, I know its a x-over with Twilight, but it's IMO the best xover and source Twilight fic there is. So there's that.

TBW has different things from usual and its quite cute. Its this fic that made me fall in love with Imagine Dragons, curiously.

To Fight the Coming Darkness has a bunch of info about Vamps and is mostly about Dementors. Not a fan of the fic, got bored halfway, but you might like it.

TF has A LOT of vampire sociaty info, there's also slaves and Dementors and other creatures. You might like it, I'd rate a 4/10.

The Unexpected, can't say cuz otherwise I'll spoil, but I've haven't found a fic where this creature is a MC.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

    I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other.\\

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
