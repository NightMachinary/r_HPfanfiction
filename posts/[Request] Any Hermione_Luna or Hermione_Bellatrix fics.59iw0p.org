Hermione and Luna are my two favorite characters in the HP series. I think the two girls would definitely make it work between them, with Luna's quirkiness and Hermione's intelligence, I see them as a plausible pairing


** "Murder most Horrid". It's an AU with Bellatrix as a hard-boiled Auror.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** linkffn(11756161) No Good Deed is a interesting fic. There is a lot of pretty violent sex involved, so if that isn't your thing, don't read it... and at second thought don't read Hermione / Bellatrix in general. Its pretty slow moving, too with Hermione constantly having angsty internal conflicts that eventually border on the redundant. Its somewhat compensated by the character of Bellatrix, who is still a psycho bitch, but with some reason and drive behind her actions other than sadism.

linkffn(7755315) Those Gilded Chains We Wear is great at the start, if you ignore the somewhat forced explanation as to how Bellatrix isn't rotting in Azkaban during the entire story. Eventually it looses drive and the emotional struggle turns into some weird sort of fluff. However, its definitely worth the read. Also pretty violent at the start, but with a much more active Hermione.

From what has already been recommended I underline Time Heals All Wounds. Its arguably the best Hermione/Bellatrix out there.

Also Crazy Little Things is a great, happy piece of Hermione/Luna.

*** Just finished reading Time Heals All Wounds and the sequel to it last night, and I also read Crazy Little Things, and I have to say that they are probably my new favorite fanfics anywhere, I loved the thought of a more innocent Bellatrix, and an explanation as to why she turned out the way she is canonically. I also love Crazy Little Things because I just always though Luna could bring a peace to Hermione she didn't previously experience, plus I never thought her and Ron really belonged together to be honest
