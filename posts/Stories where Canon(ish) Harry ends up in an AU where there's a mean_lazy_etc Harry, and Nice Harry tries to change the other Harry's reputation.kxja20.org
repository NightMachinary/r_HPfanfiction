Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine. Note it also doesn't have to be 100% what I stated either. Just anything remotely similar.

No Harem, No Incest.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing (If at all possible here). No Weasley's using Harry for fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** I think I sqw a rec earlier today where he takes over evil Harry's body. Try reading back posts
