I have nothing to do so I've been reading up on HP fanfics, and I usually like Romione fanfics but I haven't been able to find any I like or really intrigue me currently. I like AUs but don't mind any kind. I'm just requesting some interesting ones people have read


** My favorite Romione fics:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], is set in a non magical sci-fi AU. Events loosely mirror those in canon, but Year 7 is significantly different. This Trio is awesome though!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): is a long war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a major AU in which Lucius Malfoy took over Magical Britain in 1981 and Harry was raised by Sirius in France. He went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys, and was personally taught by Dumbledore there. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
