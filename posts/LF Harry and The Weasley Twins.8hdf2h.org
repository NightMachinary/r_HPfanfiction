** I really haven't seen stories like these before without the Twins acting all ‘good‘ while everyone else is bashed. It really does get annoying.

I don't know about the Twins, but I do know a story where Harry and Percy become close. I suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857153/1/Unspeakables][Unspeakables]] by Ebenbild. It is definitely amusing and surprisingly well written. Basically, Harry and Percy time travel. linkffn(11857153) Status: Ongoing

  Twenty one years after the war, the Death Eaters strike back and the Weasley, Potter and Lupin families die. Thank Merlin, Harry knows exactly what to do. "An' in the Minishtry... er... th' Depaaamen... er... Demammend... er... y'know... the mishterious thingy!... there'sh a roooom! A room foa time!" Oddly enough, this time Percy is along for the ride. Unspeakable! Harry and Percy, time travel.

**** Actually, I think I know a fic where Bill is really close to Harry! Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765600/1/The-Past-and-Future-War][The Past and Future War]] by AlexDnD. It's a really good Bill centric fic that I would highly recommend. Sadly, it has not been updated for awhile but it's a wonderful read anyways.

I cannot believe that I forgot about this one!

** It saddens me that the twins are put on these high pedestals while the rest of the family is, most of the time, bashed in some way. I love all the Weasleys equally, and I really don't understand the bashing trend. The Weasleys are a great family.

  He choked on his tears as he started violently coughing again. The smoke was still billowing through the door, filling the room more and more, with only little escaping through the window. The room was getting too hot to stand. He could feel his eyelids drooping as he began to succumb to his exhaustion and lack of oxygen. Mentor!Charlie NO SLASH! Independent!Harry in early chapters
