Hello fellow fanficcers! Like so many others, I too am looking to locate a fic I found years ago and can't remember the title or even the archive where I found it... Though I suspect it suspect it was in aff.net or what ever the domain is nowadays...

I remember Harry hearing a mental call in Hogwarts that led him to the deep bowels of the castle, where he discovers an ancient magical creature that has been trapped and imprisoned under the castle when it was built to... I really don't remember why, maybe to power the wards or something...

The creature is weak but has enough strength to implant a seed in Harry's back with a sharp vine. The creature is humanoid, part human, part plant. Human looking, but with a bulb growing on their back from which different kind of vines can be generated from, including the reproductive vine that planted the seed in Harry.

After this, Harry finds another of the same species, that takes him in and teaches him about their species. Somewhere along the way the creature under the school manages to gather enough strength to brake free and in the process destroys the castle.

The story has one, maybe even more, sequels, in which more of the creatures surface/are found.

I would really appreciate any and all help anyone could possibly give in finding this story.


** I found this [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/modules/challenges/challenges.php?chalid=148][challenge]], which seems to have something like this, but was never picked up. There is a brief mention of a character living in symbiosis with a plant (not Harry) in the somewhat not good [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732115/39/Tales-Of-A-Maho-Shinobi][Tales Of A Maho Shinobi]] (chapter 39 if you want to know). I'd cation against searching for "Harry back seed fanfiction", there is a lot of porn out there. Devil's snare gets a surprising amount of action: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9529460/1/Devil-s-Snare][Devil's Snare]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1608257][Hermione Granger and the Devil's Snare]], [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095554][Succubus Snare]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6363223/1/Snared-by-a-Devil][Snared by a Devil]] to name a few. Even the Whomping willow gets in on it! I mean [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2375339][Sap]] and its sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2394428][Sapling]] are worth a read I guess, if only to say you too have read a Harry Potter/Whomping Willow fic. If girls are more your thing there is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6942277][Whomp with the Willow]] instead. I mean "Harry is a Tree Slut" is a tag on AO3 with more then one work (ok, there are two there, but still!).

Yeah. I'll report back if I find anything else my fellow remindme peeps.

** I've never come across this story, but the description of the bulb reminds me a lot of a cosmetic backpack/back armor from the mmo Guild Wars 2 called [[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey][Mawdrey]].

It's a reference to Little Shop of Horrors, since you also get an item called "Mawdrey II" when you make it that eats some stuff called Bloodstone Dust.
