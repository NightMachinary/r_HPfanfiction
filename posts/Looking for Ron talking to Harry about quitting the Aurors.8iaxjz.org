The fic is a one-shot I'm pretty sure. They're at a pub, having some drinks?

Ron talks about how he's really not liking being an Auror and that he wants to quit, but he feels like that would be abandoning Harry.

Harry reassures him and mentions that George would probably be happy to have Ron working at his shop.

It's a pretty wholesome bro moment.

  My take on how Ron ended up leaving the Auror department to work with George at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Featuring a near-death experience, an idle threat, and Hermione's nasty habit of confunding people that she doesn't agree with. Trio Friendship fic set in the year 2000.

Still though, the hunt continues...

** I remember reading one about him evaluating his life choices after he finds out Hermione is pregnant. He goes on an auror mission and either does get injured or just narrowly misses getting injured, then he goes to Harry and explains that he thinks it's time for a career change.
