#+begin_quote
  When Daphne expresses her insecurities, Harry decides to prove to her that she's just as wonderful and sexy as the day he married her. He didn't expect his two teenage daughters and his wife's best friend to want the same treatment. Warnings inside. Rated M for a reason.

The Breeding Ground and JDS's stories are far better written in my opinion, but VenomBat has written a ridiculous amount of smut in stories dedicated and not dedicated to it.

**** I've always thought that of Venombat's smut. There's only a few engaging scenes in his smut fics, something Megamatt and James Davey Smith do very well at. Venombat's is very generic and really doesn't have anything of a plot, something which Megamatt and James Davey Smith do, even if their smutfics are just oneshots. Venombat essentially puts a name and face to a girl, gives her a workable personality, and then repeats "FUCK ME HARRY!" every chapter.

***** Venombat's work is just hilariously bad. The SPAG is good enough to be readable, but aside from that it's the most shallow and unsexy smut I've ever seen. They literally used the sentence "Astoria took Harry's face and moved closer, thus making out with him."

Thus? Really?! "Thus" is the single most unsexy word I can think of in this situation!

**** I agree, definitely the best done out of the selection. Only issue I have with the Breeding Ground is that the author does too many crossovers with other books/movies/comics. My dirty mind is mentally begging the author for some rare pairings I've always liked. Then again, the crossovers are always well done so I can't complain that much.
