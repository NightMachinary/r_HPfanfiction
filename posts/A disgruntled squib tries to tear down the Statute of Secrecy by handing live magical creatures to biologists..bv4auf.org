******** I thought they raped the soulless husks of their victims to reproduce. Unfortunately, the demeanor baby takes a full eight days to birth, so unless there's a human around to give the body water, it will die while carrying a signal offspring. The baby dementor needs that death to be born tho', so saving the body is a non-option.

Besides, nobody knows how to kill a dementor yet, (and I assure you, the Unspeakables have been trying) so why would you want to make MORE?

***** That's actually debatable. A squib famously describes a dementor to the Wizengamot in OotP, but Arabella Figgs' description was rather vague, and it's very debatable as to whether or not she actually saw them, or merely knew that a sudden chill in the air, sufficient to frost windows, combined with depression symptoms, meant that a dementor was nearby.

"So, when you say, 'There's no funding for this.' what I hear is, 'You're talking to the wrong guy.' Fair enough, I didn't know how these things worked. Now, give me a name, and a general location, for these people who can fund your research, and I will shove this jar of fucking fairies in their faces, and I will get you some goddamn money."

** John the oblivator sighed as he pocketed his wand, he had know why idea why saint mungos kept letting the clearly mentally unwell patient back on the streets every week . they would drag the squib who was training to bring down magical society by handing magical creatues to muggle unspeakable and every week an oblivator most often John, would have to go around and clean up the mess.

Then every week saint mungo's would say we can not hold this person due to ethical reasons, when they where clearly mentally unwell it was the only reason they had no been shipped off to azakban.

It was not hard work to do, it was just the same work over and over the person always went to the same people and wrote the same letters one time a co worker of Johns had managed to catch the person before they had entered the office of the muggle unspeakable.

there was a part of John that was worried if constantly oblivating the same people could have some long term effects, John was a Proud pureblood but having a bunch muggles being hurt because of a crazy squib did not sit right with him. perhaps families like the Malfoys had the right idea, use there power and connections to have there infant squib children adopted by wealthy muggle families. perhaps it was better for the kids rather then grow up in a world of magic while being able to controll and use that magic.

Back to work John goes, and he wonders if he annoyed someone at the ministry for this was the 30th week in a row he was assigned to this Job and he was starting to think it would be a good idea to oblivate himself before he reductoed his own brain out of boredom

*** They wouldn't necessarily need to actively try to live like wizards to know where to find flobberworms, fairies, bowtruckles, etc. I imagine that wizarding hikes and picnics in wizarding parks might include the wizarding parents pointing out to their children what sorts of magical creatures live in the general vicinity. It is my understanding that squibhood isn't caught until around 7, 8 years of age, and for some children, not until they fail to receive a Hogwarts letter. Our hypothetical disgruntled squib might be drawing on fond memories of childhood to remember where some harmless and obviously magical creatures might be found.

Good thought about a squib becoming a biologist themselves.
