I've not read a good femHarry fic in a long time. Time to change that. Please and thank you

Bonus points for:

- Snape and Lockhart *not* acting like pedophiles.

- Femslash

- Nicolas Flamel having actual screen time (this one is less important, but I like to include it in all my requests.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** My two favorite fem!Harry fics are linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense; The Never-ending Road) and their sequels.

The first point is met; romance is not at all the focus of the stories and Snape and Lockhart are very in character.

Femslash is heavily implied in the Never-ending Road.

*** So, honest opinion time, I've never read a snarry I liked. Whether it's slash or fem!Harry the combined facts that Snape was obsessed with Harry's parents and Snape's utter loathing of Harry in cannon means that I have a really hard time pairing them in my head.

That being said, I've read some decent snamione, so it can't be impossible. Does this fic handle it well?

Also, I love pureblood pretense. One of my favorites.

**** To be honest, The Never-ending Road is basically a gen fic. The plot of this fic loosely follows canon with more events and interactions between secondary characters, such as Narcissa, Sirius, and Lupin.

Romance regarding the stated future pairing is pretty nonexistent. Only in the ending chapters of this fic does Harriet realize that she has a crush on Snape. Snape is aware of this but definitely doesn't see her as anything more than Lily's daughter. In the sequel, there is an undercurrent of romantic tension and thus far has handled well.

Based on the author's notes, she wanted a realistic Snarriet so she started early to show how Snape's feelings about her slowly change and evolve. The first year is assumed to be very similar to canon, but starting from the second year he unexpectedly has a role of looking after her.

Currently in the story, Harriet has a crush on Snape and it's presented as a typical crushing on a professor type of thing. There is no way this is pedophilia, especially since its one-sided in this manner.

**** Yeah, I won't deny it's a bit angstfest which will be a turn off for people. I kinda powered through it just to see where it would go. I'm not much a writer so I never really noticed the dialogue issue you mentioned. For me, if it's not horrendous grammar or filled with constant glaring spelling issues, I really don't notice it. I'm pretty ambivalent about the new spells. The author is crafting their AU so I kinda just fold it under the AU folder in my head and move on. It doesn't seem a problem to me, but I won't begrudge you for your opinions.

Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.
