I was reading a fic and he had recommended a story in the final chapter just 3 or so weeks ago. When did she disappear? Anyone know why? Anyone have saved copies of her stuff?


** Is that the author who wrote Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror? Cause I remember that author changed their name sometime last year. If so, that's a real shame. That was one of the best stories I had ever read.

** Some of it can be found on fictionhunt. I know for sure that HP and the Halfblood Auror ([[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7746111/1]]) is on there and i believe Rebel and The Chosen is as well.

I'm not sure about the shorter ones. I tried looking for 'What everyone missed' because i wanted to reread it but couldn't find it...

*** I read that one for the first time just days before the account went. I guess we just have to be glad we had the chance to read it at all.
