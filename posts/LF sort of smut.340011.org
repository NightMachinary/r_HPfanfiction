Well I am looking for really good full length fics that have good smut. Everywhere I look I just find short smut stories with no real reason, but to have it. Now I know that is what smut generally is, but I want a good full length fic with some good sex scenes. I give Harry Potter and the sword of gryffindor as an example. I am looking for non-slash fics if all possible.


** Mostly when i get in the mood [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][hpfanfictionarchive]] has plenty, and the reason it's much better than other site is that you can seach for the specific thing /you/ wan't at that moment easily, fx; Under Age, Harry/Bellatrix, Incest. In general for fanfictions i would advice:

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1202][In another life]] Word count: 420,456 Read: 291,712 is an very AU Humor/Sex/MagicExploration fic where Harry and Hermione (who's become a Genie for some reason) travel across dimentions, muking about althewhile. They pick up several strays, mostly be haveing sex with them, also i remember something about a few crossovers with other series, but they aren't very dominant. It's ongoing and is updateing so much and all the time that is nearly impossible to catch up.

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=710][The Rise of Overlord Vulcan]] Word count: 241,720 Read: 585,909\\
"Read Harry's journey through his first few years at Hogwarts, and how it made him start his quest to become the new most feared Dark Lord ever known: Dark Lord Vulcan. Dark/Evil/Harry/Harem. Not for children - DO NOT READ IF UNDER EIGHTEEN!." Warning; Animagus beatiality. Should be noted that there exist a watered down not so grafical version on ff.net. Infrequent updateing, so sorta ongoing.

I haven't read [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=753][Love Has No Age]] Word count: 752,711 Read: 703,389 But I've head it is very good. Main focus is between Gabrielle and Harry, with some Harem in somewhere. Abandoned i think (maybe the auther just forgot ticking the complete boxs on), but still manedge to get more reads than the population of my nations capital just on /this/ website, also exist in FicWard.

Finally my favirote [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=457][Lucky Harry]] the uncencored version. I've read it twice. It can best be described as CrackHumor/Super!Harry/HappyEnding with some major bashing all guys other that Harry. Plenty sex, niche fetishes and overpowerdness to such a decree it's comical. Also not too long /and/ complete, Word count: 86,266 Read: 680,835.

Your welcome xD

*** I preferred [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=740][Emerald Flight Book One: Union]] to In Another Life. I didn't really care for the sequels in the Emerald Flight Series, but I really liked the first book. It's a Harry/Kara Zor-El(Supergirl) pairing and it was pretty fun to read them tackling all the challenges thrown their way together. I don't mind harem fics, but it's hard to make the relationships meaningful when you have a lot of people competing for screen time. That's pretty much why I liked the first book of the Emerald Flight series. It was just Kara and Harry and Megamatt had a lot of time to develop their relationship and Kara as a character and partner to Harry.

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=689][Harry Potter and the Curse's Cure]] is a classic. It's pretty well written and spends time developing the characters so it actually shows the growing relationship between Harry, Hermione, Susan, and Daphne.

Lucky Harry I liked. I can't figure out specifically why I liked it, but I liked it. It sometimes got a bit too focused on Harry smiting people in the groin, but it was otherwise a rather fun read.

I tried Love has No Age, but I couldn't get very far. I just didn't understand the characters. Like in the 3rd or 4th chapter, Dumbledore admits that he placed Harry with the Dursleys so Harry would feel no love and Remus and McGonagall have no real reaction to it. They just kind of accept that Harry's power of love needed to be controlled by throwing him into a loveless home to grow up in. It didn't make sense to me all and it was really frustrating to try to work through because a lot of the times the actions of the characters just don't make sense. It's baffling because the actual writing is pretty good, but I just can't wrap my head around the actions or motivations of the characters.

**** I had the same problem with Love has No Age both times i started trying to read it. I /know/ from others that it's good, and as you said it's written well. But i can tell you, the feeling of /what?/ doesn't go away by the 8th chaptor.

***** When Harry /isn't/ acting like a hypersensitive tool, there's some fun erotic scenes and the whole thing has a plotline that comes to a fitting (if slightly rushed) solution. I make the rec more on the quality of writing and sex scenes than keeping anyone in-character.

**** Strange thing- the summary initially drew in a lot of Harry/Hermione interest, but the story starts with Ron and Hermione close to coupling. Harmonians can be a twitchy lot. As evidence just stop by Portkey.org, where Ron/Hermione is considered as heretical as Harry/Umbridge.

Try any of the other stories by the same author. I'm not all that fond of Harry/Luna, but this author makes the pairing work better than most.

**** It is a good pairing in theory, but the execution is almost always terrible. Writing Luna is /hard/, and writing her in a romantic relationship is next to impossible. Kinda the reason why I tend to leave the pairing alone -- too many authors butcher her character by making her a sexual deviant or something equally ridiculous.

** First let me say thank you to all for responding. I am relieved to know that other people do in fact read these types of fics. I just can never seem to find ones that are not pure smut. I mean it just seems that dollar store trashy novels set up a better reason for couplings than most smut fics do. That was the reason for the search in the first place. I will be looking at all of the links then say what I thought.

** Heyo, this is a bit late but I thought you might like this one.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen]]

It's Harry/Luna. Fantastically written, with over 300k works.

Just let me give you a warning before you start. The relationships in this fic are categorically unhealthy. There are mentions of sexual assault and rape (some of them quite graphic) and there are some "rapish" vibes early on. Like I said, in the real world you would definitely describe the relationship as unhealthy.

That said, it's some fantastic fantasy BDSM smut, with an actual engaging relationship, all wrapped up in some quality writing. I really enjoyed the hell out of it, and have actually read it at least four or five times now.
