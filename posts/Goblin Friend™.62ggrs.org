Where the ever-blooming /heck/ did this trope come from? It's featured in most fic of dubious quality and it's such a specific concept (one goblin can speak for their entire people and be like "ok u r now Goblin Friend™ congrat") that somehow, most blossoming fanfic authors feel the need to include it.


** I read a fic where goblin friend was a title gobilns gave muggle raised wizard who clearly had no idea about the wizarding world. Of course that means they got charged a lot more than average and told that the pay a lot less and should tell nobody about it

** Probably because Tolkien did "Elf Friend" for LotR that indicated someone who had a close kinship with the various nations of elves and was considered by the elves to be a paragon of their people and a good ambassador. It was a lot more complicated than that, basically you had to do something pretty badass to become an elf friend (Like oh, I don't know, DESTROYING THE ONE RING) and it was more of a title of kinship than any power granting role.

Sadly, the kiddies just watched the movies and thought it was a cool title, and since goblins are totally misunderstood, a goblin friend could be someone who is chummy with the goblins and someone who the goblins will help protect (despite the fact that said "goblin friend" never does anything badass for the goblins). It's a stupid cliche. I can see the goblins being powerful allies if you did the right things for them, but you have to DO things for them first. Other wise they are liable to stab you in the back.

*** Which kind of devalues the title itself, I will say. In Tolkien's story, only three of the protagonists' parties' characters from Hobbit and/or Lord of the Rings had that title, two of them for their deeds towards pretty much everyone (Frodo and Bilbo) which pretty much means that the titled could as well have been “The Hero of Middle Earth”, and one because he went back-to-back to hell and back with one of the elves (Gimli) and did it not for any gain but for the person themselves. In the case of the last one there is also the additional bit about dwarves fighting for each other because they are all dwarves, all family, all one, and thus Gimli treating Legolas the same can and probably should be seen as something very darn important.

People shouldn't copy-cat things from other lores without any knowledge whatsoever of those lores. The friendship of Gimli and Legolas was beautiful to the point where I cried, and the “goblin friend” thing is just sad nonsense.

**** Gimli basically single handedly renewed the kinship between elves and dwarves through his various actions, such as his chivalry towards Galadriel and his brotherhood with Legolas. That's pretty damn badass considering it was a centuries or millennia old grudge that was mended. As for Bilbo and Frodo, Savior of Middle Earth is a pretty good summary of what they accomplished. In both cases, the title of elf friend denoted someone who had done a truly valuable act for the elves and demonstrated that they were worthy of trust and respect.

An edgy teen managing to be polite and observe a few traditions does not come close. Maybe if Harry somehow negotiated wand rights, saved the lives and livelihoods of goblins by preventing a disaster at Gringotts, restored some ancient goblin heirloom, or mended the friendship between wizards and goblins. Those are the sort of deeds that would deserve a title similar to "elf friend."

*** Whoa, thanks! This sounds more credible than my assumption. Tolkien's lore is unparalleled, and young authors probably want to channel that broad worldbuilding aspect. They don't really put in the work towards it, though, so their lacklustre attempt at communicating goblin culture just make their story incomplete and their plots contrived.

I honestly thought the trope came from some specific pre-HPB edge fic. I am not disappointed to be proven wrong.

Instead, they should strive to reach their own full potential. It might take some emulation as a diving board of sorts to find your niche, but limiting yourself to someone else's success cheapens your own achievement.

** I have no goddamn idea, and this trope nearly always makes me turn off what I'm reading, because it's fucking ridiculous. Leaving aside the fact that Rowling never went into the structure of Goblin society or whatever, the only even mildly fleshed-out representation of a Goblin in canon is Griphook, and he's a twat.

The whole idea that the protagonist (usually an either eleven-year-old or fifteen-year-old Harry) on the way to getting his independence from a certain lemon-drop addicted 'meddling old coot' can ingratiate himself with an entire fucking species by being sort-of-polite is so stupid I can't even see the thought process behind it.

I /despise/ this trope, and much prefer stories that make Goblins total bastards (if they /have/ to include them at all) because then they can have an interesting interaction with the protagonist, rather than being downgraded to some magical blood-testing, horcrux-removing, old-coot-defeating, seriously-misunderstood gang of helpers for Harry's fucking shopping list to independence.

*** You feel /very/ strongly about this! Thank you for the laugh. I find it hilarious how far writers are willing to bend ass backwards to elevate Harry in the most unrealistic ways... well, relatively unrealistic. It's not at all creative and invalidates any of Harry's success since all he does in most fics of this nature is /remember Griphook's name/. I'm sure he's not the first to acknowledge goblins, unless there's some lowkey mass compulsion enacted Many Moons Ago by some enterprising, war-weary wizard who decided that any fraternization between goblins and humans should be short to avoid impolitic exacerbation of a small matter, like the ownership of a sword or something equally silly.

Every non-goblin sentient being is /persona non grata/ in Gringotts. Goblin Friend™ is the non-goblin sentient being who doesn't heed the warning at the door, named thus because they so kindly extend their necks for goblin sword practice. Headcanon cemented.

***** It may be a bit too kind to assume Rowling does worldbuilding so well, but actually good worlds do not have whats called a "monoculture". Monocultures are when some species with the necessary brainpower to form cultures, acts exactly the same around the globe for some reason.

Giants have the brainpower to form a culture. They have enough of it to be bargained with, after all. So its likely that american giants have differences in their culture compared with european giants.

Given what we see in FB, those differences are massive. It seems that giants in America are civil and harmless when not provoked - maybe they're even well educated.

** I don't get why folks dislike it so much. Its a "different take" on Goblins and isn't that what Fan Fiction is? Changing and exploring the universe of a story or tale? If you don't like it that's cool, don't read it.

Now... that little rant out of the way....

I always assumed the idea of Goblin Friend.... might of come from a combination of 3 things:

1. Flitwick is part Goblin, which implies that Wizards/Witches CAN be friends, if not lovers, with Goblins.

2. Harry (and friends) treat Dobby (and other house elves) different and much better than 99% of the wizarding world it seems. So why wouldn't they take similar attitudes towards Goblins?

3. Goblins value gold and hate that Wizards look down on them. Would it be a surprise that someone who is rich, can make them richer, and treats them as equals (aka HP) might.. just might... have a higher status within their culture (maybe even friend?).

Throw in the idea that it would be neat for Harry to somehow be aligned with the Goblin side of the wizarding world over actual wizards and it makes things... interesting. Plus it allows exploration of the Goblin world which is limited in canon. Plus it gives Harry a power play position or fall back support structure if needed. And it provides easy transition into various other tropes, and directions with regards to financial, political, or military power.

I was ALSO going to bring up Tolkien lore but someone else beat me to it.... poo.

They're conniving, but don't get me wrong - I don't think it's necessarily without reason. Just look at the way they're regarded by wizarding society. The fountain in the ministry atrium demonstrates the popular view towards magical creatures pretty succinctly. The tensions between wizard and goblin span centuries. There's prejudice aplenty on both sides. A single culturally ignorant muggleborn witch or wizard isn't going to endear goblins to them with shallow niceties.

That's what most of these fics feature, in my experience. People just use the goblins as a catch-all tool to make Harry look more accepting of those different from him and reveal to him through blood magic seventeen and a half dormant seats on the Wizengamot to be made active once he wears his magically invisible heir ring that, when worn, strips him of any and all compulsions and provides master-level occlumency barriers. Oh, and they use them to help throw a middle finger to The Man.

*** If you actually expand on Goblin culture, to a degree where we can follow the thought process of Harry becoming their friend, I'm not against it. Hell, if your worldbuilding is up to snuff, I'm all for it.

But most authors use them as Deus-Ex-Machinas Deluxe and once Harry utters the words "May your gold flow freely yadda yadda blablabla..." they suddenly fall head over heels to grant him every wish. And its no longer a "Different Take". It hasn't been for a good decade now. Its a very old trope that hasn't aged well.

Plus, the boni Harry gets from being their friend make little sense most of the time. Its product of some heavy mental gymnastics that Goblins would oversee the succession of Houses (if they're even included). If that exists its one of the core principles of wizardkind in Britain. They wouldn't give that to a species they have a long history of bloody wars with. Some fics make the Goblins out to be some sort of office for the Ministry, dealing with stuff like marriage and guardianships. My suspension of disbelief can really only do so much...

Also:

1. Rape is a thing

2. They would, but that in and of itself does nothing.

3. Why wouldn't they just treat him as a good customer? A customer that looses his value once he looses his gold.

I'm not saying don't do it, I'm just saying that to make something original and interesting, the trope has to be averted at all cost.
