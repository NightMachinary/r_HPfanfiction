Any fanfiction on ff.net with heavy Snape bashing.

Like yes he is complex but Snape is one of my least favourite characters and I hated how he was glorified in canon. Did Harry have a fucking accident after the war and thought it was suitable to call his child Albus Severus Potter. If I was Albus I'd get my middle name changed to something better, like maybe Remus.

Anyway, I just want a fic where he gets what he deserves like dementors kiss or azkaban for life.


** oh cry me a river please He wasn't perfect but he did a whole lot of good for the characters you all love so much by working as a “double agent” and protecting Harry and yes maybe he was a bit of an ass to him but Harry was kind of an ass too sometimes as well as the other characters because that's just life. snape was bullied and assaulted by James whilst also loosing the woman he loved to , guess who, the man who bullied and assaulted him. He didn't treat lily the best all of the time but what happened must have crushed him and it's unfair to get angry at him for being cold to Harry because he was the person that lily gave his life to save and without harry there is a chance she would still be alive. He wasn't an amazing, “god send” characters like people think Harry is but he doesn't deserve to get a dementors kiss lmfao

*** “He was a bit of an ass” “Harry was kind of an ass too” stop thanks. You make Snape fans look bad by saying that an adult in a position of power acting out is the SAME AS A CHILD who is acting like a. Child. Im sure you'll also tell me Umbridge wasn't perfect and Harry was kind of an ass to her too. She was just doing her ministry approved job, after all.

Snape murdered people. Snape discriminated against muggleborn and joined the Death Eaters. Snape created spells that we're capable of maiming and killing others. Snape “didn't treat lily the best” by hanging out with future terrorists who called her kind MUDBLOOD and “loosing” her didn't change him when she stopped being his friend. His actions had to directly lead to her murder for him to drop his Death Eater loyalty. And he never took responsibility for taking away Harry from his mother. His only redeeming act to Harry was at his literal death bed, washing away his entire history. Thank you, good night.

No matter how Harry behaved, he was still a child in constant danger. An orphan. A child celebrity. An outcast. I can't blame him for being an “ass”.

**** First off I called snape an ass for being horrible ro harry, not for the murdering he did. Secondly, i know that his actions did get lily killed but it was indirectly because Voldemort did agree to not kill her but she died for Harry anyway. And last I meant by not treating lily the best when they first joined hogwarts, not later in life. I don't agree with his discrimination and joining the death eaters but I have to say he was also in constant danger of Voldemort finding out that he was working for dumbledore. Harry did have a lot of pressure on him and he was in danger all the time but honestly it still pissed me off when he acted like everything was about him just because he was “the chosen one”.

***** Snape made bad life decisions and took on dangerous roles for his own purposes. His spy role? Isn't anyone's fault. And it isn't Harry's responsibility, because like I said, this wasn't for him.

And again with the Harry arguments? He was abused. Had like. A small handful of close friends. Was repeatedly taking on jobs well past his age because of Dumbledore's machinations and the unwillingness of the staff to protect the student body. McG in book one. Basically most of staff in book two. Like. Again, I really don't blame him for being self centered at times. With the amount of witches and wizards digging their heads into the sand like fifth year, yeah, I'd probably lean into the Chosen One thing too.

Give me a single year in which Harry received meaningful support from the student body or an adult teacher not brushing off obvious problems?

** Glorified? Are you serious? 8 out of 10 potter fans hate the guy

And all he did was sacrifice his life for Harry.

But hate because he was mean to Neville and insulted hermoine lol.

** ....this is sick.

Try reading the books, they do him plenty fricking dirty. He wasn't glorified.

If that's not enough, write your own fanfiction.

*** Snape: “bravest man I ever knew” ;;; “Albus Severus”

He's more glorified when the biggest target of his harassments is naming his children after him right after naming his other kids after dead parents and uncle figures.

In order for a morally gray and flawed man to be properly respected, you don't pedestal him for doing the bare minimum of Decent Human Being. I love Snape redemption, but canon Snape is NOT his movie self. And that's okay. Snape doesn't want your defense of him anyways.

*** Downvoted.

While I disagree with OP's view on Snape (and I personally like reading Snape-centric fics where he makes things better for himself, be it Severitus, Marauder-era Snily or something else), this is a request thread, not a discussion one. Replies to a request thread with "your opinion sucks"/"write it yourself"/etc are the kind of posts that drives people away from a community.

***** I have one fic in mind but I've had some trouble finding it earlier. Currently trying to look for it again but I haven't read the fic since I more or less just started reading HP fanfics.

The fic is Harry entering an AU where Neville is the BWL, James is dead due to "mysterious" circumstances and Snape turns out to have been doing some really nasty stuff with potions.

EDIT: ...and failed. If someone is able to find it again, let me know. While the fic made me sick and I'll probably never read it again, it's a good fit for requests like this.

Spoilers: Harry, in around 3-4th year, travels to an AU where Snape has done more or less a hostile takeover of his family. He murdered James (with nobody's knowledge) using potions that killed him slowly and painfully around 1983ish (he's not a sadist, the slow and painful bit was more to make it impossible to trace back to him, but he was very much a coldblooded pragmatist) and snatched up Lily in the aftermath (which he planned to do all along), but he never managed to develop a relationship with the AU's Harry. Worse, AU!Harry is coming onto him so he arranges to dispose of him the same way he did James. AU!Harry is sick at St. Mungos, and this is where canon Harry comes in and solves the mystery. Ultimately, Snape is caught for his misdeeds.

*** I know but in the ending it's like Harry loves and calls him the bravest man like wtf Snape was a coward

Bullying a child just because you loved his mother and she died because of him if that's not being a coward I don't know what is

**** No he really wasn't a coward.

He literally had to play double for dumbledore. Realize that he died around 50 or so years old and he hasn't been an actual death eater since he was about 20. Where he realized he f**cked up real bad, came to dumbledore for help. And dumbledore made him do his dirty work, spy for the order, pretend he was a death eater, let everyone, and I mean EVERYONE think he was the worst person to ever walk to earth. When he was probably the bravest. Just because he's a jerk doesn't mean he's not brave.

And also remember this is a story told from Harry's point of view. Who hated snape for most of the books. Before he found out the truth, which is why he named his son for him.

***** He died at around 37 I think

Also Snape was a sh*t spy like I can't believe Voldemort never called him out for that. Imagine Voldemort is Hitler and he sends a spy into Jewish camps imagine how he'd react when he finds out the spy was tormenting the Jews. Yes I know Snape wasn't an actual spy but he had to play the part for Voldemort. If I was Voldemort I would have crucioed Snape hundreds of times since a spy is meant to appear trustworthy

** Well, let me see. I have some old titles if you don't mind a popular title or two.

• linkffn(8914586)

• linkffn(8788731) * chapter 4 specifically

• linkffn(5554780) * it's actually puts negative light on a LOT of characters, but it's enjoyable.

I can't quite think of any more at the moment, but I hope this list has something helpful.
