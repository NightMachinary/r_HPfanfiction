I like fics where Snape eventually realizes Harry isn't what he thought. The ones where he see Harry has his own person and reacts as such. I feel like I read most of them haha, so i figured I narrow it down a bit. I'm in a dark/Gray Harry kind of mood, so any where they are close and Harry isn't the golden boy would be awesome. Character Bashing, bad/manipulative Dumbledore, sane Voldy, or sane but not good (haha) voldy all work for me. I'm not a fan of the golden trio, to over done.

I'm in a Tom/Harry kinda of mood so if you know any fics with them as the pairing that would awesome. Even Draco/Harry is ok, as long as its /dark/Gray Harry and Mentor Snape./
