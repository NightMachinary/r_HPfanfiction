So often most fics have wand magic as the end all be all in magic.

Are there any fics where someone else teaches Harry magic years before he learns about Hogwarts? Real magic that doesn't require a wand, either from within or evocation from an outside source?

There are so many types of magic in the world with more power and versatility... and you're not left defenseless if someone disarms you.


** I can't remember what fic it is, but I read a fic that started with Harry surviving the killing curse a second time, living with some other people, going to Hogsmeade before first year, and muggles teaching him how to do magic before he learns of wands.

IIRC, he couldn't use a wand for a long time because of the way he learned to do magic.

Hopefully someone recognizes those details.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13510736/1/Spells-in-Silence][/Spells in Silence/]] has a young Fem!Harry run away from home at a young age and bumble her way through wandless magic, mostly because no one told her she couldn't after figuring out what accidental magic was.

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft

** I remember reading once something where Herpo the Foul was a blind beggar that relied on his pet snake to guide him. He meets pre-Hogwarts Harry and makes him his apprentice after Harry performs some accidental magic to escape Dudley and his gang. If someone remembers it, please post the name. Thanks!

With that being said, I can't help myself, but wand magic is real magic in the HP universe.

*** Wand magic is just stage one, why else would there be wandless magic and have everyone constantly say how powerful and difficult it is.

That means they know there are other kinds of magic

**** Wandless magic is a thing in HP universe and it's difficult alright but also not as powerful according to the Pottermore entries on Ollivander, therefore inefficient.

******* Why limit yourself? To do so negates the imagination. There are multiple types of magic in fiction and any magic where you need a focus, like a wand, is seen as weak.

Plus I never limited my question to just HP alone, crossover fanfiction is appreciated as well.

******** I see. I suppose I just got to stuck on the "real magic" part. Nevertheless, I will not disagree that a wizard casting wandless magic at the same level as an average wizard does using a wand is a testament of their skill. But then their powers would increase several times if they used an innovation in their world. It's just like the equivalent of getting your information from newspapers or sending letters in our world, instead of using the internet.
