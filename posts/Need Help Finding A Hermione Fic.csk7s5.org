:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically Hermione Slips And Falls While Pregnant And Miscarries Then Runs Away And Hides Because She Thinks She “Murdered” Their Baby And Harry Finds And Convinces Her To Come Back, And They Hold A Seance And Their Daughter's Spirit Convinces Hermione That It's Not Her Fault And Tells Hermione She Doesn't Blame Her. Please Help!


** I remember this story except there is no seance. The bulk of it is Hermione running frantically from Aurors and Harry trying to reach her to get her to come home. The miscarriage is revealed at the end as the motive for her flight.

** I believe this fic is literally titled "Run" though there are quite a few with that title so you'll have to do some searching. I looked but there are a ton out there with this in the title.
