I just read the one story that rekindled my interest in HP (and got me on the HMS Harmonyüòâ)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin)

and it got me thinking. (Yeah I know, dangerous üòÅüòú) now that the original challenge got into its years his about a "new" one:

Hermione dies at any point after the fourth year. Meets her Reaper and s/he is not happy. During a rant from this Reaper she learns about too many (at least 3) deaths of her, potential losing his/her job joining her soulmate (...that Potter brat...).

Hermione got send back to at least one year before her death and at any point before the start of their fourth year.

She have to keep Harry alive but that's easier said then done because he keeps dieing too.

Telling him about the Reaper is optional. Also optional is the inclusion of a second soulmate for a true polyamourie triangle (I think Luna and she */knows/* because Luna üòâ).

Ps: what r ur favourite stories of the original challenge? Mine is the linkffn(Harry Potter and Afterlife Inc by denuelos)


** Soul-mates are an intriguing concept at the first glance, but it leads to all kinds of questionable situations regarding consent and free will if you think about it some more. Especially if some diety tells you that there is a script and you will be repeating your life until you get it "right". And the other person has even less say in the whole mess.

IMO the only way to do time travel without too many questionable situations is the accidental kind, preferably into a parallel universe so you don't have to worry about loops or paradoxes like ceasing to exist because you altered something, making your trip into the past impossible. And no romance between the traveller and his former peers, at least while they are teenagers. Harry/Lily in the 70s is way less questionable IMO than Harry/any Hogwarts girl set during the books.

Why? Lily in the 70s and the 90s girls would be the same age, Harry would have the same mental age difference and he would have the same uneven acquaintanceship advantage in both cases. The only difference is that with Lily Harry is hiding a first degree blood relation, making the relationship much more questionable.

**** The Reptillia challenge usually takes Harry aged around 17-18 and drops him back into the start of either year 1 or 3 or 4 with the goal of getting together with the girl. The first four years of Hogwarts would definitely be questionable. And even if they are older, it is basically a diety forcing them to get together, which is dubious content at best. Although the questionable bit there are not the actions of the time traveller but rather of whoever made that "plan".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Who says anything about hiding that fact. Lily has no emotional connection to Harry and the only memories Harry has of her are due to dementors. As long as they adopt rather than have children on their own, it would not really be questionable since they have no memories and no regular mother/child relationship.

This is the same for Lily, unless by Lily in the 70s you just meant post Hogwarts Lily.

But they're well aware of who they are in relation to each other. I guess it might not /really/ click for Lily, but Harry has no excuse IMO.

Again, unless by 70s Lily you mean just post Hogwarts Lily (which makes it an apples to oranges comparison really), the situation is the same aside from the incest angle. Even if you don't mind that, you can hardly count it as a positive element to make Harry/Lily less questionable than the other scenario. At best they're even.

****** Lily, in the spring of 1977, would be 17 and not yet in a relationship with James. Harry, aged anything between 16 and 18, would be a suitable match age wise.

And two 17 year olds is certainly a better match than a situation which, no matter how noble the intentions, would result in, at the very least, unintentional grooming because Harry has a lot of insight into that person and the events about to transpire and would end up manipulating Hermione or whoever else even without wanting to do so. And that's not even considering deities having shipping wars and the impact that would have on free will and consent.

Harry thrown back a year wouldn't be bad. But that challenge has a vastly larger scope.

*** The thing is I don't equal soulmate with automatically got together aka soulbond. imo a soulmate is someone who's made to be the most compatible person for you, to the very core, your soul. It doesn't mean u have to bond that way just that it's ur best (but not only) shot for lasting happiness. Of course the powers that be want that, because they made u that way, but alas; free will and all that.

And that exactly is the issue with that concept. They are MADE to be a suitable partner. Not they are, but some divine being interfered with free will.

***** Fair enough.

But on the other hand you could argue that our parents/guardians and our environment shaped how we think and feel/ how our soul tic üôÇ and with that we are more compatible with some then with others. Imo it's the same difference and personally I find the the concept of a soulmate, somepne who is exactly right for me out there reassuring.

Btw I remember a story with soulmates in where it said that everyone had more then one and had to have activily /choose/ to be with one. But alas we will probably not agree on that topic. üòÅ And that it ok üòâ
