I love those stories where Harry starts Hogwarts, see's all the shit that is wrong/or noticing /Dumbledore/ is *bad/evil/manipulative* (whatever) and starts making *friends/allies* or building his own *followers* to change things. I normally favor the ones where he works in the background but I don't mind of Dumbledore/Voldemort know whats going on. I love *smart/Independent/Gray* Harry but I don't like the ones where he is ridiculous brilliant and taking shit over at 11/12.

I want slow build stories where he gradually gets there and it seems more reasonable. I like *political Harry* where he eventually gains *Lord* titles and uses his fame and money to make changes. I'm looking for stories like that. *Dark/Gray Harry. Slash. Harry joins Voldemort. Character bashing. Lord* whatever haha. are all thing I love. Thanks :)
