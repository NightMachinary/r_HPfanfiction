:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I found a fic not too long ago, that had Harry using a different spell to the Patronus to defend themself from Dementors. I remember that the spell was like an anti-Patronus, basically making a shield of Dementor-Aura made out of dark/sad memories instead of happy ones to stave away Dementors. If I remember correctly, the spell was made by Voldy when he figured out he couldn't use the Patronus, according to the FicLore.

I can't remember if it was on [[https://Fanfcition.Net][Fanfcition.Net]] or Ao3 (Those are the only fanfic sites I use, so it must be one or the other), but I think it was [[https://Fanfiction.Net][Fanfiction.Net]]. Any help would be greatly appreciate, as me being the idiot I am, forgot to Bookmark/Follow the fic before I went onto another fic, and considering I read 8+ fics a day, it has been buried somewhere in my history.


** Are you sure it was Harry? The Spirit Guard Devoctrix from NoahPhantom's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter series]] is pretty much this.

*** It was most definitely Harry, or FemHarry. I tend to dislike Cursed Child in the extreme and I have never been able to stomach most derivatives of it, fanfics or otherwise.

However, thank you for the recommendation, and I will have a look at it.

** I've never read the fic that you said is correct but I remember reading one where this girl is like the leaders of the muggle born and she cast a dark patronus. (Not that they knew this)

I read it in the past week. Might have been an SI OC who knows. It was memorable but I read over a million words (usually double that) a week.

Edit: found it. linkffn(A Wand for Skitter). It's a crossover but I was able to follow along perfectly despite the fact that I've never heard of worm. It's pretty good. I read it in one go and the length didn't feel dragged on.

Not an SI just a xover.
