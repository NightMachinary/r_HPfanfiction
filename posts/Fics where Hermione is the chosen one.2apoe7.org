** You mean like: "Hermione was the one Voldemort targeted"? Because that one doesn't make any sense.

There are plenty of fics with Hermione as the protagonist of the story, but not a single one that I know of where takes Harry's place.

*** Voldemort killed Hermione's parents, who were wizarding folk, and his killing curse rebounded from her and killed him in turn. Hermione was then adopted by a pair of dentists.

Now it makes sense.

** I don't know about the "chosen one". I suspect hat GirlWhoLived!Hermione would be pretty hard to orchestrate, but here are some where she finds herself as the protagonist in the leadership position:

*** In practically every Harry/Hermione story she ends up being the protagonist so I don't think the OP would have to work too hard to find those stories.

**** Not sure what you mean. Of course she is /a/ protagonist in Harry/Hermione stories, but in most such stories that are not entirely romance --- where the characters actually affect the outside world --- Harry tends to do most of the acting, while Hermione's job is to help him learn spells and occasionally get kindapped and rescued. (I am exaggerating a bit, of course, but not by much.)
