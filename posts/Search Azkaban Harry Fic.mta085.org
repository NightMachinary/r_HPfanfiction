A long time ago, I read a fanfic on FFnet where :

- Harry was put in Azkaban then prove Innocent.
- A lawyer was put at his disposal and an agreement was made with the Ministry.
- Like Financial compensation, new identity and no contact with old friends/family.
- He rebuilds his life in the USA and marries in a rich/powerful family with botanical greenhouses.
- He is the submissive and have carrying boys twins. He had a miscarriage later.
- The Oder find where he is and kidnapp him but it is very quickly found and settled just as quickly.
- The M!American prison system has an agreement with vampires. That save Draco's life.
- The vampires agree to protect Harry and his family but an attack of the Order will set fire to the powder.
- Severus and others will surrender to the vampires but it's too late and the US will invade and end the war.

It was complet around 15 chapters ( I think ).
