** One question was Why did Dumbledore not bring Bill Weasley into the Horcrux "group"? Bill was a cursebreaker, raiding tombs in Egypt, and the Horcrux is dark magic that originated in Egypt. Which means there is a good chance that he has encountered horcruxes before and had ways to find, identify, and remove them. I always wondered why Bill wasn't used in the hunt more.

*** For all we know, Bill was involved. We know that he was a member of the order at the very minimum. Who knows, maybe Dumbeldore discovered the ring only due to Bill.

**** That would be quite a lot of guessing/making things up as the books don't show Bill having much to do with the horcruxes. Don't you think that Dumbledore would mention to Harry that he should talk to Bill instead of Harry on his "own" if Dumbledore had brought Bill into the knowledge of the Horcruxes.

** He'd need to get that memory from Slughorn first, or else nobody would know how many Horcruxes are out there, exactly.

Maybe that could happen early in the year and Dumbeldore gives him permission to leave school early.
