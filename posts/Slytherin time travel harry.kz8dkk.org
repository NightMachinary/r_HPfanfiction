its a time travel harry fic back to hogwarts time, he went to slytherin obviously. the big part I remember is that harry has something strange with the unforgivables. hes immune to the AK and the impero. he feels more pain from the crucio, and he got oblivitate made as a new unforgivable. when its used on him after a certain amount of time he remembers what was oblivated. if anyone knows please let me know. thank you.
