** Lol honestly though, these aren't that far off from J.K. Rowling's writing style. For example, I can always tell if a writer is picturing book Hermione or movie Hermione based on their dialogue tags. In the books, Hermione "squeaks," she "moans" (because she's upset), she says stuff "eagerly," she says stuff "gently," she says stuff "in a voice slightly higher than usual."

Basically, she's way less sure of herself than Emma Watson is.

*** Erm, is she less sure of herself than Watson? She tends to be rather matter-of-fact about things and isn't-this-obvious otherwise. Squeaks happen in surprise and speaking gently tends to be done when she's trying to keep someone (Harry) from getting worked up (not a lot of success there, heh). I dont think those descriptions really relate to self assurance.

**** That's fair. Book Hermione is self-assured in lots of situations, but it's usually when she's explaining something (whether it's something she read or explaining how girls think). But there are lots of times when, in the midst of confrontation, she's pretty meek (obviously there are exceptions to this, but the exceptions are so satisfying for exactly this reason). A good example of Hermione shrinking in the midst of confrontation is in Prisoner of Azkaban, when Snape calls Hermione an insufferable know-it-all. In the movie, it doesn't seem to phase Hermione much, but in the book, she "went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears."

**** Okay. There are some words that are NEVER ACCEPTABLE to say.

The N-word is one of them. Seriously. And yeah, sure, you “wErE aRguInG A pOInt”, but what made you think that was okay???

Not cool. At all. I'm also extremely surprised no one else will call you out on this.

How does the N-word equate to calling someone a bucktooth AT ALL? Your logic is faulty and your use of a *racial slur* is awful. You know what this says? You wanted to use a racial slur, so you did. That is *hate speech*.

We are a worldwide community and the N-word is very offensive. Please take a moment and /think/ next time.

Edit: Also, America is the only place where race still matters, so no one from Europe called me out because there is nothing to call me out on. We don't give a shit about colour of skin, we judge people by their actions, or at the very least the actions of the group they belong to.

I argued a point, which you also unwillingly proved. I used one of many possible insults, but only the American fixation on race and your history with racial issues made that one worse.

****** My family is East German and the refugee crisis is a pretty big deal over there. I want to rip off my ears every time people here say stuff about "black feet" or "oily eyes" or whatever other offensive term they can come up with so yeah unfortunately race is still an issue in Europe. In this case it's clearly exacerbated by the underlying political issues around accepting such a large group of refugees at the same time, but people still make it about race and that bleeds into interactions with others outside of this specific group of people too.

******* But people don't dislike refugees because of their skin colour or race, they are disliked either over their social beliefs (role of women, separation of state and religion), the costs arising from the whole mess or the fear of importing crime and terrorism (which is statistically proven). No one here says "I don't want refugees because they are brown" or "I don't want refugees because they are from Syria". The concept of race was bombed out of us thoroughly and then the Red Army made sure the job was well done.
