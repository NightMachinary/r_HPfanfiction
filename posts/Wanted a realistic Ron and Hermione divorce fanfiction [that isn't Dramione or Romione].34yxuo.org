What it says on the tin. I've been sorting through Ron and Hermione divorce fics, and I haven't yet managed to find one that isn't one of the following:

- Ron and Hermione divorce. Hermione gets together with Draco Malfoy.
- Ron and Hermione divorce or break up, only to get back together.

Any suggestions for a good divorce fic that doesn't have the above? I'm interested in possibly writing my own take on it (one-shot), but I wanted to read others' stories first to get a good idea of how and where to start.


** Try jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]]. Told from Ron's POV with several flashbacks (it's a Michael Shaara /For Love of the Game/ fusion), Ron's and Hermione's separation is not an amicable one. Ron/Padma pairing.

EDIT: It's not the main focus so it might not quite be what you're looking for.

** Pretty sure I've read some good ones - on my phone so excuse the weird links. Both are on fanfiction.net if you want to search

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation]] - Hermione and Ron grow apart after the war

The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]] - Ron and Hermione realise they have very different priorities - she's very serious and motivated, he's the opposite.

How about Harry? There's a rather strange Harry as MOD fic out there somewhere where Hermione and Ron are separated because the wizarding world doesn't have a system for divorce (think GoF style contracts applied to marriage.) Meanwhile, Harry has been hiding from the world pretending to be dead after the last battle, using the hallows to derp around Britain being randomly helpful. Hermione eventually twigs to the fact that he's not dead yet and hunts him down. Relationship ensues. IIRC it's better than my description credits it. It doesn't go into their 'divorce' but touch upon post-separation life for them. As with anything involving magic, YMMV regarding 'realistic'

**** I can't claim it's a great romance fic, but it had some interesting takes on wizard marriages that I never considered.
