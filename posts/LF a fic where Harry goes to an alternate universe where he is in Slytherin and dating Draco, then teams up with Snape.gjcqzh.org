I think that eventually they defeat Voldemort, then Snape goes with Harry back to his original universe. Also, the alternate universe's Harry suicides by turning his wand into a knife. Turns out, it was Dumbledore who sacrifices the alternate universe Harry. That's all I remember, although I think that there is a oneshot in that world.

*** Definitely the one. Good fic that really nails the alienness of the alternate universe. Everything seems so close yet quite off of canon that its vaguely unsettling.
