Are there any fics where Harry's twin is the BWL, and Harry is a Slytherin? The Potter's are alive, (somehow), and they completely forget about harry as a result of maybe a Darker Harry? I know I'm rambling, but stuff like this happens when think about fic tropes for three hours because apparently, sleep ain't important.

Thanks.


** I presume you've already read Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, since that's /the/ WBWL fanfic. In case you haven't though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][here]] is a link or ffn, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][here]] is a link for ao3.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My main recommendation, if you haven't already read it, would be Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos. It is a relatively new story, so you won't have alot of catching up to do. It also gets an update once a week (every Saturday) so you won't have to wait forever between chapters.

Harry is in Slytherin, and his twin brother, Charlus, is hailed as The-Boy-Who-Lived. If I'm being completely honest I don't actually know 100% if this is a WBWL story. I do have some theories, but obviously I'm not going to say anything. James Potter is still alive, but Lily isn't.

The character bashing is very limited. I personally wouldn't even call it character bashing, but I know everyone has different opinions on that. Harry is definitely the stronger of the brothers, but if you're looking for a story where the twin brother is deliberately written as a weak idiot, characters like Dumbledore and James are one-dimensional villains, and Slytherins are the good guys whilst Gryffindors are the bad guys, then don't bother reading this story. Charlus is still competent, Dumbledore and James are human beings who make human mistakes, and all Hogwarts houses: Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff have both good and bad people in them.

Oh yeah, and Voldemort is a woman in this story.

That little afterthought made me literally laugh out loud.

**** I was literally about to click send, and then I was like "oh, this might also be an interesting tidbit." I didn't think it warranted a whole paragraph like the other stuff I was going over. xD

** The Sacrifices series by Lightning on the Wave?

Darker everyone, in this one, I think. Lots of bashing of adults (particularly Dumbledore).

Starts off with Saving Conner. linkffn(2580283)

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
