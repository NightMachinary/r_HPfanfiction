He is my favourite author, and I think the two worlds could mesh quite well.

Lovecraftian: /Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present./

All of Lovecraft's writings are available [[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/][HERE.]]

--------------

So far suggested (have read all of these so far):

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/][Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/][The Eyes]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/][On a Pale Horse]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]


** It's a self-cite, but my short-story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]] may be of interest as a HP/Lovecraft crossover.

First one is ok.

Second one, Elizium, is amazing. The build up of confusion giving way to a dawning realization of horror is perfect.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
