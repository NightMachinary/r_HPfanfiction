** When Hagrid comes to the lighthouse to give Harry the letter in person, Vernon holds his nerve and shoots him and they flee. The fic would be about the spiralling paranoia of the Dursleys on the run with Harry for a couple of weeks more before Harry is finally rescued and told that he's a wizard. Someone might have already done this, though.

In this particular instance, it was Quirrel who lived, and Hagrid who died; Vernon shot him on the island where he first showed up, which meant that he never got a chance to retrieve the philosopher's stone before Quirrel took it.

Goblet of Fire divergence, Goblet selects a Slytherin as Hogwarts champion. Slytherins do not respond well to Voldemort referring to the ambitious, cunning, pure-blooded, Slytherin, Tri-wizard champion as 'the spare'. Harry earns their respect by bringing his body back and escaping the Dark Lord.

The slytherin students are much less inclined to joint the Death Eaters, and the author can then explore Harry fighting Voldemort by uniting all four houses

** I don't know if I'd say I don't have the nerve to write these, but I don't expect that I will any time soon. I'm bone idle and lazy, and I struggle to commit to projects like this.

--------------

*An anthology series* inspired by the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP foundation]] and, to a lesser extent, the works of H. P. Lovecraft. It would exist as a collection of short stories, where each would tell of some sort of supernatural or unusual occurrence that the Department of Mysteries investigates.

There's a lot of room to play around with tropes; one idea I had involved a few Unspeakables inspecting a magically enlarged trunk, whose previous owners all vanished without a trace. Maybe a beast lives inside the trunk, or maybe enlarging trunks and then going inside of them is just a really bad idea. Who knows?

I think the fact that a story like this doesn't really have an end is probably what's keeping me from writing it.

--------------

*A Harry/fem!Harry* story. I could leave it at that and it would be enough--there's a great dearth of this pairing, and it's quite saddening. It's an extremely weird pairing, of course, but there's something compelling about it, I think.

The version I came up with involved Harry coming across a magical fish that also has the ability to travel between dimensions, and this fish would serve as the messenger that would help Harry and fem!Harry communicate until they eventually meet in person.

It's kind of a cute, light-hearted idea, without much lasting appeal, but I would want to write it on the merits of the pairing alone.

--------------

*A dimension travel* that separates itself by crossing the characters into a dimension that is neither an AU, a time travel, or a crossover. I came up with this story during my 'ambient' craze. I used to put on songs like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZAAByuWKWc&t=47s][this]], sit back, and imagine the landscapes. The subreddit [[/r/ImaginaryLandscapes]] and its brethren are also great inspirations for this.

It exists as a worldbuilding exercise. The dimension travel crosses the characters into a world that once housed a mighty, almost utopian kingdom, but which has now been abandoned and retaken by nature, sorta like a Dark Souls game except a bit less bleak.

I have all sorts of worldbuilding ideas for this, such as an in-universe explanation for why magic exists. The people of this kingdom had magic to wield for themselves, but after a calamity struck, they were mostly killed off and forced to leave. The few survivors took their magic with them, and it so happens that they found themselves in the HP world.

The story itself would begin at the end of year five, with the Department of Mysteries infiltration. The characters take a wrong turn, finding themselves in the DoM room that studies magic as one of the 'forces' on which the world runs. Here exists a passage to the dimension.

While I'm attached to this idea for personal reasons, I think it's far too open-ended and 'plotless' to be spun into any functional narrative.

--------------

*A mentor!Dumbledore* fic, packed full of action, that is also a dimension travel in its own right. It involves necromancy, black magic, the undead, and going down into literal Hell.

I've always loved Dumbledore, and I've always loved his relationship with Harry. It's a dream of mine to find a fic that crosses quality action with a Dumbledore in a teaching position for Harry, but which does not devolve into the pointless faux-politics that the fandom is plagued by.

The change can be said to begin when Slytherin is still alive; during his travels and research, he discovers the existence of an 'underworld' of sorts, and toils away in the Chamber of Secrets in an attempt to work out a way to get there.

His work is then passed to Voldemort through the Basilisk himself, who would only reveal Slytherin's knowledge to the true heir. However it is that the 'underworld' is accessed--through a spell or a sacrificial ritual or the Veil or some other geographical location--he manages to get there. Harry and Dumbledore must team up and follow him there, with a possible help from Grindelwald, before Voldemort can release whatever lurks beneath onto the surface.

--------------

I might be forgetting one or two, but that about sums it up. In the hands of a capable writer, I think these could all be great ideas, but I'm fairly confident that I'm not said writer.

** I don't write, but I've had this tickle to see Harry as a Necromancer. Not Dark!Harry like most necromancer fics. I'd really prefer it to avoid the dark/light magic thing and just treat magic as magic and intent determining whether it is bad or good.

So necromancing would just be another job description. Maybe it wouldn't be a "normal" career path for most people, but Harry's experiences with the hallows make him particularly suited for it. People might raise an eyebrow and be uncomfortable talking about the job, sort of like when a friend works in the morgue and you /really/ don't want to know the details of their job.

I've kicked the idea around in my head a bit, but couldn't flesh it out enough to warrant an entire story.

That said, the version I imagined was basically that nothing much changes until Quirrell doesn't find Voldemort in 1990/91 (due to the lack of the latter), and then the ripples of that change the Hogwarts life slowly. Definitely not pre-Hogwarts (except in the earliest stages).

** Here's a few:

- All anyone needs to rule the world is a well-placed Imperius curse commanding the subject to obey without question, and to cast an identical curse on two more people - exponential doubling takes care of the rest. Over the centuries, shields and counterspells have been developed, but the effect is a scary, scary world wherein anyone can betray anyone at a moments notice. Every corner of the magical world is subject to extensive security measures, and every interaction is laced with paranoia. Voldemort disappeared in '81, but everyone knows he has placed countless Imperius-cursed sleeper agents in key positions, waiting for the right moment to strike. You think Joseph McCarthy was bad? Wait until you meet Rufus Scrimgeour, newly promoted Head Auror and hero of the quasi-fascist /free magic, free people/-movement whose meteoric rise within the department was fueled by several Imperius-hunts conveniently removing his superiors...
- Harry Potter spent every possible moment of his childhood on school computers, library computers, and whenever possible Dudley's unused machine. Naturally, it took quite a bit of fiddling with the operating system to gain access without acquiring the password from Dudley, and Harry had to seek out aid from the dark corners of the internet. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry brings with him an enchanted laptop - think IBM Convertible - bought in a seedy store at Diagon Alley and kept hidden from his classmates. Lacking in enthusiasm for the magical subjects he is being taught, Harry relies on the advice - of varying quality, sanity, and legality - of a circle of IRC aficionados to make it through the school years and combat Voldemort. As an optional extra, the story may or may not be told entirely through IRC chatlogs.
- The Philosopher's Stone is left at a school full of mischievous students behind a series of extremely easy traps. The only real difficulty is the mirror, and that is not even used in the beginning of the story. Cormac McLaggen and several friends of his break through the traps to impress the girls, and end up with the actual Philosopher's Stone as a prize. They start small by making enough gold to buy a couple of racing brooms, but things spin out of hand and they flee to the muggle world, leaving a trail of cheap gold in their wake. The economy of magical Britain, being closely tied to a Goblin-enforced gold standard, enters a crisis. A Neo-Death Eater movement is born and gains momentum without any influence from Voldemort at all, blaming muggles and muggleborns for the financial losses of the British wizarding families.

** After 4th year Harry really needs a holiday. He's never had a holiday before, a break from all the pressure. Cedric was murdered in front of him, Voldemort is back and the ministry don't want to believe him. How can he cope with this pressure?

In France the Delacour family want to say thank you to the brave boy who rescued their Gabbi. They invite him to come stay in France and things spiral from there. You can go with Harry/Fleur or Harry/ Gabbi. Harry can transfer to Beauxbatons, Harry can run away from it all or he could see them as the sort of people worth fighting for and go back motivated. If Harry is in France but nobody knows would the Dementors kill/kiss the Dursely's would Fudge blame Harry. International murder trial with Harry Potter being defended by the French government. How would Dumbledore react, would he be overjoyed Harry is learning about love or would he see Harry as trying to escape his destiny.

You can go so many ways with this. Independant Harry, Harry who runs, Harry who learns something different, Harry at another school, Harry trained by the French ministry even. The amount of places you could take this is crazy all based on the idea of Harry Potter needing a holiday and a family wanting to say thank you.

** A twoshot story, starring Dumbledore. Ch 1, it's the Blitz in 1940. Grindelwald uses the confusion to launch an attack on Hogwarts. While the staff shields the school and hold off GG's minions, Dumbledore returns to Camelot (having visited there during his second year), picks up Fawkes, and uses the Phoenix to destroy Grindelwald's attacking force. GG and Albus talk; the gist of it being that Albus blames GG for killing Ariana even though he launched the killing curse. GG is perhaps rightly peeved, as all he did was shield himself from Dumbledore's curse. Albus confesses he still loves GG and would still gladly fight alongside him. GG says he never loved Albus, and apparates away after insulting AD some more (GG was there to get at Charlus Potter's invis cloak, but after his little army got destroyed, he backed off).

Chapter 2 is 1945, German Alps. Dumbledore alone attacks GG's fortress, realizing that his former lover won't surrender peacefully and is in fact creating magical WMDs. AD kills the hundreds of magical and muggle goons in GG's castle. Then, the two face off in a battle of epic proportions. Think the battle of the Ministry, times a thousand. For instance GG summons a tornado, and uses it to suck up and fling back curses. The battle ends when AD's wand snaps, unable to overcome the power of GG's Elder Wand as they cross red-green streams for the final time. GG then crucios AD, and throws him around a bit, then starts torturing him to death. Wandless, AD summons a Nazi pistol to his hand, and shoots GG twice. GG hunches over, AD is released from the spell bind. Dumbledore snatches the Elder Wand from Grindelwald, prepares to use the killing curse and stops only when they legilimize each other; GG wants to die, to be a martyr. So instead AD petrifies him, and waits in silence in the burned out husk of GG's castle for the Aurors.

** I've never written a fanfic before, and there is a good chance I never will, but I had an idea in my head to write a crackfic (which was half parody, half insanity). If I do ever write a fic, it wouldn't be that one, because that one had way too much stuff for my limited writing skills to juggle.

But the one idea from it that I still think would be interesting for someone to write involves a whole bunch of the characters making their own horcuxes. It'd probably have to be some sort of dark humor crackfic, but I'd be especially interested in seeing it played straight.

** What about more inter dimensional fanfics? I think the idea of main characters interacting with and meeting themselves could hold a lot of potential for a strong (if perhaps confusing) plot. I enjoy my romantic pairings from time to time, so there could even be some hilarity from one group meeting another (for example Canon Ron/ Hermione and Harry/Ginny meet an alternate universe Harry//Hermione or some nonsense like that).

I just liked the idea of instead of Horcruxes the reason Harry and Voldemort lived and are destined to fight is because they are highlander!immortals.

**** I believe I checked that story out once and didn't care for it. I can't remember why.

I'm specifically looking for the highlander theme in this instance. I grew up as a fan of Highlander way before Harry Potter showed up.

** linkffn(4343191) After reading this, and seeing that it was unfinished, I decided to try and write one where Harry and Tom Riddle switched places, without the dimensional travel... I got about 3 paragraphs before I decided it wasn't going to happen.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.

** My all time dream fic... If you do do this, I will never be able to thank you enough!!

Snape ends up having to communicate more with Hermione (she becomes an order member in 6th year since her time turner use actually makes her the legal age of 17. Severus is charged with the responsibility to help her train in some combat and occlumency/legilimens). He grows as fond of her as Severus Snape can. A VERY slow build in the relationship. No actual action is taken besides a small touch here and there, like fingertips brushing, glances that last just a second too long or brief hand on a shoulder when something serious happens (much later on and is initiated by Hermione). Maybe find a way were Hermione was the one helping give information as one of her tasks by Dumbledore (when they are moving Harry, where they are for him to deliver the sword of Gryffindor, Snape gives her some information too, ect.). By the end, Snape realizes he doesn't wish to die when he goes to the shrieking shack. He is bitten anyway and Hermione runs in just a couple seconds before Harry and Ron. He looks at Hermione as she cries and drops beside him and cups his face whispering his first name. Severus realizes and admits fully to himself the extent that he cares for her. Harry comes in and drops down beside her and Snape reaches for him to go through the whole memory tears while Hermione is slightly pushed out of the way and gets the bottle out to hand to Harry. The "look at me...." Is actually directed at her. She goes into his mind so she can feels his emotions/thoughts and pushes her emotions for him to feel. He dies knowing and feeling more than the regret he felt for betraying Lily. He feels compassion for someone and the feeling of that being returned, regardless of all he did. He dies feeling forgiveness.

Snape keeps his characteristics; proud but insecure, rude, stubborn, intelligent, and good at controlling emotions from showing (besides the squeeze of a chair or slight twitch in his finger when something very serious happens).I

Hermione keeps hers too; smart, caring, shows control when it comes to trouble and is logical.
