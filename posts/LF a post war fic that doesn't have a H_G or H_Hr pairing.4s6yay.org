  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I'm extremely wary of reading HP/OC, especially HP/OFC, because the OFC is often soul crushingly Mary Sue-ish.

Is Abigail Waters an interesting character? And what of the plot?

**** Definitely not a Mary Sue. Not a self insert either. Abby is a great character and a lot of fun to read. She is a muggle who serves Harry coffee in the shop near where his daughters school is. It is a very compelling read.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
