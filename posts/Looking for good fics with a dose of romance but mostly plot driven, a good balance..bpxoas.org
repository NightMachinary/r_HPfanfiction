I've read just about everything so if you find something I haven't read and it's good I'll probably be pretty surprised, thanks in advance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), has an excellent plot and a great Ron/Hermione romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), has a quite complicated plot with lots of twists and intrigue. I also find the Harry/Bellatrix very convincing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), has some great adventures and a really good Petunia/Sirius romance.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
