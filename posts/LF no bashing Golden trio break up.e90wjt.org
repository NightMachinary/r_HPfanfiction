I have read plenty of fics with a lot of bashing of hermione and/or ron and was wondering if there were any fics where they simply drift apart

it's annoyed me a lot since i started reading fanfics that JK rowling kept the cast so small especially when she had great opportunities to introduce new people in third year or fourth or fifth with the DA

no slash and no fem harry pls


** Interesting idea, I don't know of any fics that have this but it makes for a good prompt. I know lots of people, including myself personally have experienced drifting from school friends. It would be a good fic that could touch on that shared experience and melancholy in a real way.

Perhaps Harry starts taking Quiddich more seriously and spends more free time with the team, drifting away from Hermione who doesn't relate.

Perhaps Hermione only takes Runes and Arithmancy and makes friends with some more studious like minded individuals that get her better.

Lots of reasons people slip away from each other in real life. Lots of options to explore.

*** exactly

this makes way for others to be introduced and possibly allows harry to simply focus of voldemort and surviving

most fics i see where they break up are bashing fics and most of those are so over the top that i cant stand them

**** Agreed. Not only does it provide a chance for new friends, but it gives a chance to explore the feelings of isolation that people feel growing apart from their friends without having the edge required for "all my friends have turned traitor and abandoned me". The idea speaks to me quite a bit. I don't know what kind of fic it would fit in best, but this gave me some rough ideas for a slice(s) of life short story that I will probably never get around to writing.

***** exactly

in canon we barely see any character outside of the main cast until 5th year even than they barely interact with them on screen then theres the fact that its weird that they barely interact with them during class like do professors not assign group projects with pre assigned groups to make sure everybody pulls their weight?

another thing that is annoying is that people barely talk about james and lily (like we assume remus and sirius tell him stories but nothing really about him is known ) or lilys friend's literally the only one we know for sure about during hogwarts is snape james had the mauruders and while they dont have to be that close surely there had to other people she was close to

** Linkffn(11910994)

The Death Eaters manage to get significant pressure on ministry politicians to enact laws that discriminate against muggleborns. Hermione creates a group to fight that. When eventually all the muggleborns get thrown out of Hogwarts completely legally and beyond Dumbledore's control, Hermione's group responds at Malfoy's Summer Ball where all the rich death eater sympathizers meet with a big load of plastic explosives. Harry and Ron stay at Hogwarts and train to fight Voldemort while Hermione's group of freedom fighters / terrorists (depending on who you ask) kill every death eater they can find.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** not exactly what i am looking ron and hermione are still main characters that isnt what i wanted

i wanted fics where they fade away to minor characters without being antagonists like during the tournament hermione while believing him distances herself from the hate and ron being jealous harry figures his own way oast the dragons and when they come to apologize he accepts but doesnt take them back
