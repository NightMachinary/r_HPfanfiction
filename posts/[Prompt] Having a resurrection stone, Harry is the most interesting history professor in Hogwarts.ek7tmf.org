I just want to read fics with Harry as a history professor. Just imagine Harry conversing with the dead famous people and learning about history from the first hands. Imagine Harry creating illusions to show his students what and how everything happened in the magical and muggle world. Imagine all school (including professors) gathering in a huge class just to listen and watch all of this interesting stuff.


** Why teach the classes yourself when you could resurrect the greatest historian of all time:

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** There was a sadly abandoned fic where Harry got wind Voldemort was going to attack the Hogwarts Express and kill everyone not with him. The Order managed to trap the junior Death Eaters in the last car and disconnect it. Harry then used the Elder Wand to turn the rest of the train into a giant portkey, taking them all to Potter Keep which was being repaired into a Hogwarts substitute. Hard up for teachers, I imagined later having Harry use the Ressurection Stone to have the actual Founders be substitute teachers. linkffn(12110842)

  Fleur and Tonks' plans for the future get derailed. Now they are pulled into Harry's hunt for horcruxes. How will things go with an Auror and a trained Curse Breaker along? Rated M for language, mild violence, and sexual situations.
