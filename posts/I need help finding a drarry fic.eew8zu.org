:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it takes place during 6th year canon divergent. Draco kidnaps Harry while Voldemort is living in the manor, and cave's under the pressure the dark Lord puts on him to kill Harry. Draco eventually helps Harry escape and spend the next week or so running/camping through the country side trying to get back to Hogwarts. I think Harry had a time-sensitive illness as well.

#+begin_quote
  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.
