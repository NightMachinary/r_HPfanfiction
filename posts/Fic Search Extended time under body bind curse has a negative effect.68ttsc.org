I remember reading an HP fic in which there were negative effects to being under a body bind for an extended period of time (as Neville was at the end of first year in canon, and someone else in fic later), but I don't know either what the fic was, or even whether the effects were mental and/or physical.

While rereading the sections in question would be best (thus I'd need to know what fic this was) even an answer re what the consequences were would be greatly appreciated. Any chance someone recognizes this and can answer either part of the question, or maybe remember some details about it that would help in tracking it down. The following comments might or might not be true - while the first year incident was referenced, I think the fic was set in fourth or fifth and not part of a fic/series that retold everything; I thing it was at least of medium if not long length; I think either Harry or Hermione (or both) had a conversation about how it felt to be under it with Neville, that included apologies, after one of them had been under it for a while for some reason; I have no idea re major characters, storyline or which side any of the trio supported.

Any chance someone can help? I think I read this abouts a year ago +/- 6 months but I have no idea whether it was new at the time or quite old. While I read mostly, but not exclusively, on Ao3 and ff.net, I have also saved versions of many fics to my computer for years - many of which I haven't read yet - so it could even be something that is no longer available on line.


** I don't know that story but I thought I might still offer some help. If you use calibre to organise your downloaded collection and the one you are looking for may be among them I could send you a copy of my full text search plugin to help you sift through the mass of fics and hopefully find it.

*** Thanks for the offer, but no my fics are not in calibre for the most part. And many are never downloaded at all.

**** Oh well, I might have offered to make it ignore the folder structure (less efficient but it does not /need/ calibre to work) but in that case it would probably still not help a lot :/ Good luck finding it anyway.

** Don't know the fic but prolonged (nonmagical) immobilization can lead to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and kidney failure. Maybe they used the term?

*** Thanks for the info, but no. This was only a matter of hours so not long enough for that, I don't think.
