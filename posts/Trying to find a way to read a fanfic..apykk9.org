I'm trying to find a way to read “In curves, not angles” that was featured on fictionalley.org but that website doesn't seem to exist anymore. Any help would be greatly appreciated. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/casira/ICNA.html][Here is a link to where the original story was.]]


** You could try Wayback Machine [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160906151158/http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/casira/ICNA.html]]

*** Thanks for the recommendation but I couldn't get past the screen that asked me if I was a certain age.

** Fictionalley is in the process of being migrated over to AO3, I don't think it's complete yet but hopefully fics will show up soon
