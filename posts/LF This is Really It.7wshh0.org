Almost a decade ago at this point, I read a story on hpff.net that I think was called This Is Really It or This Is Really Now. It was a Ron/Hermione where Hermione was married to Draco. The story starts with Thump thump sex. Where the headboard is thumping against the wall and Hermione us thinking about things other than sex. The author also wrote a sequel that was Rose/Scorpious where Rose was Pregnant at school?

If anyone knows where to read them it would be so appreciated!
