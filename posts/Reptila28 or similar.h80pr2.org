***** LeQuin's response is not only complete but subverts or avoids a lot of the pitfalls others wander directly into.

Is it bashing, in more than a few places? Yes. But the prompt calls for it. And behind the bashing other things still /happen/ in this story.

One of the notable subversions is Harry's /uncertainty/. Waking up at the start of fourth year, what are the chances that he /really/ was sent back in time, told soulmates are real, etc., etc.? Not very likely. (But also as things match his recollections, the story quietly and realistically drops the concern; no point stringing the reader along when we know it's all true because the premise gift-wrapped it for us.)

The other thing is that things in the story are ... allowed to affect the plot, in a way that some authors do not. Causes have effects.

And if this seems like high praise, it's not even my favorite LeQuin story!
