*Basilisk* - /Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size, and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it./ - */Most Macabre Monstrosities/*


** “Tha's for Aragog, ya right bastard!”

Harry and Tom whirled in shock.

There stood Rubeus Hagrid with a giant rooster in one hand, and brandishing his pink umbrella in the other.

“How-“ said both Harry and Tom at the same time.

“The trick is, you need ta know ‘ow ta calm ‘im. If ya can't calm ‘im,” he turned his beetle black, normally gentle eyes, but now, hard as obsidian onto the specter of Riddle, “Yeh've got to know ‘ow to kill ‘im.”
