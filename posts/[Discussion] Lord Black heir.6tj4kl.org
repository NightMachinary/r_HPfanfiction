A very recurrent trope in some fics is the idea that the Black family among many others were some kind of nobility in the Wizarding Britain. In those fics Harry becomes Lord Black after he inherits this titile from Sirius.

Yet People tend to forget that Sirius was disinherited by his family because of his Pro-muggle sympathy. This could have or not excluded Sirius for inheriting the Title, Lest call it The Dukedom of Snobbery.

Taking these into account, who was Lord Black in the Maraunder's era and who would be the Lord/Lady in the days after the Battle of Hogwarts if we consider the family relations: Draco Malfoy? Teddy Lupin? Harry Potter? Delphi Riddle?None of the above?

#+end_quote

Arcturus Black III (b. 1901) would likely be Head/Lord from 1952 to 1991.

Arcturus Black III (Sirius' grandfather) was the oldest son of Sirius Black II (died 1952) who was the oldest son of Phineas Nigellus Black (died 1925). Arcturus didn't die until 1991 (outliving his only son, Orion Black, Sirius' father, who died in '79, and Walburga Black, Sirius' mother, who died in '85).

#+end_quote

We don't know enough. It depends on whether Sirius was actually disinherited, whether Heads/Lords can "name" their heir or whether title inheritance is determined simply by law, does inheritance pass to the oldest living or to oldest male of oldest line, etc.

When Arcturus Black III died in 1991 he was survived by a number of Blacks and their /known descendents/:

- Iola Hitchens née Black (death unknown, b. 1850s but maybe alive), sister of Phineas Nigellus Black
- Lucretia Prewitt née Black (d. 1992), granddaughter of Sirius Black II, first son of PNB
- Sirius Black III (d. 1996), i.e., Harry's Sirius, great-grandson of Sirius Black II, first son of PNB
- Phineas Black (death unknown, b. 1878-1883 but maybe alive), second son of Phineas Nigellus Black
- Callidora Longbottom née Black (death unknown, b. 1915 but maybe alive), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB
- Cedrella Weasley née Black (death unknown, b. 1915-19 but maybe alive), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB

  - /Arthur Weasley/, son of Cedrella Weasley née Black

    - /Bill Weasley/
    - /Charles Weasley/
    - /Fred Weasley (d. 1998)/
    - /George Weasley/
    - /Percy Weasley/
    - /Ron Weasley/
    - /Ginny Weasley/

- Cassiopeia Black (d. 1992), daughter of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB
- Cygnus Black III (d. 1992), grandson of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB

  - Bellatrix Lestrange née Black (d. 1998)
  - Andromeda Tonks née Black

    - /Nymphadora Tonks (d. 1998)/

  - Narcissa Malfoy née Black

    - /Draco Malfoy/

- Marius Black (death unknown, b. 1915-1920 but maybe alive), squib and son of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB

In addition, there are at least two other Blacks who have passed on but may have non-Black descendents with inheritance claims:

- Charis Crouch née Black (d. 1973), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB
- Belvina Burke née Black (d. 1962), only daughter of PNB

Canon, Harry Potter has no known relationship to the Black family until he marries Ginny (granddaughter of Cedrella Weasley née Black). If we ignore that Fleamont nonsense and say Dorea Potter née Black was Harry's grandmother (thus making Harry and Ginny third cousins via PNB ... which is /fine/, no sarcasm), then (absent Sirius being able to name an heir) Draco's claim is probably better than Harry's --- Draco is the grandson of a male Black heir (Cygnus Black III) who would have been next to inherit after Arcturus if Sirius wasn't eligible, while Harry is only the great-grandson of a male Black heir (Cygnus Black II). Draco also descends from CBII, but through the oldest son (Pollux Black) rather than through a younger daughter (Dorea).

If Sirius was ineligible, then that would basically strike out the entire line from Sirius Black II (son of Phineas Nigellus Black). The next oldest son of PNB was Phineas Black who was not known to have any descendents but could still be alive. The next oldest son was Arcturus Black II which could actually give Arthur Weasley a claim. After Belvina, we finally have PNB's fourth son Cygnus Black II (great-grandfather of Sirius via Walburga, as well as B/A/N).

Arthur Weasley's claim might be better than Draco's. Like Draco, he is also the grandson of a male Black heir, but he descends from PNB's third son while Draco descends from PNB's fourth. However, if CBIII does inherit because he is in a direct male line, that could strengthen Draco's claim over Arthur's later despite Arthur having primacy from PNB. EDIT: Callidora may have been disinherited, removing Arthur's claim.

So, when Arcturus Black III dies in 1991, the possible heirs are:

- Sirius Black III (b. 1959, d. 1996), great-grandson of SBII, first son of PNB (if not disinherited)
- Phineas Black (b. 1878-83), second son of PNB (if still alive, we don't know, but he'd be about the same age as Dumbledore, b. 1881)
- Arthur Weasley (b. 1950), grandson of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB, but with a break in the male line and possible disinheritance
- Cygnus Black III (b. 1938, d. 1992), grandson of CBII, fourth son of PNB

Who actually inherits depends on whether Arcturus named an heir, whether breaks in the male line count against you, etc. My money is on Sirius --- he /did/ inherit 12 Grimmauld Place, so he /wasn't/ disinherited (or at least reinstated after being sent to Azkaban as a Death Eater and thus proving his worth). After Sirius dies in 1996, I'd say it goes to Phineas --- if the Tapestry doesn't say he's dead, then he's not, and he has precedence.

--------------

Huh, it just occured to me that Marius Black is the first cousin once-removed of Arthur Weasley, and could be related to Molly through Lucretia ("I think Mom's got a second cousin..."). In 1991 he would be in his '70s and related to the Weasleys through the Black family --- two reasonable reasons to "never talk about him" (just because his name never comes up, not because it's verboten).

Also, there were a number of important Black deaths in the early '90s: Pollux Black (great-grandfather of Draco) in 1990 (age 78), Arcturus Black III (grandfather of Sirius) in 1991 (age 90), and Cygnus Black III (grandfather of Draco) in 1992 (age 54), as well as Cassiopeia Black (age 77) and Lucretia Prewitt née Black (age 67) in 1992. Most of them were reasonably old, but ... maybe Lucius clearing the way for Draco to inherit?

*** Great breakdown!!

I think you flipped Draco and Arthur at one point though. Draco is descended from PNB's third son, Cygnus (great-great grandson) while Arthur is descended from PNB's fourth son, Arcturus (great-grandson).

The other interesting question (and this would come down to OCs, so it might not be preferable) is where the Burkes and Longbottoms come in, as they could have a better claim than Arthur Weasley. Neville's great-uncle Algernon could be the child of Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom.

I don't think so. "According to the wiki" (quotes for reasonable scepticism but having no better alternative), Arcturus Black II (Arthur's grandfather) was born in 1884, and Cygnus Black II (Draco's great-great-grandfather) was born in 1889.

If Neville's great-uncle was the child of Callidora, then Neville would necessarily be the ... great-grandson of Callidora? Unless Harfang remarried at some point. Or "great-uncle" was simply a courtesy title.

*** This is a very complete analysis of the Black family situation in the late 20th century.

Thank you very much for taking your time to write this.

It's very interesting that RON might have a stronger claim than Harry and even Draco to 'Lord Black title' if this title follows traditional European rules.

Perhaps Lucius and Draco aren't that interesred in the Lord Black title because themselves might actually have their own title (the Malfoy one), and as I said earlier, the headship might or not be inherited along with the material possessions (that probably can be given freely in a Will to whoever the owner considers it).

How ever this 'Heir without a possessions' it's very unlikely because the tradition usually have the Heir keep most of the main state and gave to the other offspring token gifts at best.

A second son, he's watched /four generations/ inherit from his father (assuming Sirius actually inherited) before he gets his chance when he's in his 110s. He probably attended Hogwarts within a couple years of Dumbledore and watched him become the most powerful wizard in Britain. What does he do when he finally gets his chance?

** It depends on who was officially disowned from the family versus simply burned off the tapestry, and also if women can inherit the title. Sirius would be first in line (if he wasn't disowned), then Andromeda (if she wasn't officially disowned), then Bellatrix, then Narcissa, then Draco.

Delphi Riddle was born out of wedlock, so if we're going with the typical lord/ladies inheritance system, she probably wouldn't be able to inherit.

*** But the wizards could have a system of their own for titles, and how the rules are set up for them would be up to the author, since canon doesn't have/mention such titles. It could very well allow adoption to work, and I'd say that most likely, genders would be treated as equals. Or it could be entirely up to the current holder of the title - like how the rules of the Admiral's Cup are made by the current holder.

**** In Britain at least, any change in the line of succession for the monarchy must be by Act of Parliament, as since 1688 (when Parliament crowned the King of their choosing rather than the next in line by succession), Parliament has had supremacy over the Crown. (De facto supremacy goes back further).

A current holder can disinherit someone of any property that is theirs to pass on. So in canon, where there is no indication that the Blacks have any title, Sirius is free to will Grimmauld place and Kreacher to Harry.

But titles are generally not property in the sense of property that you can dispose of as you wish. Rather they are honours granted by the monarch. You cannot pass on or sell your title because the giving of titles belongs to the monarch alone, and it will be inherited according to the method the monarch dictated at the time the title was created.

There are /some/ titles that are attached to land, which are a different kind of title known as manorial title. These will transfer with the land if the land is sold. But these titles are not noble titles but rather the titles of the gentry: they entitle you to the title "Lord", but you are not part of the hierarchy of the nobility. Further, most of those titles could not historically be sold as they were a form of property ownership known as entail, where the current "owner" had a life interest only, not full legal title. It was only in the 20th century that entails were able to be broken up and sold (and the creation of new entails is unlawful).

** The whole inheritance thing is too flimsy in canon to really be worth following. Sirius, who was "disinherited" by his mother, willed the headship to harry, who is at least 3 generations removed from any black blood.

 

At worst, sirius was soft disinherited for any of three reasons.

A Lord is a sovereign, and sovereigns require subjects, unlike a familial head. The wizarding world definitely has an aristocracy, but tom was the only actual Lord knocking about.

*** Indeed. It's just something that some fans have toyed with.

IMO Even if it was as a true nobility title (which of course it isn't) Sirius could give Harry EVERYTHING in his possession (12 Grimmauld place, the money, the freaking furniture, the books, etc)EXCEPT the title because it'd be granted by very different rules. Draco could get the 'Lordship' but absolutely nothing else. Perhaps the only way to pass it to Harry would be that He was adopted into the family (like the old Roman families)

Basically all this 'Lord Black, potter, Slytherin, etc" are as must of us know, illogical bad fics, that have little idea of how nobility or inheritance works.
