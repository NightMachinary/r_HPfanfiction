I love Sirius Black, he's a rather interesting character in canon, though in fanon he's normally twisted to either: Hating all authority or a complete womanizer Which, I can deal with in moderation, but those are normally his traits in stories (though of course not always)

I'd like for him to be more then just hating on authority, and more then just a womanizer, if he is those things, fine, I'd just like more then that too.

So I'm curious, what stories are some of your favorite Sirius Black? It can be as Canon or as AU. It can be Muggle or Magical. It can be Time Travel, Traveling to another AU, or anything else.

Sirius Black can be a main character, a secondary character, a side character or a background character, not particular picky on that.

Would rather NOT have Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing, if at all possible.

If Harry is in the story: If Harry is smarter and/or more powerful then in Canon, I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it.

For Pairings (If any): Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, Et Cetra. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

Can be: Oneshots/Drabbles/Multichapters. Can be on ANY site, Anyone can be the main character. Can be an older or newer story.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** No one's mentioned linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)? I'd better do that, then.

Sirius escapes from Azkaban when Harry is eight, and without any leads on Peter, he instead checks on Harry - and when he finds him unhappy, he offers to take him. Which triggers a huge manhunt in response to the "kidnapping", brings Remus out of seclusion, leads to Snape finding out about Peter's role as Secret Keeper, and accelerates a lot of canon events, but above all, gives Harry a few years of actual childhood.

No one is overpowered, nor bashed, but there's a lot of really good fleshing out of characters like Tonks, Remus, Marlene McKinnon, Gawain Robards, and even Snape. Book 1 is pre-Hogwarts, books 2-4 cover Harry's first three years, book 5 is in progress.

**** Oh - Harry does become an Animagus. But it takes him years, and honestly, being raised by a Marauder it would be more surprising if he didn't.

And there's a second point of divergence, that starts off minor but snowballs in later books: Draco has an older brother.

***** Question: How are they with nicknames? Some stories where Sirius is in Harry's life more, is that he gives Harry a name like Prongslet or Pup or something, which... I'm not the biggest of fan of, tbh. Though if he was given a nickname at a young age, and the nickname stops when he's a teenager, or he's only called that in private, I can be more accepting of it.

******** I really love scenes like Harry and Sirius playing hide and seek, shortly after they move into Grimmauld Place. Sirius starts on the first floor and thinks Harry has to be trapped upstairs, but Harry persuades Kreacher to elf-apparate him downstairs, by reminding him that Sirius doesn't like to lose ;). Sirius eventually finds him in the kitchen eating fresh scones.

Or when Harry pranks Sirius (in book 2, actually) by inviting his primary school friend Hermione to visit; Harry has recently learned that she's a witch, but hasn't told Sirius yet, sending Sirius into a tizzy as he tries to hide how blatantly magical Grimmauld Place is. Harry busts a gut after Sirius drops a wand and accidentally transfigures a teapot.

They're just such kid things :). Harry needs more of that.

** I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better, but it is also a great dive into Sirius's struggles to find mind healing after all his trauma. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to the characterizations. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

linkffn(13052940)

I really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432][Fractured Skies by Orphan Account]] - it features a deaf Sirius and the way signing is portrayed seems to really capture the poetry of the language. The story beautifully conveys the challenges of living on the fringe ... the otherness (not just Sirius, but also Lupin). Also, I loved how the Marauder's story was made mundane (not magical) with links to the original stories woven in. It is slash and has a sequel that is also good.

  Sirius shuts his mouth, hides his views and does all he can to protect himself and his brother. This is why the hat put him in Slytherin. (In another life, perhaps he was more like Andromeda. Perhaps he rebelled, lived his life bright and loud and brave and Gryffindor. But in this life, Sirius Black decided that surviving was more important to him than living, and he adjusted his actions accordingly.) Sirius Black is a Good Pureblood Son, and everything changes.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

I'm also partial to the muggle Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], which is about a witch Hermione who got stuck in a muggle AU and wants to get back (WIP, very regular updates). Plot spoiler... At least, it was about that. She got back and I stopped reading. It's still being updated and I'm not sure what the plot is any more.

I also remember liking [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16807438/chapters/39450802][Magpies]], but I don't know if I liked it for its Sirius or not. It's a bunch of thematically linked oneshots about various Blacks.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  March 1984. Walburga Black sits alone in Grimmauld Place, accompanied only by her ghosts, a broken woman with little left to live for. The House of Black lays in ruins, it's members scattered, awaiting its inevitable demise. Until, one day, a Ministry owl comes tapping at her window, bearing news that offers a last chance to change the course of her life - and the fate of the Black family. Seizing the opportunity to free her son from Azkaban and secure him the trial he was denied, Walburga quickly finds out that three years in prison has done little to quell Sirius Black's rebellious spirit, and it is soon clear that he is not going to simply follow the plans she has so carefully laid out for him.As the impending trial approaches, both Sirius and Walburga must grapple with their broken relationship and stormy past - and Sirius himself must decide whether he will seize the chance of the freedom offered to him, or whether he will send himself back to Azkaban for the punishment he is so convinced he deserves...My take on the "Walburga gets Sirius out of Azkaban" scenario.
