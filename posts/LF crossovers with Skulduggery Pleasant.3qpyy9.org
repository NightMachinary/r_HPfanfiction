The ones I've found make Halfway Fucked Herpes (or whatever it's called) look like Shakespeare. Any of you had better luck?


** By "Halfway Fucked Herpes" you refer to "Partially Kissed Hero"?

*** How the hell did you manage to figure out one from the other? You must be some kind of patron saint of misremembered names.

** That would be fucking awesome. Never seen a good one.

Even more than with HP, I'd like a good SP/Dresden Files cross. There'd have to be some fudging of magic systems or an outright alternate dimension thing, but the snark/banter and manly adventure would be godly.

**** Well, those 31 are all the ones on ff.net, so unless you want to write one you're probably SOL.

***** I kinda exaggerated a teensy bit. I haven't read most of them, just a couple of the top favorited ones. I was hoping that someone who had would know which ones were actually good or if I would be wasting my time looking through the rest.

Edit: I had some free time. I can say relatively safely that I am not exaggerating and that the couple of them worth reading aren't finished and likely never will be. On the bright side I did find a fantastic (sorta) crossover where Vergil from Devil May Cry is the defence against the 5th Dark Arts teacher and spends the story struggling to put up with Umbridge.

Edit 2: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9173332/1/The-Fifth-Champion][The Fifth Champion]] actually okay. It's plot is that Valkyrie is entered as the 5th champion by Voldemort who's working with the Roarhaven mages or something along those lines.

******* It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5283776/1/Dark-Defense][Dark Defense]] it's not exactly the best fic ever (and it's also dead) but it's still a fun read.
