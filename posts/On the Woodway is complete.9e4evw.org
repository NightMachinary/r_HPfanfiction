Hey guys, I just posted the last chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13018423/1/On-the-Woodway][On the Woodway]], part two of the Elder Tales series. (Part one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12631584/1/Driving-Miss-Weasley][Driving Miss Weasley]]). Part three, the final part, is on the way, and I'm steaming ahead these past weeks. I'll post it on the subreddit when I start publishing.

Let me know what you think!

EDIT: a summary: A gruesome murder at Hogwarts disturbs the peaceful summer, and Head Auror Harry Potter struggles with the dark secret he carries with him. Kingsley Shacklebolt's Ministry hangs by a thread as old foes once again seek to reclaim power. Ancient and eternal forces are changing the world once more, and Harry is caught in the midst of the storm.


** Coincidentally, I just read Driving Miss Weasley and it was good. Believable dialogue, good action pacing, I got a very professional feel from it. Good job, dude.
