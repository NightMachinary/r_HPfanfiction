*** Last but not least, never underestimate a female Weasley! Ginny Weasley has already captured the eye of Horace Slughorn due to her wandwork, and we know he is not often wrong. And lastly, the matriarch, the femme fatale. Loyal to her family and the good cause, Molly Weasley lures in unexpecting informants who think her an easy target for information. Like a spider in a web, she manipulates those around her. With her motherly air she hides the fact that she is one of the most effective spies for the light side and the sole cause of quite a few turncloaks by offering them a home and safe haven. Those who do not switch sides often find themselves pulled closer and closer, before being smothered within her warm embrace. Some who step inside the Burrow end up getting burried...

** I also like the idea, if voldemort did actually impurise the weasleys in the last war

leading to some bitterness from weasley family towards the malfoys who falsely claim it
