I'm just obsessed with that fic! I'm wondering if there's any Harry x Voldemort fic that's similar to that? i.e. them being forced to live/work together and begrudgingly forming a friendship which eventually gets deeper. I just really find their dynamic interesting because power aside, they have a lot more in common with each other then they do with other people.

Any recommendations are welcome!

This is fic I'm talking about - linkao3(29356095)
