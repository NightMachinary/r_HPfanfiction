Touched By The Arcane by lisbeth00, a HP/Bloodborne crossover fic done very, very right so far. It has a lot of awesome potential. I recommend it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctum]] - Voldemort travels back in time to when he was 16 after his death. Very good. At first I was skeptical because of the fanon "Horcruxes drive you insane" trope, but Voldemort's evil nature is retained and the author only uses it as an excuse to make him more patient and clever. Includes Dumbledore discovering Tom Riddle is a time traveling Dark Lord, and them looking for opportunities to eliminate each other while the war with Grindelwald rages.

**** It's actually an interesting read. And a welcome respite from the oversaturation of ‚ÄúVoldemort is evil and crazy‚Äù. That being said, the protagonist is indeed Voldemort. But not all protagonists are good. He's still villainous, and he admits as much to all and sundry.

It also brings us a great view of an imagination of Voldemort as a student in Hogwarts. I think that's what I enjoyed the most in this fic.

** Linkffn(fireworks by anorc)

It's a post-war Haphne fic (M-rated), and pretty enjoyable. It's a pretty interesting mix of politics, romance, and the fallout of the war on both personal and societal levels. I'm a bit over halfway through, but apparently there's a sequel in the works. I'd say it has some similarities to Novocaine, which is really some of the highest praise I can give. It's pretty harsh on Ron, so be forewarned, but mostly within the realms of reason IMO

** I've started reading linkffn(A Cadmean Victory), about 10 chapters in. Thus far it hasn't diverged all that strongly from canon, just added some side-story about Harry visiting the Chamber of Secrets again and finding a portrait of Salazar Slytherin and a non-portable time turner, while the canonical plot of his name coming out of the Goblet of Fire still more or less happens. Also, Harry has apparently done a remarkable (implausible?) amount of study and catch-up over the summer between third and fourth year, and is now on a level with Hermione in most classes, which is...eh, probably going a bit too far when she's clearly a genius. The characterisations are otherwise decent, though, giving people both strengths and flaws, and there's plenty of time yet for it to go well off the canon rails.

******** Biggest downside from this fic is that I find it very hard to read anything that isn't a h/f, Ive never read heart and soul as it's a HP/HG/FD (worth reading?)I'm trying to read h/daphne but it's just trying to find the right story. I'm also a sucker for the Salazar mentor stories that make use of the chamber of secrets. I'm no writer but I feel there's a lot of story potential if you use it.

********* You should try 'wastelands of time' and 'the Lie I've lived', 'his angel' is also a pleasant fic. There's a ton of others but varying in quality. H/F has also always been my favourite and I feel like no fic does it better than a cadmean victory. From the awkward teenage attraction to buying a house together and having a child. It's just such a long, well-crafted , dynamic and finished fic.

There's also these wip H/F fics that are being regularly updated: 'ingenio ab artifex' and 'a court of flowers'.

As for Harry/Daphne, 'contractual invalidation' is probably my favourite. Don't know many others tbh. There's 'blood of the phoenix' with a female OC that I basically consider to be an older Daphne.

That author made no money off his story, he wrote it for free and published it for us all to read. As a fanfic author, i don't like trashing stories that were fine beyond my complete dislike/disinterest in the plot or narrative. It feels needlessly disrespectful.

So, to summarize - I did not enjoy that story, the plot, or the choices that the author made. I did enjoy Cadmean Victory, despite much of what you say being true of that fic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

It's about a Tom Riddle sorted into Gryffindor, who's just as monstrous as he is in Canon but much better at hiding. The world building is very much on point, and the characters read very well. Reads like a series of short stories set in one universe.

** The Master, the Warden, the Headmaster and the Deputy by mak5258 ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11702523/1/The-Master-the-Warden-the-Headmaster-and-the-Deputy]]) Snape and Dumbledore enact an old tradition in the castle, hoping to gain a much-needed edge. It's Hermione/Severus, and I remembered I loved it. I've been rereading some stories in Hope's if finding the story I've been searching for. It's a very unique plot where Severus and Hermione becomes the Master and Warden of Hogwarts that has special powers to help Harry win the war. The Headmaster shouldn't also be the Master but he is; and the Warden should be living in the castle but she's off finding Horcruxes with Harry and Ron. McGonagall is great in the opening chapter which takes place in HBP (AU) and thus she's doing everything she can to make Snape's life miserable.

  Daphne's not the person everyone seems to think she is. She's really down to earth, has a jolly nature, wears her emotions on her sleeves. She's also VERY interested in one Harry Potter, and she wants ice cream...no I said ice cream, not ice queen, dang it! Also, throwing coconut pie is a legit way to win a fight against dark lords and their followers.

** Just finished reading my first two (ever actually) fan fics this week.

First was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] by FloreatCastellum. Wow. I honestly blow away by the quality of this writing. Not to offend anyone, but I've kind of associated fanfics with poorly written shipping and smut up to this point. That was not the case for this wonderful... I'll call it a novel.

For anyone not familiar it tells the story of Book 7 from Ginny's perspective and follows the canon nearly exactly. It of course centers around the actions of the silver trio and the Weasley Family. The writing perfectly captured JK's tone from the original books and is honestly part of the canon for me now. There was never a moment where I thought that a character said something out of place to what they would say. I was impressed how seamlessly Harry's story would occasionally intersect without feeling forced. Really an absolutely wonderful work. 10/10.

The other I finished just a few minutes ago was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]] by RRFang. This was really similar actually except focused on the events of Book 6 with a shorter rush through 7 at the end. Again, very true to the original books. Maybe not /quite/ up to the same caliber as /Not From Others/, the illusion of reading a lost book from the originals was broken a few times with some out of place (though humorous) meta-references and inside jokes. Still a great read.

So now of course I'm sitting here flopped back into reality trying to figure out what's next.

*** If you haven't read FloreatCastellum's other work, I highly recommend The Aurors and it's follow-up work Hollow Ash. In Mendax is third in the series and in-progress but I think she's on a hiatus from writing, she mentions in her profile caring for a sick relative. Still the series is worth every second, and I'll wait patiently for her return.

*** Associating fanfic with bad writing is totally understandable. The majority of fanfic is poorly written ships and smut. You just have go find the cream of the crop.

*** I read this one story that I now like to think as my head canon. It was so well done that I have to remind myself that it's not actually canon.. It was a time turner fic so it spanned from the Marauders era and covers all the books. It does an awesome job of keeping most of the details and events in the books but changing it up to allow my favorite ship to thrive. And it has 2 endings...split from where the Hermione travels back in time so she could either de-age back to a teenager or continue on as an adult. I can't even pick which part 2 I prefer since both endings bring something completely different to the table.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681/chapters/29871909][A Dangerous Game]]

Quick preamble: This is set where the Chamber of Secrets is opened in the fifth year. No one is 12. It's a good fic where the small details make everything so rich.

It has young horcrux Tom as the horrible psychopath he is but also he's human. He's a horrible, bratty, cruel and most importantly a stupid, human teenager. There's this little detail in the beginning after Tom kidnaps Harry to his old safehouse of a cauldron with FOOD ONLY written shakily on it. It's just a throwaway line, but it implies he can make regular human mistakes such as accidentally poisoning himself. You can really see his adult self in him. Voldemort is Tom Riddle increased and concentrated.

Harry's actual strengths are catered to. He learns by action and is more intuitive than Tom in dangerous situations. It doesn't shy away from the fact that Harry isn't a book learner and doesn't act like that is a horrible crime. Their relationship is abusive and Harry acknowledges this. However he's still emotionally attached to him because he has spent time with him. Harry is just a young, sweet, and compassionate teenager.

Voldemort is actually scary. He's creepy. He's definitely Tom Riddle as an adult, but this Tom isn't there yet. He doesn't have the experience or age. I don't know how to describe that better.

This is starting to sound like a weird book review and I just want to shout about how human every single character feels real and I love this story.
