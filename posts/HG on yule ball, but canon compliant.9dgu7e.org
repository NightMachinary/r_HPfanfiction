Hello!

​

In the past I have read a few Harry&Ginny go together to yule ball fics, but all of them are... OC's... and wish fulfillments.

So I wonder if there is any fic, where they go together. Harry because he has to, Ginny because she is still star-truck, but nothing of these "this was the best night, and I figured I'm in love with you Gin", or Ginny acting like she is deeply in love with Harry, when at that moment it is (in my opinion) only a really huge crush, that will evolve only at the end of 5th, beginning of 6th year.

​

I just want to know what would have happened, and I couldn't find anything.

If there is an AU, that kind of features a similar premise at the GoF part, I'm open for that too.


** I think this story handles the topic very well. linkffn(12824953)

Be aware that it's WIP.

  What if Ginny hadn't already agreed to go to the Yule Ball with Neville?
