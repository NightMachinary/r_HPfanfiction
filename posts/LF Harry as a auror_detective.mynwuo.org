Hi!! idk if this is right, but does anybody have a fic in mind that has the same vibe as this[[https://blvnk-art.tumblr.com/post/184721181469/harry-is-walking-inside-azkaban-to-do-his-job-when][fanart]]


** I would suggest linkffn(Red Amber by Andrius) for a hard-boiled, noir vibe with Harry as a PI/hired wand.

  It's a simple arrangement. Between her grueling quidditch schedule and his mysterious auror duties, Ginny and Harry find time to have spectacular sex with no strings attached. It's incredibly uncomplicated. Except when it isn't.

** Hey you might want to change the flair on your post to *Request* as *Recommendation* is usually for when you rec a fic, whereas the former is for when you request ficrecs.

So, I've only got slashfics for you, hope you don't mind (otherwise someone else might be into them so I'll leave them here)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550][Running on Air]] A brilliant Drarry fic

*Summary* Draco Malfoy has been missing for three years. Harry is assigned the cold case and finds himself slowly falling in love with the memories he collects.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22023307][Time and Again]] is a Drarry fic, not so much focused on the Auror part, but the fact that both are stuck in a Time Loop

*Summary* Harry's absolutely sure it's Malfoy's fault that they are stuck reliving the same day over and over. Harry is good at his job. He's professional, has an excellent closure rate, and is a well-respected Auror. Malfoy's the unprofessional one with his snark and his judgemental eyebrows and his far too-posh-for-work robes. If Malfoy could have managed to refrain from being a pain in the arse, everything would have been just fine. They wouldn't have gotten in yet another argument, Harry wouldn't have been distracted, and Harry certainly wouldn't have accidentally set off a powerful artifact at their crime scene. And if Malfoy would just get out of his way now, Harry's sure he can quickly fix this so they can get back to their comfortable professional dislike of one another.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20309395][Celestial Bodies]] Also Drarry, also not that big on the Auror Part, if maybe a little

*Summary* “An astrological anomaly induced bond,” Harry repeats, deadpan, as the Head Healer of the Magical Malfunctions ward finishes announcing his prognosis. “Space magic,” says Draco, tapping long fingers irritably against the arm of his chair. “You're saying we've been zapped by space magic.” The Healer huffs. “That's rather simplifying things, gentlemen.”
