Almost all the time traval fanfiction's about Harry Potter that I read that follows him through Hogwarts year have couple things that seems to happen. First the troll always attacks Hermione or another girl Second Pettigrew seems to always escapes and to me the most frustrating thing Voldemort always comes back in year four I've always thought the way Voldemort was resurrected was a lot to do with luck of things I just happen to run together such as Pettigrew happened to escape he happen to run into a witch that happens to know where one of his other death eater is that is under the imperious There's no sign showing that if Pettigrew was imprisoned and didn't escape or if he was killed off I don't see how any of those things could've happened. I was under the impression the death eaters believed that Voldemort was dead that the only reason Peter Pettigrew look for Voldemort was because he knew he was in the castle first year because Ron and Harry talked about it and of course he was there to hear it and because he's a rat he's able listen to gossip about the dark Lord being in Bulgaria. The only reason Bertie Crouch Junior was able to get free was because of the interference of Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort. I personally believe that he would have eventually been able to get himself free after the elf was freed but I don't think he would've been looking for Voldemort instead I think he would've probably seeking revenge against the ministry and the free death eaters like said no death eater knew where Voldemort was or even if you still alive, none of the other death ears went in got him that were free. Some may believe that's death eater like Lucius wouldn't want him back but there has to be some who would have wanted him back. I believe they would have search for him if there was any signs he was still alive and it didn't it seem like a lot of the inner circle death eater weren't sent to prison after the war I think only a handful were.


** Okay. Three things. One, stations of canon are what you are refering to.

Two, alot of time travel arent true time travel fics, in line with butterfly theory. Most time travel fics are fic it fics.

Three. And this is probably going to get me downvoted. If you are going to post, please please proof your post. Its extremely difficult to read, and that leads to a bad discussion

** these are stations of canon. writers use them because they want to write a story, but are unable to really think of a story. Instead they follow the same things that happen in canon, but they make minor differences like a different paring or have neville be the best friend instead of ron. They also often bash one plot device or character and replace them with another. But in the end they have the story follow the stations of canon because they couldn't really think of a good story themselves.

** If it is a time travel fix wherein Harry is sent back to approximately the time he gets his Hogwarts letter, the events of the First, and perhaps even Second Years have already been set in motion by outside forces who are currently unaffected by the time-travel. They will only alter those plans once Harry actively involves himself in altering the timeline.

Small deviations from canon can cause great deviations in the future, but will not do so immediately, unless extreme actions are taken. As in, killing Professor Quirrell before school starts actions.

*** But there's no evidence that anything else or anyone was helping Voldemort come back using the third task. Certain things can change history and there's certain things that no one man can change but if you went back in time and assassinated the man who assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand would we have had world war 1. Maybe even with those actions the war was inevitable but perhaps years down the line. The reason I'm fixated with this is it would've been great if harry gave himself more time to train more time to gather his resources if Harry could've been more proactive in some of these time travel fic.

**** To answer your question about if someone assassinated the assassin of Archduke Ferdinand would we have had World War 1? Yes. The assassination was an excuse; tensions were already high, and all it took was a singular spark to ignite the flames of war.

The same is true for the first, second, and possibly Third year. The first year, Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel had already established the whole stone idea, otherwise the stone wouldn't have been in Gringotts. Quirrell was already possessed, possibly before the beginning of the year, depending on when Quirrell went to Albania. The results of First year remained unchanged.

The Second year, seeing how slow the Ministry is, the Muggle Protection Act was in the works for years, most likely before Harry was /ten/. Lucius put the Diary in Ginny's things because it was the only way he had to counter the Act, which would have put him under extreme scrutiny. The basilisk would have still been unleashed, and while it may not have been Ginny who did it in the end depending on what Harry did, the snake would have been let loose in the castle. No matter what. And killing Lucius is out of the question since the man has the ear of the minister, is on the Board of Governors of Hogwarts, and is extremely wealthy. That doesn't take into account that he lives in Malfoy Manor, which is warded to all hell and back, to the point that the fucking Dark Lord Voldemort felt it safe enough to hold his prisoners of war. Second year will go as planned.

Third year is the earliest that a major divergence can occur if you put Harry Potter back in time into his 11 year old body, and that is only if the lottery that the Weaselys won was done that very summer. Considering how slow everything is in the Wizarding World, that is not the case, and it probably happened during Ron and Harry's Second year, and they were announced during the summer.

Lets say that Sirius breaks out, and goes rat hunting. The best Harry can do, is stun the rat the first time he sees it, and turn it into Dumbledore, as he doesn't have connections with Amelia Bones, unless he is cultivating contacts which breaks the time line. But lets say that it still happens. The fact of the matter is, Fudge is a fucking dunce. He wouldn't have allowed the trial, nor would he have allowed the ministry to look bad.

That doesn't even count the fact that Voldemort was already going to come back. It wasn't a matter of if, it was when. One of the points you made was that Barty wouldn't have broken out of the Imperius Curse without help. We know this isn't true however, as in the Goblet of Fire book, Barty states that he had "moments of clarity" meaning he was /breaking/ the curse, and that these moments slowly were becoming more frequent. Again, not a matter of if, but when. Judging from Harry, the only other example we have of breaking the curse, the first step is to question, then to gain that moment of clarity, and then the curse breaks. It is arguable that Barty could have broken out at any point, and that the reason he didn't was Winky. (The movie time line is fudged up as it have harry's vision before the World Cup include Barty Crouch Jr, when he was still Imperio'd during the Cup. )

The other issue you have is the events of the Fourth year. The thing is, the TriWizard Tournement was a mulitnational event that housed at least 100 foreign Nationals on British Soil, at least 3 dragons transferred from Romania, possibly foreign hostages for the second task, and several creatures, plants, and such for the Third. There is NO WAY that was organized in a singular Summer.

Would Harry have competed? Probably not without Barty as Mad Eye. But, he would have been easier to transport to the graveyard, and most likely dead as he wouldn't have expected it.

***** But do you not believe that if Harry used his frame and his celebrity starting at year one and by year three when serious escaped he would have enough clout to help push opinion at the ministry and to the people of Britain to listen to him I also agree with you that he could not have done anything about the fact that the sorcerer stone was in the Castle until I was already there and about Lucius where is a thing called political assassination with the boy who live being subtle during interviews to slowly over time make comments about the Malfoy's to the press I think opinions would have shifted by the end of year two

****** Hell no. Money talks, fame walks. Sure it opens doors, but the fact is Lucius had more money than harry by at least a factor of 10. Who gives a fuck what the public thinks when Lucius Malfoy is handing you 1000 galleons to make sure that boy doesnt make waves in the government. After all he is only 11.

** Money only get you far there's a point where political operative's look at how this is affecting there campaign. And about getting him under control remember in year five the reason they were able to hurt him so bad was he didn't rebuff any of their accusations. It took him one interview from a not so reputable news paper to get majority of the people to listen and to rethink what the ministry was saying. Think about how much the average wizard thought of harry potter think about all that political power he has it's not just fame it's political power
