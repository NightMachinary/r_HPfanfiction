I remember reading something about Harry who stop the Quidditch Game about showing his memories in public but also warning others not to move as well along with Madam Bones who is behind Albus Dumbledore..

But I wasn't sure what the title is. If anyone else know about this fanfic please link it to me. I've been trying to find this on google for quite a while.


** I believe it was the first round of the 'TRI' wizard tournament where Harry reveals all the dirty secrets he's learned about Dumbledore and Hogwarts but I can't remember the name of the fiction.
