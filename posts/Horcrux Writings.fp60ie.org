[DISCUSSION]

The following are intended to be in-world text sources for the story I am trying to develop with regard to the nature of Horcruxes. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are welcome. I hope to have a clear and concrete understanding of the magic as it will exist in this world so that all uses of magic can be consistent.

Excerpt from the Diary of Saavedra Gaunt

One piece of dark magic that my father took a particular interest in was an object called a Horcrux. A Horcrux was a special vessel that contained a portion of a human soul for the purpose of anchoring the rest of the soul to the mortal realm. The principal of a Horcrux was based upon the greek Phylactory, which itself was based on the Egyptian Canopic Jars. Where those predecessors were used to protect an entire soul from passing through the veil, the key difference of a Horcrux was the idea of splitting a soul.

My father's concern was with the original creator of the Horcrux, a mysterious man in ancient Greece known in text as Herpo the Foul, but whom my father suspected has appeared under multiple names throughout history. Herpo is known for both the invention of the Horcrux as well as the creation of the Basilisk, a feat replicated by my father.

Deirdre was a dear companion to me for my entire life before I left the castle. My father hatched her in hopes that she would shed some light on what Herpo had been trying to achieve, but all we ever learned was that a Basilisk is no more evil than those who teach it. She will sleep in the Chamber until my own child goes to the castle, or my grandchild if the gift, like so many others, skips a generation.

She was an insurance policy, set in place by my father as an unstoppable guardian for the castle. He believed that Herpo had made the first Basilisk in order to destroy anyone who dared follow in his foot steps to immortality. Deirdre would be entrusted to our descendants to ensure that the castle never fell to those who would twist nature so cruelly.

Excerpt from Secrets of the Darkest Art

The Horcrus remains, after countless centuries, the most effective safeguard of immortality to be devised by wizard-kind. Herpo the Foul of Ancient Greece used the concept of a Phylactory and added a crucial step by splitting the soul and binding only a portion of the whole to an object, preserving immortality by anchoring the soul on the mortal side of the veil, while also allowing the body to truly live rather than becoming a corpse bound to life as had been the case before.

To split the soul requires an act of pure evil, murder without regret, remorse, hesitation, or motive. A life must be taken and destroyed for no other reason than to destroy a life. Even the intention of using that murder for the creation of a Horcrux can decrease the ability of the act to tear the soul. This may be why no other wizard since Herpo has succeeded in creating a Horcrux.

Once the soul has been split, so long as it is not mended, then one must continue along the path of creating a Phylactory.

Excerpt from Secrets of the Darkest Art

A Phylactory, being a vessel used to bind a soul from passing beyond the Veil, must be carefully prepared.

First, the vessel must be cleansed of the physical, mental, and spiritual residue which accumulates on all objects that exist in our world. Second, the vessel must be made suitable to receive and contain a soul, a role naturally fulfilled only by birth.

Once the vessel is prepared, then the Soul Transference Ritual can be performed to move the soul from it's original host to the new vessel. The transfer must be performed immediately while the vessel is still prepared, or the accumulation of residue will revert the vessel to a state of inhospitablity to a soul.

To cleanse a vessel is most easy done by partially submerging the vessel in a stream beneath spare trees, such that it is supported by natural earth, brushed by naturally flowing water and naturally flowing air, and as time passes, obscured by shadow, bathed in sunlight, and then obscured in shadow once again. This is not the only way, so long as the vessel is cleansed by the elements in nature. Raining skies with a clear, sun washed horizon will also purify the vessel, so long as the vessel is supported by earth, and sun passes from obscured to clear to obscured.

The final preparation is a symbolic ritual in which the vessel is made suitable to receive and contain a soul by a process of birth. The vessel first must be anointed with a mixture of semen and menstrual blood, as an act of conception, and then passed through the birth canal of a living creature, as an act of birth.

The vessel must then be used immediately in the soul transference ritual, otherwise the vessel will be "stillborn", and lose the ability to contain a soul.

The selection of and treatment of a Phylactory is vital, and unfortunately limited. It would be ideal, for the purpose of preserving the soul indefinitely, to use a grain of sand and to then toss it into the ocean, however a soul is vibrant and unique, and a vessel that is simply one of many without identity of it's own will relinquish its grip upon the soul within, allowing it to pass through the veil. So also must the vessel be protected, not cast aside. By it's very nature, a Phylactory must be unique and cherished, which then paints a clear target upon it for those who seek its destruction.

Excerpt from Secrets of the Darkest Art.

The soul transference ritual is a simple alchemical transmutation, with three interlocking arrays. One array defining the target host, one array defining the source host, and one array interlocking both defining the transference.

Excerpt from Secrets of the Darkest Art

A soul, anchored and unable to pass through the veil, may be given a new body by use of the resurrection ritual, a precursor to modern potions, is an amalgam of ingredients, some specific to the ritual, some catagorical, and some specific to the individual.

The foundation of the potion is a mixture of Phoenix ash and rain water, and into this mixture is added a full bone taken from the paternal line of the body to be resurrected, a pound of flesh belonging to one who has done an act of service, given willingly, and three drops of blood from one who has engaged in a struggle of life or death with the one to be resurrected.

Lastly, the anchor which binds the soul is to be added, and from this the soul will be reborn into a body built from the fragments of memory within the ingredients. For this reason, the bone should be taken from the most recently deceased paternal ancestor, the flesh taken from the servant who holds their master the highest in their mind, the blood taken from the enemy who poses the greatest threat, and the anchor, if deliberately created, should be imbued with as much of the soul as possible during life. This will allow the soul to return to the most powerful possible form.

Excerpt from Secrets of the Darkest Art

It is possible for an anchored soul in absence of a body to become corporeal through the creation of a Homunculus, so long as the soul can enlist the aid of a servant with a body, either by instruction or possession.

A Homunculus is constructed body, an approximation of a human, lacking the finer detail of a true body, and of limited utility and longevity. However, a Homunculus is sufficient to allow a soul to take temporary occupancy and thereby interact fully with the physical world.

The creation of a Homunculus requires only a mass of flesh. The flesh is crafted into the likeness of a human via simple alchemy, and the construct is then given a form of life by providing it a fuel which is specific to the soul which occupies it. Once a Homunculus has been occupied by a soul, it cannot then be occupied by a different soul. A Homunculus, even provided with fuel without fail, can only survive for nine lunar months before it will reject the occupant soul.

Excerpt from the Diary of Herpo the Foul

I have taken a necessary step closer to true immortality, and through my experimentation I have improved upon a long known tradition. My soul, when viewed through my apparatus, was torn and fragmented, due of course to my own actions. It occurred to me that perhaps one of these fragments could be separated from the rest and bound to a Phylactory so as to anchor my soul further to this plane without the death or my mortal body.

The process worked as expected, and I have no doubt that my immortality has been further assured by this advancement. But could this be a step towards something greater?

If the fragment of soul could be bound to a vessel capable of defending itself, or better yet, a vessel capable of creating more vessels, then the assurance of immortality could grow exponentially. Perhaps something of a similar nature to an Inferi, a Homunculus, or a Poltergeist. The ideal host would be able to create more of itself, defend itself, and perhaps, improve itself. Perhaps a single fragmented soul could populate the entire world.

Excerpt from the Grimoire of ????

The soul is delicate and resilient, able to bend to unimaginable extremes, able to shatter under the slightest pressure, and able to heal from the most grievous wound. To split the soul, a person must commit an act which is abhorrent to their core nature. For a person with a pure and untarnished soul, it is simultaneously very easy and nearly impossible to split the soul. The act required would be, in comparison, very mild, but to the untarnished soul it would pose an insurmountable burden, and to act without remorse or regret would be unthinkable. The difficulty of splitting the soul is that a sound mind simply cannot do so purposefully with full knowledge of what they are attempting to do.


** Really enjoyed reading this. I love your concept of how Horcruxes are created. The idea that inanimate objects must be 'born' as bodies to receive souls. Was this something you came up with?

*** Yeah. I wanted something that fit with what little we were given. It had to be something that did not involve the body of the person that got murdered, because Myrtle and Tom Riddle Sr. Were both recovered unharmed. J. K. R. Said that it was so horrible it made her editor want to vomit. It also seems to have more to do with the vessel than the soul splitting or soul transfer, since the split is just murder, and the transfer happened accidentally with Harry. So, if you assume a living human is already prepared to receive a soul, the horrible part of a Horcrux is probably making the vessel into that same state.

**** If fits in really well with what little we know about Horcruxes. I've always suspected some gross act after what JK said about it & refusing to share it. But how this connected with Harry being an accidental Horcrux was always peculiar.

My own theory that I developed, seems redundant now, was the idea that he has to cause further harm, maybe specifically to his murdered victim in some way, whether through their loved ones or anything attached to them in order to create a Horcrux & had to get some kind of gratification or pleasure from it all, a euphoria, & not simply just killing. It would explain how he accidentally created a Horcrux with Harry.

He killed his mother who begged for her child's life & then he intended to kill her child anyway. Murder followed by further harming of an innocent attached to his victim, sin upon sin, & gaining self-gratification & pleasure from it all, no redemption or guilt, and the result is a Horcux is created. I believed this to be the working theory to how he transferred his fractured soul into another vessel.

If murder splits the soul,then perhaps another equally heinous sin would drive it out of the body completely where it will naturally tether itself to the nearest 'body'.

*** In a world where this is the way Horcruxes work, I believe Voldemort would have already split his soul, either killing Myrtle or a member of the Riddle household he had no anger towards, before discovering the theory, and then struggled to overcome the limitations to create another. Maybe he found a way to selectively alter his memory, or maybe he found a way to damage his psyche in such a way to allow him to split his soul purposefully.

I agree, power and knowledge alone makes it hard to believe that there aren't tons of people running around with world ending power.
