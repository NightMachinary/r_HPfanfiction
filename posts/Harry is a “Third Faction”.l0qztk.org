Looking for any fics where Harry, rather than siding with either of the two available sides (Voldemort or Dumbledore---and in some, but not all, cases Dark or Light) or allowing himself to be a pawn for said sides, he decides to make his own path. I would prefer, though it's not a necessity, for that choice to end up creating a “third faction”.

This could mean that some death eaters from the first war who no longer want to follow Voldemort, yet don't want to follow Dumbledore either, could end up choosing Harry's ‘side' (even if Harry didn't intend to be a third choice for the wizarding world). It could also mean ‘light wizards' who are tired of Dumbledore's methods could choose Harry's side as well.

I know this seems super specific, but as long as it has Harry being neither on Voldemort nor Dumbledore's side (and is decently well-written) it doesn't have to have anything else I mentioned!

(Sorry if this is poorly formatted or anything, it's only my second ever post on Reddit).


** The /Cry of Freedom/ series by Ian Hycrest is going that way.

  During the summer before his sixth year, Harry reflects on the death of his Godfather, Sirius Black, and decides that it's time to fight back. If it's war Voldemort wants, it's war he will get! (Assuming Harry's raging teenage hormones don't distract him, that is.) An occasionally X-rated (NC17-rated in the US) novel-length Honks re-write of Half-Blood Prince that's about 70% plot, 20% humour and 10% smut. The smut doesn't really take off until Chapter 7. Independent!Harry. Proactive!Harry.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

  Harry is determined to root out the corruption in the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and to bring to justice those responsible for the tragedy of the previous year. It won't be easy. The law protects the rich and powerful, at the expense of the innocent. The only way to win a dirty fight is to fight dirty. Book 3 of The Cry of Freedom. Sequel Up!

  With the success of Harry's scheme with the Foundation for the Future, magical Britain is at a crossroads. Dumbledore seeks to regain control of their society, but Harry will take this opportunity to fight for a better world. And with the famous Triwizard Tournament being held once again at Hogwarts, Harry will have the publicity needed to spread his message far and wide.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
