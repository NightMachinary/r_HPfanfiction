#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  When Harry received his 1st ever letter, he never expected for Aunt Petunia to tell him (with pinched lips) that he would get Dudley's 2nd bedroom, or inform him about other “freaks”, or reveal that his parents hadn't actually died in a car crash, or to bring him to a dingy-looking pub and ask the owner to ‘open the back for her nephew' while looking ill and refusing to enter ‘Diagon Alley' herself, instead thrusting two £50 notes in his hands, telling him 'their' bank would be able to change it for 'freak money', or for her to bring him to King's Cross on September 1st before snapping that, no, she didn't remember how to get onto the ‘ridiculous platform' so he best wait for other ‘freaks' to come show him.But Harry especially never expected the magical castle, with plans of her own (yes, Hogwarts is apparently a 'she') for those who came within her walls.Or the one where, after being introduced to the magic by a more perceptive Petunia (pointing out to Vernon that they would come if Harry wasn't sent to Hogwarts, so might as well get it over with before 'they' thought on actually coming to Privet Drive), Harry transported 20 years back in time for his 1st year at Hogwarts.

** Realignment isn't from Harry's pov, but it's very good.

Gelosaþ in Écnesse was pretty good. A founders there and back again. Slash, but mostly fades to black.

Six Pomegranate Seeds - Hermione centric, do-over fic while her original self is still around.

One Hundred and Sixty-Nine - Another Hermione-centric fic and the best of its sort.

A Little Child Shall Lead Them - Excellent. Just... excellent.

Of a Linear Circle. So, it isn't apparent for a while that this is a time travel story, but it is. A bit of Snape apologist-ism, but at (for me) a tolerable level. Story-wise... this is excellent. Even with the pairing, which I usually hate. Slash, but you can freely scroll past any and all romantic scenes and be fine (there aren't too many of them). The relationship isn't the focus of the story, at all. The actual time travel goodness starts in Part Three, with echos throughout.
