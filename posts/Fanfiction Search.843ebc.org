Hi! I'm new here and I might need your help :) I'm looking for a next gen hp fic I read a while ago. I don't remember much about it, but it was a James Sirius fic and he was in love with a gilr, I think she was Neville's daughter. She had a fiancèè who cheated on her and so they broke up, but she was pregnant and James offered a place to stay at his house. If I remember correctly she had a big brother (Mason, maybe?) and a younger sister possibly in love with Hugo or one of the Scamander twins... It was on ff.net. Could somebody help me find it? Thank you so much to all of you and have a nice day :)
