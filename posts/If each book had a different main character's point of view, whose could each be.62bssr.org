And for whatever character-book pairs you think are interesting, have fics already been written for them?

- *Philosopher's Stone:* Ron. He spends enough time with Harry to keep the main plot, and first year had one of his best character arcs (getting to know the Boy Who Lived as an actual person, and being quite heroic himself during the chess game).
- *Chamber of Secrets:* Ginny. Her blackouts while being possessed could keep the mystery of the Heir going for a while (of course it would be dramatic irony in a fic, since we all read the original book). Plus we'd get to know a different class of students, including Luna, who will eventually be at Hogwarts while the main trio is hunting Horcruxes.
- *Prisoner of Azkaban:* Lupin or Hermione would be interesting. Lupin gets to know his best friend's son, learns about the Secret-Keeper switch along with Harry, and generally is involved enough with the main plot to maintain the story. Hermione would show what Arithmancy and Ancient Runes are like, plus the Time-Turner has potential.
- *Goblet of Fire:* I don't know, Harry seems ideal here.
- *Order of the Phoenix:* Luna. I'd like to know how she handled Umbridge's classes, or the DoM battle.
- *Half-Blood Prince:* Draco, easily. He's been given an almost impossible task that he has to do for his family's sake, he's learning that being a Death Eater isn't glorious and easy, and Harry's kind of taken his place this year as the stalker antagonist. (Has anyone written this?)
- *Deathly Hallows:* Neville. Pretty obvious choice, I know it's been done before.


** I would actually like Deathly Hallows from Voldemort's PoV. It would be interesting to see the reasoning of several choices, the recognition of how things are going wrong, and confronting HP only for him to go Jesus on him.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  What do adolescent girls write about in their diaries? Stop and think about that for a moment. Now, imagine you're Tom Riddle and the only obstacle between you and world domination is an awkward eleven year old girl with a fangirl crush, a Harry Potter Doll, several older brothers, and absolutely no idea about human reproduction. You might just feel sorry for Tom Riddle if he weren't such a manipulative bastard.

** It's different from what you suggest in that it wouldn't show the whole plot, but I would totally love to see each book from the DADA professor's perspective. BC Jr's in 4th year and Snape's in 6th year would be particularly interesting. Quirrell's would be like a dark horror thing getting progressively scarier as Voldemort completely controls his life; the first book was actually very creepy at parts, like when they killed the unicorn. Umbridge's would give an inner eye into the Ministry and I feel like it could be really well done, providing the opposition's perspective to Harry. The only boring ones would be Lockhart and Carrow, mostly because they barely do anything except piss the reader off. Perhaps instead, COS could be McGonagall and DH could be Slughorn, because he was so reluctant to stay. I feel like instead of full books, these would be better as a series of short stories (maybe 5-10k words each).

** Hmm...I think these POVs would be interesting to read (and mostly unwritten)

Philsopher's Stone: Dumbledore. How aware was he of Quirrel's actions throughout the year?

Chamber of Secrets: Other than Ginny-maybe Dumbledore again?

Prisoner of Azkaban: Sirius would be fascinating or as you say Lupin or Hermione.

Goblet of Fire: Cedric would be interesting and tragic.

Order of the Phoenix: Luna or maybe even Cho (whom I sympathise with).

Half Blood Prince: Lupin, I'm surprised there hasn't (as far as I know) been anything written on his time with the werewolves.

Deathly Hallows: Percy, Arthur or Kingsley to either get a look at the Ministery ongoings of the Order.
