Just wondering if anyone has come across any fics with magic being available to everyone through training or rituals. Like a muggle could be trained to access a limited form of magic or through a ritual able to access it.

I've done a bit of a search but wasn't able to find anything on FF.net or anything that has been previously post here.

Thanks in advance.


** There's... there's one that kind of fits. Linkffn(Disillusion, by Hermione Granger) /kind of/ works with your request. But it's not like, actual magic, but technology that harnesses ambient magic and allows for the user to cast spells. Sort of.

It's a crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And incorporates that setting's approach to magic which says that everyone can do some magic if they learn the right rituals. Among other things, it is revealed that Petunia has learned some magic in this manner. "What kind of a freak needs a wand to do magic?"

**** It has a well contained plot arc to it but it does rely on knowledge of both settings. Personally, I usually prefer longer stories but consider this one of the better short ones I've read. However, since I'm always in the mood for crossovers I'm kind of immune to the “whet the appetite” issue.

******* Ok. My preferences with this particular crossover is Harry being pretty OP. I take Harry with seven years of magical education to be a very serious to all but the most powerful of beings. Harry himself is also a relatively powerful wizard, not Dumbledore levels, but definetly Snape, Bellatrix, Mcgonnagal, etc... levels, although I wouldn't mind if he's more powerful than expected. I mean we've seen what magical users in the BTVS universe can do, now imagine if they also had the variety of HP. Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, etc...

I also prefer that it's after Hogwarts Harry. I prefer if he doesn't outshine the original cast though, magic has it's place, and sometimes magic just wouldn't work. Why have Harry fighting on every patrol when he could be creating protective amulets, and healing potions.

If you wouldn't mind taking those preferences into account, I would greatly appreciate your expert opinion in this. Also I don't mind if there's the occasional stomp stories too, I mean Harry would have to be beefed up for Glory, and beyond, but I don't mind the occasional wish!fics.

******** That's a bit of a challenge. Most of the "Harry is OP" stories I know use different crosses (a few of those are very good and I know at least two Star Wars ones that fit your bill perfectly). With BTVS, I usually see other Harry Potter characters shinning and/or the Buffy setting taking charge.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8583/Greywizard+Prophecies+We+Don+t+Need+No+Stinking+Prophecies.htm][Prophecies? We Don't Need No Stinking Prophecies!]] sort of fits the bill. It is definitely a fic that has Harry as OP (and a bit of a Mary Sue) but that is mostly due to the fact that he has his canon innate talents while being raised by the BTVS characters. He is still only a first year by the time the fic peters out, but he is clearly way beyond anything the rest of his native world is ready to handle.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]] has Ginny as a bit OP because she gets called as a Slayer while also having all of her witch skills. Harry isn't OP in this fic beyond how he is in canon, but I think he functions as a pretty decent magical powerhouse working in tandem with Ginny.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-4652/justaguy+The+Muggle+Way.htm][The Muggle Way]] is less focused on any particular character but Harry does have his moments to shine. The bulk of the story is both settings getting overwhelmed by the other one because they simply aren't prepared for each other.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] is a multi-crossover that focuses on Hermione but definitely showcases a post Hogwarts Harry as the heavy hitter in her corner. The basic premise is that Hermione needs to assemble a super team of badass women from across the multi-verse to battle a demon god. She gets Buffy, Willow, Catwoman, Samantha Carter, the Bionic Woman, and Alex Mack (who I only know from this fic and it's sequels). Harry doesn't take center stage, but he is pretty clearly considered an equal to Batman in general terms.

********* Thanks for the suggestons. I wouldn't mind the Star Wars one's as well if your willing to share some more. Thought i'd ask this as well, but do you know any stories that have Xander actually being relevant beyond what he is. Willow has her magic, Buffy has her Slayerness, Giles has his wisdom. Any where Xander has something. Also I don't mind OP Xander fics either.

As far as Xander goes, he seems to be a favorite choice for some authors to give all sorts of weird shit. Canon Xander is a bit of a blank slate as far as powers go which makes him easy to mold into whatever you want.

We Are-]], and [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-23251/BarefootXO+Time+and+Again.htm][Time and Again]] are all pretty decent HP/BTVS crossovers that feature some sort of powered up Xander. Of course, if you go outside of just HP/BTVS there are tons of OP Xander fics. Funnily enough, one of the best ones is also a [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-7119-60/scribbler+Jedi+Harris.htm][Star Wars crossover]].

*********** I know those crossovers. I was actually asking if you knew any OP Xander stories that don't intersect with HP. I don't mind if they intersect with other universes, but i've read most of the HP crossovers. Sadly BTVS is not my main fandom story choice. I mostly just read HP, Naruto, and RWBY. The only BTVS stories i've read have been crossovers with HP.

I ask of your expertise again please. You've already helped a ton, and I won't get offended if you tell me to buzz off, but i've never really read OP Xander, except the one where he's a Sayian in Xanderzone, and the one where he was a Q basically. Oh, and the ones by mjimeyg on fanfiction.net.

I really loved 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.' I'm still waiting for updates.

************ Like I mentioned before, there are a lot of "Xander is OP fics". I also don't mind sharing. Buffy is my main fandom and it is old enough that it is a bit niche so I don't have people to talk to about it often. Let me know if you run out and need more BTVS stories. Here are a few of my favorites where Xander is either OP or has a unique thing going for him:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-4925/Lucifael+Blood+Moon+Rising+I.htm][Blood Moon Rising]] Starts as a non-crossover but turns into a Charmed cross later in the series. Very much NC-17.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-21322/dogbertcarroll+I+wouldn+t+exactly+call+that+sitting.htm][I wouldn't exactly call that sitting]] Multi-crossover and goofy as hell.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-19569/Chilord+Echoes+of+the+Fallen.htm][Echoes of the Fallen]] X-Men crossover that explores some severe mental trauma (explicit Holocaust content).

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-9349/CrazyDan+The+Child+of+Rao.htm][The Child of Rao]] DC Comics crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-10852/anotherlostsoul+An+Echo+of+Thunder.htm][An Echo of Thunder]] Starts as a Norse Mythology crossover but turns into a Smallville cross later.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-23613/Chilord+Poker+Knight.htm][Poker Knight]] Multi-crossover with the main one in my mind being Hellsing.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26060/Oxnate+A+Whole+New+World.htm][A Whole New World]] Stargate crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-22286/dogbertcarroll+I+Still+Say+it+Looks+like+a+Nail.htm][I Still Say it Looks like a Nail]] Stargate crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-29715/Ironbear+The+Hell-er-Nator+Chaos+Machine.htm][The Hell-er-Nator: Chaos Machine]] Mainly a Terminator crossover but includes other fandoms as well.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27400/DianeCastle+Xander+and+Yet+ANOTHER+Demon.htm][Xander and Yet ANOTHER Demon]] Stargate crossover

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-7573/angrymonkey+There+And+Back+Again+The+Horsemen+s+Tale.htm][There And Back Again The Horsemen's Tale]] Primarily a Highlander crossover but includes other fandoms as well including a bit of Harry Potter right at the end. Willow keeps pace with how OP Xander gets and by the end of the series they reach a point that in the whole multi-verse there are only two other people who are on the same level as them.

[[https://m-mcgregor.livejournal.com/176718.html][The Zeppo in Mind]] Non-crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-11757-58/Methos+Tales+from+the+Barman.htm][Tales from the Barman...]] Multi-crossover. Xander runs a bar that happens to have people from around the multiverse stopping by randomly. Gets to the point where even gods won't fuck with him (except for the goddesses that enjoy teasing him).
