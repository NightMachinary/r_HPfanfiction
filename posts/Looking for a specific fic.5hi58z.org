Looking for a specific fic where a good Dumbledore switched bodies with a bad Dumbledore(called "Wulfric" as an insult). In the story, Dumbledore began fixing his(Wulfric's) mistakes. I remember that the good Dumbledore died in 1991 and had killed Voldemort in 1981 in his original universe. Good Dumbledore died in his first universe from complications from his battle with Voldemort.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).
