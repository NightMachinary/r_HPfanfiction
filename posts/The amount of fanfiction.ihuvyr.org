My fanfiction library says that I have read 2,648 fanfictions and I'm just wondering about everyone else's. So how much fanfiction have you guys read?


** I'm definitely in the thousands. I would not be surprised if I've hit over 5k. The only reason it isn't more is because I prefer full length fics over shorter fics.

I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for YEARS. I haven't gone a single day in years without reading something from fanfiction. No joke. Most people are on their phone for social media. I'm on my phone for fanfiction.

I started reading fanfiction in high school. I now have my masters degree, and have been working for a couple years. That tells you how long its been since I started reading. I read in the morning, I read at night, I read during breaks at work, I read anywhere and everywhere. Its at the point where most people would classify it as an "addiction". I admit, it is a bit excessive.

I have an app on my phone I use to read them. Looking at my "digital wellbeing" on my phone, I'm on the app more than any of my other apps combined.

I read anything Harry-Centric. Most of them over 60k words, and a large amount over 100k, 200k, even 500k. I feel like I've read them all, and yet somehow I'm always discovering new gems.

*** Yeah I feel like I've read them all but it's hard for me to find new gems that fit my taste, that's why my fanfiction has tapered off over the years. Though when I do find one like this one I read a while ago it was like 124 chapters and over 600k words finished that in 2 days then I spent the next month trying to find another

**** I know the feeling. If I can't find something new that sounds good, I reread my favorites. But then I'll get tired of rereading and find a fanfic that, while it wouldnt be my preference, is still okay enough to satisfy me. And then usually that leads me to discover fanfics that I do enjoy. I definitely have my "comfort" fanfictions - ones I go back to again and again if I can't find something new or I'm having a rough day

***** For me sometimes I can reread fanfics but most of the time I dont because I actually remember most of the details and what's going to happen and I guess that takes the novelty out of it

****** Thats one of the reasons I do like rereading. I already know that I enjoyed it. Its definitely a comfort thing for me. Dont get me wrong, I'm not going to start over the second I finish it. But if I read 50 to 100 fanfics and then can't find anything? I don't see anything wrong with rereading that nice fic that brought me enjoyment a hundred fics ago.

But I definitely see where your coming from. Sometimes you just flat out NEED a new one. One where you have no idea where the twists and turns will take you.

** I am pretty new to HP and have only read a relative handful. Other fandoms some years back, probably 100s but nowhere near 1000s. One thing I notice about HP though is that the fics are unbelievably long compared to what I'm used to. A typical Star Trek (or whatever) fic might have been 5k or 10k words, though there were a few 100k+ ones. With HP, almost everything is 100k+, so even starting to read one is a big investment. I'm looking at Arithmancer now, and it's 500k+ just for the first installment.

**** Lots of oneshots, but I read pretty fast, so 1 100k a day at least, and multiple oneshots/incompletes, and Ive been reading for around 8.5 years.

** I've never tracked how many stories I read, but I started reading FanFiction in 2015 and read a lot in 2015 and 2016. Then, my reading of FanFiction started to taper off and this year, I don't think I've completed one story. Aside from work being incredibly busy at the moment, I typically only read Harry/Hermione stories and Charlie/Hermione stories. The former suffers from me not liking how many authors portray Harry and Hermione along with many of those stories being uninteresting. If there's no plot to the story, then odds are my interest will be diminished before finishing Chapter 1. With the latter, there aren't many Charlie/Hermione stories to being with, let alone any of them being well-written. Too many authors portray Charlie as a Christian Grey figure and...I just can't go along with that. It's a shame really but I'm hoping I'm able to run across some good Harry/Hermione and Charlie/Hermione stories in the near future.

** I wouldn't know. I'm not reading on my original account (and even then I'm reading on my Kindle instead of the computer now) but I started back somewhere around 2001.

** I cannot compare with you all. 179 stories but only because I didn't have an account the moment I started reading fanfic. Two years later, I realized I had to create an account to save all the wonderful stories I've read. I try to refind all those fanfics and save them.

I was like 11 or 12 when I started. Was 13 when I created an account. Am 14 right now trying to redo all my mistakes

** Not actually sure how many I've read in total, but it's quite likely to be in the 10k area. I started reading HP fanfiction in roughly 2002, and it's been a staple hobby for me since then with only some short breaks.

** 87, started seven weeks ago.

That number includes 2000 word one-shots and million+ behemoths. I think I've read about 6M words, and I still have many to go. And I'm picky to boot.

No idea how one reaches 500+. You would be reading sub-standard fanfic at that point, IMO.

** At least 3000, but I don't have a definitive count. My spreadsheet says I've finished (or, at least, read every chapter available for) 2150 stories, and have read at least part of 2923 stories. I didn't start the spreadsheet until I got really annoyed at how often I would start reading a story and recognize that I'd already read (and disliked) it. I have a bunch I saved to my hard drive prior to starting the spreadsheet that aren't listed in it, and I'm still occasionally recognizing "new to me" stories as ones I've read before.

** I've never really tracked them, if I'm on my phone I often don't use the ff.net app so haven't tracked it properly. I'm going to guess definitely in the thousands. I've been reading fanfiction since I was 10 years old, so 11 years now. It's crazy to find stories I remember reading way back when and how my tastes have changed or stayed the same!
