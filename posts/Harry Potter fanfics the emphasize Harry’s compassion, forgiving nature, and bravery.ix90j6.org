:END:
I know a lot of people like to bash Harry in fics. But I've always loved how brave, compassionate, and forgiving Harry is, and would appreciate your guys's fanfic recommendations that emphasize these underrated characteristics. I just want to read fanfic stories with Harry as brave and compassionate as he was in canon. He doesn't have to be perfect or op or a Mary Sue, but I think he has other qualities that are worth delving in to.

Examples of these traits can be seen when he is comforting Fawkes when dying, forgiving his relatives, being humble towards his friends etc...


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/][Seasons of Change]] is an AU that starts by having Harry do one tiny nice thing. It's a cute story in whichHarry and Dudley slowly become friends amongs otger things (and Dudley comfronting his upbringing, realising how much his parernts had conditioned him to be a jettk and how /wrong/ they were is well done, slow, character developement).

** linkffn(13260989) is not solely focused on Harry, but is otherwise a solid answer to your question

linkao3(19334905) touches on this.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
