It was a crossover with something or other, and the guy ended up teaching at Hogwarts during either 2nd or 3rd year, and insanity happened. Harry ended up overpowered, and Voldemort was kicked out of the Evil Guild.

  It was supposed to be a joke letter, but it ended up so much more. Who would have guessed that the 'poster child' of the Light side was a closet Pyromaniac with a distinct inability to care about the trauma he causes? Now there's a warlock teaching DADA, there's Death Eaters on fire, and the mediwitch is hexing everyone! Who knew being a minder for Richard could be so fun? CRACK
