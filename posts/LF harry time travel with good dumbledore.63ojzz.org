** "Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always" fits your criteria perfectly. Some people love it, but some people hate it, though. linkffn(4101650)

"Gryffindors Never Die" also fits. linkffn(6452481)

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** linkffn(Circular Reasoning). Not a happy fic, and Harry is not a nice person. On the other hand it is written better than most fics on the site, Dumbledore is complicated but mostly good, and yes, there is time travel.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
