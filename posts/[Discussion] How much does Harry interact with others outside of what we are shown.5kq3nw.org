In cannon we see Harry interact with Ron and Hermione. We know he shares a dorm and classes with Seamus, Dean and Neville and plays quidditch two or three nights a week with the Gryffindor team. Having done sport for years I know you get close to your team mates and really he ought to know a fair bit about who you share a room with.

What I am asking is how much do you think Harry interacts with these people off page. Obviously we can't fit every interaction Harry has into the series but for FanFic purposes it could be quite important. It always struck me as strange that Harry and Sirius interacted so little at the beginning of the fifth book but we don't know if they did and we just didn't see it. Is Harry really as isolated and insular as we see in cannon?


** Impossible to answer precisely because it isn't shown lol.

However, it's worth considering just how little we see of Harry's life. This is the origin of the popular idea that Harry doesn't really understand much about magic - Harry is our PoV, and we the reader don't really know much about magic, so we assume the same is true for Harry. But of course Harry has been spending years at a school of magic, attending classes, doing homework, and getting generally pretty good grades. He knows far more about magic than we do - as seen by the way he pulls spells out of nowhere that we never saw him learn.

I'm convinced that a lot of the reason why people think Harry is an average or above-average wizard is that we don't see him learning magic. But everyone else treats him like he's a very good wizard, which is I think telling.

If this is true of Harry's magical ability, it may also be true of his social circle. Just as he pulls new spells out of nowhere, he also seems to be familiar with a large number of people with whom we never saw him previously interact (like McLaggen in HBP).

*** Indeed it is impossible to say. I just find it interesting how we have far more fics where Harry goes edgy and alone to Harry moves to spend time with his other friends which surely he must have even if they are not as close. When Ron joins up with Dean and Seamus in GoF neither Dean nor Seamus are show saying anything about this which suggests he often spends time with them so I can only assume Harry sometimes chats to others too.

*** Pretty good grades? - CITATION NEEDED! (I'd like to know how you got that idea!)

As far as I remember Harry excelled at one subject and one subject only: Defense against the Dark Arts - in all others he was kind of mediocre (not good, but not worthless either! Still, nothing to be really proud of!) and he was kind of lazy (if Hermione didn't prod him he'd probably be even worse!) - a slacker if you wish, more interested in quidditch and chess (kind of a jock - someone getting by in school because of being a damned prodigy at sports! In RL you have people who get into fucking college/university (even Ivy-Fucking-League!) because they are good at fucking football or basketball etc...IMHO this is so wrong and needs to stop...think about all those nerds those kind of guys use to do their homework/write their papers etc.!)) and generally being a lazy bum with Ron (look at his electives! He chose the easiest ones available (ok, not fully, he could have probably aced muggle-studies...but I don't think CoMC is super difficult and neither is "how to deceive a fraud with crazy made up homework" (otherwise known as Divination!) which he and Ron took for "an easy OWL"!)

ps: I don't think Harry is the most sociable guy - sure he knows the names of his classmates and a few things about them (especially the guys he shares a dorm with and the members of his quidditch-team), but that's what happens if you go to school with people for 6 years...I know stuff about my former classmates, too and I was very withdrawn etc. (and bullied because of it))

The part where he got his grades in HBP for his OWL exams? In all the important subjects he has an E or an O i.e. the equivalent of a B or A in Muggle exams. If wizarding grade spread is anything like the Muggle world, that easily puts him in the top 5%. It's certainly enough to justify the proposition that he has a decent general idea about the content of the subjects he is studying.

** I always read it as Harry being friendly with several people, but his only real friends are Ron and Hermione.

** First off, because it bugs the hell out of me: canon, not cannon. The one is a synonym for "official" most often used in fanfiction and fandoms to describe the original authors work , the other is a tool of war, used to shoot projectiles at high velocity.

And I personally always assume that Harry is somewhat friendly with most people in Gryffindor, on mostly neutral ground with Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw and in a general state of distrust and animosity with Slytherin. I'd say he's friendly with his dormmates, friends with the Quidditch team and maybe friends, or at least well-acquainted with the DA members. I also assume that he knows at least the names of all of his year-mates and of most, if not all, of Gryffindor.

** He's not really as isolated as you'd think, but he isn't the star of the party either.

He interacts with other people to what I presume to be a fairly reasonable degree, as he knows many of the people, but whereas Ron and Hermione (and a few others in later years) are “friends”, people with whom he spends time just because he can, the others are all “acquaintances”, people he simply knows and occasionally talks with but doesn't get particularly close to.

This is precisely why he became so frustrated and aggressive in fifth year: when the public perception of him (again) became so negative, all the “acquaintances” became shunning him and because they weren't complete strangers it hit him quite hard in addition to the other stuff already happening.
