I would like to find a fic where Harry has a snake familiar. Bonus if it's the boa constrictor from the zoo.

I'd also like fics where Harry has older siblings or an older sibling relationship/mentorship with older students at Hogwarts.

The amazing story: "The Other Champion" on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] where Cassius Warrington becomes the other Triwizard Champion and he and the other sixth-year Slytherins take Harry under their wings comes to mind.

Thanks in Advance.


** Snake: [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]]

Brother (WBWL) and Snake. Very popular fic, so many people seem to like it, but IMO it's terrible: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero]])

Most sibling fics I can think of are WBWL and from your description I assume you don't want that.

Here's a fic where he has a mentor (non romantic) relationship with Hermione:

** I don't know of any good sibling/mentor fics, but I know of a few in which Harry has a snake familiar that is important to the plot.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12365453/1/The-Memento][The Memento]] - Harry befriends a snake while he is young and living with the Dursleys.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] (WBWL) - Harry rescues a snake from the zoo (not the constrictor).

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] (WBWL) - Harry gets a snake familiar at the end of book 2. (First book in the series is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]")

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10748108/1/A-Brother-to-Basilisks][A Brother to Basilisks]] - Harry forms a familiar bond with a basilisk hatchling from the Chamber of Secrets in year 3.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Until he befriends a grass snake in his aunt's garden Harry believes his relatives when they say there is no such thing as magic. Looking for a place to belong, he ventures into an elusive world shackled by age-old prejudices and fear of a man who may or may not be his father. What he finds is more than he expected, but less than he hoped. First Year AU

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
