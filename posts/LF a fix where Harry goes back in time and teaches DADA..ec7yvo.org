Doesn't need romance but I won't mind if there is some. Preferably completed if at all possible.

**** Right, I knew he became a professor but I forgot it was a pathetic potions one and not Defense. Wind Shear has him become a defense professor though I am pretty sure. He also screws up and calls himself Storm Chaser and gets stuck with it.

** This one has him tutoring students and eventually teaching defense. Time travel with some there and back again-itis. Slash, but barely explicit (two or three scenes that can be easily skipped over if you're like me and that isn't your cup of tea). Linkao3(2352896)

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.

  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No time paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated.
