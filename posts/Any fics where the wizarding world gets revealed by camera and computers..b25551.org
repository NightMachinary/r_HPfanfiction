Dont mind if its a one shot though I would prefer a longer story.


** I mean, considering how there is one wizard for approximately 10000 muggles, any photo/video captures on accidental magic sightings like say, sudden apparition are counted off as freak accidents or worse video edits/troll posts. Again considering the ratio, it's not like one village without electricity would be glaringly striking on a satellite map. So unless there are some extremely curious detectives who purposesly wanted to reveal wizarding world, the statue of secrecy would be pretty safe.

I mean, think of the numbers. The world population is like around 7.5 billion. Wizard population would roughly be 750000 if we go by same ratio. It's like population of /one small city/ scattered across the /entire/ globe. The difference is quite unnoticeable. Heck, even the population of London itself is roughly 10 times higher than the entire wizarding world population

***** I sure hope no more Grindlewalds crop up, and drop massive magical banners from the sky with moving pictures in fabric that cover entire biuldings and fade away after a while; or no dragons or obscurials go on rampages in cities; or no death cults go on killing sprees; or no giant fiendfire constructs get barely contained...

That'd be ‚ÄòBad', in a world where everyone has an Iphone in their pocket that can stream live video or instant messaging to the anyone, cloud save images to other devices as soon as they're taken, and keep a detailed record of exactly how much time you spend and where you're spending it and what you're doing...

Who said anything about it being accidental magic that gave it away? It just takes one determined wizard armed with transfiguration and charms in a major city in the year 2020.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7258617/1/][Escalation]] features dumbledore vs a computer.

The MLP crossover fanfiction Magic School Days (on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490541/1/Magic-School-Days][Fanfiction.net]] and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/371039/magic-school-days][FIMfiction.net]]) has a subplot about Muggles finding out about Wizards because their chat room logs were not being erased. Super cracky, I stopped reading it when the Dumbledore bashing devolved into other characters bashing his knees in with a baseball bat.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]] Harry's flight at the beginning of the fifth movie gets recorded in a SuperBowl commercial. I found it a bit dry though.

**** There's also "If Wishes Were Ponies" on fimfiction. [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/102/if-wishes-were-ponies/]]. I skipped to chapter 13 because I'm not deeply familiar with MLP but there is a lot of world building, politics, etc. Right now the world leaders and important government officials are aware of magic, and have told everyone else (Civilians) that they have met "aliens" so anything magical is passed off as alien technology to keep the SOS. There's a lot of politics and deeper worldbuilding. Updates Mondays and Thursdays around 2-4 pm EST.

***** I just gave [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/if-wishes-were-ponies][/If Wishes were Ponies/]] a try, but am giving up on it after reading 55 chapters. I don't recommend it.

After chapter 30 or so, the story devolved into nothing but Harry and the Cutie Mark Crusaders talking nonchalantly about doing crazy things and everyone being really impressed at them. Then they get superpower-like transformations without having to work for them, and they cast various spells imported from Equestria that impress everyone because they are so much better than wizard's spells.

It starts feeling unreal because every non-main character always acts like everything the main characters do is a brand new work of genius. With the number of times the main characters showed off, I would expect that at least once, the wizards would be able to be unimpressed at what they did, saying ‚Äúoh, we know some magic to do that too, we just don't do it [because it's illegal in this country / because of the side effects / because it harms our culture]‚Äù. The author dumbs down all other characters and societies just to make the main characters look better.

In between the chapters about Harry, there were indeed some interesting chapters that explored how the Equestrians go about revealing themselves to the British government, starting with chapters 37--44. Though that storyline started off as decent sci-fi, it was eventually infected with the same problem, showing nothing but British government officials being amazed at the skills of the aliens.

**** Just got through most of it. Wow it's a doozy.

The main problem with the fic is (particularly early on) the author likes to do 'artifact' chapters. Such as 'here is the text of the news article' or 'here is a report to hq'. They work fine from time to time in stories, but this one overdoes it. A lot of them could have simply been a paragraph or two.

Doesn't really fit the feel of what this thread is asking, IMO. I mean it meets the letter of the request, but wizards go "yep, revealing is inevitable" and come out willingly.

On that note, the fic seems to do a large bit of author appeal for a deference to authority. I found the religious plotline a bit unbelievable in a world headed for nuclear war. And then the loyalty oath thing. Or even how the death eaters are competent enough to transform themselves into an international terrorist organization.

Plus I have never really been a fan of 'real people as chatacters' too much vHgage.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
