Whether through a mistake, a retcon or wilfully ignoring a bit of text in order to suit a narrative, what do you think is the most overlooked bit of the books and why do you think it is ignored or forgotten?

For me it is:

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first-years never getting in the house Quidditch teams and told long boastful stories which always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.
#+end_quote

To me what is really overlooked is eleven year old Malfoy's knowledge of helicopters. It seems to go against the numerous stories that have purebloods living in complete ignorance that the muggles have progressed at all since the Statue of Secrecy was implemented. I think Arthur Weasley's comedic ignorance goes along way towards pushing this passage down. For a man who works with Muggle artefacts he seems far more ignorant than Malfoy. It also is overlooked in pro-muggle stories to exaggerate the gap between wizarding expectations and muggle reality.

Another contender for me include Ron uncovering the hats Hermione made for the house-elves believing even if she had a point, the house-elves should have the right to choose. That sense of fairness is often lacking in a lot of interpretations of Ron.

  Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.

  Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.

It's a massive failure on the side of the adult Weasleys, one that's unforgivable IMO, especially since Molly said that she had been worried in CoS but never actually does something later on, but that's not on Ron.

And taken on a horde of dementors.

  Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

There is a difference between a child soldier and teaching a child how to defend itself. And canonically, Dumbledore resorted to child soldiers to do his job again and again. Just look at the finales of CoS and PoA. Or the detention in the Forbidden Forest.

The Tonks home was able to repel the entirety of Voldemort's forces. And those protections could be erected everywhere. Hell, having Harry raised by the Hogwarts House Elves in a remote hut under the Fidelius with Dumbledore would have been better than Privet Drive.

A bloody prison would have been more suitable than that hellhole. Because in a prison there are regulations on how much food someone gets, how much space he gets, how much time they can spend in the yard and all that stuff. And no matter the category, a prison beats Number 4. At least a regular British prison. A Soviet Gulag might be a different story.

Examples? The cloak should have been Harry's as it is a family heirloom and the mirror should not have been kept where anyone could stumble across it. And Harry only was out of bounds because Dumbledore hid a dangerous artefact in a school and Harry was (rightfully) worried that someone wanted to steal it. The entire second year only happened due to Dumbledore's incompetence. Harry didn't get the permission slip due to the abusive relatives Dumbledore stuck him with and the trip through time was Dumbledore's idea AND only necessary because Dumbledore didn't stand up to the Minister. And that pattern continues throughout the series. Harry only needs the leeway because Dumbledore is utterly incompetent.

******* Finally, someone who /*agrees*/!!!😭😭

I don't necessarily /hate/ Dumbledore but both of the Second and Third Wizarding wars could have been prevented. He is the cause of Voldemort going mad with power. He basically sent Snape running into the arms of Voldy by /willfully/ ignoring the abuse Snape was going through. He let the Potter's die (was it ever revealed which family he placed Secret Keeper to?🤔 ...Seems pretty suspect to me.👀) and then let Sirius go to Azkaban without a trial...

Dumbledore has made one too many /*life changing*/ mistakes for most of it not to be deliberate.

Also, to the person who mentioned that Dumbledore /"knew"/ Harry...I'd have to disagree. What he did was manipulate him.

Prisoner of Azkaban.

It's taken out of context so hard. I mean, I like Hermione being smart, instead of "smart when the plot demands it" as she is in canon, but she's not going to outdo Dumbledore anytime soon. 16 year old Snape was probably smarter than her. Hermione gets the best grades in their year. That's what it means.

In context, Lupin is pointing out Hermione is the smartest 14 year old in their class of 13-14 year olds after the events of the Shrieking Shack. Which Hermione denies, because of course it's dumb to go hiking outdoors, at night, during the full moon. I cringe whenever I see /"she's the brightest witch of her age"/ in fic used by another character to give exposition on how Hermione is apparently a supergenius.

#+begin_quote

**** The issue is that, in canon at least, she seems to be by far the brightest/most studious in her year. Additionally, the tropes of the genre (having everything be solved by the main group of protagonists/the kids) means that if there's research, /she's/ going to be the one to have to do it.

For instance, if we take canon at face value, a 12-13 year old Hermione was the only one who was able to deduce that the petrifications were because of a basilisk. Does that necessarily make sense? Not without considering it through that genre view, IMO.

The second thing that makes it hard to judge is because anyone else that might be comparable to her (in terms of results/scholastic ability), we don't see firsthand. Tom/Voldemort and Dumbledore are presumably on an entire different level, but we don't /really/ see what that means. The Marauders are able to become Animagi and make an incredible map of Hogwarts - but that's a decade or two earlier, and we have no idea /how/ that was done, just like Snape's clear genius with potions and skill at devising new spells at that same age. Percy, Charlie, and Bill Weasley all have excellent results - but they're not directly comparable with Hermione's (since, uh, JKR didn't really count those out) and we don't really see them in classes firsthand.

So what we're left with is fairly inconsistent - if we judge by the standards of those that we see firsthand of roughly their age, Hermione stands out clearly - along with the Twins and their creative use of magic and new inventions. Past that, I'd say it's basically impossible to /truly/ compare those that we do see to those that we just get fragments of information about - because it's exposed differently.

Just a long way to say that canon goes out of its way to make her seem incredibly smart (in relation to everyone else we see firsthand), but that it's hard to say if (non-Dumbledore/Voldemort) characters in the past matched her.

#+begin_quote
  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time --- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

In other words, Harry is /only/ able to return to life because Voldemort used his blood -- had he been resurrected in literally any other way, Harry would have died with the Horcrux. Aside from breaking quite a few "fix"-fics, this is also crucial to understanding Dumbledore's relationship with Harry. In Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore is /surprised/ that Voldemort used Harry's blood, and then has his infamous "brief gleam of triumph". Dumbledore did not expect Voldemort to use Harry's blood, he considered it a mistake made out of ignorance and greed, and as such /up until the end of book four/ Dumbledore must have expected Harry to actually have to sacrifice himself permanently. The "gleam of triumph" is Dumbledore /finally/, after presumably fourteen years of trying, finding a way for Harry to survive.

Are you honestly arguing that slavery is OK as long as you have a "kind master"? Or that elves should be slaves?

******** I don't think we /truly/ know what Crouch ordered Winky to do - particularly when there are conflicting orders (like keep Barty Crouch Jr. safe/away from others appears to be an order he gave).

In any case, house elves clearly have some sort of compulsion forcing them to obey - whether it's magical or just ingrained somehow, Dobby's reactions is ... well, he clearly /wants/ to help Harry, but he's constantly punishing himself.

As for slavery and their desire, it's pretty apparent to me that they've had that role for centuries - they're raised in servitude, and there may or may not be a magical component to it. The way the bond is to a family/master, and how it's broken, certainly speaks to some amount of magic involved, but it's unclear how. But even without that, if they're raised from childhood in that cultural context, with other aspects (like education) kept away from them, they're conditioned into that slavery/servitude. We can see that in humans, too - [[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/][here's]] a news story about a slave/'indentured servant' in modern America.

Personally I'm not satisfied by the lazy canon explanation that they like being slaves, with very little actual backing to show /why/ that's the case beyond centuries of slavery/mental conditioning.

** *Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. “...then I declare you bonded for life."*

That moment occurs just as Bill and Fleur finish their wedding vows. The fact that JKR chose to write Hermione turning behind herself to smile at Harry with tears of joy is something I still think about once in a while. It's the most romantic line in the series.

***** Same. Just because I think Rowling made a mistake doesn't mean I don't appreciate other aspects of it. She just telegraphed how she wanted the story to end really early and when it seemed the story was taking her in a different direction she had trouble righting the ship.

I think a heavy reason behind the massive tone shift and delay in the release of Order of the Phoenix was due to her realizing the story she had written so far did not match where she was trying to go. So she ended up having to use OotP as an in-game patch, and then Half-Blood Prince takes over as if she had been writing the story she had meant to all along.

** “I don't think your a waste of space.”

Within the context of the story, I always wonder at how people react to the Dursleys, Dudley in particular. I mean, Dudley was raised by parents who encourage or ignored certain behaviors, and like practically any child he grew to accommodate these choices. His parents may have even rewarded his behavior to Harry (I don't think this ever explicitly happens, but it doesn't seem too much of a stretch either).

And prior to 5th year...well, what had Harry ever done that contradicted their views about Harry, particularly for Dudley? The pig tail? The exploding aunt? The tongue toffee incident? At best everything would encourage a child to be afraid, and at worst lash out violently to what isn't understood.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, on the one hand people say blood purity and supremacism is racist and can't be changed (Harry and Voldemort's history and parentage certainly don't help either). On the other hand, there are numerous incidents that show, when you shove people out of their black-and-white bubble, they can change their views. And painting everyone as completely rigid and intransigent in fanfics really reads like someone's naive view of the world.

Every time Harry didn't screw something up or his magic took a nonviolent form would be evidence against that. Harry jumps onto a roof to get away from bullies instead of electrocuting them to death. He grows his hair back overnight instead of melting the clippers in Petunia's hands.

It seems like you're trying to say that Harry should have worked to benefit them to make them stop hurting him, which is all kinds of fucked up.

***** Petunia certainly does. Remember that she wanted to be a witch - she'd have asked about accidental magic. She's much better informed than Harry before he goes to Hogwarts, and maybe for a few years even then.

And that's beside the point that you shouldn't be treating a child under your care poorly under any circumstances.

All of which are triggered in response to the abuse they'd levied on Harry first. This isn't a reaction on their part, it's a response on Harry's. They were abusive, and his magic struck back at them.

******** Dudley for sure can be explained in this way. Like most kids, he idolises his father who encourages this behaviour. He was eleven years old and got locked in a snake enclosure and grew a pigs tail which gives him reason to be scared but he bullied Harry long before any violent accidental magic. The blame for Harry's upbringing can be firmly placed at the feet of Vernon and Petunia who treated him like shit and raised their own son poorly, teaching him to be a bully. Dudley's bullying of other kids at school likely comes from being taught that he can do it to Harry and its okay. Dudley can be redeemed, Vernon and Petunia are bad people.

** If young Malfoy has ever spent significant time outside his house - in the gardens, for example - then he will have at least seen helicopters, and it's only reasonable for him to know the name for that class of object even if he never interacts with them. His home is in Wiltshire, where there are large military ranges, and so plenty of helicopter traffic. He doesn't show any knowledge of helicopters at all apart from what they are called.

For examples in the real world, consider priestly vestments. The vast majority of people, including those who are members of the Christian churches where they are worn, don't really have the faintest idea about them except that they're called vestments. They couldn't tell an alb from a dalmatic from a chasuble and have even less idea about why they're worn.
