** How is Dramione in any way Canon? It's distinctly not Canon. Are you trying to say the events up to the story are all Canon?

** I have written many a fic, all listed in my profile, one that actually had around 400 people following it and that I was so proud of until my ex found out. Read everything and thought I was so weird, and made me wary of even trying to post my stories at all.

The past two years have been myself in a spiral of alcoholism and depression due to being in that abusive relationship. Been through hell and therapy and back. I'm not trying to get a pity party going I just am really proud that i finally wrote another chapter to the only fic that I actually liked the plot I created. Writing for me, and not being shamed for it by someone who doesn't understand .
