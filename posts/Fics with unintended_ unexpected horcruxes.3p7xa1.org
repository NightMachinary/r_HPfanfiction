What fics do you know of that have people on Harry's side with unintended or unexpected horcruxes, tethers, phylacteries, what have you that bring them back? Preferably with consequences for having meddled with something so dark? Most of what I have found rarely touches on that - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marauders' Horcrux by The Santi) and linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by CopperBadge) use the Marauder's Map while linkffn(Brutal Harry by LordsFire, The Law of the Jungle by Roozette) has Lily tied to the blood protection.

linkffn(The Terrible Ideas Bin by The Mad Mad Reviewer, Lily's Diary by Red Phoenix Dragon) and [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council by Tenhawk]] make use of an enchanted book that may or may not be a horcrux but provides some form of mentorship.

I am also not averse to any fics where Harry accidentally makes a horcrux such as linkffn(Oops by michaelsuave).

There was also a oneshot I remember but can't find where Lily comes back using the same resurrection ritual that Voldemort did in TWT, using Snape as the servant.

I will take anything, give me your recs?


** linkffn(An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity) contain many resurrection shenanigans.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

  Harry gets sent back in time and across dimensions because... well, there doesn't really seem to be a reason why. Life is kind of awesome here. But Harry's full of Horcruxes and this world is ripe for the taking- he just has to prevent himself from going insane and becoming the next Dark Lord. Helpfully, he's regressed to a child.
