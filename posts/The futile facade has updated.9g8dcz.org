** I was super psyched to see this. After the last two updates took a year each, I was really not expecting this one to come so soon.

Since they aren't using the goblet I wonder if Harry would be able to compete as Rigel. I assume both Rigel and Harry will be nominated. Assuming she has the option of competing as either and both get nominated, I wonder if Harry will compete as Rigel or Harry. If Archie competes as Rigel and Harry competes as Harry, Riddle would probably assume Rigel is throwing the competition and enact whatever he is going to blackmail Rigel with, but also Harry would presumably rather win as a halfblood than a pureblood.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.
