A twinfic is basically a fanfic with Harry having a twin. I was hoping that you guys knew of any good twinfics with Harry's twin was the boy who lived. Even fanfics with harry having a brother (not twin) who was the BWL would be good.

Thanks!


** I was always a fan of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi]]. Unsung Heroes is good too, though the ending + sequel was below expectations.

Of course, the best Harry Potter fanfiction ever written on the boy-who-lived twin spinoff is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave]]. Major, major warnings! This story is super long and incredibly convoluted. Also slash, if you're against that.

*** I looked at the 80k word count and was like 'psh that's not super long at all' but then I realized it was a series and Jesus buttfucking Christ 3 Million words!?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die]] Dark!Harry. Best treatment i've seen of the downside to the dark arts. EDIT: can't forget [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent]]

** Definitely read the Sacrifice Arc that snowywish recommended. Even if you don't care for slash pairings, I swear to god it's the greatest fanfiction ever written.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is one of my favorites. Features Ravenclaw Harry and H/Hr. The author writes horcruxes really well.

*** I agree, but this is also one of the only fanfics that I apply the EWE to. It spun off into LaLa Land with the sequel, and was way below expectations.

**** It was a good, interesting (for its time--many of the tropes have since been copied ad nauseum) story for its time that sufferes from an ending (which sets up the sequel) that is arguably the worst in fanfiction. Especially for those of us following the story at the time, it was a major letdown, one that many readers couldn't forgive.

*** Descent ... don't care for the ending. I think it sorta went off the deep end. There is an abandoned sequel.
