** All the house elfs work around the limitation of needing a bond in Blue Steel, by Jeconais: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/]]

They make the wizards think they don't need the bond anymore and the wizards are left without elfs. Except in hogwarts, but they don't obey anyone but Harry.
