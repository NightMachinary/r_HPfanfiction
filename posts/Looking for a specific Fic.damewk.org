Okay, so I don't know too many of the details but I do remember that the inner circle was a very prestigious position and they were Voldemort's most trusted and could speak to him without fear. I also remember Harry was creating his own inner circle in a kind of mirror of what Voldemort did. I believe Harry was in Slytherin.
