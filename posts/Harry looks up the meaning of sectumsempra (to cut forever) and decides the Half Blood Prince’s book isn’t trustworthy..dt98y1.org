*** Why? It seems worse than a stunning charm in every way, since not hitting a vital area doesn't take out an opponent and still allows them to attack back, like James did after Snape cut his cheek, if Snape had used a stunning or disarming charm he would have won, not to mention that any enemy could be simply under the imperius and even those who arent are more useful alive, since they can be questioned.

And even if you want to kill the death eaters nothing stops you from slitting their throat after stunning them.

**** Stunning charms can easily be reversed, cutting off someone's limb is was more difficult to fix. Especially since Snape is the only one who knows the counter. Also, the screams of your comrades bleeding out are rather distracting.

Just do a Dooku on them. Without either hand, they won't be a threat. And worst case, just burn the wounds to close them.

****** If a bunch of racially motivated, fascist terrorists decide to attack a school, then that's not really a concern. I mean, if you get to interrogate them, fine. If they die, well, better them than the children or the defenders. You should not endanger your lives for those of the people coming to kill you.

Unless you work for an intelligence agency, but that does not apply to Harry nor anyone other than Dumbledore, who can easily 1v5 the Death Eaters either way and does not need to resort to Sectumsempra. And maybe Moody.

******* Or unless you place an inherent value on human life and appreciate that killing another human is an objectively regrettable act that should be mourned even when necessary. The Killing Curse is even better than Sectumsempra, by the values you used, and it's illegal because nonlethal measures are just as effective.

******** You are always allowed to retaliate using lethal force if your opponent is using it. Illegal would be a killing blow in return to a simple punch. Hell, if we were talking about an escalated bar brawl, I'd agree with you. But against an opponent not above needlessly attacking civilians, well, I only see one response.

[[https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/german-commandos-captured-american-uniform-1944/][Here's what the Allies did to people caught for just one of the war crimes Malfoy committed]]. And Malfoy is guilty of a lot more than those commandos. And no, coercion is not a valid excuse for war crimes, neither is being ordered to do so.

********* Allowed to? Maybe. Reasonable force is usually a thing, depending on your jurisdiction. If you have a perfectly nonlethal countermeasure that you DON'T use - which Harry and co. do 100% of the time - then you are, in fact, not allowed to resort to murder willy-nilly.

Oh, and Malfoy was, in fact, being coerced - Voldemort would have killed his dad had he not.

********** Coercion is not a valid defense for both, war crimes and crimes against life. Basically, what you were threatened to do must not be worse than what you did. Malfoy was threatened with the MURDER of his father and he tried to MURDER Dumbledore. Hence not a valid defence. And no one forced Malfoy to attack Rosmerta or Katie Bell. No one forced him to use the Imperius. That's entirely on him, not Voldemort. And those attacks were especially condemnable since he basically strapped a bomb vest to a civilian.

Also, stunners and the disarming spell are easily shielded. Which makes them stupid to use if your life is on the line. You want something that's difficult, if not impossible to defend against, since you have a good chance of snuffing it if you don't win. In that specific fight, Malfoy was trying to use the "I make you almost braindead" curse.

Except for the Killing curse that is true about all spells.

So they're still preferable to sectumsempra.

************ If you deflect a blasting curse into the ground next to you, that will end up rather badly for you. If you do the same with a stunner, nothing happens. And there are certainly a few other spells which are difficult to shield against.

Also, nothing wrong with lethal force. Molly Weasley does it in canon. And authorising the unforgivables against Death Eaters has precedent.

************* Shield dont always deflect sometimes they just negate the attack. And literally only the Killing Curse was mentioned to be difficult to shield against, for all the other spells it seems to be entirely dependent on the skill of the caster.

Sure lethal force isn't necessarily bad, but its certainly less than ideal when your opponent could be fighting against his will under the imperius. Like sure it would still be justified since your own life is in danger, but its really not much harder to incapacitate them non-lethaly.

***** Stunning charms still take you out during the battle though, like even if you use rennervate the person is still disoriented and in no state to fight.

Questioning someone after cutting them up results in very unreliable information, like they could easily go into shock or like with torture decide to tell you what they think you want to hear instead of the truth.
