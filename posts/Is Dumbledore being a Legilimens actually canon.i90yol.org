So this is basically a universally accepted fact, but was it actually confirmed at any point?

  “He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a suffi­ciently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I --- persuaded him --- to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.”

** We also know he used Legilimancy to get the deep buried memories of Morfin Gaunt and Hokey the house elf of Hepzibah Smith. Both this instances show he is a very powerful Legilinens.

And of course there are several times throughout the books (specially the early ones before we knew that Legelimancy existed) that Harry mentions Dumbledore's piercing blue gaze, that felt like and x ray.
