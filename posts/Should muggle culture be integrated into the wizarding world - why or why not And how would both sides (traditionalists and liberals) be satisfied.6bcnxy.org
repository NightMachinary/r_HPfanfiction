** OP, from your statement about "traditionalists and liberals", I feel like you may have a somewhat fanon idea of wizarding culture. So let us note a few things before proceeding:

- The children at Hogwarts are seen to have a dating culture which is pretty much identical to modern Muggle Britain.

- The vast majority of wizards wear Muggle clothes as casualwear. Robes are for school uniform, work, formal occasions, and old people.

- There are no signs of institutionalized discrimination against Muggleborns. From the reaction of people to the word "mudblood", from the fact that politicians and the media refer to Muggleborns using the politically correct terms, from the fact that wizards like Slughorn are embarrassed if they say something that accidentally sounds prejudiced, and from the fact that a Muggleborn Minister for Magic was elected, we can see that the treatment of Muggleborns in the wizarding world is supposed to be largely analogous to racism in the real world: very much still a societal problem, but not something that is accepted as politically correct or embraced by a large number of people. The idea that traditional Pure-bloods hold a disproportionate amount of political power or wealth is not supported by canon. The only rich Pure-blood family we know of is the Malfoy family, whose wealth derives from their past connections with Muggles. And there's no sign that political power is in any way hereditary in wizarding Britain.

- Where wizards like a Muggle invention, they already adopt a magical version of it: the Hogwarts Express for trains, Ministry cars for automobiles, wizarding cameras, the wizarding wireless, etc. But these things do not always take off: see the wizarding attempt at television.

- In some respects wizarding Britain takes a more Northern European approach than Muggle Britain to certain social issues. In particular, we see in PS and PoA that the Quidditch changing rooms, which have showers attached, are unisex. This is a rather more liberal approach than Muggle Britain.

So with all of this in mind, what aspects of Muggle culture do we think the wizarding world should be adopting?

*** Well, they wear muggle clothes in a way and combination that makes them stick out (even a drug addled hippy wouldn't believe his eyes at what they believe muggles wear IMHO!)

Isn't there? It might not be stated that there is, but: If all the power (politically and socially) and money is in the hands of the old guard of purebloods who consider muggle borns beneath themselves (Draco's parents are just the most prominent example!) and muggles to be utterly worthless trash that should either serve or be annihilated (!) then there is bias, even if people do their best not be caught showing the bias because it simply isn't polite to do so!

Yeah, inventions that are "old" - haven't seen computers, smartphones etc. in the wiz-world!

Liberal? I think there never were female changing rooms because females weren't playing quidditch mostly ("It's not propper for a lady to be seen doing THAT!") and when they started to play? Well, they had to put up with the boys (in the hopes that they will quit probably!)...they don't have feminism in their world, so it truly is equal there without having the pendulum swing the other way (like in RL, where it's now putting women on pedestals and making prejudice against men (women's quotas!) the norm...as if that's institutionalized discrimination - but it's just men, right?...Damned, sorry for going off on a rant here, but this topic always gets my blood boiling and I am in favour of fucking equality! Gender bias, no matter the gender it's aimed against, serves no one IMHO!)

Hm...maybe the aspects of recognizing muggle laws (so you want to drive a car? Get your license the normal way, no if you confund the instructor it's AZKABAN WEASLEY, you don't do that!) and bringing their school up to modern standards (an art and music program would not hurt either IMHO!)

*** Just to add on to this, the Wizarding World is a small, insular, xenophobic culture with an immense paranoia of Muggles. They are also the closest thing we have ever seen to a post scarcity society, and their economic system can only really function with their small numbers.

Combining the world's brings an economic crisis to the Muggle World, beyond everything we have seen, as well as a cultural crisis for the Wizarding World. Not to mention all of the horrified screaming on both sides about weapons of mass destruction, such as nukes, nerve agents, Basilisks, Nundus, Fiendfyre, and every other magical thing which may apply.

People may well try as hard as they could to wed magicals, in an attempt to secure powers for their children, leading to a massive rise in people who have not grown up in Wizarding Society, which is much better equipped to handle wizards, and the potential abuses of magic.

It also becomes incredibly interesting to see outrage on both sides, at how they treat citizens. Such outright discrimination would horrify Muggles, and Azkaban would be considered a major human rights violation(cough cough, muggle circlejerk authors, cough cough). On the other side of the fence, I could see wizards as horrified by any ideas of regulating magic, or else having it exclusively used for the government, as well as invasion of other countries to secure economic affairs.

Then if Muggles turn hostile, and try and control the Wizarding World, along with try to figure out magic to render wizards useless, then a wave of terrorism worse than anyone could imagine would surface. If a single wizard apparates to 10 cities in a day, and casts Fiendfyre on them all, unless wizards intervene, that could have a death toll in the millions. And if nuclear weapons get broken out, then wizards die by the scores, and then the Imperious curse comes out to play. Nuclear apocalypse incoming.

I think you give our society way too much credit. You can find all sorts of horrible bigotry and abuse today on google, but little of it is stopped. I seriously doubt the wizarding world's discrimination towards nonhumans would face all that much backlash from muggle governments. It would be so simple for wizards to paint other species as naturally hostile and untrustworthy. As for discrimination towards muggleborns, that's easily denied as a fringe philosophy similar to nazism today. The Ministry just puts a friendly Weasley up on stage to show how appreciative purebloods are of muggleborns. Even if muggles knew, do you think people wouldn't turn a blind eye for all the possible benefits of magic?

I also feel like a lot of the institutional sort of bigotry takes place farther away from areas which do not tolerate such things. The wizarding world, smack dab in europe, would be close enough for normal people to care, especially seeing that they are the ones being discriminated against. But yeah, there will certainly be those willing to overlook such flaws, and more likely than not, they will be the ones with a significant amount of influence on politics.

***** You're not going to get the one without the other, in my opinion. The less distinct wizarding society is from muggle society, the less incentive a wizard has to not be a part of muggle society. Especially considering that even the worst wizard would thrive in muggle society because of what they can do with magic. Part of what keeps a wizard from 'crossing over' (aside from the legal ramifications of breaking the statute of secrecy) is the peer pressure of the insular society to stay within it. Yes, it causes it's own set of problems within the wizard society to have it be so isolated, but in doing so it makes leaving society almost impossible, which protects the rest of the world from the ramifications of the statute of secrecy from being broken.

** Yes, absolutally. Why? There are a lot of reasons, but my favorite one is this: if, by action, you can help someone, you should as your inaction is harming them. There is so much good that wizards could do for the world (and that muggles could do for them, but more on that later). Diseases could be cured easily. The energy crisis could be solved. We could finally begin to really explore our solar system and even go beyond that to the rest of the galaxy. In short, I believe that integration would be a moral imperative for the wizards and that it would be morally wrong for them to withhold help.

Space exploration is probably my favorite, and magic could do so much. Magic could easily replicate the effects of element zero from mass effect; that is, to reduce an objects mass to a near zero quantity. Once you can do that, you can easily accelerate to near reletivistic speeds for very little energy investment. Then you can cast cushioning charms and such to act as inertial dampeners so you don't go splat. And, of course, once you get there you can use magic to construct Star Gate like objects. Then there is asteroid mining and all kinds of other cool stuff you can do. This would also mean an economic collapse isn't inevitable, as with near unlimited space and resources there would be an unlimited demand for labor, skilled and unskilled, so that everyone would be put to work.

Then of course, there is the medical side. Magic seems to make curing things like Type 1 Diabetes trivial, as you could reactivate insulin production easily enough or create an artificial spleen. Organ grafts and regrowth can be done as well. Very few diseases would not have magical cures, and wizards would add to the lifespan of nearly everyone.

Climate change is a real concern, but with magic you can get rid of nearly all excess carbon production and replace it with clean energy. You can also cast spells to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere. Species going extinct would no longer be a concern as you could use magic to recreate lost habitat or possibly even breeding partners through transfiguration. Trash could be easily vanished and toxic waste transfigured or vanished as well.

Of course, what would wizards get out of this? Well, with only a little marketing, they get fantastic wealth and privilege with only a little inconvenience (also known as having a job). Even truly mediocre wizards like Lockhart would be highly in demand. Someone who can modify memories would be needed by security firms or intelligence agents, or even just people who would pay to have a painful memory removed as a part of therapy. Moderately gifted wizards would have near limitless employment options, and since they would be so in demand they would command a very high price. Overall their lives would be better, and they would make everyone elses lives vastly improved as well. There really is no reason to keep magic hidden: let it serve the people, and it will be seen as a gift not a curse.

You seem to be putting a lot of moral weight onto the idea of proximity. What moral justification is there for only being good when it is convenient to you? The homeless person next to you is just as deserving as the one 100 miles away. And in any case, there are plenty of people in desperate need within convenient distance that you or I are not helping at all.

Even taking into account the need for rest and relaxation, that still leaves a huge amount of time (and resources) that should be spent helping others according to your proposal. I hope you don't have a savings account: any money that you're keeping to yourself rather than giving to the needy is evil.

The fact of the matter is that Muggles do not need magical solutions to most of our problems. Many problems are within our power to solve if we wished to do so. There's no moral difference between magical failure to act and Muggle failure to act. But do we think every single Muggle in the world is evil? No, because our accepted moral system is that helping others is laudable but not required. A person is entitled to keep the fruits of their labour to themselves.

There absolutely is a difference. To those whom much is given, much is required, or to put it in Uncle Ben's words, with great power comes great responsibility. The average person has comparatively little they can do to improve the state of the world, but still has an imperative to do what they can. The average wizard, on the other hand, would have the power to make drastic changes that could greatly improve the course of human history. Compare what people like Bill Gates or even our own JKR have done with their wealth to improve the world to what someone like you or I could do. We're both called to action, but the action we can take is different.

That is not what I said. I didn't say people should become helpless: I made allowance for a person to put their own interests first up to the point of achieving an adequate quality of life for themselves. But the vast majority of people in the West are far and beyond above this point. Anyone who earns more than, say, $15,000/year per member of their household has reached the point of self-sufficiency.

The fact is that, if inaction in helping others after achieving self-sufficiency for yourself is wrong, then the vast majority of Westerners are evil.

Furthermore, I think you're dodging my point about convenience. Moral imperatives are absolute: if you have to help others with any excess time and resources you have in order to be good, then it is not sufficient to merely do a bit of it but to keep most of the excess to yourself.

In which case wizards are under no obligation to help Muggles. Solving Muggle societal problems would be a full-time occupation for wizarding society, so they're under no obligation to devote their entire lives to helping Muggles. Especially when there are plenty of needy wizards who are in greater proximity to other wizards.

Why do you think that legal ownership has any impact on whether or not withholding resources is immoral? If there's a poisoned wizard on the streets and you own a bezoar but refuse to hand it over, I'm not only going to think you're evil, I'd probably feel morally obligated to take it from you by force. A man is dying, I don't care one little bit about your earthly possessions, illegality of theft or culture/economics.

I think the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_dilemma][Heinz Dilemma]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development][Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] are relevant to this debate:

If you can frame an argument around Stages five or six why it isn't bad to just sit on their money I might be interested to hear it. Your current reasoning seems to be stuck around Stage 3-4, which aren't really interesting to me.

... and yeah, if you sit on a wealth of money, that you personally will never need and your next ten generations of ancestors will never need, you're a bad person if you don't use it for something good. Zero doubt about it in my mind. In fact I'd probably applaud anyone who takes it from you in order to do something helpful/good with it. Anyone who pays income taxes or lives in a country with a wealth tax or lives in a country with some form of socialized medicine is familiar with the concept... and most people seem to believe that at least some of these things are moral imperatives (taking from the individual for the good of the community... I mean, some people still believe in full-on totalitarian socialism, it's not an absurd notion).

** I don't think that anyone would end up satisfied. Both sides have something that the other doesn't; one has magic and the other has technology. But the two are /not/ comparable. Most notably, wizards have access to things that Muggles could only dream of having (or things that are thus far imperfect) -- mind-wiping techniques, truth-telling potions, electronic disruption fields, invisibility, instant cure-alls, longer lifespans, and so on.

I'm not an optimist, so there are several scenarios I think could play out instead of holding hands and singing around a campfire:

- Muggles would try to use, enslave, and/or weaponize magic and wizards for their own ends.
- Wizards would try to rule over Muggles or ...
- Wizards would become part of the upper tier of Muggle society that already does the ruling.
- One group tries to wipe out the other due to societal incompatibilities and/or fear.
- A world war due to the scenarios above.

It'd also throw the scientific community into a tizzy, not only because current principles, models, and laws would be upended but because it'd also open up a new and exciting field of study. And let's not even get started on what it might do to religion -- it would have been a piece of cake for witches and wizards to fake being gods or the mouthpieces of gods centuries ago. And god, so many other things would be completely ...

... ah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that most people would be fucked in the power struggles that'd emerge, but it'd at least be interesting.
