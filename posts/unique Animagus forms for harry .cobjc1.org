  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** I feel like I've seen mostly snakes, ravens, and SO MANY peregrine falcons?? for some reason?? plus the occasional lion.

Personally, none of those seem right to me (for canon Harry, anyways). Okay, Harry's kind of a stereotypical Gryffindor sometimes, but a straight-up lion seems like a bit much, or at least not particularly creative.

I think the argument for birds is that Harry...likes flying? But James also liked flying, and he's a freaking deer, so that's not my favorite argument. I think an animagus form should be representative of your core personality, not one thing you like to do. Which is more fanon than canon, but it's fanon I really like, so I'm sticking by it.

And Harry might once have been sorted into Slytherin, but I don't think he's really very...snake-ish.

I mean, I don't have any better ideas. But surely they exist. Please, someone, have a better idea!

**** *Pronghorn*

The pronghorn (UK: , US: ) (Antilocapra americana) is a species of artiodactyl mammal indigenous to interior western and central North America. Though not an antelope, it is often known colloquially in North America as the American antelope, prong buck, pronghorn antelope, prairie antelope, or simply antelope because it closely resembles the true antelopes of the Old World and fills a similar ecological niche due to parallel evolution.It is the only surviving member of the family Antilocapridae. During the Pleistocene epoch, about 12 antilocaprid species existed in North America. Three other genera (Capromeryx, Stockoceros and Tetrameryx) existed when humans entered North America but are now extinct.
