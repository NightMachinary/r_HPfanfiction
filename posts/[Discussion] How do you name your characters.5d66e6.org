Do you simply pick random names, or put a bit more etymology into it? Do you pick one name and one surname, or add middle names too?\\
What's your favorite? And why


** Mostly random. I might know what letter or sound I want it to start with, then I just browse [[http://www.behindthename.com/][behindthename]] until I find one that I think fits. I almost never have middle names because it never comes up in fic. Only times I've bothered with them are when characters have babies and are picking the names; that kind of situation, you have to broach the topic.

As for a favourite, probably Gareth Stuart Martin, who is the one middle name exception to the baby thing and I'm disappointed I never found chance to mention his full name in fic, because it meant there was never chance for anyone to get the joke, especially as he's an over-powered OC with a mysterious past.

** I usually try to make it fit in with the rest of the family naming pattern if one is established. For example, I've given Astoria and Daphne an older brother named Jason Greengrass. Jason is a Greek hero which I thought fit with Daphne's name. I'll also check what baby names were popular in the birth year for the characters I'm writing to give ideas when adding things like siblings or parents to characters. I rarely give a middle name to a character.

My favorite is Nephele Rosier. I got her name from a random Harry Potter name generator and thought it was perfect for a pure blood witch.

** I go the Dickensian route.

My favourite is probably 'Constance Goodword,' an OC I made to replace Rita Skeeter with someone kinder.

** I often base them on real people and use translations of their name or names that mean the same thing

** A bit of a mixture. Sometimes I'll hear or see a name I really love (like Rowling, I like walking round old graveyards) and I will create a character around that name. Sometimes I look up meanings or play around with similar names until I hit one that feels right. My biggest OC, Theia Higglesworth, was named for the ancient planet that supposedly collided with earth and created the moon. I felt like her name risked being too ethereal so I grounded it with a mildly silly sounding British surname - a combination of Higsworth and Biggles.

** Not related (maybe) but I've seen *way* too many Lilith Moon characters out there.

*** I believe that was one of the names that appeared or was crossed off one of Rowlings lists for the 40 students in Harry's year. "Moon" does appear in the sorting in PS IIRC.

*** I know right! I don't even know where they came from, actually. But it's been spawning like mad.
