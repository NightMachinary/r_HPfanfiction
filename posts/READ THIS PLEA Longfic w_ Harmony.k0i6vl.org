I know, I know. People here don't really like Harmony. I do!

I'm looking for a loooong fic with Harmony that has a few things:

1. Possessive Hermione
2. Fluffy Harry
3. Househusband Harry (Cooking, cleaning)
4. Very brave Harry
5. Hermione is NOT supersmart
6. Parody

Anyways, if it has at least 2 of the previous, I'm happy. Particularly if it has Possessive Hermione, I'd like dat. I've read:

  Hermione loves her books. Hermione loves her Harry. Get between Hermione and either at your own peril. Series of connected one-shots.

It's nice. However, I want something a bit less ridiculous, and some more Dark!Hermione. Please, there has to be something like this out there...

Thanks!

** I don't think I dislike Harmony per se, just that many of its stories are riddled with the worst stereotypes and the most obnoxious tropes. You can take a look at [[/r/HPHarmony]] subreddit.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr
