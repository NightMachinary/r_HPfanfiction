Now I know this varies a /lot/.

But the reason I'm making this post is because in quite a few of the fics that I've read have his Patronus/Animagus Form be a Black Panther.

And I just want to know if anyone here can tell me /why/ it's a panther. I've never been able to figure out what traits that Harry exclusive to the fic and a Panther have in common.

Help? Please?


** Let's see, turning into an animal is cool, and also it's a connection to Harry's parents, the Maraudersâ„¢. But this is a badass Harry (because aren't they all?), so he has to turn into something that's good for combat. Something to strike fear into your heart.

No, maybe something even more combat-focused? Something with a track record that will bode well for Harry winning the war.

Not quite, I'm thinking this Harry will be more of a stealth murdery type, so we want his Animagus to be more "things that go bump in the night".

Ah, fuck it. Panther it is.

** What bothers me the most about it is that none of them seem to realize that a black panther isn't a unique breed; it's any breed of large cat (jaguar, leopard, etc) with a melanistic color variant.

** I liked the form taken in a fic in which he was a wee little sparrow and everybody made fun of him. Damn, I gotta find that one again, but I know it was some Lord Potter bullshittery, hence I don't have it saved.

*** I used to be a part of a Harry Potter RPG. I didn't play Harry (he didn't exist in the RPG timeline), but I did play a supposedly "buff" character, a Beater on the Ravenclaw Quidditch Team, who had a [[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGhlY03aR0U/maxresdefault.jpg][wood thrush]] as a Patronus.

** u/mistermisstep:
#+begin_quote
  Harry has black hair. Black panthers are black. Therefore, Harry should transform into a panther, which is much cooler than a deer wearing a hat rack.
#+end_quote

Or, at least, that's how I imagine the rationale for it. Sorry, I can't handle it when he has an Animagus form that's "totally awesome" instead of "totally Harry." It makes me laugh. Sometimes, I'm surprised that no one's given him flame decals on the side of his fur coat.

Oh, sorry, I meant /rune tattoos/ in a flame design.

** I've never read a fanfic where Harry was a panther animagus. I guess we might be focusing on different sections of the HP fanfic multiverse? I usually avoid fics in which the writer tries to take the coolness/edginess factor up to 11.

The most common forms I've seen are a raven or various species of snake.

Just to name a few Harry animagus forms I've seen:

- Ghost ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]])
- Raven ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]])
- Bat ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]])
- Griffin ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]])

** I've never come across that one, but I've seen more than one where it was a mongoose.

Panthers are pretty cool though, so maybe it's just that. Is there any shared trait between said fics, or are they completely different types of Harry to begin with?
