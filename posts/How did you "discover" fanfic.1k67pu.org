I don't remember the first fanfic I ever read, though I was writing them long before I knew what they were called. I had only been reading fanfic on mugglenet's website for a few months when I accidentally discovered FF.net because the author of the fic I was reading linked to it.

When I realized there were about half a million HP fics alone, I remember feeling like I won the lottery.


** I'd seen "Methods of Rationality" linked by several bloggers I read in the span of a few months. I'd normally have dismissed it even so, but I'd heard of the author before in the context of AI ethics debates - the incongruity made me curious and I looked it up. From there, branched out from one author to another using their own "Favourite Stories/Authors" tabs on FF.net until my preconceptions about the field had largely faded and I went looking for more on my own.

**** Virtually identical story for me as well. Read /Methods/ then also read /Time Braid/ by Shaperv (a Naruto fic) on FFN and got dragged kicking and screaming into that fandom and sub-genre of stories.

Find a story by someone you like, read it, finish it and choke back a tear because you can't read any more, check that author's other stories, check their favorites tab and scan all *those* authors' stories, find one of those you like then rinse and repeat.

Do not, whatever you do, look at bare FFN results in browse mode. The goggles, they do /nothing/.

** I'd read aloud all the books that had come out to my son and while waiting for the next, I wondered whether anyone had thought of writing their own completion of the series. After a bit of googling, I stumbled onto this notion of "fanfiction" and then Melindaleo's stories over on Phoenixsong. Things took off from there.

** I was googling for anything Draco related and came across CC's Draco Trilogy. From there I explored Fictionalley Park, and eventually branched out to other sites as I found them.

** I think it was during my senior year of highschool because of a Cracked article on fanfic pairings. I started reading the Hogwarts/the Giant Squid one, but it has developed into an obsession for reading...totally normal stories...that have Harry/Voldemort ;)

** I had always been one of those people who thought that the people who read and write fanfic were weird and I wanted nothing to do with it. If it wasn't in the book, I didn't want to read it. About two years ago, I was searching for a topic to write my senior thesis on while at Dragon*Con. I told someone I had just met of my problem and she suggested I do my thesis on fan fiction. Four months later I started researching fan fiction and a month after that I started reading HP and OUaT fanfics. I have been reading fanfic for over a year now and even posted a few of my own.

** Following HP tumblrs, one started linking Dramione, but I thought it might be a part of the book I forgot (I have a terrible memory about books!), so I started googling it and found dramione.org.

My life has never been the same.

** I feel so old answering this, which is RIDICULOUS because I'm only 26...

... But I found Sailor Moon fanfiction in 6th grade. I've been happily reading recommended fics (even for source material I've never watched/read) ever since.

I once wrote a short Sailor Moon/Ranma 1/2 fanfic without having watched Ranma 1/2. I was praised for my accurate portrayals of Ranma characters. Caused me quite the giggle-fit.

** I think it started after reading OoTP. I was craving more HP and couldn't get it from re-reading the original. I was reading loads of weird theories of veritaserum.com and by chance encountered the 'fanfiction' section where people would write their own take on book 6/7. So that helped until Book 6 came along.

After HBP I was reading some weird theories (Dumbledore didn't die, etc) and then I encountered HP and the seventh horcrux. I got sucked into it as though it was an original by JK herself and never looked back after that. I started reading loads of Trio fics and only recently stumbled upon FF.net

*** I actually started with Kim Possible fanfiction about seven years ago after seeing some adorable pictures based on certain stories. From there, I occasionally branched out into other categories.

I got my start in the HP fandom after I was watching one of the movies, and just had the stray thought, "I wonder what Harry/Luna would be like."

The rest is history.

Edit: That wasn't supposed to be a replay, but apparently I'm bad at Reddit.

** My first ever fic was [[http://www.debbiesfics.com/darkness00.html][Draco in Darkness]] by Plumeria and subsequently every fic on her site, to which I've linked. I cannot for the life of me remember how I stumbled upon it, as it's been 8-10 years now. It was probably the result of googling everything Harry Potter I could while waiting for whichever the next book was to come out.

** After my third or fourth time reading the series, I had lots of questions/opinions and wanted to discuss them with people. So I did a google search for some of my questions and up popped a few links to fanfiction stories.

My first fanfic was [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127020][The Hogs Head]] on SIYE. Canon Compliant H/G, Ginny's seventh year and Harry's first year out of school and free of Voldemort.

** I actually saw a fanmix posted on tumblr. "Alone With You: A Draco and Hermione Fanmix". I was high and it made me cry. So then I tried some creative googling and found Isolation. That was like 8pm on a Sunday. 8am Monday I had finished Isolation, Heavy Lies The Crown, We Learned the Sea and The Fallout. That was August of last year. I then went in to work exhausted. My coworker asked what was up and I find out she's a Dramione shipper too. I obviously love going to work with her, and have lasted at this job this long.
