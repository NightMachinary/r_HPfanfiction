I write Snape centric fics and enjoy reading them too, but notice different interpretations from different writers about why he is the way he is. Obviously there's some PTSD in the mix, and a lot of disaffection... But would he be "cured" if only he could apologise and find true love?

I tend to think that he's actually 'wired up' a certain way that dictated some of his life choices, more chicken than egg, so to speak, and that he'd be a difficult character irrespective of the damaging events in his life.

But the very popular Snape stories (smut notwithstanding, lol) have him redeemed and saved and his personality reversed as a result.

I love happy endings, but I can't help thinking that Snape would never be a cruisey guy, however patient the gal (or guy. Even Harry). How've I got this wrong?

Sorry if this has been done before! I didn't check previous threads... Please let me know if I missed a similar discussion.

Thanks!


** What's a 'cruisey guy'?

Also, psychologically, it's generally a mixture of both. Bit of nature, bit of nurture. Good nurture can affect bad nature and good nature can be affected by bad nurture, in basic terms. I don't know if Snape is 'wired up' to be difficult, but it wouldn't necessarily determine his life if he was.

I think the arguments generally fixate on the whole 'you're just like Voldemort, Harry, only you made the Right choices' and 'everybody should have a chance for redemption' theme of the series. Hence why War Criminal Draco gets off scott-free, why Albus Severus got his name, why Voldemort was offered a chance to repent as he died, Ron and Hermione were both forgiven for their intermittent 'terrible teenage person' syndrome, etc.

There's also a lot of that "You can get through anything if someone loves you" belief in some parts of the fandom, it seems. Which has always baffled me, so I can't really explain that one. Love can be just as toxic as hate sometimes, and it's definitely not a cure-all.

Probably a lot of Draco in Leather Pants cliche-ing in there too. "Oh, he's such a bad person who's had such a bad life, I can fix him with my love!" type crap. Credit to Alan Rickman for making a canonically bitter, bullying twat seem redeemable, I guess.

*** Was with you up until Alan Rickman. I'm old enough (though barely) to remember the books before the movies came out, and I remember my mom and I having discussions about whether Snape was good or bad even back then. Snape isn't an interesting character because he's handsome or Alan Rickman-like, for he is neither. He's an interesting character because he does some real asshole things and some real good things, and its not clear which should be given more weight

**** I didn't mean it like that - I was more listing possibilities than what I actually believe (mainly because what I believe about HP characters and canon tends to change based on what story I'm reading and how well it lays the foundation with things like this).

That particular possibility was referring more to the idea that Alan Rickman hyped up the good-bad distinction of Snape's character more than the books did. I admit, I haven't read the books since the week leading up to when the last one came out, but from what I remember and have read in the intermittent discussions of this topic on this sub, Snape was indeed way more of a bullying twat in the books than the movies and seemed to take a lot more pleasure in making people around him as miserable as he was. Rickman's performance, not Rickman himself, made Snape seem a lot more redeemable and a lot less vindictive, if I'm recalling correctly. I could be wrong - again, it has been years - but that's the current understanding of that argument that I'm operating under.

***** The books have enough to cause some of the same kind of discussions. However, Snape does far more "mundane cruel" things in the books. As in, in terms of "truly evil" actions or whatever you'd call what he did as a Death Eater, they're about the same. However, he was a far more cruel teacher in the books.

The movies does not portray him being a blatant bully to Neville -- unpleasant yes, but not things like threatening to poison his toad, saying how terrible of a student he is to Lupin, etc (then again, he remains Neville's boggart in the movies), and the "I see no difference" line does not exist in the movies. Also, movie Snape is clearly trying to protect the students from Lupin near the end of PoA, which is especially notable with what we know of his past with a transformed Lupin. In the books, he is instead unreasonably set on capturing Sirius, even after it's clear that he's innocent.

This isn't strictly a result of Rickman, though (unless he's the reason they changed the scenes this way).

****** True, there was definitely some rewriting (and I don't know if that was due to Rickman), but I'd say a lot of the tone of what was there changed due to his portrayal. Where the book would indicate Snape was doing something in a bitterly wanker-ey fashion, the movies tended to take a more softer 'Always...' sort of tone to things.

Though I admit, I haven't read the books since the week the last one came out (the one and only time I read the whole series) and I haven't seen the movies since a little after the last one came out either, so I'm really not one to claim absolutes in canon. :D

******* While I'm not 100% on it, I always figured that the discrepancy was a result of JKR only developing Snape's backstory partway through the series. As a result, the movies (or at least more of the movies than books) has the benefit of hindsight, and can thus make use of it to make the transistion from "caricature evil teacher" to the (anti)hero they later wanted to portray far less jarring.

Compare Snape's portrayal between books and movies starting from around 5th year (the year that introduced Snape's Worst Memory and thus likely had a somewhat, if not fully, developed backstory for him even if we didn't get to see it to its full extent at that point). They're not nearly as different as earlier books/movies are. His book portrayal is still worse (we clearly see him witness Harry's home life and yet do nothing about it in the books), but not nearly as much as earlier years.

******** I mean, probably. I'd be interested to find out, but I think your answer is probably one of the closest to the truth. I don't remember enough of either books or movies to remember if they got more similar over time or not, though. If you mixed in a bit about there being different directors and Rowling basically making up everything as she goes along to fit the plot and I think your answer would be right. :D

Every actor does put a bit of their individual tone to a role though, so I expect someone else being cast as Snape would've lead to at least a little different portrayal than we got.

** I generally see Snape as having some not bad, but, let's say, unpopular character traits that he never got any real opportunity or motivation to improve and work on. He's a closed no-nonsense studious person who is snarky and lacks time and tolerance for ‘fun' and ‘jokes'. Now, in a healthy home with a loving family, with good friends (Lily aside or maybe if they were in the same House) who were not DE's in training, Snape might have turned more ‘likable'. But he didn't have any of those. He grew up in poverty; was abused by his family; was a poor, ugly kid in school where he became separated from his only friend; fell in with a wrong company; lost his only friend due to a thoughtless slip; fell in with even /worse/ company; became a reason for the death of the woman he loved; was forced to spend all his foreseeable future reminded of his mistakes doing a job he hated. All of this certainly doesn't spell personal growth. Thus his initial unpleasantness just progressed further and further. So, I say it was nature that got worse by nurture.

As far as fanfiction goes I don't think Snape could be changed much personality-wise. A ‘redeemed' Snape still would be a snarky arse. He still would make uncalled for, harsh comments and be generally unpleasant. I could see him being more civil towards someone who earns his respect though. I also could see him toning it down with bullying of the students if someone talked some sense into him.

** He's a talented perfectionist who wants acknowledgment (like most of us do). He doesn't have the natural or studied charisma that Lily or Sirius do which made it difficult for him to receive acknowledgment, especially due to the politics of the time. This made him somewhat bitter, especially as the person he considered to be his most hated rival was the 'hero' of their story. His rivalry caused him to lose sight of his potential as a teenager, and he sacrificed what was left of his potential for the 'greater good'. By that I mean he could have been a great potioneer or spell inventor (?), but instead he was caught up in politics by age 15. Instead of having a great career and leaving a potion legacy (like Damocles Belby did), Snape was stuck in a role he never wanted (a professor) and head of a House that carried a huge negative legacy.

** The part of him that I always found interesting is the part that is destroyed by those stories.

Snape as a character is about how /good and nice are different/.

Snape does good things. Incredible, difficult, heroic things. He is arguably one of the most morally righteous characters throughout the series.

He is also a deeply unpleasant human being.

That is why he is compelling. "Jerk with a heart of gold" stories usually suck, (unless they're more snarky than actually an unpleasant person) because the heart of gold always feels tacked on. Nothing about giving money to orphanages is related to you yelling at your secretary.

With Snape, the reason he's unpleasant are the same as his reasons for being heroic. The heroism is inseperable from the unpleasantness.

It's why he's polarizing, it's why he's memorable and why he's dynamic in a way that Dumbledore or Sirius aren't. He's a contrast that refuses to resolve neatly.

** I think it's pretty obvious that his upbringing had a heavy impact on Snape - his childhood was not a happy one, outside of the presence of Lily. That would definitely have a major impact.

His personality is stand-offish, it's rude, it's often mean - but at the same time, the extreme to which it's taken in his actions reads as, to me, a function of his own self-blame. A way to cope with the mistakes of the past.

It's not entirely that, of course. But the way that his actions seem to come straight out of that troubled childhood situation, and to me that indicates that it's 100% made.

As for starting closer to the start of the series, my feeling is that a redeemed Snape would still be a sarcastic asshole - it's not going to flip overnight. But at the same time, he'd 100% be 'curable'. Not through true love, but by dealing with the root of his own issues - still being fixated on Lily, blaming himself, etc. Whatever happens to jolt him out of it, it needs to do that.

Since it is the Harry Potter series, Harry's presence could make for such a changing point - for instance, Snape being sent to the Dursleys to check up on Harry prior to 2nd year, or to give him his letter, seems like it would definitely refocus the man - and give him a different view of how Harry grew up. I could see his guilt over Lily becoming less powerful if he, say, continually saved her son even more than in canon, and not just for the sake of being /her/ child.

So - perfect, no. "Fixed" - yes. 'Wired up' one singular way - NO.

** I think I agree. What canon Snape wants above all else is power and recognition and that's mostly independent of Lily, the Marauders, and Slytherin house, and Voldemort. And I think his personality in combination with his wants, regardless of the circumstances, lend themselves more to tragedy than redemption.

So, yeah, I agree.

** Redemption and change are possible, but shouldn't mean a personality transplant. He's not going to be a fluffy bunny ever. And "nice" does not equal "good" - doing good things can mean people still get hurt . perhaps even unintentionally.

Also, IMO Snape in canon is mostly nurture/consequences of his actions and choices.

** (Long ramble) So before I start can i just say Alan Rickman played Snape far better than he was written. Well i said it whether there was permission or not because If there's one thing to say that's it base your interpretation of snape off him imo

So Snape though imo written pretty badly( and no that doesn't mean i don't love the Harry potter series just that i see bad writing), is a very complex character. A brief break down of

○Halfblood. With an abusive muggle father

○Had cruel tendencies because of that

○Loved Lilly

○Hated james, sirius, remus,peter

○The Death eaters in training took him in despite him being half blood

○Ruined his relationship with lily his one anchor in the "light" side

○Became a death eater

○Did some very bad things

○Told lv the prophecy not knowing it affected lilly

○Felt remorse over the one person he realized he cared for

○Realized the death eaters, lv didn't care about him just what he could do

○Became a spy

○Years passed harry comes to school

○Couldn't get passed how much harry on the outside looked and acted like James

○Got his rage on against harry all school years

○Year 1 Helped stop quirrelmort multiple times

○Year 2 wasn't really a character besides wanting to show harry up

○Year 3 couldn't get past his childhood hatred to listen

○Year 4 at the end became a spy again

○Year 5-7 Continued being a spy and helping the order and harry out while being his old rude self

It's a lot to take in when you think about it all what we got from J.K was Snape was an asshole for 99% of the series minus 2 scenes where he wasn't.

But when you really think about Snape he was a very conflicted person that had his demons, could hold a grudge, was an asshole at times but ultimately helped the good side because he realized Lilly was the only person in his life that really ever cared about him and he could never get her back but he could fight for her memory

It's very hard for us as people to understand people can be flawed we tend to view people as either good or bad and it's very hard not to write a character like that.

people like changing Snape to be all happy go lucky and is nice to harry because that's the way they process people. they can't see or can't see how to write a deeply flawed character. and instead make Snape the mini Dumbledore or they go the opposite way and make him completely evil ..... it's not just snape it's every character just about That's the easiest way to write people, it's why there's so many harry does absolutely nothing wrong stories out there.

So to your question i don't think Snape needs to be "fixed" he was who he was. Wrote badly by j.k. but still a deep character.

*** Very true, and even though JK claimed him as her most complex character, it really took Rickman's skill to bring that out. I find Snape's character in the books, particularly the early ones, quite caricaturish, which is appropriate for littler kids and we all know that was intentional, but it makes the transition to his later version a little harder to justify, which morphs into a slightly Byronic, almost romantic version of him. So I 100% agree - when I write his character I imagine Rickman, usually POA.

** Go back to Snape's childhood, you could easily redeem him. Sort him and Lily both into Ravenclaw - he'd have Lily's constant support all day, his rivalries with the Mauraders wouldn't have that Gryffindor/Slytherin animosity, plus teachers are more likely to interfere when it's a Ravenclaw being bullied (four against one, and Lupin a prefect?). Let's be honest, if a Slytherin sent a Gryffindor into a werewolf's den, we'd view that like Malfoy cursing Katie Bell or poisoning Ron, not like a prank gone wrong.

You could even redeem him at that infamous "mudblood" scene - have him realize the true horror of his actions and try to become a better person, instead of wallowing in despair and joining the Death Eaters.

Once Harry gets to Hogwarts, though, even the kindest interpretation has Snape as a person who thinks "staying undercover as a Death Eater spy" and "traumatizing children so badly you literally become their boggart" is the same thing. At that point he's committing more sins (ethical, not religious) he needs to atone for, and steadily growing more irredeemable. If his abrasive persona really was essential, Dumbledore should have given him another job without regular contact with children. Brewing potions for Pomphrey, secretary at the Chief Warlock's office, heck, make Deputy Headmaster a job independent of teaching and let Minerva have more time for her students.

I'm a sucker for a well done Snape redemption story and I'm simultaneously a sucker for a well done revenge on Snape story, because there's material in canon to support both and material in canon to deny both.

** I like reading Snape-centric fics because I always liked the idea of a person with a thoroughly shitty life in terms of basically everything, somehow manages to turn things around and find happiness in the end -- whether it be with a love interest (my favorite of the kind being LESS), or a fulfilling life in general, work and all. I fully realize that (at least after his schooling), such a scenario is very unlikely.

** I think Snape the Death Eater was made and maybe also his general attitude, but to me one of the defining features of Snape is "always" and I think that was born. This is why I think it's a bit weird where Snape dates, sleeps with or even romances other character/s.

I have an idea for a fic which might... were it ever written... see Snape not be defined by "always", but it involves muggle therapy (Q: why muggle? A: Dumbledore).

I don't think there's too much you can do to stop a rude 30 something from becoming a rude 40 something. Maybe you can make him less cruel but I think most of it's ingrained by the time Harry's 11.

The other option is just to embrace Harry's motive driven (but simplistic) morality in which case Snape is completely redeemed in canon (hence, Albus Severus). Basically, if the motive is nominally good (e.g. love), the character is good whatever they've done (even if most readers will rightly think Snape's love is more an obsession and is very unhealthy). I guess it's possible Harry feels more indebted, but I think this quite radical moral positioning makes more sense with old Expelliarmus Potter.

*** Good points. I think it would have to take a very ingrained personality disorder at 40-something to remain celibate over an unrequited teenage love and harbour deep resentments over the son of a (perceived) bully. I prefer to think, given his implied intelligence and ability to recognise/own his mistakes, he could overcome some of that historical damage. But I don't think he'd ever be an easy-going, lovable type. There'd be scars.

** I personally feel that while a person may be born with a " base of a personality" most of who they are is made, not born. We are products of our environments and lessons we begin learning even before we can talk. Snape may have always leaned towards rude and cutting, but I will never say that a person is born an asshole.

Snape was born to a witch that abandoned the magical world for an abusive man that didn't even love her for it. Her magical family and therefore Severuses disowned them for it. His father was abusive, his mother never did anything to stop it despite having the power and ability to make things better if she ever wished. He grew up in the poor side of a poor mill town. He only had one true friend and was separated from her almost immediately once they got to Hogwarts and then surrounded by people that encouraged his hate for his father and people like him. He was passed over for more attractive and popular people by authority figures and only really found the recognition and approval he sought in the things he was good at, dark magic and potions. Even then the approval came from those same people pulling him away from his best friends.

Even before his worst memory the environment that Snape lived in conspired to help turn him into what he was. Getting over Lily and finding someone to love wouldn't change all of that. It wouldn't change who he had become. But of he dealt with those issues, if he had a reason to force himself to deal with those issues. He could change. Snape wasn't born like he was in the books, he is not fated to be an uncompromising jerk.
