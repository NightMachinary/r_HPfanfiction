Hiya people, lately I really got into fanfictions about Harry and the Weasley's reading the books. I found a lot about the first book and some on the deathly hallows but the one I'm really searching is the half-blood prince. You see I'm an avid Hinny fan, (sure i sometimes ship Linny and Drarry my gayness can not stop me from feeling proud people, sometimes poly are fun too lgbtq+ is awesome). But Hinny is my OTP. So what do you suggest ? I honestly don't care if it's not finished just a couple of chapters is fine( not gonna lie probably will frustrate me but something is better than nothing). Thanks y'all.
