I've read a couple of Slytherin Harry fics including Leo inter Serpentes and I really want to read more. I would really appreciate some recommendations. I'm open to anything plot wise and I'm open to any pairings too! I'd prefer complete fics or ones with higher word counts.


** Shameless self-promotion, but...

linkao3(20049589)

It's 200k+, and it'll be complete either this weekend or next weekend. Planning it as the first part of a trilogy, though.

Super excited for the end of this fic! It's a great take on Dark Magic, love the world-building, and Blaise is absolutely hilarious!

"I didn't ASK him to punch me in the face!" I died. There are so many fantastic scenes in this fic. Thank you so much for writing it!

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** linkffn(9622538)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] is a time travel story. Though the premise is rather cliche and really stupid (years after Voldemort's death Harry finds out that his parents and Dumbledore are alive and that he even has a younger sister - yeah, right (that's sarcasm)), the story is otherwise well-written, quite original and has some interesting elements. Being eleven years old again, he gets sorted into Slytherin and... well, I don't want to give away too much here. But he does get sorted into Slytherin and that's what you asked for.

Unfortunately the story is abandoned some time into third year. But it's nonetheless a good read.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  Slytherin Trio. Deaf Harry. No ridiculous modification of beloved character behavior to turn them into evil monsters. Because fuck that shit.Ron is a Slytherin and he is perfect. Because for some reason Slytherin Harry fics tend to demonise Ron and I am not about that shit.

  I'd prefer complete fics or ones with higher word counts.

Well, there is always the Sacrifices series (over 3m words) linkffn(Saving Connor). WBWL, HP/DM slash, a very interesting magical system and a complete rewrite of the seven books

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** I read one on ffn called the list, it's 300,000 words and technically not complete(tho it ends in a good place). Harry basically gets some bad news and stuff happens that make him not get along with his housemates anymore, so he gets adopted by slytherin and starts wearing a green tie. Loved it.

  After her divorce, Hermione decides to get out of town to recover from the pain of her lost relationship and the miscarriage she suffered a year previously. She arrives in the Cotswolds depressed and aimless but compiles a list of things to do that she hopes will help her get back on her feet. In the midst of her journey to find healing she keeps running into Draco Malfoy, who is nothing like she remembered him. He invites her into his world, and Hermione finds exactly what she was looking for - in the place she least expected it.

  Four weeks before her wedding to Edward, Bella is frustrated. She knows there's little-to-no chance of getting him to bend his rules and boundaries now, but there's no harm in fantasizing about what could happen later. So she begins compiling a list...
