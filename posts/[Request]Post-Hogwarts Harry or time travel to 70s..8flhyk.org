I am looking for Post Hogwarts Harry with non-canon ships. Or an adult Harry sent back to 70s. The ones I've read and liked are: Contractual Invalidation, A Fine Spot for Trouble, Wind Shear. I was planning to read Delenda Est but everyone says it gets worst later chapter. Should I still give it a chance?


** While some dislike the second part of Delenda Est, I still like it a lot. The tone is a lot lighter than the first half, and there are more hilarious moments, for example â€˜Draco's redemption'.

For best post Hogwarts fic with non canon pairing, I nominate [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167).

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Delende Est gets pretty bad, but its worst spots are still better than Wind Sheer

*** I wouldn't say it becomes bad, more mediocre than anything.

Wind Shear just pissed me off though. Decent writing, great ideas, awful execution. So disappointing.

***** There was no tension because from the beginning you knew Harry was going to win, making this an aggressively mediocre fic.

It's a fun and easy read for sure, but the potential was there for it to be so much more, which is why so many were disappointed.

***** While I liked it, it didn't reach up to its potential. I liked the OP Harry. But he was OP even for Voldemort. So there wasn't any tension. And the ending felt rushed for me. Also I had started reading it for the Harry/Bella pairing and there wasn't that much interaction between them. Romantic or otherwise.

** Do they have to be Harry centric? I'm following two that are dramione, both incomplete but still quite good.
