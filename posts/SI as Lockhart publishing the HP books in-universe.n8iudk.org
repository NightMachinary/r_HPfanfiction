I read it on AO3 a few years ago, it was completed, maybe even a one-shot.

A self-insert wakes up as Lockhart and decides to write and publish the series in-universe. Once the deed is done, he starts getting threats from death eaters.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][Death of a Dark Lord, a True Story - by Gilderoy Lockhart]] . AO3 account required for reading.

  A past, more sensible, less frightened version of me might wonder what I was doing with a human leg, most of a human hand, thirty gallons of petrol and a crowbar.

  Luckily, all sensible people had long since left my house.
