I really enjoy reading about this trope, though i am at the moment reading a fic that will subvert it shortly as that is how it is written.

Wondering I'd i can find more of the actual regular trope itself since I am finding it quite fun to read about. Any suggestions welcomed!


** Oh man, old fic recommendation time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1502554/1/The-Seduction-of-Severus-Snape]]). I know, I know, the name is weird, the premise is weird, and it was written pre-DoH (possibly pre-HBP) so it's rather AU. The sequel is unfinished. But I laughed until I cried the first time I read it.

*** Currently reading Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin, another fic recommended here. But I've read several in the past with excellent pranks, usually featuring fred/george as minor side characters.

The debt of time also had some excellent pranks in it, a well written fic with hermione granger going back in time to marauders time, one of my favorite fics of all time tbh.

*** Thats actually the one that I'm reading! Im enjoying the way the author subverts his tropes, tho I am finding that there are a ton of verbal exposition dumps, and it's a little bit rushed to read, as well as some clumsy foreshadowing. But its a decent read - 5/10 for written skills as a writer and 8/10 for ideas and usage of plot devices and tropes and such.
