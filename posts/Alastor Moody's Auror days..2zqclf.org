** I'd also like to see something like this. It would make an interesting character study. I was disappointed to see him dispatched so casually in Deathly Hallows.

** This sounds like it would be really interesting to read! I'd love to read what made him so grumpy and cautious

** Alastor Moody walked into the door, only giving a cursory check to make sure he was at the right house. Moody's unmarked, plain face took in the sight of Dumbledore and a ragtag group of people from various facets and positions in society.

"Everyone, this is Alastor Moody. He is a new Auror, and a promising one. Moody, welcome to the Order of Phoenix." Dumbledore said.

"Great to meet you all." The 24-year old Auror responded, intrigued in what this group would be doing in response to the up and coming dark lord.

--------------

"We're not sure what's in the house. A pair of Aurors went inside, but haven't come out. /Homenium Revelio/ hasn't picked up anything." The older Auror commander said to the squad. "We're going in with sound-maker and flash spells." Moody nodded along with everyone else.

The plan fell apart almost immediately. The door was flung open via bludgeoning spell, and the magical equivalent of a flashbang put through the doorway, only for inferius to spill out. Before Moody could realize what was happening, his squad of Aurors were on the ground as the inferius viciously pummeled them. An inferi tackled Moody, its blank face a deep contrast to its efforts to pummel Moody to death. "Inflammare!" Moody screamed in desperation. The fire spell ignited in the inferi's, and in Moody's face.

--------------

"/Avada Kedavra/!" The death eater yelled, barely missing a teenager trying to flee from the attack on Diagon Alley.

"/Avada Kedavra/!" Moody yelled in return at the death eater, dropping the death eater immediately. Moody had been sent to help out in defending the Alley, being one of the few Aurors who could use the Unforgivables after it had been authorized via the actions of Barty Crouch.

Moody kept moving, heading toward where he could hear the action coming from. He moved through normal people fleeing, only taking time to make sure that they weren't in full panic. That was when he felt a strange sensation on the back of his neck. Moody stepped to the side, an action that probably saved one of his feet.

The Auror bowled over, screaming at the sudden pain. Moody was vaguely aware that his foot was completely cut off, and that there was a death eater about 20 yards away, preparing to fire another spell.

And then Aurors suddenly popped in. Before the death eater could react, he was nearly bisected by the combined power of a dozen deadly jinxes hitting his body. Another Auror, one trained in healing quickly approached Moody and numbed the leg, before waving her wand over the spot to cut off the bleeding.

"You alright Moody?" One of the Aurors said, instantly recognizing the heavily scarred face.

"My foot's missing, of course not." Moody said angrily. "And where are the other Aurors, there must be half of Voldemort's army here."

"The Ministry is under the attack from the inside. Turns out there were much more Imperiused people than we thought." The Auror who had healed Moody responded, the rest having moved towards the major fighting. Moody considered this for a second, before grimacing. This was going to hurt, even with the numbing spell. Moody picked up his wand, before conjuring a block of wood. With a few waves and a muttered Transfiguration spell, the wood became an animated peg leg that attached itself to the stump that had just been healed.

"Come on, let's go. Diagon Alley isn't going to clear itself out." Moody said to the horrified Auror.

"But your foot!" The Auror exclaimed. "We can still reattach it at Mungo's." Moody just looked back at the Auror and shrugged.

--------------

"Are you doing well Moody?" Arthur asked the grizzled Auror.

"About as well as you can be when Voldemort himself puts a bounty out on you." Moody said to Arthur.

The two had become friends through their mutual membership in the Order of Phoenix. Both worked for the Ministry, both were similarly aged, and both had a similar interest in muggle technology. The moment the two had met, they hit it right off.

--------------

The conflict had been going on for several years now, the Ministry of Magic constantly bleeding talent, fighting Voldemort while being sabotaged within via Imperious Cure and willing, malicious Pureblood fanatics.

Moody had once been a mid-range Auror, at the beginning of the war. After several years of fighting and near-brushes of death, he could safely say he was even better than the legendary Amanda Bones.

Soon Moody would become legendary for his skill in evading assassination attempts, as well as for the causal rise in his paranoia.

--------------

Alastor took to the skies, a cowardly Mundungus Fletcher on the back of his broom. He was only a little older than fifty. He would die that night in a successful effort to transport Harry away from 4 Privet Drive.

I feel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9093619/1/The-Eye-for-an-Eye][this]] story explains the "mad-eye" thing better then I ever could. And sorry for the rough narrative, just wanted to write a midnight one-shot about this. Also, the thing about his age- it could totally be true. Extrapolating from the canon, we could definitely place his age to be similar to Arthur Weasley's. Of course, one could also place him a few years younger than Arthur, or many years older than him.
