Recently read Natural 20 from a rec on this subject linkffn(8096183). Fun read.

I found the muggle policewoman sideplot to be particularly interesting. It also jived with a few concepts I had been brainstorming earlier (one where a muggle child sees their parents/friends obliterated and goes on to infiltrate Hogwarts with trick wands and stuff trying to gather enough information to expose the wizarding world, the other where a sub minister of the government figures out what is going on and builds a international response without directly involving world leaders, who were bound by magic treaties to shut down anyone they know of who learns of magic. Have them communicate with the government heads using thinly veiled hypotheticals and such)

So looking for fics that fit this mold. I haven't seen any but natural 20, but that is not surprising as this is basically an OC request, and I generally don't read those :). There really are not enough muggle appearances in cannon to appropriate one of them.

What I am NOT looking for is 'muggle government takes and trains Harry and Co. Into hardened killers' 'harry joins there army' 'Harry and Hermione go to muggle government nfor help' and such. I have seen a few of those and they don't quite fit the bill. Looking for a 'fight the system story'. Where something happens on the muggle side to start the system unraveling, not just "wizard group decides to blow SOS out of the water".


** Linkffn(memorium by Aesop) -- should fit the bill. Aurors frame a muggle for fallout from a death-eater attack. The muggle's sister infiltrates magical society, looking for justice.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** linkffn(One World) It starts with a Death Eater involved in weapon smuggling being busted by an MI-5 Agent, who then goes on to survive a fight with Quirrelmort and a Barbazu while protecting the Flamels. (In this fic, the Flamels are opposed to the Statute of Secrecy, which they predate, and their hope can bast be summed up by the title of the fic.)

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

** It's not the main focus of the story and I haven't read it in years so I might be a little off, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/][With Strength of Steel Wings]] has a subplot where an underground muggle organization is infiltrating the wizarding world.

*** No, this works. Although since it is unfinished you do not really see the plans unfolding
