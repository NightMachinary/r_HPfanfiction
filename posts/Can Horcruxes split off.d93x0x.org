In Chamber if Secrets the young Riddle horcrux seems like it's a separate entity completely. What would have happened if he killed Ginny? Would he have been his own person?


** I'd say YES. He and the 'real' Voldemort would both exist as people, but I think their souls would still be connected.

Still, I would also say that this is unique to the Diary because it was his first horcrux (50% soul) and thus euqally or more powerful. In addition to the hurcrux, the Diary is (presumably) enchanted--like a portrait--to retain his personality; So this wouldn't be possible for the other horcruxes and he couldn't create an army of Voldemorts, lol.

Then again, considering the diary (as a hurcrux) could be destroyed by basilisk venom, one could ask if the resurrected 'Diary'-Voldemort could still be destroyed that way. If so, that begs the question whether Voldemort's original Soul could be destroyed that way. I'd say NO, meaning that the 'real' Voldemort always remains superior, and the 'Diary'-Voldemort always remains a hurcrux (except if he somehow manages to absorb the soul of 'real' Voldemort).

I gotte say I'm a fan of the Diary being resurrected, and then becoming his own entity and fighting against the older Voldemort. Sadly, there aren't any (good) fics with that plot. (Preferably without Ginny dying, and with a Tom/Hermione or Tom/Harry pairing, lol)

Edit: Whith Diary-Voldemort resurrecting, I mean that he 'consumes' Ginny's body to form a new one for himself. He wouldn't absorb Ginny's soul or whatever. Just a new vessel inhabiting Voldemort's soul.

*** I don't know if it's explicit that it's a halving of the soul from each horcrux - it's possible it's the same sized fragment that gets split off I think.

In any case, I am not aware of any fics with the diary fighting against Voldemort like that - but there are at least some where Tom gets set up as his own character/plots. I just don't know any where he explicitly becomes a good guy.

**** I wouldn't go so far as calling him a good guy...ever.

Just that he realizes that the 'real' Voldemort has lost his sanity and wants to stop him. After that, he'd most likely try a different and more subtle approach to rule over Magical Britain. (Politics)

Or could just be that he forms some kind of attraction (e.g. toward Hermione) and thus has to reevaluate his beliefs converning blood purity. (This is assuming that he has those beliefs in the first place and isn't just using them to gather a following upon the most wealthy magical families.)

******** I're read "The Green Girl", "Lady of the Lake", and "A big ball of Wibbly Wobbly". They're certainly interesting stories. It's just that they don't have these 'in the moment' scenes where you're anxious of the outcome, or any battle scenes at all. It's a more passive style, which I personally don't like so much. You're never really 'with' the character--what they're feeling, if they're hurt, distraught, in love, heart beating loudly, breathing becoming labored... You get what I mean.

Also, the climax always feels very lame and predictable.

The stories feel more like documentations of the character's actions and not a story of the characters, if that makes sense.

Well that's my opinion, and I do have (unreasonable) high standards, so yeah.

********* Ah I've read The Green Girl and Wibbly Wobbly too, not Lady of the Lake though. It's been a while since I've read them and I didn't love them or anything so I don't remember much of the fics beyond the general plot and my issues with the characterization. So you're saying Colubrina focuses too much on the actions of the characters rather than the emotions? I'd say skip Things in Common then because I don't remember it being different from her other fics just that the other fics of hers I read are Hermione-focused ones and this is a Ginny-focused one.

I'm curious then - what are some of your favourite fics?

Edit: also I totally get you on the high standards thing. Don't say they're unreasonably high! We like what we like. I often find myself dissatisfied with very popular fics and wonder why I can't seem to love fics that so many others do and question if my standards are too high but hey, it is what it is.

********** I'm not saying there is too much focus on the actions. Rather, not enough. The character don't feel very real because you're never given their motivations and emotions. The stories are a lot of dialogue which isn't very engaging. There aren't really scenes where characters have fights or do something stupid on a whim/lose control because of anger/hate/love/fear. I'm not saying that the characters should be more stupid but rather that they feel too logical and calculating.

To be honest, ever since I've started writing myself, my standards have become really high and I probably wouldn't enjoy the stuff I used to like.

'Delenda Est.' It was one of the first stories I've read on FFN, and I'm also a huge Bellatrix fan, so I might be a little biased there. Still, looking back, I thought the climax wasn't very good and the romance a lot too sparse.

'Luna's Hubby.' Again, one of the first I've read but was really sweet.

'What are you doing in my house.' It's a post-war Harry/Narcissa romance. Not much plot but liked it anyway.

'Blindness.' That one started out really good, but I stopped reading after things grew a little boring for a while. Not sure if it got better or not.

'Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.' This one would be the only one I could call a 'favorite', even though I think that it is a lot too detailed and slow.

As you can gather from that list (or not), I like stories that have good (fast) pacing, an engaging plot, and interesting romance. Not too many of those around, I'd say.

I generally can point out (a lot of) things I dislike in every single fic. Sometimes I wish I could go back to my previous (ignorant) self and just read.

Edit: I also liked 'Paid in Blood' (Haphne) and 'Brilliant Magic' (Hermione/Fred/George) but again, rather boring climax/ending.

** This is something that's not entirely clear in canon I would say - you could make an argument either way on how it'd work. Personally I get the impression that yes, he would have been his own person and taking over Ginny's body/possessing it as his own.

Past that, it's very murky. Would Tom (the diary) be able to form new horcruxes? How much could he/it develop past what was imbued in the diary? Would the host shift from the diary to the possessed body? Could his magical ability develop further?

It's also not clear exactly what Horcruxes do in some other ways. In canon we know it splits the soul and houses a fragment of it - but is it halved each time? Always the 'same sized' fragment? Etc, etc. This is something that you could easily debate either way on - or make small switches for your fic.

Eg, if it's halving the soul (with a limit), the first horcrux made could make a whole bunch more. If it's a fragment of the initial soul, perhaps horcruxes could keep making horcruxes - each time making it a weaker and weaker 'copy'.

I've also got a headcanon that all horcruxes can eventually possess the one wearing it if they're let in. We know they affect the thoughts, obviously, but I imagine that wearing one for months/years would eventually let the soul fragment/consciousness seep its way into the one wearing it and start to possess them.

I really dislike the idea that a soul has a size in a mathematical sense, and that you can measure Horcruxes in percentage in relation to the 'original'. So I believe that after regaining body, any part of a soul has a capability of becoming bigger than even its whole, depending on its choices and experiences.

** I would have to say it depends. The only real horcrux exposure we have is the diary of Tom Riddle, the locket of Salazar Slytherin, Nagini, and Harry Potter.

The easiest first, Harry Potter. Harry has the distinction of being the first human horcrux, and humans are known for free will. He was also the seventh horcrux of Voldemort, and accidental. Theoretically, he holds the smallest portion of one Tom Riddle's soul. He is subject to possession by Voldemort, visions through a mental link, and has the abilities of bother parseltongue and to always know when the Dark lord was in close proximity. He was known to inflict great pain to Voldemort through love. Obviously, while tethered to Voldemort's life force, he was not Voldemort., and could not become Voldemort.

Nagini, as a snake, (or a blood cursed human, but that was not canon at the time of production for Deathly Hallows, book or movies) has less mental faculty than a human, yet is still known to have at least some level of reasoning and thinking.) Nagini can be possessed by Voldrmort, and is known to have complete, unwavering loyalty to the Dark Lord, even more than is normal for a serpent and parselmouth. Nagini does not seem to have the potential to become it's own variant of the dark lord, nor does it show desire to.

The locket is an inanimate horcrux, and appears to act autonomously from Voldemort during the Hunt. Whether it is due to Voldemort not being aware of the locket's removal from the inferi cave, or a lack of capability to do so, Voldemort Prime does not use the locket as a weapon. The Locket has some form of legilimency, as when worn by the Golden Trio, it has a negative effect on emotions, and compounds their fears. The locket, surprisingly enough, did not have a notable effect on Delores Umbridge, despite her being in contact with the item for months. A notable phrase used by the locked when opened was " I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears." This show sentience as well. The locket, presumably, could become a new Voldemort.

And last the diary. The first Horcrux. The Diary acts completely autonomously, and does not have any memories of Tom Riddle after the creation of itself. The diary grants parseltongue, and possesses the mind of Ginny weasley, eventually capable of draining her life to build himself a corporeal form. The Diary displays sentience, but not the legilimency the locket was made famous for. The diary absolutely could become a new and different Voldemort.

This is mostly conjecture on my part, but I hope it helps. A good idea of the way horcruxes work is presented in the fanfiction Souls Abound by RobSt, and it is that I used as the basis for some of my theories.

** We don't really know enough about Horcruxes to say for certain that they all act that way, only that the Diary does. I'n also pretty sure that it's stated or implied in canon that Voldemort planned to have his diary end up in Hogwarts to open the Chamber, only for him to find out later that Horcruxes are limited in number so he decided against it.

So, there are two main theories I have on why this happens with the diary specifically (in-universe, anyway. A third would be JKR being inconsistent). One, Voldemort modified his diary to act this way, or two, all Horcruxes have unique defences, either set by Voldemort while making them or just by what they are. So the diary can be written in and absorb someone's soul, and the locket needs to be opened in order to be destroyed, but can only be opened by a pareselmouth and has a way to mentally see into an attacker's mind and project images of their fears/insecurities to keep them at bay.
