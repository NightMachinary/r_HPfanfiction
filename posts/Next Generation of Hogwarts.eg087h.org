Not sure where the best place to post this is but here goes!

I have recently become obsessed with Harry Potter through the films and have begun reading the books today. I am huge fan/player of dungeons and dragons and told my friends that I would begin a table top RPG campaign for them and set it in Hogwarts.

The players will begin as 1st years and the campaign is an open ended adventure. I haven't really begun writing my antagonist yet, but I have started writing about hogwarts in the next generation. I am not very interested in The Cursed Child, but have taken some cool things from it.

Anyway the nature of this post is to gather ideas and inspiration from you guys about what The school could be like 22 years after the battle of Hogwarts! Any and all ideas are welcome and feel free to make up the craziest of things! A few prompt questions would be;

Who is teaching Defence against the dark arts?

Are Flitwick/Hagrid/Sprout/Trelawney/McGonagall still teaching?

Who are the new caretaker and keeper of keys? (If there are new ones)

When will McGonagall resign/has she already?

What children of the wizards we know and love are enrolled now?

Are there any new secrets such as passageways and covered up crimes?

Last one (because I really need the inspiration)

What could be the biggest threat to the school/the Wizarding world as a whole now?

Could Voldemort return? Could he have children?

Any and all ideas welcome! And thank you in advance!

TL;DR - Give me some ideas about Hogwarts in this day and age, I need inspiration for a Harry Potter RPG Campaign I am making!

Thanks in advance :)


** Some of it depends on whether you want to be epilogue-compliant. I lean towards "no", since I like the idea that Harry came back after a while - perhaps after dealing with the last vestiges of the Death Eaters and pro-Voldemort sentiment - and took up the DADA job instead of staying as an Auror. It would be his final victory over Voldemort: Voldy wanted the job for his own ends (to search for Hogwarts trophies, and recruit followers), Harry started teaching defense so people could /protect/ themselves from Voldemort, and he gets the job because he's actually good at it. Also I detest the "Albus Severus" name, I mean /really/ now.

McGonagall is almost certainly Headmistress; the books never described her as very old (ignore Crimes of Grindelwald) and she's such a staple of the series it seems right to keep her. She probably doesn't have time to teach Transfiguration, unless she teaches the NEWT level and has someone else doing the OWL years. In fact, some other core classes might have split teachers now - the school's population was likely very small during Harry's years due to the war, and would be larger now since the war is over.

Neville should teach Herbology (and /probably/ be head of house for Gryffindor, now that Minnie is Headmistress) - that's in the epilogue and there's no good reason to change it. Hagrid's probably still doing CoMC (and /maybe/ he's even figured out a sane lesson plan. No guarantees, though!) I don't think the books mention Flitwick's age at all, so he could go either way. Slughorn may have quit by then, so you might need someone for Potions.

The Room of Requirement is probably well-known now, but lots of fics introduce the idea that /each/ founder left a secret room in the castle. The Chamber of Secrets is Slytherin's, and the Room of Requirement could easily be Ravenclaw's (to serve as a workshop or study) or Hufflepuff's (to provide the students with whatever they need), but that leaves two that might exist that Harry never found.

Voldemort is definitely dead for good - the books were very clear about that - and the idea that he had children to become the new Dark Lords is fanfiction-y in the worst way. That was what caused a good chunk of the backlash to Cursed Child: they couldn't be arsed to come up with an original villain so they used a convoluted time-travel plot to reuse the old one.

Since the books were fairly black-and white, good-vs-evil, I like the idea of the new generation facing more moral ambiguity. The goblins could be a good antagonist here: they have legitimate grievances, such as their repression at the hand of wizards, the wand ban, and their differing ideas of ownership regarding goblin-made artifacts, but they're also quite vicious and unsympathetic in person. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727/chapters/602150][Inter Arma...]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] both have some good plot development dealing with goblins.

The rise of muggle computers and surveillance (which seem to be very poorly understood by wizards) and ensuing difficulty in enforcing the Statute of Secrecy might be another plot point. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Natural 20]] has a subplot about a couple muggle cops discovering the magical world, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549?hide_banner=true][Super Bowl Breach]] has been recommended here before and is /massive/, and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/][Albus Potter series]] involves the repeal of the Statute, but IIRC the series doesn't do very much with it.

*** Wow this is all great, very well said, and thanks for the links for inspiration. Harry working DADA is a great shout, was thinking of a way to put him, I was also thinking of an antagonist and Goblin and house elf's wishing for equal rights is a really cool idea. Another Dark Wizard is ok once it's different enough, I think a Goblin revolution leader is a cool idea, especially if he had a way of casting spells. I need a new wand lore man since Ollivanders probably dead/retired. It's hard balance to strike between adding new stuff to a world they already know so we'll but still not rehashing pervious ideas and use them the same way. Thanks though!
