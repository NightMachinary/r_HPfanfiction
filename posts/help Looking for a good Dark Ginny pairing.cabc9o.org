In a story I have a dark Ginny sorted into slytherin who does the dark arts she breaks up with luna because luna can't handle the things Ginny does.

â€‹

Do you have any recommendations on who Ginny can date?


** I suppose it depends on whether you want a male or female character, but you can't go wrong with the first year slytherin's (Draco, Theo, Blaise, etc), or pull something off with the diary.
