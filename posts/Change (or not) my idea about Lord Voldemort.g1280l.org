I often read charts that include Lord Voldemort as one of the best villains. I can't understand why. He is not particularly strategic, nor particularly intelligent (perhaps Tom Riddle was, but the post ritual Voldemort does not seem to me that brilliant dark wizard). His regime of terror, and his agenda, are based on halving the English magical population and no plans to prevent purebloods from ending up as Gaunts. Maybe Voldemort doesn't care, but his followers?

Voldemort has always shown me the caricature of a villain rather than a villain. Before you attack my throat, do you think he is? And above all, why? What do you see in Voldemort that I don't see?


** I think Voldemort has the /potential/ to be an amazing villain.

Orphan child growing up in an abusive environment, surrounded by death and war. Develops the idea that his mother didn't love him/betrayed him by dying, further cementing his revulsion to death. Grows up guarded and with no one he can trust to look out for him. Eventually discovers magic and lashes out against his bullies, but by this point he has been way too alienated by the rest of the orphanage to enter some form of normality, so magic is the only thing he has.

Eventually, this old man comes to him and tells him he is a wizard, dispelling his greatest fear that, maybe, just maybe, he really is a demonic freak like the rest of the orphanage thinks he is. In the span of a few minutes, the old man turns into a judgemental prick and makes assumptions about him without having any insight into his life.

Tom marches on, and gets sorted into Slytherin, where it's safe to assume he gets instantly bullied and humiliated. Just like in the orphanage, he has nobody he can rely on, and he has to resort to subterfuge and martial prowess so that he won't be beaten to death by the time he graduates. He probably pours over the Library and disregards Wizarding social customs and laws regarding Magic, which makes Dumbledore even more wary of him. Each summer, he has to go back to a place where he is hated and which he hates, with German bombs exploding in the background.

Eventually, he discovers he is the Heir of Slytherin. I imagine this was similar to first hearing he is a wizard. It was something that dispelled him of his subconscious fear that maybe he really is an unwanted freak. He finds his father and confronts him about abandoning him to that hell, and Senior is just snarky and tells him to fuck off, so he lashes out again and kills him. Meanwhile, his uncle is barely above the rank of animal.

In the end, he comes up with /I am Lord Voldemort,/ as a way to finally break from his past. Voldemort is everything Tom was told he isn't, and the conqueror of every fear Tom has. Voldemort is powerful, famous, has followers, he is immortal, rich. He is Tom without any of the insecurities and weaknesses. But instead of freedom, Lord Voldemort forever chains him to his past. He will now forever be that scared little boy taking shelter from the bombs and blaming his mother for abandoning him, just now with a different name. he doesn't integrate his traumas, he supresses them as deep as possible. As time passes, he looses himself more and more in the mask, until even he can't make the distinction anymore.

​

Tom is by far my favorite character in HP, and /to an extent/, I relate to him quite a lot. Rowling dropped the pieces to make a fantastic and tragic character. One of her best, imo. Sadly, when it came to piecing together her thoughts, the end result was something along the line of */hhhhhhhh Killing Curse go brrrrrrrrrrrrr/*

*** I'm never going to give up the hope that someone eventually will write this in a nice long fic.

*** Honestly, I never really delved quite this deep into Voldemort, but your analysis makes perfect sense and brings in a new outlook, prompting people to find themselves sympathizing with the 'enemy'. I have always liked Voldemort's character but this analysis really sold it for me, well done! I do have one thing to add that you also mentioned, Rowling should have delved this deep into his character like you did, to show this to people who do not think like you and me. I feel like if she really established this sympathy and reasoning behind why Voldemort is the way he is, a lot more people would like him and the series would have an even richer value to it as it would have touched upon the heart of both sides of the war, not just the "light" side.

** I really think he is just another generic ass villain who is evil and wants to take over the world, just cause. He doesn't do anything grandiose, he just does all the generic villain shit. I think Umbridge was a far better villain than ol Voldies, cuz it felt like she had at least some depth to her character beyond being villain A.

** Those types of rankings are more a gauge of the work's popularity. Voldemort is the main villain in one of the most popular series written, so therefore he's going to rank highly. He's also very flamboyant and lurking menacingly in the books.

That said, he's also not a /great/ villain in canon, like you say. There are glaring holes in what he's doing, he doesn't act nearly as smart as he's supposed to be, he's a caricature, etc. That's fine in canon - because that's what the books needed for how they were written.

For fics that want to make it a bit more complex, challenging, or the like, he does have a lot of potential to improve - as TheSerpentPrince369 writes out, he does have a compelling storyline when examined as a whole. Voldemort is also supposed to be a genius - showing more of that would always help.

** On the one hand, he was woefully ineffective getting at one (pre)teen throughout the series. In his defense, that teen was rather bulletproof. He also killed a snake and outwitted a dragon before most of us muggles learned to drive. Part of what made Harry so effective was actually his naïveté; he reacted so unexpectedly in situations, it was impossible to predict. That's not even mentioning the extent to which, the plot protected him. I'm not sure there's any other time in cannon that a portkey took a person back to another place upon touch, though it is frequent in fics.

On the other hand, Vold took over an entire government for a second time within a couple decades without anyone noticing. That's terrifying. He also had teams of people who would appear near you and kidnap you if you said something he didn't like. If Siri teamed up with Big Brother in 1984, you'd still need to develop teleportation to reach that level of inescapability. You want to plan a rebellion, but (a) not everyone believes the government is evil, (b) many individuals being evil might be mind controlled by others, so even if you take them out, the masterminds in the shadows will stop you and keep their power without effort, (c) on top of not knowing who to trust, you can't even risk saying certain words because there is no way to protect yourself from being magically overheard.

Finally, he had a symbol that meant, “your loved ones are dead here. No matter how fast you run to check on them, they're already gone.” It's like the Red John smile in The Mentalist. You see the symbol first and feel the dread of it because you know what it has meant every time before now.

The story is told from a rather oblivious boy who has bonus survival powers on top of the magic. He barely thinks through the consequences of his own actions, let alone the political sphere at large. I think they are written in the fantastical way that allows fiction to be less scary because Good will always prevail over Evil. That said, if you put some of the implications into the context of the current world, where there isn't a single person fated to save it, it becomes much scarier.

In books, the bad guys can be tempered by equally powered good guys. However, in real life, that isn't always the case. Sometimes, the bad people---selfish people, evil people---gain power and use that power to hurt those who can't protect themselves. In the world where Harry always wins, Voldemort is a hapless villain with delusions of grandeur. In the real world, someone of his reach would be a tyrant who mixed the most suppressive parts of military dictatorship with the scariest parts of government control dystopias.

** He's one of the most evil villains. He does dark things of such magnitude, but not only to others. That is one of the major reasons.

Take for instance Horcruxes. The soul is played with a lot in fiction, and the closest thing to one is a Lich, an arcane undead that stores their soul in an object called a Phylactery. They essentially control their body like a puppet, but that's about it.

Voldemort, though, he went further. He tore his soul into eight pieces, and still maintains one in his body. He's worse than a Lich.

TLDR: other villains will torture and enslave others, but Voldemort does these things to himself too.

** I think that Voldemort was more of a revolutionary in his early phases. Like leading his Slytherin gang to commit 'cruel pranks' on fellow students. But as he grew more powerful, he became this god-like figure. Think of how he doesn't own any property and probably doesn't have any money... yet he is surrounded by these rich powerful families. He then takes over Magical Britain but he doesn't bother to put himself in a position of power (nor as Minister, Headmaster, whatever) but instead goes on his quest for the Elder Wand and lets the Death Eaters rule Magical Britain as they see fit... which is actually in complete discrepancy between how he rules over the Death Eaters, maintaining strict discipline, and the total chaos that the magical world had become as shown in the Gringotts chapter in DH.

Voldemort, at least in the books, is only proactive when it comes to Harry and Dumbledore because he sees them as threats, but overall he is really a god who doesn't give a shit about the squabbles of the petty mortals whether they are purebloods or mudbloods. He doesn't care about materialistic power as he does not take positions or acquire wealth. But he cares about his magical knowledge and power.

I actually read a pretty nice comparison between Voldemort and Jehova. Both had names that people would fear to speak. At first they were gatekeeped by followers but eventually non-believers started to associate calling their name with punishment as well. Also, Voldemort often talks in third person saying how generous and kind he is if you obey his commands but he will not hesitate in a second to torture or kill you. Also he is immortal.

Overall, I think that by the time we get to see Voldemort, he has this god complex and doesn't care much about flaws in his plans. The only person that actually evades him is Harry and I think in Harry's case, Voldemort always loses his cool.

He might have been a great villain in a First War story or his Hogwarts days story but in the end he gets overcome by the human's greatest weakness (which is not death): pride.
