JKR has said that Hermione was meant to have a younger sister, but that she never got around to writing her and eventually just gave up; Hermione is canonically an only child by book 7. Are there any AU fics out there that feature this hypothetical sister?


** I remember one called linkffn(living with danger) which features an /older/ sister who acts a a mother figure(both Granger parents are deceased in this continuity.

I eventually quit reading it because the plot was very very repetitive.

It was also rather repetitive.

And it kept repeating itself.

*** I gave up somewhere in the third volume of the series, but the first volume is really good. Very much worthy of reading.

**** Same actually. The plot point of one or two of them getting kidnapped was /way/ overused. I finally got to the point where I was like, “This? Again? Right. I'm done.”

  Hermione goes to Australia to bring her parent home and gets a big surprise. It turns out her Memory Charm wasn't enough to fill the hole in their lives. Now, she has a new sister who will be starting at Hogwarts as she returns for her seventh year and deals with the aftermath of the war. Epilogue-compliant.

** The Confectionary Chronicles features Hermione's sister as a solid part of her backstory and she's referenced/talked about often, though she's not actually ever really 'in' the story. It's a supernatural cross-over, but you don't need to know anything about the other show to follow along (I haven't seen a single episode).
