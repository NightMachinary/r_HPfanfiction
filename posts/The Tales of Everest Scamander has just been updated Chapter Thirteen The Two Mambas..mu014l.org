The Tales of Everest Scamander has just been updated!

Here are a few quick notes before I give my brief description,

1. Update days have changed. I will be posting Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon MST.
2. We just hit 400 reads! Thank you all so much! I never thought that so many people would enjoy my story, but I am so glad that you do! It has seriously made these past months the best ever.
3. I will only be posting updates on Reddit every week now on Monday, sorry. I mean, over-advertising isn't good advertising, is it?

Anyway, thank you for all of your support recently. I really appreciate it. Now let me tune back to my regular sales pitch.

In this new chapter, Steward eats a brownie. I mean, a lot of other things happen too, but yes, Steward does eat a brownie.

For those of you who haven't read my story yet, here is a brief description.

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.

Future pairings are DracoxOC and FredxOC
