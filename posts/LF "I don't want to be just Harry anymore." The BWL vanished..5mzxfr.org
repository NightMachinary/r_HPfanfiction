So any good long fics in which Harry assumes a new identity? Nothing to link him to the past, new appearance just to get away from everything attached to the BWL and go under the radar (either just to escape and leave magical Britain or subterfuge and infiltration to throw off the enemies). Could be crossovers where he assumes a secret superhero identity, or an accident that disfigures him, a blood adoption, genderswap or just being a metamorph that uses the gift properly, or even soul transferal into Lockheart or some random person who was dead in an AU timeline, or a reincarnation into a muggleborn after he dies so that he can finish the prophecy, but the end result is Harry is no longer known as Harry Potter and is treated as a completely different person.

** Try linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold). It is a bit cliche (OMG why didn't anyone think of using the RoR this way!), but it probably wasn't cliche when it was written.

HP assumes a new identity, goes to a new (BAMF) school. Becomes bad-ass, saves the world. The usual :)

Has a sequel, which is also good. The third part of the trilogy only got two chapters before it was abandoned.

My favorite part of the fic is the epic new fields of magic, a plethora of new races, and plenty of original ideas (or at least ideas that seemed original 10 years ago when I first found it).

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
