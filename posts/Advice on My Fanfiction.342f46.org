Hi - I'd love some advice on my new fanfiction.

It's meant to be a gritty retelling (read: AU) of the Harry Potter universe; somewhat like a George RR Martin meets JK Rowling. It's also kind of cliche, given Harry has a twin but is not the Boy Who Lived. I'm hoping to add my own unique elements to the story though - ones that, to my knowledge, have not yet been done.

I realize it's early, but I'd love some advice.

** Is there some deep reason behind changing Lily's name to Lilly? Or is it a way of saying this is different from canon? It's slightly distracting.

Aside from that, I think it's interesting so far! Really can't say much more, but I'm definitely looking forward to more chapters.

*** And this is why I need an editor. Thanks for the catch; I'll have to go through and republish the chapters. I can't believe I missed this.

** Format wise, I'd suggest adding more tags to AO3 and a different picture to FFN.

From a content standpoint, I think it is starting too slow. Information in these first two chapters is clearly important to the story, but not so much to the reader. At least, not yet.

The prologue doesn't really grip so much as paint a picture. The next chapter only presents more answers, not questions. And that's not really enough. Very little tension is being built. The summary tells us where this is going (which is fine) but we're being walked instead of run towards that interesting AU conclusion to Snape's life.

I suggest you make a change to your first few chapters. Pick something big from slightly later in the story to start things off. Grab the reader with something shocking and new, something they haven't seen before. Make a promise for what's to come, then go back for details. Not too many, though. Not in a row.

Instead of starting with background, begin the story with something big and important. A wedding or a funeral. A fist fight or a lover's clench. A birth or a murder.

Harry uses Dark magic for the first time. Snape's funeral. Dumbledore kills someone. A Lily who is mature, lonely, and a mother invites a lover to her bed. A Dumbledore who is full of life and magic invites a lover to his bed. Lily kills someone. Voldemort returns, but not the way people expect. Something to divide and polarize, to entice and enchant.

Put that non-linear bit or focus element first, then put your prologue behind that. Then repeat for chapter two, starting with something later or Harry-centric, then going back for the details and history of the situation.

I get that this is the AU changes being presented, but I don't feel that's enough. I have overdone this non-linear format style, but people who have read my stories usually remember them, for better or worse. I think it works very well for fanfiction, as people usually know what to expect and will be bored by retellings of the same old setting and events, even if there are new elements being added.

I've been told I'm harsh, so I want to make clear the pictures being painted are good ones. That's why I want more tension. I like a lot of what I see.

*** I don't think you're being harsh at all. This is the most helpful advice I've received. Thanks for taking the time.

A couple follow up questions.

1. How much of what you said above do you think could have been avoided by longer chapters? The thing is, in my opinion, I think a lot of the later chapters do build tension and have promises, but I wanted these six or seven chapters to set the stage. And instead if I made it one huge chapter, then we'd get tension by chapter two instead of chapter ten.

2. Re non-linear - I've thought about this myself, but I can't seem to do this without spoiling the way certain promises resolve. A big one was going to be Harry's first dark magic, Harry's first unforgivable, Harry's first kill, etc. And I feel like if I started there, and worked backwards, then it's the hindsight effect and people just say 'oh, well of course the story is going there.' Do you agree? If so, how do you strike a balance?

**** Thanks. If I can explain my opinions on writing to someone it helps sort it out in my own head. What I'm trying to say is, I'm glad to give my thoughts on this.

Here's my take:

1. If anything, longer chapters would make it harder for the readers, in my opinion. But regardless of length, six or seven chapters is what, 7k words at this rate based on the post-prologue first chapter? A little too long for things to build. That would be like not getting to magic /at all/ (counting your prologue) until after the Hagred minecart scene. Few strong, directly plot-advancing scenes for that long isn't a good idea. As for chapter length, if someone wants to read about an interesting Snape or the AU background, they'll be interested in chapters of almost any length (though I'd stay below 10k). If they aren't just in it for Snape, etc., a reader waiting to get to what they think is the "good stuff" could be an issue. That's why I suggest front-loading something both strong and important to your story so you don't lose readers' attention before then.

2. You've already given away some of that in the summary. But those parts are really cool, right? The actual moments where those things happen? That's why people will want to read them. Beacuse they're cool. Don't make them wait unnecessicarily. Sure, don't give away the moments that need to build, the twists and surprises. But the obvious stuff can be presented without explaining everything ahead of time. Don't climax too early (aha), but do tease some things. Balance it out by having those surprises people don't see coming happen early and often.

** First, your writing is very digestible. Easy to read and follow along. Since its revealed in your summary that Snape dies, I would shorten the prologue to cover the entirety of his life and death. Seven chapters is too long to linger on a known character death despite the character being well written.

Then, you can time jump to the present. I think it would serve better to create a frantic prologue. Leave the beginning of the prologue as is. Condense the area where he asks for Dumbledore's help. I would leave out the parts with Regulus and Rosier as well. End the prologue with his death.

I'm interested to see what you can create going forward. Traveling the already worn path and describing the past is easy. Creating the future will be hard.

*** Thanks for taking the time to read and give advice; it's super helpful.

I think you and [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] are both right; I'm spending too much time doing the boring stuff and not building enough tension. I'll definitely have to rewrite the beginning.

**** It was far from boring. On the contrary, it was engaging despite knowing his death would be coming soon.

It would just have more impact if the Snape portion was condensed to a prologue. Plus, if you wanted to keep it to true GRRM style - killing off a character in the prologue is the way to go. I'd also leave off Harry becoming dark in the A/N.
