As the title says, what are the best stories where harry potter either discovers some crazy inheritance or the gringotts vaults play a big part in the plot? Bonus points for ones I haven't read yet!


** Here's a few that I have enjoyed.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - Harry discovers he's the Potter heir, at which point he's entitled to a monthly allowance from his family vault. He later sets up his own secret personal account in Gringotts, which comes in handy when [[/spoiler][he is disinherited by his father]]. Counter to the "Lord Harry Potter-Black" trope, at one point in the story he is legally known as Harry [[/spoiler][No-name]].

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - Harry's new adoptive father helps him learn about the property, savings, and businesses of the Potter family that he should have known all along. Bonus(?): The author creates a reasonable backstory to explain why inheritance tests always happen at the Gringotts bank and why they aren't commonly done.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2856616/2/Tom-Marvolo-Riddle-Potter][Tom Marvolo Riddle Potter]] - A different run-on name than usual. Harry accidentally goes back in time to a parallel universe. Luckily for him, the last known Potter died 80 years ago, so Harry gets an inheritance test and claims the remaining Potter properties (which are in heavy disrepair).

*Crack:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] - Harry goes to Gringotts to pick up his inheritance only to discover he gets diddly squat from the Potter vaults. It's a great scene.

  The ancient goblin pushed a folder across the expansive marble desk. "And, as we discussed, the Noble House of Potter was dissolved and its fortune divided among its claimants when the Head of House and sole remaining member of the family suffered the misfortune of a most untimely and tragic end."

  "You mean when I died."

  The goblin coughed, uncomfortable. "Yes, Mr. Potter, though we generally do not speak of it so bluntly, out of respect for the, er, survivors."

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  When Voldemort is defeated, the fragment of his soul still stuck in Harry drags the Boy Who Lived with it through time in search of another, complete version of itself. A time travel, Harry adopts Tom Riddle story.

  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
