** Personally I wouldn't continue reading this story. Admittedly I only stumbled through the first two chapters but were I reading this for myself I probably wouldn't have finished the first.

So, why didn't I like it?

To me it was a bit of a mess. Stories are weird, they can make you feel certain things and think about things in a specific way all without telling you how you're supposed to feel. A simple thing like making me care about a character then having them get hurt makes me feel a bit sad and a bit sympathetic. If you've introduced them to me and made me care I might support their choices.

Your story doesn't have any feelings. You hand wave them away.

  I wonder what it wants. Why am I not scared.

Now ignoring the lack of question marks I personally find this to be rather lazy. I understand what you're trying to do but I think the whole section could be rewritten into a longer passage that makes more sense and allows us to know what the characters are feeling.

The next bit, the train station, its a mess. Now you leave an author's note at the bottom of the chapter trying to explain things. Personally I believe if you feel the need to explain things you haven't written it well enough to be clear. Mystery is a thing, I much prefer stories that hit the ground running and leave the reader to follow the breadcrumbs and piece the bits together than explain every action from an objective angle but your story doesn't have either. One of my absolute favourite story starts is linkffn(10016768). I wish there was more of it but I'll happily use it as an example of when big changes are made and the reader is only told what they need to know. You've missed mystery and landed in clumsiness and confusion.

Your story reads like a list of events that come across as random events. Take Sirus' presence as an example. When does he get there, why is he there, how does Harry feel about his presence. We get a glimpse of their relationship and that would be enough had you not already established that Harry and Tonks aren't from there. You've also told us that Tonks is going to be sorted you've also told us she's 11 and Harry is ten. What the fuck, they're just okay with this, not only are they okay with this but they were aware and prepared? Tonks telling us that she didn't expect Harry till next year suggests she knew he'd be ten. This means we as the readers have missed something important and given how little detail your story has it does feel like something is missing.

Tonks and Harry get visited by a strange being, gap, somehow Harry is there with Sirius, Tonks and her family and everyone seems okay with this, also did Sirus not recognise his own cousin, the one he would have kept in touch with had he not gone to Azkaban?

Then you get them into the train and somehow they don't know anything again? According to your dialogue on the train, there was no gap. They went from bed to there? Not to mention, if they're going from adults in bed to eleven year olds, why bother with the whole thing about their clothes given they wouldn't fit them anyway nor would their parents/guardians know where the clothes came from? This just comes across as very clumsy.

Your second chapter, well, in terms of content this is very much not what I'd like but that doesn't matter, this isn't a story for me, this is for you. That being said, Dumbledore is just okay with Harry being able to do NEWT level magic before classes start, all without a wand? You don't think Dumbledore would have questions? I know I bloody well do. You seem to be trying to set up the whole manipulativeDumbledore trope along with some family magic bullshit. Now that's your choice, I don't think I've ever seen it in a way I've liked but I reckon it could be done but really, Harry thinks that Dumbledore is suspicious after Harry used wandless NEWT level magic and Dumbledore doesn't ask any questions. Dumbledore isn't suspicious he's full on negligent. Unless of course you're saying that it was suspicious that he seemingly doesn't care? In that case I agree completely. Completely bonkers that he's just okay with it. At the very least I'd have expected them to have to sit placement tests. Then you have this confusing chat about /'it's not really even him'/ I so, is it not really Dumbledore, that might explain why he's so chill with the bonkers shit Harry just pulled but if that is the case then I'm even more confused. Especially as to how they know? They've been at Hogwarts for a single day.

In the nicest way possible your fic is clumsy and I suggest you spend more time planning. You have ideas in your head but I suggest you spend some time really narrowing down what you want to focus on, work out your timeline, work out what is going to happen and who knows what. Your characters flip between ignorance and omnipotence in a single bit of dialogue.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  Harry and Tonks are sent back to Hogwarts. They have to figure out what they have to do and why they are there. For my female friends. Yes, there is going to be a female heroine. Rest easy, I have plans for her. DarkHarry! for later chapters. Slytherin!
