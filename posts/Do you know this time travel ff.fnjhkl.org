:END:
I had read this ff which I don't remember the title or the site where it was posted. Harry and Ginny, after the death of their children because of the war against Muggles, decide to go back in time. I remember that it takes many years to find a safe way to guarantee their soul, magic, and knowledge in their younger bodies. They weren't in Gryffindor, but I don't remember the house where they were sorted. Maybe it was Ravenclaw. Thanks.


** Here is one, it doesn't have dead kids but they both go back.

Book 1 of Bonds of Time Saga. After an attack, Harry and Ginny Potter find themselves back in time before Harry's first year at Hogwarts. Stuck in the past with no way back, they decide to change the future for the better
