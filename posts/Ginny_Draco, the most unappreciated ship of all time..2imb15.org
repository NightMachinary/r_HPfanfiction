Looking for good G/D stories, love the dark ones but anything during Hogwarts would be great. Solid characterization would be appreciated but anything you've enjoyed would be wonderful!


** One thing that annoys me is that HHr writers on portkey often pair Ginny and Draco up, with no characterisation whatsoever except 'he's hot, she's hot, and they enjoy kinky sex'. I feel like this ship has potential to it, but needs to be well-written to be believable.

** I don't personally have any recommendations, but it's definitely an underappreciated ship. The very first one that I can remember reading yeeears ago was Ginny/Draco!

*** When I finally (eventually) finish my epic fanfiction, Ginny/Draco will be prominent.

In the meantime... I haven't read this in years, and my standards were lower, but I recall [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3707227/1/Three-Thousand-Days-of-Innocence][Three Thousand Days of Innocence]] being pretty good.

**** From the summary of that fic:

#+begin_quote
  "Draco Malfoy wasn't guilty of anything until no one could find him after the last battle"
#+end_quote

You know, except for him being part of a recognized terrorist organization. And performing /at least/ two instances, likely many more, of the Unforgivables: Madam Rosmerta with the Imperius and Thorfinn Rowle with the Cruciatus. And that time he poisoned Ron Weasley and almost killed him. And, as part of the Inquisitorial Squad, accessory to assault of a minor, multiple counts. The hits really just keep coming.

This isn't how you do an anti-hero, by straight white-washing. In that story, they have Draco not having the Dark Mark, as well as an even more contrived excuse for his crimes. And that isn't even mentioned until like chapter 17/49.

It isn't fair to canon, and makes it more Ginny/"Draco in name only". Neither is the classic "Old magic is best magic" Pureblood apologist stuff something that makes Ginny/Draco work.

That's all fine for heavy AU stories, but it changes so much that the motivations and goals of the characters are entirely different, as well as their upbringing and abilities. It isn't a "post-Hogwarts" story anymore, it is just an AU being set in an entirely different world.

Makes me want to write my own canon-compliant Draco-centric romance story, just to show people how it's done.

I really want to see an example of Draco/anyone done well, but as you suggest, this isn't the best out there. Because it isn't /about Draco Malfoly./ Just some character with the same name.

***** Personally, I don't mind AU too much. It gives writers that aren't great at developing their own characters a place to begin writing. On the other hand, I would love to read a canon-compliant Draco, if you ever write one!

*** u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
#+begin_quote
  their personalities clash so well
#+end_quote

I'm very sure that's /not/ how relationships are meant to work.

Which might be why people have a hard time writing something with this "ship" that isn't a rapey forced marriage or post-Voldemort-victory abuse fic. Or if not, simply yet another [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] hooking up with girl X. All of which are really boring and predictable, once again misusing the possibilities of Ginny's character.

Hard to have the series' second, and least well used, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress][Damsel in Distress]] fall in love with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel][Heel]] and have it not be very contrived and forced from beginning to end. Usually, /literally/.

*** Sounds like a typical portkey story! It might be [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/2119][Dirty Dancing]], one of the most read stories on that website, but your description fits a lot of stories.

** Ginny/Draco makes me grit my teeth in anger. Enough so that even just seeing this thread bothers me. I've tried ignoring it, but I can't.

It's ok though, almost any non-cannon pairing does that to me. I just can't get a grip on the idea of Ginny without Harry or vice versa.

Funny story, I almost didn't watch that new show "How to Get Away With Murder" because the guy that played Dean Thomas is on there, and Ginny/Dean nearly makes me fly off in a rage. I blame Northumbrian for that one.
