I'm most interested in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff Harry, but if you have a really great Slytherin Harry in mind, I'll definitely check it out!


** Try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]] for a funny take on Harry being in Hufflepuff house.

**** I agree! You have probably already seen this, since it's pretty popular, but this is a great Hufflepuff!Harry work in progress: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] by Blueowl. It involves Snape going back in time to help Harry.

** This is one of my favorite Slytherin Harry series. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One]] The author just finished revising years 1-4 and will not post year 5 until it is fully completed.

And this is my favorite Ravenclaw Harry story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door]] It's fairly short but it has a very unique storyline going.

Well that's all I have, if I can find or remember any other fanfiction I have read in the past I will post some more.

**** I found it to be pretty good, it was nice having a completely new perspective on some of the characters I have grown to dislike. The change in attitude could be attributed to how slytherins act towards each other, take care of your housemates and all that. I'm not sure how draco acted throughout the stories, I read that series a while ago and have recently been checking to see if Dethryl has posted year 5 yet.

Joe has to be one of my favorite fanfic authors I've read the hero series multiple times, which I usually just read a story once and forget about it, the only bad thing about An Unfound Door is it only has 6 chapters right now and he doesn't seem to update too often.

I like reading different kinds of HP fanfiction so I will definitely check out that story you posted.

On the Way to Greatness is fantastic. Unfinished though, not sure if the author is still updating or not, either they are but they're doing so slowly, or they've stopped, which makes me sad.
