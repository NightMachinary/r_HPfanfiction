I feel like I butchered the title...

Anyway, I find that sorting through your favorite author's favorite story list is a great way to look for fics. Of course there's also the author's own fics. So here I am asking you, who is/are it/they? And why?

Active authors are those who have published at least a story for the past year and have been regularly updating. HP and HP crossover authors only, please. Thank you.


** A few worth checking out: The Carniverous Muffin, jacobk, Newcomb, Kwan Li, Myst Shadow.

Honorable mentions to Tsume Yuki, Steelbadger, Chim Cheree and Muffliato.

Also I'm not sure whether you would consider Taure or Mira Mirth active writers, but they reliably update their stories once a year or so. So there's that.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4404355/kathryn518][kathryn518]] They, a female duo, created linkffn(I'm Still here by kathryn518) that I've been following since its fourth chapter, but recently they've put that fic on hold and is regually updating a Starwars the Clone Wars/HP crossover with the protagonish being Ashoka who tags along with a super duper super Harry. But they have promised to return to I'm Still Here and their Twilight fic sometime. I liked Harry in I'm Still Here because while he's a super Harry in that one aswell he makes human and understandable mistakes.
