  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

*** I mean it does say God-Like Harry right on the tin. It has some cool ideas, but gets a bit bogged down in over explaining if I remember correctly.

**** I don't think it has bad explaining /per se/ but a liiittle bit too much embellishment and glorifying of every thing Harry did to the point where if Harry ate a potato , the shit he made of it would be hailed as a bloody artefact

It is kind of annoying how it ends but who even cares

**** I'll read smut every now and then but this story and it's crossover ASoIaF sequel are pretty good. Over a million words between the two of them.

I find it better to skip over the smut to get back to the actual story!
