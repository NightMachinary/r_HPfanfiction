** These will be interesting to peruse. I sometimes have trouble visualizing what things mentioned in canon or fanfiction look like, because I've seen only pieces of the first movie and none of the rest.

** Do you maybe know if there are maps also? For Hogwarts, ancient house manors, MoM, etc?

*** [[http://www.polyvore.com/harry_potter_paper_quills_maps/collection?id=690405]] here's an album that has one or two maps. I'll try to find more. If i do find them they'll be from different sources. Did you just want pictures or a compiled album?

**** Maps in any format would be very useful, as far as they are legible. And thanks for the general thread too---you're right that details like this can be very important to better imagine the environment of the story.
