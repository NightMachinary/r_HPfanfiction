** There was a crossover with Dresden where, due to the existence of the fairy court, some of the powerful artifacts from canon had been revisited and made both more powerful and darker. The Mirror of Erised, for instance, actively ensnared those looking into it and was extremely difficult to resist to. It also showed the darkest desires rather than the deepest. The invisibility cloak (the true one) was almost alive, it enveloped the wearer like a second skin and was controlled by thoughts. It was also able to attack and eat an enemy, leaving nothing behind.

I dropped that fic for a variety of reasons, but those parts were really good. It made the fic feel unusual at times.All those powerful artifacts were also very dark and often dangerous to use.

In Enembee's By The Divining Light, I liked Dumbledores backpack, which had been charmed by Dumbledore beyond the usual limits of magic (Which he could only do once) so you could pick any mundane object out of it including food (obviously, without having to load it up beforehand). It would also work in environments where usual magic didn't work or was even dangerous to use. It seems really useful.

The Wand is extremely blood thirsty and only desires more bloodshed (so it has no master beyond whoever wields it at the moment)

The Stone creates shades who's sole goal is to get the user to kill themselves.

The Cloak induces Suicidal Overconfidence in its wearer.

*********** If i were gonna set it up so that the Hallows are mighty but horrible...

We've covered the Cloak. Invisibility, maybe even intangibility, at the cost of seeing deaths everywhere while using it. I also like the idea of the Cloak being semi-autonomous, like Dr Strange's cape in the latest movie. Going by the legend, it may make one immortal too, so long as the owner wants to be.

The Stone would have the ability to summon the spirits of the dead and speak with them, even interact with them(ever wanted to fuck Helen of Troy?), but the cost is the endless whispers of the dead, urging you to join them, trying to make you second guess yourself, and question the motives of everyone around you.

The Wand would be unstoppable, no spell could be blocked or cancelled by another, but the cost is that there is always someone trying to take it from you, by force or by deceit, even if that someone has to be driven to madness by the dead first.

Combined, they might not contribute any additional powers beyond the norm, because they are already powerful enough. If I was going to give them one, it'd be a peace. The Stone no longer whispers, the Cloak no longer causes visions of death, the Wand no longer inspires enemies to seek it.

************** Not necessarily, It could make you realize that you'd better seek your own power instead of relying on and running after powerful artifacts made by others.

The thing is, this is some pretty dark power to wield. Those things always come at a price. The wisdom to not be blinded by it and seek power elsewhere seems a very good lesson to learn. Not because it's power and power is bad, but because their powers are a lie, that leads you to your doom.

The guy that would have spent years to gather the Hallows would suddenly realize that he has found something else he didn't know he was after. He would take a new look at all those years and grow from it. Maybe, the 3 Hallows combined could give the wearer some magically enforced epiphany that would allow them to grow and accomplish what they really want to accomplish without needing the Hallows anymore.

But basically, the idea of someone spending years gathering and using the Hallows, with is mental health and his life at risk, only to find out that they're useless now that he has the 3 seems deliciously ironic to me. Though now that I think about it, I do prefer the other solutions instead of the last.

I know where you're coming from though, and I would agree that just making it the kind of wisdom bullshit you describe is actually pretty awful. But that's not really what I had in mind. What I had in mind was that such dark artifacts should probably screw the user just one more time. Or at least make him realize that what he seeks is not here.

*************** The Cloak pushes you towards being afraid to use it or uncaring about death, easily suicidal. The Stone tries to make you suicidal, isolated, and hesitant to act. The Wand makes you always hunted, with no indication of who it might be, pushing the user towards paranoia and isolation.

There is a theme there, one in which those with a weak will won't survive for long, either falling to their own hand or that of another. The combination of the three is meant to retain the power of the Hallows while alleviating the downsides, meaning it would need someone strong of will to gather them together in the first place.

***************** There's also the consideration that someone that possessed strong enough will to resist the downsides of the Hallows would more than likely also possess the wisdom not to overuse them.

After all, the Cloak at least doesn't influence the owner unless it is being used(or at least using the invisibility/intangibility effect). Maybe the whispers of the dead from the Stone would fade away after a certain period of time if it wasn't used, until the Stone was used again and the whispers return(they last longer each time it's used?). The Wand might not inspire another enemy if it's not being used(the wielder would probably have another wand to use, after all) or if the previous enemy was defeated without using the Wand.

Making the Hallows acknowledge the wisdom of their proper use is, imo, a better way to incorporate that idea than to make it a sudden thing once you have them all.

Actively making him more and more paranoiac or overconfident and thirsty for power or withdrawn and suicidal, for instance. Something about the price of a power you never earned versus a power your own. And the idea that shortcuts are dangerous but can sometimes lead you farther than you would've gone without it. In this case from the first type of power to the second by reuniting the Hallows.\\
There's also the idea that the power of the Hallows could have been strengthened by adding this type of way out of the curse.

It will look after you, provide you whatever you need to survive. And as you walk, in its walls you'll see images and memories.

** The Anatema Codex in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) and the Sorting Hat in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived)

*Anathema Codex:*\\
A collection of 12 (?) spells so dangerous and to the world that the Ministry doesn't even risk sending you to Azkaban. Each spell is pure "Wild Magic" and way more dangerous than any Unforgivable. You just get chucked headfirst into the Veil. Wizengmont, and its equivalents in other countries, were created to enforce this ban and, eventually, hide the knowledge of the Codex's existence.

This is a really neat piece of worldbuilding that adds so much more to the fic. "Wild Magic" (ancient magic from a time before) is a big part of this fic, and the Anathema Codex is a great bit of mystery and lore.

*The Sorting Hat:*\\
In the Lie I've Lived, he doesn't just sort kids. He's a full blown character with emotions, wants, and a hell of a lot of sarcasm. I've never seen another fic do this (take a throwaway artifact and make is a main character) but the Lie I've Lived does this perfectly.

***** The second one also comes from HPMOR, the third one is an HPMOR meta-fic where Harry transfigures himself to give himself more magic, and blows up the entire Earth to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. Not sure what it's called, someone else might be able to find it.

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

At this point I'd like to rec a short fic I found amazing. Both silly and brilliant. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5136938/1/Innocence-and-Roses]])

Has weaponized portkeys, though a little different from what you describe. Won't spoil though.

**** There is an upper bound on the mass of a star. The heavier the star, the faster its fusion reactions go, and although it has more stuff to fuse, the former grows much more quickly than the latter. Stars about 100 times the mass of our sun go massively supernova after only a few million years. At some point beyond that, it would supernova more or less instantly.

The idea there was to conjure a couple hundred solar masses of water, which would collapse under its gravity, then massive supernova.

This was from one-shot off of the fic with the Pioneer plaque being a Horcrux, and HP thought the supernova would be enough to destroy the Horcrux (it would definitely be sufficient to vaporize the plaque). He pointed out he could imbue the supernova with Fiendfire in any event, IIRC.

** I liked the named artifact in linkffn(The Marriage Stone). The artifact revealed who a person would be best suited to marry. In the beginning it is explained that using the artifact isn't always the best idea, since if you are already married, you could potentially see someone else. I thought the idea of the artifact's power was an interesting way to usher the main plot of the story.

** The Power of the Mind by Landstradd, Harry has a number of cool things like a Ring Focus Primarily set for Shield Spells, a Staff like Focus that while Ampping his spells burns his skin off which clears up why Wizard would use Wands rather than Staffs.

I don't remember the story but the Slytherin Locket was a Magical Battery useful in Rituals and stuff, so Harry I think transfers or breaks the Horcrux enchantment to make use of it.
