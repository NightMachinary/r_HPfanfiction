Like when he drops Quidditch because he "only really did it to fly anyway" (which is some bs right there too) and becomes super-studious and overly formal because for some reason that's what happens after you date Hermione in fanfiction...


** Actually, no...

At least not without a decent explanation. Being more studious, thats something that always happens. But downright giving up on the things he likes... can't remember ever reading that.

But seriously, yeah, though there's a lot more to Percy's character than studiousness and formality. He actually /is/ the authority-worshiper of his generation.

** In order to make the pairing work, you have to make one or both of them OOC. And one of the most frequent changes is Harry suddenly becoming more studious. And suddenly becoming okay with teasing Hermione when she nags him. And Hermione suddenly being able to perfectly understand Harry's emotional needs. But whatever.

The Quidditch team is probably also due to the fact that Quidditch games aren't the most fun thing to write. JKR openly admitted that she got sick of writing them.

*** Or maybe they can change reasonably based on their interactions with each other. They're pre-teens or teens, depending: either way, changing the way they look and/or act, to please either themselves or someone else, is the most normal possible thing.

If we were to look at Dumbledore back in his Grindelwald-friend days, you might call it OOC that he becomes the Muggle-loving Headmaster of Hogwarts rather than co-Dictator of the Magical world. But people change, grow, learn, and that's just part of being human.

*** I'm not a harmony shipper, but what I don't get is that so many people on this sub have no problem sharing their insight that Harry/Hermione won't work based on a few lines in canon, while they're perfectly okay with canon pairings, even though Ron and Hermione have NO common interests whatsoever and aside from the last few pages in the book, all they do is fight pretty much (and no, that's not attraction). For them to work, one has to be massively OOC and from the epilogue, I think it's Hermione that's lost most of her personality and ambitions. Although to be fair, Hermione is a bit OOC in the last two books anyway.

Ah well, at least Rowling's admitted that they aren't a good pairing. Although I disagree that they need therapy, they need a divorce (or a rewrite).

***** From Hermione's perspective, her and Harry could work out, perhaps maybe better than Hermione/Ron. Why wouldn't it? But with her personality, from Harry's perspective, they could never work out. As one can see from the books, in response to her nagging, Harry starts avoiding, lying, and ignoring, with his last resort being bottling it up and exploding at her.

Those pairings? IMO no. But yeah non-canon pairings can totally be believably done if you change situations or peoples personality. However, I don't believe that H/Hr could ever believably work without the later happening because in canon, with canon personalities they are incompatible.

It was there to show that Ron was Harry's best friend and Harry preferred spending time with him to spending time with Hermione. It also shows H/Hr is impossible without significantly changing either Harry or Hermione's personality. Harry just doesn't find her fun the way he finds Ron and Ginny to be fun.

**** Yeah, I've always said that all Harry/Hermione is inherently OOC. A pairing like Harry/Susan isn't inherently OOC because we don't know Susan well enough to say that she's a bad match for Harry. But with Hermione/Harry, we know full well that they're not a good match. So you can't write an IC Hermione/Harry, even if you pretend the Weasleys don't exist.

Of course, if you're writing an AU where Harry is raised by Remus and has a wildly different personality, maybe you can make it work. But Harry is still OOC relative to canon.
