  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.

** There's a couple threads on this subreddit with some good Lovecraft/HP crossovers. The two that I remember off hand are "It's Always the Quiet Ones," linked already in this thread, and linkffn(9767473) "The Eyes" by Shadenight123. "The Eyes" really nails the psychological horror genre--it's a dark descent down the rabbit hole and definitely not a happy read, but it's definitely worth reading if you're looking for a Lovecraftian Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
