Many years ago, Incubus was the first contact I had with content with such ratings. I followed it up to the last published chapter, and have wanted more ever since.

Does anyone know how to contact the author? I want to tell them that I appreciate their work and maybe find out whether the rest of the story exists somewhere. The story was also published under the name squarerootbeer.

(You can still find an ePub of the book up to chapter 22 just by searching on duckduckgo)


** As far as I can tell, they do have a couple of accounts under a different name. But since the FF.net account has no stories and doesn't allow for messaging, I would assume they don't want to be contacted.
