Most I've read where James lives he's kinda awful or abusive and sometimes the Marauders and Lilly are too.

Lilly I've sometimes seen good in fics where James is dead but she lived but not so much the other way around.

So ones where neither James nor the Marauders nor Lilly ( if she lived ) are dicks.

I prefer like the focus be more on like the Marauders and not their kids if that exists.

Thanks!

no oc ships or ships with a marauder x a super minor character that was like only name dropped once and is basically a oc.

slash is fine


** A Different Beginning: linkffn(4489910)

Sadly, this is mostly a Harry-focused fic, as are most of them. On the plus side, I really like James's characterization as a flawed character but a good dad. Lily also survives but she doesn't actually /show up/ until much later (she's in a coma for the majority of the fic).

EDIT: I just noticed the "No OC ships", and Sirius does end up with an OC in this one. It's not a heavily-focused-on OC though, not the dreaded author-insert-fixes-everything kind.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.

** Might I suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352/chapters/20295151][Storm of Yesterday]] about a widowed (widower-ed?) James and his slow burn romance with a time-travelling Hermione. Very interesting idea and very well-written. James is a great dad and just a nice guy. And the fic is finished!
