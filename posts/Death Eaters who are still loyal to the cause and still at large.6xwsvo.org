I have an idea for a fic set about two months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and I need an at-large Death Eater for my villain. I presume all the Death Eaters who fought in the BoH are either dead or in prison and that the Malfoys are no longer loyal to the cause. Looking at the HP wiki, the following Death Eaters are not confirmed to be dead and were not mentioned as being at the BoH:

- Avery
- Crabbe Sr.
- Goyle Sr.
- Jugson
- Rudolphus Lestrange
- Mulciber
- Nott Sr.
- Selwyn
- Travers

Of these, I think Crabbe and Goyle would be too hokey, and Rudolphus would be too much in Bellatrix's shadow. Do any of the rest stand out as being particularly memorable? I admit I don't remember Jugson at all. Mulciber has the most sinister-sounding name, so I'm going to go with him unless someone can convince me one of the others is better.


** Jugson is only mentioned twice in the series (and in the same paragraph), in DoM.

  Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy --- *Jugson*, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary --- Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right --- *Jugson*, Dolohov, the door straight ahead --- Macnair and Avery, through here --- Rookwood, over there --- Mulciber, come with me!”

If you want to have someone who is not an obvious choice, I would pick him. You can create a new back story, what drives him, why was he in the shadows most of the time, etc.

If not, go with Mulciber. He was mentioned by Lily in /The Prince's Tale/, you can draw some connections to James, Sirius & co. during their time at Hogwarts.

** Mulciber and Avery Jr are mentioned as stereotypical Slytherins in their teens, nothing special. I wouldn't use them. We see Travers in DH. Nott Sr is seen grovelling in GoF. Crabbe and Goyle... yeah. Jugson takes orders from Malfoy in DoM.

If you want a completely blank slate, go with Selwyn. However, I'd recommend using a Death Eater who's been built up a bit.

- Yes, Rabastan and Rudolphus share the same last name as Bellatrix. But they're mentioned in the books as being sadists and dangerous. You could build on that to make them very interesting and sinister villains in their own right. (I think Rabastan could be particularly interesting as the 'second son'.)

- Rookwood is shown to be competent (read his wiki article).

- Dolohov is able and malicious -- he memorably 'slashes' a nonverbal curse at close range.

- You've also missed some older death eaters mentioned in passing. Nott (not necessarily the same as Nott Sr.), Mulciber (ditto) and Rosier went with Riddle when he applied to Hogwarts. Avery Sr. and Lestrange were with Riddle at Hogwarts. These DEs could be older and closer to Riddle, hence privy to more of his secrets.

*** I agree with you, but Rookwood and Dolohov were both defeated during the Battle of Hogwarts.

I did miss Rabastan. I think he might be the right one to use. He was the one whose head kept turning into a baby during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, so readers will at least have a vague notion of who he is without having to rely on the reflected infamy of Bellatrix.
