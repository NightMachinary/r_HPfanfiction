Hello. I've read ff for about 3 years now, and gained many great stories from this forum so I thought I'd recommend some of my favorite stories from all time to here that I don't see recommended too much.

First off is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Skitterleap]] which is probably my favorite of all time. (It's incomplete so I'd recommend not reading if that's not for you.) I love massively AU stories that take tons of creativity, and this is definitely one of them.

Next up is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë]] which I love for the odd bromance of Harry and the hat. Overall just a heartwarming wholesome adventure story. (Also AU, but this one is complete)

Next is another AU set in Grindelwald's rein in Nazi Germany as an Aryan child set to enter Durmstrang. Of all the ff I'm recommending here, I feel like this one captures the essence of J.K. the most. Something about the writing style and characterizations make it seem like J.K. could have written it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]]

Last I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]] which I love for the exploration of magic, and the characterization of Dumbledore as a fallible man is one of the best I've read.

That's about it for now. I'll update later if I remember any others I enjoy. Let me know if you enjoy too!


** Huge second for Skitterleap, one of my favourite pieces of FanFiction. I'd also say that while it's final chapter does end with 'End of Book One' I felt that it told a complete story without necessarily needing a sequel, in fact I had to skim the last chapter to remind myself that it was incomplete.

Forest of Valbone is an amazing stand alone adventure story too, if you love those young adult stories where a boy survives in the wilderness on more or less his own abilities then this is a great story. Also has one of my favourite Luna lines ever written right at the start

** Skitterleap is pretty much finished. There was a sequel, but the author removed it because of how different it was from the first story, and how much of a drop in quality it was.

** I always get annoyed at the translation of "The Greater Good" into "Das Größere Wohl", since it is actually how the /official translator/ did it.

It should say "Für das Höhere Wohl".

But anyway, I definitely second Magicks of the Arcane and Forests of Valbone.

** The Nazi Germany one does look really good. I will definitely read that one.

** Each to their own, I've been reading hpff for about as long and find most of those to be unreadably bad.
