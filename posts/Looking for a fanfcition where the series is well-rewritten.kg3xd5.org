** The Mirror of Ecidyrue series. Basically Draco's conscience goes back to when he's 11 and everything is rewritten from his point of view. It tackles Draco's growth as a character, going away from his prejudiced views. He lives through the events of Harry and the others lives during Hogwarts, but... It's never the same thing. Harry's mental health issues show a lot in the 5th book of the series, also it shows how they get out of the graveyard on the 4th. It's drarry and mostly Draco focused, still being written. But i like it a lot, if you give it a go, I hope you like it

****** The Slytherins are always fun to look at, to be honest and their relationship is just good on book 5. But it is fairly angsty. To be honest tho? At times I feel like authors will placate the characters anger way to easily and it doesn't really happen here, so it feels a lot more real. It's not really something to read exclusively to have a good time tho, being progressively darker. I just can't seem to atop bc I'm really curious about the mirror and the wand.

** I'd like this a lot. Through the series you have some sort of character inconsistency(like Ron not knowing about the dark mark, but knows what mudblood means, plus he grew up in the wizarding family who was in the Order). I'd really like an close-to-objective-as-it-can-get-with-the-given-material(cause you always have a favorite one who you more lean to, for JKR it was Hermione and you can see it lots) portayal of characters. Not to bash on the series, or the fanbase, but it had an influence on the community(and on the series as well, *cough cough* Kloves *cough cough*) where they outright bash Ron(who is smart, witty, and quick on his feet), Ginny(which could have been also a great female role model for the kids), Molly(even though she kinda deserves criticism), or totally overpower Hermione(don't get me started on that, the one person deserving criticism). Its hard to write flaws, cause when you go into it, you can come up with situations in canon where you cant get out. For instance, Hermione could have died in the Ministry battle, due to her panic and dumb move to silence, instead of confund that Death Eater/Battle of Hogwarts/Bellatrix torture/troll in the first year, Ron could have died in the ministry after the incident with brains/DH after splinching and blood loss/in HBP after poisoning/Chess level/troll in the first year and Harry, who could have died in the graveyard/in the forest with spiders/in the forest in DH/troll in the first year/suicide after Cedric and Sirius died/battle at the Ministry. It would be hard to remain friends with Hermione through the realistic approach of the series(she is kind and smart, but she is a proud, close-minded, bossy, my-way-or-the-high-way-type-of annoying person), even after the Scabbers/Firebolt/Opugno incident, I see no way how can Hermione be friends with Harry and Ron(after Scabbers and Firebolt maybe, but after Opugno assault probably never, unless Ron being Ron downplays it for the greater good cause they need her).

#+end_quote

I don't think any of that is character inconsistency. "Mudblood" is clearly used as a playground insult and he's probably heard his older brothers being indignant that a Slytherin called one of their friends it, so he picks up what it means. But the Dark Mark and stuff to do with Voldemort just doesn't seem to be discussed openly in wizard society, and Molly definitely wouldn't be the type to discuss such things with her kids when she thinks it's all over. Also just to note the Weasleys weren't in the Order the first time and that's explicitly stated in OotP.

Oh c'mon, teenagers fight all the time (especially when there's sexual tension they don't know how to deal with like Hermione and Ron).

How is the Scabbers incident unforgivable in the long run, especially when Ron has the information that the rat was Pettigrew all along and Crookshanks realised? How is the Firebolt unforgivable when Harry gets it back and deep down he knows she's right - it absolutely could have been cursed. Should Hermione have sent birds flying at Ron's face? Probably not, but Ron shouldn't have used her the way he did from GoF onwards and then used Lavender to make her jealous and rubbed it in her face.

True. But Ron was never an abuser.(he was immature, and a part sometimes, but he was raised well). He maybe called Hermione a know-it-all, but friends do tease each other sometimes, there were many times he stood up for her, and there were less times when she stood up for him.

Well Hermione doesn't have empathy(or doesn't show it that much, being lonely as pre-teen, not having friends before Harry and Ron). We saw it with Lavender's rabbit, and we saw it with Scabbers(where Ron constantly asked her to place her cat away from his pet). I said maybe cause in a realistic scenario Peter would have escaped(and faked suicide) as a rat from Hogwarts as soon as he realized that Black entered the Gryffindor dorms(Peter is a coward and would rather try to escape than to stay around Hogwarts, he would be even safe, since Dementors do not feed on animal emotions the same way as they do on humans, Sirius used that way to escape Azkaban). Hermione is prideful(firstly she didnt want to even consider that her cat ate Ron's pet, even though the evidence was there), it took Ron's approach(and of course Hagrid's advice that friends mean more than brooms and pets) after their fight for her to say that she is sorry for what happened(using the canon as material). Maybe Crookshanks would have caught him anyway, but that we can't know if he leaves the grounds.

Place yourself in an abused 13 yr old mind. Your best friend went behind your back when you got the coolest thing ever after you broke your favorite thing before(the same things are in the matter, but this one is newer and better). Harry is not so mature/emotional mature person due to abuse with the Dursley's that the movies made him. It is not hard as the Scabbers one, and Hermione had the best intentions, as we the readers know, and it was returned to him afterwards.(Harry knew Hermione meant well, but he was still angry with her).

#+end_quote

Ron had a crush on here since Year 3-4(maybe even Year 2, but I think that Hermione had a crush since Year 1). Ron was insecure(being the youngest male child, he needed to prove a lot, and he had an inferiority complex) and when he realized that there is no way that he can end up with Hermione(cause she likes to build a wall around her attraction to Ron, for the fear of rejection). I mean like she compliments Harry in front of him, never gives him a compliment or any sort of validation and approval(even when he actually kinda mentions it), thinks Harry is fanciable, tells Ron that she is allowed to bring guests to the Slughorn's party(it's not an invitation to a date), and then Ron finds out that Hermione that she dated Krum(which devastated him), and after that the downplaying his Quidditch skills cause of the Felix Felicies incident(Ron had every right to be mad at her), he chooses to pursue Lavender(And I still think that he thought he was using Lavender because he didn't like like her, but he wanted to have some experience with girls, cause Hermione was a lost cause). Hermione used Ron for a tease a lot of times(writing a long letter to Krum in front of him, just so he can ask her to who is she writing that essay to), just to see his reactions to confirm that he still fancies her(she knew that McLageen would offend Ron, and she told Parvati in Ron's presence that she really likes GOOD Quidditch players). Then she uses Oppugno to attack him(and everyone downplayed it, Harry downplayed it, Ginny downplayed it). That whole bird moment would have been interesting and we could have seen Hermione dealing with guilt of what she's done, Harry feeling guilt for not interfering and Ron, dealing with the fact that the love of his life attacked him or being the better person and forgiving her for it(not to mention not reporting it in that time, a muggleborn attacking a pureblood, it would have been a scandal). JKR basically needed to poison Ron in order for Ron to realize that Hermione likes him, and to bring back the trio together.

I believe that a lot of people see Hermione either through Emma Watson(who is beautiful and charismatic, which book Hermione isn't that much, even JKR stated that) or through the prism of the Golden Trio friendship(duh, that is whats the book about), and yes, that shows her positive and negative sides(which is amazing). But if it weren't for Ron(who liked even spending time with her alone, cause when Harry is training or at detention they spent time together alone) and Harry(who already said that he likes to spend time with Hermione but she isn't Ron) being her friends, Hermione would be the worst person to be around(well except the Draco bigot gang), cause she doesn't have social skills, she thinks that she is superior cause of her book knowledge(not disputing it also,she is a smart cookie after all), and is in fact very annoying(you could see that in the first book before they became friends, imagine you are in class and you don't know how to do something and some one snaps at you how to do it), not to mention a future tattletale(I could see myself being nice to her, but close friends not at all).

Basically Harry and Ron saved her from her own fate in canon. I was merely saying that in an realistic AU universe, where we portray characters without author favorites, it would be really hard for them to remain friends after Scabbers/Oppugno "demise". But it would have been interesting to see how would they reconcile again.

**** Hands down, I agree with you on the Rob's knowledge point. But sexual tension? They just disagree, people can do that and their relationship is actually almost competently written. Sixth year? Yes, but before that was a lot more complicated. They were growing up, and Ron was actually starting to see Hermione as a girl, and he's not exactly good at not thinking he's worse than everyone else. Also, let's please be kind to Lavender, and assume she's not a moron and Ron was at least somewhat into her. To assume otherwise diminishes both characters. He didn't rub it in anyone's face, she just was jealous. To sum up, Ron was into Hermione, Hermione went with Krum, peace, then Ron thought Hermione wasn't interested in him, so he dated another girl, Hermione wanted to be with Ron.
