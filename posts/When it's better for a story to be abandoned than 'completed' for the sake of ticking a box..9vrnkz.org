Just finished reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10236556/1/The-Soul-Within]] and man, what a journey.

It's an absolutely GREAT story from chapters 1-23, engaging plot, varied subplots, nice characters, and interesting ritual magic system. Loved it. But I was getting worried you see, I was on chapter 23/25 and the story seemed like it was nowhere near done?

Well, I got to chapter 25 and the story really wasn't all done.

Suffice to say, if there was ever a story which showed that sometimes it's better to just straight up abandoned a story than 'end' it for the sake of ending it, it's this one.

Clearly the Author has their own reasons for not being willing to continue it when they finished chapter 23 (arguably the last decent chapter) maybe they were bored, maybe they had no time, maybe their account got hacked and someone else fucked over their readers with a shit ending, who knows?

But if there's anything even WORSE than a shitty /boredom/ ending on a great story, it's an author claiming that it's the natural ending and they 'had it all planned' so you shouldn't be mad. Like, what the fuck? Is obvious to anyone that reads it that the ending was NOT meant to be like this, literally NO plots ended, the author just killed the MC and said 'yeah, it's realistic, we don't always get what we want' hahaha.

If I want my soul crushed, I can read Antithesis, at least the author puts care and effort into emotionally destroying me there. This ending was just lazy and then given a shitty excuse. And it's actually complete! (though I've not finished it yet, got a bit to sad for me so Im gonna have to get back to that)

Makes me so mad. Had to vent, I really felt like I wasted a lot of time and feeling when I got to that ending.

PS:sorry if I got lost writing this and it wasn't coherent, on my phone.


** Hmm. I've never let a stories activity or completion status stop me from reading it. Infact I go out of my way to avoid looking at weather a fic is complete or not. I'll figure that out when I run out of chapters to read. This has lead to me being overly disappointed about discontinued fics ending, but I'd be sad about that either way, and I'd rather read it not expecting it to end.

** I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I thought I should add on. Sometimes I've sent a message to the author on a discontinued fic to ask them what they had planned on doing to finish it. I've done similar with obviously rushed stories, and although I don't get anything written by the author, sometimes it's incredibly fulfilling to me to at least know what they were planning or where they were going with it. Its incredibly difficult to write a super exhausting or emotional story, sometimes authors give up and never finish because they find they out the hard way. I'm not trying to excuse them, but once in a blue moon it's nice to understand why people dropped such good ideas so quickly. I know that if I didn't have such a good fanbase and people helping me along, I would have fallen short with Antithesis.

** If you don't mind having a good read, even if you know it's not a complete story then read chapters 1-23 and stop there. Your imagination CANNOT be worse than 24 and 25.

If you want to read a good story and then be insulted by the author because they got bored but still want a 'complete' fic so more c peeps pick it up read chapters 1-25.
