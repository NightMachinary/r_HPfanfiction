I'm currently reading the Sebastian st cyr series of historical mystery novels and I'm looking for a Harry Potter based murder mystery series hopefully written similarly. Does anyone have any suggestions?


** Here's a good one. The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks by Paimpont linkffn(6243892) It's not a murder-mystery per se, nor is it a series (it only contains 36K words). It's good though, and I highly recommend it

** Hm, closest to that really are the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Sherlock-Crossovers/224/7190/?&srt=4&r=10][HP and sherlock crossovers]],

An example: linkffn(7578572) A study of magic wherein Harry is raised by Sherlock, though they somewhat nerf Harry- since, lets face it, a Harry Raised by Sherlock would destroy anything in his path, so they made him ill and gave him a limp from some explosion he saved Watson from.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
