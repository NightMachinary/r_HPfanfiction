** Harry/Fleur:

Self-promotion: Nymphadora's Beau\\
linkffn(10256543).\\
I am still writing it, just can't promise when I'll update.\\
Others describe it as somewhat of a crack fic, but it's not intentionally so. I just write what I find fun.

Some generally seen as good fics:\\
Never-ending Summer linkffn(3606379)\\
Summer of Change linkffn(2567419)\\
Haven't read these myself for fear of inadvertently copying from them...

*** I don't mind the self-promotion much since I like the work so much. My only annoyance is that it is incomplete. Hope it is updated eventually, but in any case I'm glad you haven't just disappeared off the face of the planet like authors of so many incomplete works.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons.
