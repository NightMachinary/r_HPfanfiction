I was reading Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir for the first time, and while fun a little to much is put on to the Smut part, and too much importance is put on the idea that All Harry's bondmates aren't Normal Humans. And while much of the story is basically good, there are things I would change things I would stretch some Smut parts I would do away with.

So what Comedic or Smutty or even Romantic Fluffy story would you love to see done with a more action or dramatic or tragic way?


** linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel)

Harry, an Unspeakable and alcoholic, travels back to the years when the first war with Voldemort is heating up.

The original fic is a little thin since there aren't that many chapters, but with a premise like that, it just begs to have a serious remake. I'd love to see a cynical, fucked up Harry Potter going around in undercover Rust Cohle/Crash-style on the past, trying to take down Voldemort and his pals. Of course, if there's going to be any influence from /True Detective/, things won't end neatly or well for all the characters involved.

*** I was so hopeful for this one! I think the incredibly fast rate at which it got popular intimidated the author or something, honestly

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** Harry Potter and The Sword of Gryffindor. Sex based magic as a cultural aspect would be interesting IMO.
