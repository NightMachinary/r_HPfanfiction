The Malfoys making him punish himself made him gain so much skill in the art. Dobby is also insane. Find me fics or write prompts.


** I remember that the Dobby in "I still haven't found what I'm looking for" by Kathryn can be quite creative. Like hanging some pirate slavers on the walls, but on the outside of the ship, while flying. He also gets a lightsaber I think? Anyway, it's a great fic.

** It's not the usual meaning of being skilled at torture, but Dobby in "Enter the Dragon" uses self-punishment to keep his mind alert and aware of the injustice of his enslavement, instead of letting himself slip into an obedient fog.

** Out of curiosity, is there a list anywhere that compiles the different tortures Dobby/other house elves have been subjected to in canon? The only one that I recall at the moment is the ironing-his-hands one.

~goes looking~

Ears in the oven door too.

*** Sure, only two things mentioned, but where's the fun in that.

Besides, isn't it fun to have a scary Dobby.
