** I tend to dislike prompts like this; that ‘historically defining event' or ‘scientific discovery' was won or helped by Wizards or some such. It becomes eerily reminiscent of British Imperial dogma, that the ‘white man' was superior and had a duty to bring ‘civilisation' to the ‘savages'.

Just a thought.

*** What about they try to help but keep mucking everything up so the Governments just kinda throw them at each other and hoping they stay preoccupied?

*** I see what you mean. But I meant more like there were Wizards on both sides as well, and the British ones assisted their muggle counterparts better than the Germans. I did not mean to imply Wizarding superiority, merely the difference in methods and tactics.

** Dragons participating in the Battle of Britain are mentioned in the very fascinating and very disappointing (and very unfinished) “One World by Stellar Magic” linkffn(8993792). Agent Kim Hunter of MI-5 who investigates the Magical World from the outside is one the best parts of the story.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
