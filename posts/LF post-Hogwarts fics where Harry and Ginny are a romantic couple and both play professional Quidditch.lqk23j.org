They can be on the same team or different teams. I think the dynamics of either scenario would be fun to read about.

This means not Loose Cannon which I do enjoy, but is not exactly what I'm looking for.


** There is a fic called Reversing Course , where from what I remember Ginny starts as a quidditch player and switches to being an auror and harry starts as an auror and switches to quidditch - it's not quite what you are after but is really good.

*** Thanks! I'll take a look. I'm not one to turn down a rec on a really good fic.

** My current story (not published yet) starts this way (both play Quidditch and they are a couple), but it will not end this way ðŸ™ˆ

** A Cannon's Harpy

It's not my favorite fic, but it is genuinely super well written. The reason it's not my favorite is just preference, but it is good.
