Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Would rather not have character bashings. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is usually a no go.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  She sometimes forgot that she and Regulus were two distinct people, separate from one another. It was hard to tell where one of them ended and the other began; they bled into each. It had been seven years. Of course they had a little of the other in them. Of course it hurt when the other wasn't there anymore. The separation could have been a day, an hour, a minute, and Grace was sure it would have hurt the same---a cleaver sailing straight through her soul, severing it into two.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
