So yeah. That pairing.

I'm interested in it because I have never seen it before. I never read one, especially not during the Marauder era in Hogwarts. The dynamic between Sirius and James would be interesting when Sirius is the one stealing the heart of Lily, or being the target of her affections.

But as stated in the title, I'll take anything. I just want to see that pairing written for once.

There is exactly one Sirius/Lily story that is somewhat decent (does not involve cheating or similar themes). It is a smutty one-shot where Sirius gets punished with a strap-on...

Which probably says a lot about [[http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/HMS-Barham-explodes-595x433.jpg][the state of that ship.]]

** There's one where Lily and James split up cuz of reasons (James is a douche) With a WBWL setting and whatnot. linkffn(12365803)

It is H/Hr with Sirius/Lily on background, and probably Luna/Jack (Harry's brother)

Know this. James is a massive prick, and so is his kid. Harry is a pussy most of the times, but then he growls balls.

** I love this pairing. Here's two.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2819982/1/A-piece-of-sun][A Piece of Sun]] is a short one where Sirius/Lily have feelings for each other but Lily/James is also there.

[[https://siriusxlily.livejournal.com/12723.html][Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]] is longer and set before James/Lily.

** Five Times Lily Doesn't Kiss Sirius (4565421)

It's a one shot, and could even be considered canon. It's really sweet and portrays the relationship between Lily and Sirius really well.
