I've had this plot-bunny in my head for years, but I'm never going to do anything with it, so here's the general idea in case anyone might get inspired to write a fic:

- The Ministry for Magic still exists and so does the Minister, but he's basically a puppet for the Goblin Emperor or King. Basic day to day operations are still in the hands of Wizards and Witches

- The newspaper is called the *Daily Profit*

- Goblins are allowed to carry wands, but only very few attend Hogwarts (because of the animosity)

- To enroll in Hogwarts the opening of a Gringotts vault is required. I imagine this would be accompanied with the handing out of some kind of anti-Wizard propaganda pamphlet.

- Dumbledore is still Headmaster, but Flitwick is Deputy, not McGonagall. In general Flitwick acts more self-assured and he'd be a key character of the fic. What are his loyalties? Does he lean more towards his Human or Goblin heritage? How does he react when he learns that Dumbledore hides a Philospher's Stone in the school, which would be highly sought after by Goblins. What is his relationship with Goblin students? Maybe they don't like him and see him as a pariah...

- There's plenty of room on how independent Hogwarts remains. I can imagine a board of Governors with a few Goblins or very little to no involvement.

- There's a slight cultural shift in society: Greed is seen as less of a bad thing and the Weasleys being poor is a big deal (they are much worse off and looked down upon not just by snobs). This could go as far as institutional castes enforced by the government. Overall a strongly meritocratic society, where the primary merit is how financially exploitable your abilities are. The Weasley twins becoming inventors is a big deal for the standing of their family.

- Voldemort is still an insane maniac, but he gains the additional sympathy of Wizards who want independence

- possible endgames: (a) Another Goblin/Wizard war because of the rising resentment and oppression. (b) Overcoming a common threat (Voldemort) and Wizards winning some kind of independence (c) Status quo

There's probably a lot of stuff that doesn't quite add up with canon and needs to be considered. The devil is in the details.


** Do you require a 90s scenario? I have something in mind, but it'd be in the early 70s (dawn of the first war).

*** Not really, but I think the 90s is more interesting (as it involves Harry) and if you throw time travel on top of it it might be a bit much to digest.

** There actually used to be a pretty common cliche where goblins did win a war. It essentially was based around the premise of "If wizards won the war, then why do they let goblins control their money?"

Someone who asks that question is going to be in for a rough awakening if they ever pick up a history book - though unlikely considering their apparent aversion to history.

Can I steal this idea for a story of mine? xD
