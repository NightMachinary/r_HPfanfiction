I'm currently reading PotDK and am enjoying it thoroughly. One thing that has given me a painful pause though are the pairings.

Ultimately I don't particularly care /that/ much about who ends up with whom, but so far it looks like the author is mirroring the Canon pairings, using incredible contrivances and suspension of disbelief to do it.

I'm on book three, and although I'm not entirely certain, it looks like a ginny/Harry pairing and a ron/Hermione pairing are being shoehorned in.

It's entirely breaking my immersion. I didn't want to look it up, out of fear of spoilers, so a specific question here seems like the safest option.

Does Ron end up in a romance with Hermione, and does Harry end up with ginny.

I don't want spoilers per se, but I'd really appreciate a confirmation or otherwise of those two things.

Thanks
