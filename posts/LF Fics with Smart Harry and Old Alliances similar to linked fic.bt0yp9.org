So as the title suggestions I'm looking for other fics that are similar to this fic: linkffn(8988776) Breaking Habits by TheIndigoRaven. I'm specifically looking for fics that involve a Harry that had suppressed his intelligence until recently and comes to find out that his family was part of a group of other families that had an alliance of sorts. Bonus points if Dumbledore was hiding these families from Harry and if Harry transfers out of Divination into another class ie: Runes. (Clearly really liked the story I linked sad its apparently abandoned) Pairing wise I'd rather it be Het only please just no Hermione.

** I would have suggested FurySerenity's works on AO3, but all have either Harry/Hermione or Harry/Hermione/etc.

**** Most common would be an OC, Harry's either younger or twin sister Rose. Other would be Luna, Susan Bones, Dephine Greengrass, Tracy Davis, and a few others I can't quite recall.
