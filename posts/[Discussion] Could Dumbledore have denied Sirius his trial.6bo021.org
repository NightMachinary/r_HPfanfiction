linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) has an intriguing idea: according to this story, Dumbledore was the one who arranged for Sirius to be sent to Azkaban straight without a trial. I must emphasize that it's /not/ a Manipulative!Dumbledore story; he is depicted in exactly the same light as in canon. His reasoning was that, as Sirius was a Death Eater and a pureblood, he might manage to get acquitted at his trial (through 'I was Imperiused' defense or other), in which case he would have guardianship of Harry --- and Voldemort's right-hand man having Harry in his custody is a bad, bad thing. So Dumbledore pulled strings with the Minister and Madam Bones to try and get Sirius straight to Azkaban.


** It's an interesting idea, Dumbledore does say that he gave evidenced against Sirius. So he did have a hand even if unintentionally in sending Sirius to Azkaban. Furthermore I could definitetly see that Dumbledore's evidence would be valued enough to convict without trial.

*** The fact that Dumbledore gave evidence implies that there was some kind of hearing at which Sirius' guilt was decided. Sirius states that there was no trial, but of course he wouldn't know the difference between no trial and being tried in absentia.

Trials in absentia are in fact legal within the English legal system, albeit unusual. They are allowed for reason of illness of the defendant, or misbehavior, or abscondment. Magical law may have its own provisions, but it's possible that Sirius' absence was justified on the basis of illness: remember that he was widely considered insane, and as such might have been deemed to lack mental capacity.

Indeed, from what we saw in GoF, all Death Eater trials were conducted with the defendant absent. Karkaroff, Bellatrix, Crouch Jr, Rabastan and Rodolphus were not present for the presentation of evidence or argument over law. They were only brought into attendance to hear their sentence. So trial in absentia may be standard in the wizarding world.

In any case, it's important to recall that it was Barty Crouch Sr who led the trials of Death Eaters by the Council of Magical Law, not Dumbledore, who was a regular member of the court.

** It's ... unlikely, to say the least. Possible, but very damn unlikely.

What some people do not get is that, no matter Madam Rowling's many mishaps with consistency when writing certain things, there actually is a basis in the British law for what Barty Crouch did, and while there are still questions one would likely ask before accepting that possibility, these are not without answers that would not point to Dumbledore.

And, since we know it was Barty Crouch who made the decision, the version put in that story (assuming the idea you propose comes from it) is simply impossible as Amelia Bones would have no input on where Sirius would go, and neither would Bagnold; heck, we don't even know if Bagnold was on good enough terms with Dumbledore for him to have any hold over her. So for it to happen in any way Albus would have to convince Crouch to do it, in a situation in which Crouch felt like letting Sirius go---which is unlikely at best.

Assuming you do not go for “J.K.Rowling did not know shit” as the answer to this particular conundrum, one would have to take into account the information we do have: that the ministry was operating under wartime laws in 1981, that the law giving law officers the ability to pronounce someone the evidence of whose guilt is overwhelming and obvious guilty without a trial during wartime is most likely there (it was a part of British laws for a fairly long time), and that the actual trials of the Death Eaters were mostly a publicity stunt for Crouch---what with his son being one of them---and there wasn't much of a point in having a trial for an “obviously guilty” gibbering wreck of a person (who could also have garnered sympathy from people because of his lamenting which would have put Crouch in a bad light). While Albus could have had a hand in it by providing evidence, for what the evidence is worth because being a secret keeper of a secret not kept well is not a crime but merely a red flag for the person's character, I feel that his actions there didn't really serve to change anything for Crouch would have done the same even without him.

*** I'm not wondering about whether it might be the case in canon (I know Crouch made the decision there); I'm wondering whether it makes sense /in the story/. I didn't mention it in details, but there's a pretty solid non-Crouch-related explanation for why Dumbledore had the authority to do that in /Vaults of Stone/.

**** I cannot say whether it makes sense in the story for I have not read it, but you have this: it can only make sense if the story actually gives a reason for Bones and Bagnold, rather than Crouch, having the power to decide about Sirius's fate. As the story supposedly (based on the summary) diverges after the events of Halloween of 1981, I am kind of doubting that this is the case, but if it actually is a thing then that is that.

And that applies to every story that is not fully AU with the whole world rebuilt, really; in those, sure, the author can do whatever they want with their world, but if the world of any given story is based on the canon one then there needs to be a reason for such a ... discrepancy, as this.

** I'm not sure I buy the whole "Sirius would raise Harry" thing. Sure, in story, we see Dumbledore just dropping Harry off with the Dursleys. We don't know what kind of procedure was done in doing that, and it's easy to assume nothing. But, at least the Dursleys were qualified (and I use that term very losely.) Sirius is a single male, 21 years old, no experience with kids or a family or any idea how to raise one, no job that we know of, with a murky background. Handing an infant to this guy just because someone's will may or may not suggest it seems like a crazy thing to do, and I could see it being very easily disputed.

*** Not because of someone's fanon will --- because of the fact that, canonically, Sirius was Harry's /godfather/. The whole /point/ of a godparent is (or used to be, at least) that they'd raise the child in case something happened to the original parents.

*** He sent for Hagrid to take Harry for the ruins in Godric's Hollow. Due to a plothole Hagrid took more than 24 hours but supposingly Hagrid arrived at Privet Drive 1st of November. I am not sure about your country but I doubt that the office dealing with custody is open around midnight. So he clearly did not go through the official channels.

*** I disagree. My son was born when I was 20 years old and, while my circumstances weren't ideal, I was (and am) able to take care of him. Obviously not every case is the same, but there's no reason to believe that someone who is "21 years old, single, has no experience" is incapable of caring for a child. Unexpected pregnancies happen to millions of people and, should Sirius have been willing, wasn't in prison, and the Potters' wills had actually named him to be Harry's guardian, there's no reason to suggest it could have been "very easily disputed".

** - Part of the fault of Sirius imprisonment lie with the Potters. They should made some contingency plans if something like that happens. Although I don't exactly remember if they were aware of the prophecy or not. What they expected? That Voldemort would die of an old age and they will live happily ever after?
- Nevertheless, Dumbledore knew that Sirius and James were best friends and like brothers to each other. He should at least investigate why would Sirius betray him.
- It is possible he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot even back in '80s. And even if he wasn't, he must knew that there was no trial.
- To the whole "custody of Harry Potter" thing - With the exception of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Hagrid no one even knew where Harry Potter lived for a ten years until he came to Hogwarts. It says something about Dumbledore intentions. He even admitted it to Harry in the fifth book when he told him the prophecy.

In my opinion Dumbledore isn't evil or bad or something like that. He did exactly what he had to do in order to defeat Voldemort. In great scheme of things it was masterfully done.

Anyway with no updates in four year it's pretty safe to assume it's abandoned.

** Sure, but that basic idea is hardly new. It's almost the default for manipulative!Dumbledore, as it certainly makes sense that Dumbledore at least could have /prevented/ his lack of trial, so why not go a step further to make Dumbledore even worse?

It's harder to attribute it to good!manipulative!Dumbledore, but you do an excellent case for why he might see the need to do it - that is actually a first that I read that.

*** It is impossible to look at Dumbledore's actions in canon and conclude that he's a good person. The manipulative Dumbledore trope is merely a conclusion when the supposed greatest wizard of the century does nothing while a bunch of kids have to save the day.

Unless you want to argue that Dumbledore simply lost his mind in the seventies there is no logical explanation for his faults. Sure, everyone makes mistakes but he missed

Voldemort possessing his teacher for a year,

Missed a giant snake roaming his castle,

was instrumental to a severe miscarriage of justice,

Did the same thing again,

missed a Death Eater impersonating his friend,

did nothing to stop Harry's participation in a bloodsport,

let his students be tortured,

withheld strategic information that got people killed and injured,

used completely ineffective tactics in the war he was waging which lead to even more deaths,

admitted to accessory of child abuse and torture while not seeing anything wrong with this,

let at least one terrorist (Draco Malfoy) stay in his castle and try several attacks that ended in severe injuries close to death,

Did nothing to gain vital information from Slughorn (Veritaserum, Felix Felicitis, conventional interrogation methods)

Withheld strategic information again,

Relied on child soldiers

Tell me, how can such a person be anything but either senile or a manipulative bastard?

**** And you forgot the very first example in canon. He left a one year old child on a doorstep for his relatives and new guardians to stumble upon in the morning. Even if you assume that he took precautions to ensure that baby Harry did not freeze to death, wasn't eaten or carried off by some animal, or didn't just wander off himself (and that's being very charitable since it isn't mentioned at all) that's grossly irresponsible behaviour, especially from a government official. Sticking purely to canon, I think he's mostly a bit senile, but he had to be written that way because Harry et al could not have had their adventure if all the adults behaved responsibly and rationally.
