Being relatively new to fan fiction, my small mind has a hard time wrapping my head around non canon relationships. There are so many and I have limited time but I'm open to something new.

Can you please recommend to me a pairing you like, why you like it and a fic that does a good job representing it.

Thanks!


** Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks have always been my favorites, but the good stuff is few and far between. Isn't really surprising when you're talking about a legitimate part veela/triwizard contestant, and an auror seven years older than him.

Why do I like them? Well, H/F always seems like a "what could have been" pairing to me. My favorite book has always been Goblet of Fire, and many of the H/F fics are rewrites of that. Fleur also goes through quite a bit of character development in the series (even if most of it is off screen), and I always thought it'd be cool to see that front and center. Fleur also brings a whole cast of characters with her (naturally her family, her friends) that are otherwise completely unknown to us. There's just tons of stuff to work with there.

For Harry/Tonks, I've just always loved the Tonks character, and despised what happened in book 7. Not only that, but there's just enough things in common and differences to keep the idea interesting. That 7 year age gap is pretty gigantic for Harry at 15, but it can be worked around. They're both fighters, both incredibly passionate about getting what they want. Tonks also brings her own cast of characters with her, though obviously we're already exposed to many of them in the original books.

That said, I likes what I like. So here's the good stuff, hidden in between the garbage.

Harry/Fleur:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by Jbern

#+begin_quote
  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
#+end_quote

Everyone knows this fic, everyone has read it. Personally, I consider it more popcorn reading than anything else. Harry is practically a Mary Sue, but Jbern really makes it work. It's just /this/ side of hokey, that you can't help but enjoy it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] by E.C. Scrubb

#+begin_quote
  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
#+end_quote

Probably the best of the Harry/Fleur stories. You see a gigantic jump in quality around chapter 6, and it's all uphill from there. Scrubb just takes forever to update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter & The Wastelands Of Time]] by Joe

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
#+end_quote

This is another one of those fics that I feel like everyone is read, and I'm always shocked when I go back and realize it has less than 4k reviews. It's worth reading even if you /hate/ Harry/Fleur, that's how good it is.

Harry/Tonks:

For H/Tonks, just about everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1824855/chelseyb][Chelseyb]] is great. I could recommend at least four of her fics, so instead I'm just going to let you discover them yourself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] by Silens Cursor

#+begin_quote
  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
#+end_quote

The best of Harry/Tonks, for sure. Great plot, really interesting magical mechanics, just overall great. This is one of those fics that you finish and say "That could have been an amazing published series".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] by Shraydrall

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. In a body that once housed two souls, only one remains, and it's not exactly what began either. With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will. Post GoF.
#+end_quote

Going to be honest and say that I have no idea how this one will end. That said, there is plenty of H/T in it, and the fic is worth reading regardless of the eventual ship.

I know there's more, but that's off the tip of my head. It's a small list, but every single one of the fics is on my must read list.

** Harry and Luna make for a surprisingly good pairing most times I've seen it.

Sometimes she's batshit crazy, sometimes they both are, often enough she's just a zany cryptologist, several times she's just faking the whole thing using it as an extreme way to avoid most people. Regardless, she's often hilarious as hell in them, and after the life Harry leads, he could do with quite a bit of levity.

**** Harry and Luna is the pairing that makes most sense to me. Both have troubled pasts and feel to blame for someone close's death. Both have been ostracised by the majority of the school and have had to deal with being bullied. They're both nice people and need to heal. Rowling could've had Luna join the hunt after the whole Malfoy manor malarky and turned her into a main character. Luna doesn't care that Harry is the boy who lived and that's exactly what he wants and needs, Harry can see past her quirks and see her for what she is. I will never understand why She paired Harry with Ginny.

** That's a pretty broad question. Almost any pairing can be good in the right context, if it's written well. I mean, never in your wildest dreams would you imagine that Harry/Narcissa Malfoy could work, in any way, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2127558/1/Narcotic_Effects][Narcotic Effects]] does it with style.

There are examples like that for Harry/practically every female (and male) HP character.

I completely agree. However, I am super skeptical about some pairings. While I see plenty of recs from redditors of non canon pairings, Im not sold on the idea of most of them. Thus my request for GOOD recs that could help broaden my mind in that aspect.

I have never considered a Harry/ Narcissa Malfoy pairing. Thank you for the intriguing recommendation.

** Hermione/Sirius. Now before you swat at me or run off, give me a chance. What I'm gonna recommend are stories where time travel is involved, so there's little to no age gap.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny][Roundabout-Destiny]] . " Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better." It is NOT Hermione Granger as she is in canon. This is Hermione Potter with Granger' memory and influence, and it's a DAMN good story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][one hundred sixty nine]] . " It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir" I absolutely love this one, and this was the first one I had read that I felt like was worth recommending outright. Funny parts, sweet parts, Wtf reread did that really just happen parts...

I love this pairing with and without the age gap. Of course it has its problems, but since we didn't get to now Sirius all that well in canon, there's a lot of wiggle room, and just enough of a personality outline to build on. It's got its cliches and tropes, but honestly, what pairing doesn't?

Also the Reddit app I'm using is confusing and I don't know how to do url in markup, so messy post ftw.

** I actually wouldn't rec a pairing. :D I'd recommend stories with strong storytelling (likely in a similar year-by-year format to the books) and let you figure out from there if pairings or storytelling are more important to you. :)

Especially with the stuff that splits off earlier in canon- either a full 7 year AU or splitting off after book 3-4- it's very easy for a writer to take things in a slightly different direction- Harry/Hermione and even Harry/Luna are pretty darn plausible at that point. (As anyone who was on some of the fic mailing lists back when books were coming out /coffHP4GUcoff/ will remember- there were GIANT FIGHTS with huge chunks of canon quoted to justify various viewpoints :P). Ditto some of the non-Harry pairings (Sirius/Remus is fairly doable splitting off from this point- Harry's an oblivious enough narrator for it to be plausible).

** I'm not good at explaining the whys of something, especially things I like. For the most part with pairings, it's just a matter of "I like Character A and I like Character B, and this story happens to have them in a relationship and is well written." Not denying that there are pairings I come back to repeatedly, but chances are I like those pairings a lot because (a) I like the characters involved, individually; and (b) I read a well-written fic that made me like them.

Beneath You /also has some background Ron/Pansy, and is probably the fic that made me open up to the idea of 'anything goes if it's written well enough'. Both of them are written pre-OotP so expect multiple non-canon elements./
