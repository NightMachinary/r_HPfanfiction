** Just to be clear, when I say "Magical Burnout" I don't just mean actual burning is involved. Yes, that can happen if you constantly use fire spells, but a lot of the symptoms of Magical Burnout can be muscle degradation, shortness of breath, internal bleeding, bruises, weakness, sluggish thoughts and severe pain that can heighten over time to be near Crucio levels.

*** InwardTransience has a similar idea in her fics - Using magic physically damages the caster's body, and you build up a resistance to it over years of spellcasting. Careless witches and wizards can potentially kill themselves by pushing their limits too far too soon.

** This could be pretty hilarious.

Harry begins dating xx: a connection formed initially because they can't feel pain, and they discover they can heal one another.

They get injured doing couple's activities and they have to point out to each other when one of them is injured. Their friends stare in morbid horror.

-

''Harry, your finger...''

Harry blinked and looked down at his and Daphne's intertwined hands: one of his fingers was dislocated at the knuckle, poking out at an awkward angle.

''Oh. Must have knocked it on something.''

He sighed and popped it back into place with a muted crack. Daphne lifted their hands and kissed it gently, correcting any possible complications of his impromptu healing with a brief, fiery glow.

''Thanks, love.'' He paused. ''By the way, I think I caught your lip by accident.''

''Nuts.''

Harry reached up and tenderly wiped away the blood with his free hand, and he assessed the injury with a critical eye. ''Just a nick.''

She smiled at him impishly, brushing a strand of hair away from her cheek. ''Kiss it better?''

He rolled his eyes and pecked her on the lips, ignoring the tangy taste of copper. The cut knitted itself back together with a tingling coolness and a quick pulse of blue.

Hermione's mouth was agape and her eyes wide.

** Brain does not compute: If there is no core, then how would you burn out? Wouldn't you be feeding off the latent magic in the area? Also, is it how much you use or long you use it? Example- Say Levitation spell requires x amount of magical energy. You do it continuously for an hour before burning out. However, say Bone brealer requires three times as much magical energy. Using it straight for five minutes burns you. Which does more damage to your body?

*** Essentially, in my mind, when you use magic you're not dipping into some reservoir that is exclusive to you. You're drawing the magic from the world around you and shaping it into a spell. Magic, again in my mind, is a chaotic kind of energy. While Wizards CAN shape it, if they use too much it can actually damage the body . Think of it like water travelling through a pipe. Over time, that water can erode the pipe and cause damage to it. The same can happen to a Wizard if they are constantly using magic.

The intensity of the spell you're using can also effect how quickly you can burn out. Blasting spells used constantly will cause severe pain after 10-20 minutes. But you could indeed keep a levitation spell up for about an hour before they start to feel discomfort.

Honestly, when I thought this prompt up I was thinking of the classic saying "Magic always has a price" and it would be interesting if modern day Wizards made up the idea of a Magical Core to warn others off from expending too much magic.

** I see it kinda like a muscle. It's not that you "run out," like draining Mana out of a reservoir/water out of a bowl, but that you fatigue and can't sustain the same level of activity.

** LOL Grindelwald with no concept of pain tolerance would actually have made him super terrifying. It'd make Voldy almost demonic. For Harry... it'd be another addition to his already existing angst train.

** So, to invoke gaming terms, instead of having something that is functionally an MP gauge or a Stamina meter (that needs to be refilled by rest, food, etc.), you have a "Harm Meter" that fills as a function of the MP-value of the spells cast per unit time (e.g. if you cast less than some amount of magic in an hour, nothing happens, but the more you exceed that barrier (which probably varies somewhat from person to person), the more damage each additional unit of magic used damages the caster.

Of course, one needs to consider what kind of damage is being done...

*** Yeah it would be like magic use drains HP instead of MP, and as your magic level increases, you can both use higher level magic, and magic below your level uses less HP.
