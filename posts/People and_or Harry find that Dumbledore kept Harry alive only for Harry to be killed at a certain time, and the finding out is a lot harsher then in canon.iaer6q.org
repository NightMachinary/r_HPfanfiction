** It would be interesting if Harry and Dumbledore are on the same page, but nobody else is.

â€‹

cue a regretful Dumbledore explaining to Harry about how that is why you have to keep secrets.

*** That'd be really interesting. Or even a Harry that dislikes what Dumbledore did, but is still working with him.

** People tend to misunderstand this. Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to survive. But in order for that to work, a very specific set of circumstances were needed.

*** "Very specific" that he wasn't even necessarily sure was going to work, he had hoped of course, and because of the books written, it was able to go to those circumstances.

**** Sure. Even still, he was trying to give Harry the best chance possible. If he didn't care, he'd have just ganked Harry as soon as he figured out the boy was a horcrux

***** I love Dumbledore, I find him quite fascinating, him and Snape are like these Shakespearean type of characters, real tragic. But yeah, Dumbledore made mistake after mistake, and the way he dealt with Harry was yet another mistake. Though it wasn't 100% his fault, of course, just the circumstances at hand were all tilted.

**** He wasn't sure it was going to work, but the only other alternative was Harry 100% dying.

What else could he have done? He couldn't leave the Scarecrux alive because he (and more importantly, Harry) would have never stopped to fight Voldemort. So either he quickly killed Harry during on of their meeting to be done, or he put in place this convoluted plan to give him a chance.

***** Killing Harry quickly would have been better, since he wasn't 100%, plus raising the child, only in his mind to kill him off later is awfully cruel.

He had no idea that Harry would survive, though he had hoped.

****** Dumblefore didn't "raise Harry to kill him off later". When he first placed Harry at Privet Drive, Harry was (for Dumbledore) just a newly orphaned kid that had somehow vanquised Dumbledore. Even the prophecy was not something he truly cared about (outside of how in would influence Voldemort moves).

He placed Harry at the Dursleys because they were convenient. The presence of Petunia would maintain the protection granted by Lily sacrifice and keep Harry safe, and it would also mean that Harry would be raised far from his fame (and people wishing to use him).

While he knew that Voldemort had somehow survived (and was hiding in Albania), Dumbledore wasn't sure about what method he had used to survive. Until the end of CoS when Harry brought him the diary. It is probably around that time (between CoS and GoF) that Dumbledore made the link between the scar and an Horcruxe. By that time, Dumbledore was already attached to Harry who was pretty grown up, it's not like he could kill him out the blue (not to mention all the troubles that killing "The Boy Who Lived" would bring.

At the end of GoF, Harry told Dumbledore about how Voldemort used his blood to come back, and this is where Dumbledore found a little chance to safe Harry ("hint of triumph in his eyes").

Also (from what I remember), he could not tell Harry anything about his plan because Harry needed to be willing to die in order to survive (like he needed to wish the stone without wanting to use it in PS). Telling Harry that he needed to die by the hand of Voldemort in order to "maybe" survive may have destroyed any chance he had to save Harry.

Finally, I just want to point that, from what we know of Dumbledore, he is not the kind of person that would kill an innocent child just because he had some suspicions. He would probably have murdered Harry himself if he found himself forced to, but he would not have made that choice until he had exhausted any other option.
