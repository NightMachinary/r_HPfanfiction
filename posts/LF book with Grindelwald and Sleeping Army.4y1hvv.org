It has been a while, and the little bit that I can recall is that Gellert Grindelwald had a sleeping army of soldiers that were awoken when he escaped/returned? My searches have turned up nothing. Thanks!


** Oh, I've read this, but it's been years. Might be linkffn(5150093) but I don't remember.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
