I'm not sure how best to ask this, but just imagine the story being mostly laughs but then next chapter Harry's lying in a pool of blood on the verge of death. That's a problem because there's a huge change in the mood of the story. But I also kind of need those bad things to happen for the plot to move along.

Do you have any tips for combining comedy and drama (if that's the correct term) in a more seamless way? Or should I avoid darker themes altogether if I'm writing a mainly comedy story?


** Foreshadowing and misdirection. Scrubs did this the best. You could be laughing hysterically one moment then crying the next. It was an emotional roller coaster but if you looked back you could see the clues mixed in with the jokes.

** Life is funny and sad and dark and fluffy and exciting and painful, so don't limit yourself to one genre. Handling the shifts in mood is tricky though.

I can't say I'm the best to advise on this, but sometimes the shock is the point.

** This was /exactly/ my problem two years ago. Funny, light story for 20 chapters then suddenly DEAD BODY (if you're interested, last section of [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=482708&i=1][this chapter]]). The more foreshadowing you have, the better, but you might not have that available to you if you largely write as you go, like I do.

I like the Scrubs example if you're familiar with the show. It has absurd humor, but very real stakes and at the end of the day, it's a hospital and people can die. And they do, sometimes.

Give your serious scenes time to breathe. It's ok to be not throw in a joke for a long stretch of story for the buildup and fallout of the scene. If you want to shock, the characters still need to react appropriately.The humor can turn darker for awhile, or even permanently. Writing these scenes are tricky--the chapter above was definitely amongst my more difficult ones--but totally worth it, if it's what you want.

** Dark things are good. If you want people to be /at all/ invested in your characters or plot in any significant or meaningful way, you'll need a struggle and bad things.

I'm no writer, so I can't give you much advice on how to go about doing so, sorry for that. Perhaps try showing your world is gritty/realistic from the start.

** I'd say mix it. Show light-hearted and dramatic things. Mood shifts, especially combined with scene shifts, do work - provided they are not too extreme. Going from slapstick, anime comedy to deep, dark angst and back is often too extreme. Going from comedy to drama and back often works.

** One way to do this might be to have lighthearted chapters, bam a dead body scene, then some vignette flashbacks within the same chapter to help seam over the transition?

Or have a separate scene at the beginning of each chapter that's removed from the main lighthearted storyline, but seeks to add elements of darkness/foreshadowing/danger.

I'm not a writer, so this advice might be useless.

*** Well this advice is useless...

A fic or ane prose story is not a movie where you can just add a flashback scene. A reader needs more time to read a scene in text than a viewer of a movie needs for the same scene. Those flashbacks directly interrupt you just created mood and the scene entirely just to add a flashback scene.

Another thing would be the creation of a narrative frame around the story. I mean moving the result of the chapter to the start before flashing back to what happened leading to this result. Might he hard to accomplish right but it's an idea.

A technique that would help just as well would be a cliffhanger changing the mood considerably before ending the chapter. Mixing in some foreshadowing and I think you get the mood changes done.

That was the idea behind the second suggestion I had. Thanks for clarifying!

I wanted to participate in the discussion, because I found it an intriguing question. I did caveat my comment with a disclaimer. Thank you for providing additional perspective.

** A really jarring mood shift is less about what's actually going on in the story than the way the author addresses it.

JKR handles this, for the most part, really well---"Kill the spare" can exist in the same book as Moaning Myrtle hitting on Harry because it's all filtered through Harry's conscience and JKR's stylistic tendency of setting the world just a little off-kilter.

It's about what you pay attention to and how you're telling the reader to perceive it.

One potentially useful heuristic: *Did this seem like the kind of story where death existed as a possibility before this moment?* This isn't about the mood so much as the constraints of the world---you can tell a really melancholy love story that clearly doesn't have the specter of death in it, and you can write a light-hearted adventure that does. As future dead people most of your readers will see death in a way that can unbalance your story---make everything else seem unimportant by comparison---if you've spent a lot of time worrying about comparatively trivial things to this point, or not demonstrating any care for your characters' wellbeing. (Provided you want people to care about the death.)

One of the things that's made people come back to Jane Austen for 200 years is just how good she is at this. She constrains the scope of her characters' concerns so tightly that all these otherwise insignificant character interactions---who danced with whom, and what she was wearing, and why they were invited /here/ but not /there/, and what Auntie meant when she said it this way instead of the other---feel incredibly important. If we got through 300 pages of delicately observed dinner-party conversations only to have her witty protagonist portkey into the ballroom with her dead mother in her arms, it would kind of seem like Austen was burying the lede.

I think that's what people are picking up on with /Scrubs/. The show makes it clear over and over---through Zack Braff staring into space, the choice of music, the hospital setting, the blunt-instrument foreshadowing---that even at its most ridiculous, the show has the possibility of death in it. (In the HP books I think the same effect is achieved with his parents' violent death and the viciousness of the Dursleys---have a great time flying on your cool broom and making friends, Harry, but we already know somebody is trying to kill you and you're going to have to deal with it at the end of the book.)

** I don't think your readers are so fragile that a shift in tone will really jar them, unless you've done like the first 20 chapters a fluffy love story/comedy and then suddenly, death. If they think they're reading one type of story only for it to turn into another, maybe. But you can talk about some serious stuff in between the comedy to kind of make it clear that it's not just a crack or fluffy story beforehand.

** One of the ways to do this, IMO, is by changing the tone of your humour. Light, fluffy comedy should be mixed in with drama, but never the kind that makes you bawl your eyes out. What's it that they say? 'Camp and tragedy don't mix'? If you want really heavy-hitting dramatic scenes, I'd recommend making the tone of your humour darker and less absurd, so that when something happens, your reader will respond naturally, since the characters' senses of humour have been prepping them for these scenes.

** If you don't want to ruin the comedic feel when adding in corpses and bad things, just add in some dark humor.

AurorHP finds a dead body. Sadface. But wait! Its a Malfoy, suffocated when the pile of muggles he was torturing collapses on top of him. or. That poor little kidnapped schoolgirl. Found at the end of a trail of blood, where it is discovered that 1. She was a carrier for some sort of magical flesh eating insect. 2. She was found in time to cure the thing before they hatched and ate their way out of her cooling corpse, but the men who assaulted her were not.
