TL;DR basically the events that happen in the original story that ALSO happen in nearly every fanfic taking place in the same story, like /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ has the visit to Diagon Alley, the trip to Hogwarts, and the troll attack on Halloween.

For me, the most annoying one is from /Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/, specifically Harry and Ron stealing the Weasley's Ford Anglia after they're blocked from the platform, which seems to happen even when Harry is clearly aware of alternatives.

Also, I don't normally find myself annoyed about the troll on Halloween, but one fanfic I'm reading had Hermione cry all day in the bathroom after being badmouthed by Ron, for being a know-it-all and not having any friends. The issue I have with it is that in this particular fanfic, at that point in time, Harry and Hermione have been best friends for /years/. It would have made more sense for her just to go to the loo during the feast because she had to go.


** Regardless of how skilled Harry is and how his past life went, Pettigrew always managed to hit him with that Stunner.

*** Yeah, that can be annoying. Sure, people can be caught flat footed, but he was in the middle of a deadly competition and probably should be wary of anything until he knows he's safe.

I remember one fic rather cleverly circumvented this by having a stunning spell tied into the portkey.

** None of them really bother me as long as there is some twist to it. The troll attack is fine, but having the club get levitated and drop in its head each time gets annoying. Have a teacher stop it. Have one of them get injured during the scene. Have the entire Hufflepuff house show up and overwhelm it with dozens of stunners to safe a Hufflepuff Ron who then manages to accept that he was put there and not Gryffindor.

*** In Raolin's The Fires of Magic Harry is taken away from the Dursley's to monastery where he is trained in mind, body and a different style of magic. Hermione is still trapped by the troll, Harry arrives (followed by Daphne, Tracy, and fem!Blaise) and watch as Harry uses martial arts to avoid getting hit by the troll finally killing it with a knife. It's a WIP that I hope the author hasn't abandoned (last update December 2018, last update author's other work March 2019).

** Pettigrew escaping at the end of year 3. In canon, he only escapes because everyone in the Shack was unbelievably stupid. Snape is unconcious and moved with mobilicorpus, but instead of just knocking Pettigrew out and moving him the same way, they decide to manacle him to Ron and Remus and hold him at wandpoint. Even without the distraction of Remus' transformation, there was still an obvious risk of Peter just transforming and hoping their spells missed him while he ran away.

** I'm annoyed by all stations of canon, but the most annoying single use of it was from a Slytherin Harry I read a few years back. This is from what I remember so might not be exactly right but it's also probably close enough.

It got to year five, and by the end of the year, Harry had already figured out that his dreams were about the prophecy and likely a trick by Voldemort. Then, he goes to the ministry for an unrelated reason (I think to meet Amelia Bones because /of course/), after which Harry decides to find a cafeteria for lunch. He then got lost and wound up in the fucking department of mysteries somehow, at which point he was like, fuck it, I want to see the prophecy /even though I know its a trap/. Queue end of year five battle. That was the last straw from that fic.

*** Kind of reminds me of a fanfic where Harry was tutored by Alastor Moody before the events of /The Goblet of Fire/ and part of the lessons includes a bit of Moody's paranoia, with him teaching Harry a passphrase so he could verify Moody was actually Moody.

Only the events of /The Goblet of Fire/ still happen, Moody still gets replaced, and Harry never catches on. Even more annoyingly, the fanfic briefly takes up fake Moody's POV, in which he complains about Potter constantly using the phrase and having no idea what it means. That's just adding insult to injury. It's like the author made a plot hole, and filled it in by making Harry an idiot.

Someone escaping Azkaban in Harry's 3rd year. If the previous years go the same I'm fine with Sirius escaping. If something happens to keep Ron from smiling in the Daily Prophet it's a problem.

Heh, I recently started reading a femharry fic that basically does that. She does go to the alley but the shopping parts are completely skipped over.

Caught me off guard, but in a good way. It was nice not to see something stupid like Harry getting a wand with a dual core of Basilisk venom and powdered pixie testicles.

  Despite her best efforts, Elizabeth Potter is repeatedly drawn into situations she wants absolutely nothing to do with. People just refuse to leave her the hell alone
#+end_quote

Just a heads up though, Vernon is more abusive here than in canon and the author is pretty good at capturing the affects abuse has on a child.

Notes from the author:

#+begin_quote
  /For the first time ever, I'm including a content warning, for the physical and sexual abuse of a child. (The latter in the form of humiliation, there's no contact, but given the particulars of the psychological consequences I still think that should count.) The only truly explicit scene is October 1988 --- if you don't want to read it, go up to the point Ellie thinks how intimidating this sofa is and ctrl-f to June 1989. It will be an issue through much of the story --- it's not the primary focus by any means, but it does have a long-term effect on Ellie, so it will come up occasionally --- so if you're particularly sensitive to these issues, you should probably give this fic a pass./

** Honestly, I get annoyed every time they fight their way through the traps to the Philosopher's Stone. The Stone would actually have been safer if Harry were not there, plus the security doesn't add up at all; if 11-year-olds can get through, what would stop an adult? After all, most of the obstacles could be removed with either a Blasting Curse or a Killing Curse. And it's all very well for Hermione to say that most wizards don't have an ounce of logic, but that certainly does not apply to Tom Riddle.

And even if Harry has different friends, a different relationship with the teachers, etc, they still usually end up running the gauntlet.

- Why is Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw Harry are in this scene? Canon say it's only Gryffindor and Slytherin?
- Why is the sooooo sneaky and clever Slytherin Harry still jump on his broom to confront Malfoy as a hot headed kid?
- Unlike McGonnagall, Snape hates Harry and doesn't need a Seeker, he would rather drink poison than make an exception for Harry and let him join the Team. Also, the only way he would either gift him a broom is if it is cursed

  We've all experienced moments of dread. A gut feeling that something was very wrong, but Harry Potter has been through so much more than most in his short life and has a higher threshold for weird feelings. Meaning when he gets one, he listens to it. So, what happens when he gets this feeling before grabbing the Triwizard Cup and instead accidentally knocks it into one of the many dangerous beasts in the maze with him?

** Yes, well. I often wonder whether FF authors just don't /think/ about what they write, and that's probably true. Really, the best advice that can be given to an author is to stop at any moment in time and spend an hour just thinking about what they were just going to do. As long as their attempts are serious and not crack, that should get rid of illogical Canon-inserts or bipolar characters because c/p from Canon clashes with own writing. Everyone is able to figure out whether something makes sense or not.

.

The cases where it's most annoying is when stations of canon only happen due to certain character traits -- say, saving the PS, which entirely rests on the fact that Harry is a mix of impulsiveness and implicit arrogance. Stopping to think for even a moment must kill that particular sequence of events, because in no world is “I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.” a reasonable solution to the problem of "I think Snape wants to steal the PS", even if you are 11, and in no world is seeing you are /too late/ to execute that plan (because he got there first) /not/ a moment to stop and reconsider your just-failed plan -- unless, that is, you don't think at all, and are always happy to fight adult wizards.

So if you change it to an AU where Harry by definition must be more prudent and cautious -- say, he got sorted into Slytherin -- then there just is no way that can happen as it does, and authors just shoehoerning a confrontation in there is offputting.

*** Some are more egregious than others. I find it's hard to defy expectations when it comes to the Philosopher's stone, nearly every fanfic I've read involving that period of time, Harry gets roped in, either voluntarily trying to stop whoever's trying to obtain the Stone, or getting kidnapped to be exploited in obtaining the Stone.

One amusing instance had Harry kidnapped, but he had no clue about the Stone or the Mirror, so was unable to obtain the Stone for Voldemort, to his utter frustration.

The example in my initial post is one of the more egregious versions of some event from the book being shoehorned in however. As I noted there, Hermione in this continuity had a best friend in Harry for a couple /years/ at this point, thus had no real reason to believe that Harry would agree with Ron about her, or get that upset.

It is? Why? Do you mean because readers expect this and not writing it puts them off, or do you mean because it's hard find something else to do instead?

Just from a technical standpoint it's the easiest thing in the world to just /not/ do the PS. And once you've done that, you have a blank slate where you can come up with basically anything for a plot.

Anyway, I do consider this one of the most egregious instances, because it's often done intentionally, when writers get out of their way to fit it into their AUs. The Troll thing from the OP I'd put down to not actually thinking about what you are c/p, as I said, so you end up with a two halves (Canon and your own writing) that just don't fit.

** I have a whole list but the worst is Voldemort getting Harry to compete in the tri-wizard tournament.

In cannon this required a lot of setup and basically only happened because Pettigrew was found out then escaped in year 3 and then had months to track Voldemort down and get him a body. And then Barty escaped just in time to act as a double agent.

To say nothing of the difficulties of capturing and replacing Moody, remaining undetected in Hogwarts for a year, rigging things so that Harry would actually end up the winner without being found out and convincing Voldemort that the plan is a good idea.
