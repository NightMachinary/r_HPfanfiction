So after the Battle of Hogwarts, the Ministry forgot that it had been carrying out a genocide, happily went back to its paperwork and Harry, Ron and Hermione join them a year later. Supposedly, there was a clean-up effort and "everything was well" under the new Minister,

I am not buying that. A look in the history books shows how difficult denazification turned out to be since a lot of guilty people were needed to keep things running and were often left in positions of limited power (local government, low-level courts). So it is completely unbelievable that the Ministry did an 180 and all people who committed crimes under Voldemort faced justice. Because that would mean giving everyone with the exception of Arthur Weasley and maybe two others the boot.

So are there any stories where the Ministry did not miraculously purge the criminals with 141% efficiency, many still retained their positions and abuse them to keep as much of the old order as possible.

I am not looking for stories where the Red Banner of the Revolution is raised and there are open battles between Harry and the Ministry. More something along the lines of spy movies or mob tactics, like "Oh, Malfoy bribed his way out of Azkaban? Guess it is time to torch his house, or maybe tear him to shreds in the papers".

No m/m, no Death Eater revisionism/apologism and preferably as little of the Weasleys as possible since I find them boring (with the exception of Ginny).


** I think most of the Ministry got taken out during the Battle of Hogwarts, since Voldemort was sending all his forces to take the school, and we know that his puppet minister was there and got turned into some kind of sea urchin creature by Percy.

The first half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is definitely like that.

Two anti Marriage Law fics have similar plot that involve secret assassinations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536)

The Ministry under Amelia Bones definitely tried to keep the old Order in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), so Harry and Co carried out several covert ops to neutralize remaining Voldemort sympathizers and force the Wizengamot to yield.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

*** This one would have been my recommendation! What a fun read...but the choice of opponent for the Trio (especially Hermione) is strange IMHO (would have used someone like Malfoy - maybe Parkinson or Nott)
