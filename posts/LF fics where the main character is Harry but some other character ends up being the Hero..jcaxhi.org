SO I read this fic where Harry thinks he is all supreme and stuff and it really irritated me so I quit it, but can't get it out of my mind so I am looking for this kind of fic. Where a Self Insert or OC or any other character emerges as the hero, and is truly the hero instead of Harry. (Main character is still Harry, that means the fic focuses on his POV) and how Harry gets jealous and extracts revenge or something like that.

Thanks!


** Looks like your looking for a wbwl(wrong boy who lived) fic; these fics either give harry a sibling(usually a twin) or Neville is the hero/presumed hero.

Antithesis comes to mind, as does Prince of Slytherin (as some of the more popular and recced fics), but theres so many out there that you could feasibly find specifically what you're looking for by narrowing down tags

*** Not exactly. I am looking for one which like focus on Harry. For example till 4th year the fic focuses on Harry, who is the Boy who Lived. Then an OC comes in fifth year who is, like more matured then an average teenager. For example, he or she is one of those kids who is smart but doesn't act like that. Like teachers compare him to Hermione but he never scores up to the grade, but is smarter and graps concepts faster. Is more magically powerful, Snape approves of him(though he will never say it aloud) and stuff. And ultimately that OC defeats Voldemort instead of Harry.

Damn.... I can't explain. Nevertheless, just link in any fic where an OC join Hogwarts after 4th year, and/or during 5th year.

Thanks
