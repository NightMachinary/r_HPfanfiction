I remember reading this story a long time ago. It has Harry storming a vampire castle, and he meets a girl who accompanies him to the throne room. I think she might have carried a hammer, but I'm not sure.

So in the throne room he gets attacked by the boss vampire, who thinks he's going to have an easy time because Harry can't use magic for a reason I can't remember. Except, oh snap, Harry partially transforms into his incomplete dragon animagus form and kicks the vampire's ass. "Incomplete" as in Harry's still humanoid, but he gets a strength and speed boost from it.

This might have been cheesy as hell, I honestly can't say, but I remember my teenage self being totally impressed.

Anyone remember a fic like that?
