And if Harry were to find the lamp what do you think his three wishes would be ?

And if you were to get a three wishes from a genie what would yours be?

I would probably use my first wish to make it so the genie could not make my other two wishes monkeys paws or long cons so the genie could not screw me over and others stuff to that effect and granting the wishes by what I mean not necessarily what I say after all translating a wish from thoughts into actual words thing could get lost in translation. And also make the genie tell me if part of my wish could not be granted in the way u wanted it to. And make it grant the wishes to the best of its abilitys

I would probably write a whole list on a but of paper and then use the first wish to make the genie have to follow the rules for the others two wishes.

My second wish would probably be for a set of working dragon balls so I can get more wishes or do you think that would count as wishing for more wishes?

Looking back I have probably put two much thought into this

Edit:I am leaning toward no otherwise Tom Riddle would have used one to wish for Immortality,and eternal youth.

That is another question what do you think Voldemorts three wishes would be if he found a genie lamp?


** We know Genies/Djinns exist in some capacity in the Potterverse, but what they're like, no one knows. I'd take them to be something like House-Elves, having powerful magic and who can be enslaved to wizards' will through weird clauses (in House-Elves' case, as long as they're not presented with clothes; in Genies' case, if they're put inside a bottle or a lamp). Either way, it's unlikely they have all-powerful magic of the sort seen in the various /Aladdin/ stories.

*** I agree Genies/Djinns were not Nice like the Genie from Aladdin and I am pretty sure in some myths they were tricksters if not out right malicious. which is the reason I would even use a wish to make sure the other 2 couldn't be Monkeys paws better safe than sorry.

** The theme of HP tends toward /not quite what Muggle lore says/, so I'd guess not. It also has some bits of subtle magic, and I think genies would be closer to that than to something litigious that can be munchkinned.

*** Still considering Genies/Djinns in some of the myths were tricksters if not out right malicious.

It would probable best to try and cover your ass to the best of your abilty with the first wish so as not to get screwed over.

You wouldn't want to be the person that wishes for Immortality only for your body to keep ageing so you end up in immortal in a body with all sorts of age related health problems unable to die.

** Maybe not Djinn precisely, but there might be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit][Ifrit]]... which is apparently djinn, but powerful and malevolent. Well.

As for one hidden away in the RoR... not likely. A djinn would be hella valuable, even if not exactly useful. I can't imagine they're easy to catch, at least. Probably a bit below Nundu tier.

*** *Ifrit*

Ifrit, efreet, efrite, ifreet, afreet, afrite and afrit (Arabic: ʻIfrīt: عفريت, pl ʻAfārīt: عفاريت) are supernatural creatures in some Middle Eastern stories. In Islam, this term refers to the most powerful and dangerous Jinn.
