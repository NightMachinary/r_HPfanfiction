** There's one fic I saw a long time ago which this prompt reminded me of. It doesn't /exactly/ fit, but during the final battle Harry and Voldemort do get whisked away somewhere foreign where they do grudgingly work together to survive/escape.

It's also a Tomarry fic, so. Idk how you feel about that.

*** My main problem with that pairing is the fact that Voldemort was 54 when Harry was born. Unless they're both immortal, and several hundred years old already, then it's really, really uncomfortable to read. The only way I can tolerate Tom/Harry is if it's either time travel to make them a similar age, or Diary Tom (whom I still refer to in my head as Wizard Trotsky... Thanks Carnivorous Muffin...)

Thank you for the suggestion however, I appreciate it nonetheless.

  An unexpected twist during the final battle has Harry trapped inside a magical artifact with only his greatest enemy for company. The Carcerem will release them, but the requirement for freedom is an impossible one, for neither Harry Potter nor Tom Riddle will ever forgive the other. --- Spanish Translation (Thank you DraInu!) can be found here. Chinese Translation (Thank you Kylinaive!) can be found here.

** They have to fight against an dark Albus dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. In time, they realize the similarities between the two, and grudgingly accept that the other is skilled in their own ways.

*** While Harry and Tom vs Albus and Gellert is an interesting idea, it's not quite what I have in mind. More like the two of them are stranded somewhere where they are totally alone. No other humans to be found. Alien worlds or alternate planes of existence or even in the distant past before mankind arose/the far future after we've killed ourselves off. They're forced to watch each other's backs in an entirely hostile environment, meanwhile also dealing with their tendencies to try and kill one another.

** There is somewhere one in which Harry escapes from graveyard with faulty portkey and ends up another world/pocket dimension. After Harry returns he sends Voldemort there, once he returns Tom is like "f/ck this s/it, I am going to retire!" And they team up in order to figure out who created said world and beat them up.

** That would be awesome! Have them teleport to different planets randomly, like in Quantum Leap. Then, they find out how to get home, but they arrive just as Harry's curse hit's Voldemort. Meaning, Harry had this epic adventure with his arch-nemesis, and it only exists in his memory.
