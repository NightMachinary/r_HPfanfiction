I love this ship to death (although only in fanon!) but I've read a lot of the fics out there. Can anyone recommend any good ones? Even if I've read them already it will have been a good while ago and would be fun to reread :) Thanks!

** The serpents bride is pretty good. Old fic, but hey.

*** Ahhh you are amazing! I just finished Three Thousand Days of Innocence a few days ago and I might have read A Marriage of Convenience (it rings a bell), but I haven't heard of most of those! Thank you so much :D

As for recs, I really like a lot of the stories on the Fire and Ice Archive (if you haven't heard of it - it's a site solely devoted to DG fanfic, check it out!) - I'm currently reading [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewstory.php?sid=4481][Hesperides' Apple]] which is pretty good, and I love everything by [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewuser.php?uid=116][Anise]] (although warning - most of her stories are years old but unfinished).

***** :O You are in for a treat. Their standards are quite high (they read stories before allowing them to be submitted) so they only have good ones posted. You may be glued to the computer for some time :P

** I've never read one I enjoyed as a main pairing, but several where they are a background pairing (usually when Harry winds up with Hermione).

Likely the reason you got zero response was because nobody can think of any off the top of their heads. If YOU can think of any good ones where it is the main pairing, I might be convinced to try it out. . .

*** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/sarea_okelani/KB01a.html][Kissing Booth]] is *hilarious*. And short.

[[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewstory.php?sid=4386][Crossing Into Chaos]]: /Completely AU. In a world where Voldemort was never defeated, only a few things matter: pureblood, money and power. All that Ginny Weasley wanted was to survive her 7 years at Hogwarts, a school where the children of the richest and most powerful wizards dominate over others. Denying her natural instincts, she managed to make it into her 6th year without offending any of the cruel and powerful Slytherins - especially that horrible Draco Malfoy. Until one day, she crosses a line, and her peaceful existence is shattered forever. A story filled with adolescent drama, clash of the classes, angst, jealousy, ridiculous pride and love triangles (and squares)./ This is possibly the most fun to read D/G fic out there :D

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3043746/1/Not-Quite-Fate][Not Quite Fate]]: This is one of the first D/G fics I read and I've reread it so many times. Heart's Cadence is a fantastic author.

*** Replying to this now to remind me to find you some good ones. Any genre in particular? Adult or clean?
