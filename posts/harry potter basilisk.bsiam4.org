why didn't Dumbledore know that it was a basilisk in the chamber of secrets if it happened 50 years ago and people where petrified then, then they would have seen that it was a giant snake that did that to them so all Dumbledore had to do was ask those students what the last thing they saw was


** I don't think I've ever read that people were petrified the first time around. Only Myrtle's death, by unknown way. There are lots of magic that can kill, even without leaving bodily traces. He knows it's not Hagrid, but wasn't headmaster and possessing an acrumantula in a school is grounds for expulsion anyway.

As such, when the petrifications happen the second time he has no reason to suspect a basilisk. He has no reason to even suspect that it's done by the same cause. No one save riddle had ever seen it, and to suspect a 1000 year old basilisk as a cause sounds almost like a Luna theory.

It's Harry's parseltongue that gives the necessary clue. Without, the suspicion that it is not actually a magical beast at all is much more reasonable.

** Most likely explanation: useless adults trope in children's literature

Most likely in-story explanations:

- evil!manipulative!greaterGood!Dumbledore who wants to test Harry.
- incompetent!senile!Dumbledore who is too dumb to do some basic detective work (such as asking Moaning Myrtle some basic questions) to clear Hagrid and neutralize this extremely dangerous threat to Hogwarts students.
- Completely uncooperative Moaning Myrtle who absolutely refuses to answer any questions from Dumbledore.

** Do we know for a fact that he did not know it is a basilisk? Its been ages since I read the books, so I am not sure. Not much he could have done anyway, since he had no clue where the Chamber was.
