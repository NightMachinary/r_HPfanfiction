So in the spirit of revisiting middle school fandoms during quarantine, I've been rereading some of my bookmarked Drarry fics, and the ones where Ron, Hermione, and/or everyone else are very confused about a sudden change in Draco and Harry's relationship are still entertaining.

I was thinking: One day, idk reasons, the Draco and Harry we know in cannon are swapped with a Draco and Harry of another world that are in an established relationship. They're being affectionate as they're used too, and everyone else is confused af, which then confuses this Draco and Harry because everything else is the same so they haven't even noticed the whole 'alternate universe' thing.

I'd love to maybe write this myself one day, but I was wondering if anything like this exists already or if anyone else would like to take this idea and run with it themselves.


** I would read it
