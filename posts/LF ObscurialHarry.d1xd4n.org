As it says in the title: I'm looking for stories in which the Dursleys went a little bit further in their quest of "stomping the magic out of Harry" and he consequently becomes an obscurial. Bonus points if there is some hurt/comfort going on, but pure angst would be totally fine as well.


** linkffn(Harry Stark and the Spirit of Iron) is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. I think I came across another one, but I don't have it saved anywhere regrettably. Cheers

  Magic and technology. Polar opposites for some, and yet for one boy living on the streets ... maybe they can be something more. Follow Harry as he is taken in by the famous Tony Stark and starts to combine his own unique powers with technology in ways that make him more than just a wizard, or a thief, or a prodigy, but instead make him ... an Avenger. Harry/multi.

** The ones I like are mostly from my Newt Scamander phase.

  Harry is an Obscurial, the Wizarding World is panicking and Newt is both over excited and potentially immortal. Things get complicated.

  Newt appears in Little Whinging in 1988, just at the right moment and time to meet 8 year old Harry Potter. This leads to Newt adopting -please don't call it kidnapping-him, and Harry growing up to be just a little...different.

  Following the deaths of the Dursleys - who prove that humans truly are the most vicious creatures on the planet - Harry gets a visit from a fascinating stranger.

  There were rumours that Harry Potter was a squib. Harry smiled and laughed it off because he was actually so much, much worse.

  (Or in which the Dursley's harsh treatment didn't left Harry unscathed and his two best friends were the only ones who knew.)
