  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

I've completed two short stories, one about Hermione wingmanning for Harry and Fleur, and one about Hermione meeting Tonks and quickly developing a crush on her. Also, a response to a prompt about Sirius having a different Animagus form, but that is just something short and silly.

There are plenty of one-shots and short stories sitting on my GDrive at various stages of completion, I hope to get at least one of those done after the next weekend (Most likely the Harry/Pansy one, but it could be chapter one of a HufflepuffHarry piece as well).

#+begin_quote
  left you completely satisfied
#+end_quote

I don't think I've ever been completely satisfied by an ending of anything (even outside of fanfiction). I can't help it, I'm a nitpicker!

Then there's the fact that it's easier for us to remember bad endings than the good ones and that canon was so terrible in the end (epilogue + Harry probably should have died thematically), which means: Basically anything that's better than the canon train wreck is good in my book.

I'm just going to rec some fics where I didn't think the ending was bad, okay?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/Like-Grains-of-Sand-in-the-Hourglass]]) (just a nice happy ending without a catch-22 gotcha)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]]) (didn't overstay its welcome, knowing when to end it is just as important as the how, also everyone gets their just deserts)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) (tonally appropriate, not everything is suddenly okay and perfect just because Voldemort is gone)

What's missing in this list is a fic that truly ends with a bang. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185/1][Forever Knight]] almost qualifies, but it takes a bit too long to wrap things up in a neat tidy little bow, which is completely unnecessary.

I had a surprisingly hard time thinking about endings here. Just goes to show that as long as the ending isn't actively terrible I'll probably be fine with it.
