Just give me a fic where Harry's WBWL learns not to be an ass. He's whiny, and greedy but gets harshly taught a lesson IDK why I want this. I'm just feeling it


** Linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) did this, but has now gone on so long that he un-learnt the lesson and is an ass again

*** yeah uh, I started that story, Then it honestly got too confusing for me and I stopped. It deviated from a good fic into... something else. It should've ended a long time ago

**** It's very divisive on here. It has great world-building and concepts, but it gets very convoluted pretty quickly - I don't know when you bailed, but 3rd year is crazy. I personally try to keep up with it, but I have to do it like 5+ chapters at a time because individual updates are confusing

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** "Saving Connor" is the first tome of the massive AU written by Lightning on the Wave. It's absolutely amazing and Connor (Harry's brother) as his arc, just later.
