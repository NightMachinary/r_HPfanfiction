I ask, because with close to a million words, and already past third year, and with the author stating it's a Super Harry story, is it worth reading. Most Super Harry stories I can never really see going above 200k words just because the inherint nature having a Super character brings to a story. So with all that in mind I have a few questions, what does the author mean by Super Harry? Does it drag, and end with Voldemort, or is Voldemort just a stepping stone in the stories over-arching goal? Is Wandless magic a possibility, or something that only the truly powerful, and skilled can accomplish(like the books), or is it a locked down no wand, no magic type of deal? How about the lore, and history, how are other creatures treated in this story, do House Elves require a master, are the wards HP wards, or other fictions take on wards(ward-stones for example), do Wizards/Witches have a core, or is magic it based on skill? From the way the first chapter reads, is there going to be a lot of bashing in this story, manipulative Albus, crappy friends, etc...? Lastly, what can I expect when it comes to action scenes, great, good, meh, OH GOD NO, etc...?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I love reading long stories. But A Marauder's Plan is imo too long. I read it fully once. And I started reading it again at a later time, because I couldn't remember the details of the story. I couldn't read it a second time - it was too long and, honestly, too drawn out and boring.

The writing itself was good, but the author could have told the story with fewer words.

I still can't remember the details, but I know that the story was interesting in parts.

You might give it a try.

** You should just throw caution to the wind and simply read it. You might like it or you might not. I think I read about 200k words before I got bored. I don't remember if the fic itself was boring or because I just couldn't read a half a million words, because I'm the type of person to read something in a stretch. I finish OotP in one day but this fic takes even longer and that frustrates me. I do remember I liked it initially, because the prose was good. But there's only so many 'So mote it be's that I could take before I quit.

** You can throw 90% of the fic away and nothing will change plot wise

** I'll preface this by saying I did not finish this fic. What I did read, which was up to the drawing of the names in the TriWizard, was okay, if not excessively meandering. I don't recall any character bashing, nor did I find any technical faults in grammar or spelling. My problem is the same as others have mentioned, that it's way too long for the timeframe it covers. From what I remember, the entire fic encompasses the summer of ‘94 and runs through the entirety of Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts. That's it. Even expanding the Tournament shouldn't force the word count to balloon to nearly 1 million words. Too much of this story is reiterating what we already read earlier in the story in a much too verbose manner. It also feels like the story takes an age to go somewhere. I don't mind a long read, but at some point, we have to stop crawling along from plot point to plot point, which is where I feel this fic failed to do. At least from what I read.

With that said, this shouldn't be a deterrent to you taking a look for yourself. It's obviously a well-liked fic if the favorites and reviews on FFN are any indicator. Maybe you'll like it.

** I liked it it was interesting, everything that made Harry “super” had some serious negative affects so he couldn't solve all his problems

It's definitely satisfying though

** I for one found it very fun to read. Yes, it can drag here and there, but that's life, some of it is filled with meetings and group decisions but nothing in it is unimportant. Is Harry OP in it? Eh... Kinda? But with serious consequences for every OP ability. Definitely worth the time spent slogging through it.

*** I still haven't read it. I keep hearing how it's a Harry, and co basically stomp everyone. A godlike Harry, and co fic. Don't get me wrong, I like OP Harry stories, but only ones where they're 20k-200k at the most. There's no point in dragging out such stories. At almost a million words with such a Harry, i'm hesitant. Would you be willing to tell me a bit about the story. I don't mind spoilers much, and with such a large story, I definetly don't mind spoilers.

***** Well that personally put me off of it. I don't think I could deal with 400k words of hurt/comfort. I enjoy them in short stories, or as you said, to advance character development, but that is way too much for my tastes. Thanks for the information though. Maybe if I ever develop more of a taste for such stories, i'll come back to it.
