Do you think the magical world would have any interest in space travel? Cutting 200-300 years into the future of the world we see in Harry Potter, do you think wizards would take notice at Muggles leaving to colonize other planets en masse?

If magical fields really do interfere with electromagnetic fields, how would you reconcile the necessarily electronic nature of spacecraft with wizardry?

I don't think we know enough at all about the limitations of magic in the canon world to say that a spaceship would have to have electronics.

** I think an important point to consider is that there's more to space travel and moon landings than just hopping in a broom or grabbing a portkey and going there.

Do wizards even know there's no air in space? I imagine someone's tried to portkey into orbit and then promptly died of asphyxiation. Or flown to high altitude and frozen/passed-out and fallen to their death. I doubt they know about cosmic rays either, or orbital mechanics.

This is all stuff that muggle scientists took decades to piece together and find solutions to. There's no way wizards could skip all that research without stooping to relying on learning about what the muggles already know. A magical space program only seems easy to us because all that work is already done.

That doesn't even get into motivations. Do wizards even care about space travel? They're notoriously stuck-in-their-ways. It takes a certain drive to explore the unknown and try new things to start a space program that appears to be rather rare in wizarding culture.

** Maybe some random eccentric wizard would have done it, like the guy who made the cheese cauldron, but I doubt wizards would really be interested much in /travelling/ to space. They can study astronomy perfectly well from from Earth so they don't really have any particular reason to go to any celestial body. For us Muggles it is desirable because it is difficult, and therefore we wish to prove that we can. But for wizards it would be rather easy (if time consuming due to the distances involved) to go to the Moon and back. Given that, and given that there's not really anything there, it barely seems worth the effort.

** Very easily, as I have previously noted.

The Undetectable Expansion Charm (see for example Newt Scamander's briefcase) means we do not suffer mass penalties for our fuel, which break the tyranny of the rocket equation (see for example [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/38/]] for explanation thereof), as the mass of fuel is a small constant (the mass of the container we cast the charm on). Clearly, the 'external' mass is the mass of the container (otherwise Newt's briefcase would have the mass of the entire zoo, he'd be unable to lift it).

We see the same tech applied to Mood'y's trunk, so clearly this charm also works to create long-term living spaces. So instead of a massive, heavy spaceship, the size requirement is "big enough to hold a hole big enough for the largest non-shrinkable thing we need to pass inside to fit through".

So quite small. Unbreakable and Impervious Charms allow us to use very light or flimsy materials in the construction, thus giving us insane acceleration and efficiency (Presumably, Newt's briefcase has some kind of magical internal dampening field, if not, a magical equivalent shouldn't be to hard to create).

Thus accelerating even to large percentages of the speed of light should be relatively easy.

Furthermore, you could presumably employ Apparation and Portkeys to create some kind of relay system (assuming that those [can] travel at a reasonable percentage of the speed of light).

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) has an interesting take on this. I think it says something like one of Malfoy's ancestors proved that ley lines do not extend into space; therefore, space travel is impossible. Many purebloods are convinced that the Moon Landings etc are a hoax as a result. Fred and George, upon hearing that muggles have been into space, want to become the first wizarding astronauts.

I'd like to see a story where a Black invented a (crazy) way to get to other close planets and that's why the naming tradition came into effect. It fell out of fashion, though, and the only remnants of wizarding space travel include the Hogwarts astronomy class.

  No. He's not allowed near Dudley's computer and Dudley's the only one who's got a computer. He gets beaten up if he goes too near the keyboard. So no, he's never used the Internet. I use it a lot but not Harry. Wizards don't really need to use the Internet but that's something that you'll find out later on in the series. They have a means of finding out what goes on in the outside world that I think is more fun than the Internet. Could anything be more fun than the Internet? Yes!

#+end_quote

Wizards, although a little slow on tech adoptions, did create magical versions of Muggle inventions that appeared useful to them, such as cars, cameras, radios, and trains.

If Muggles had great success colonizing remote planets, you can bet Wizards wanted to have a world of their own.

The big question remains however whether magic could be used in outer space or had very different laws there. After all, lots of lore require magic to be near living beings.

If magic worked in outer space or required only minor modifications, then they were definitely going to build their magical spacecrafts.

Minister of the time(too lazy to search):"...and that's why we're banning travel to the moon."

With Portkeys, apparation, vanishing trunks, and a whole host of instant travel open to them, not to forget maybe a bubble head charm the size of your body anchored to a runic necklace. It seems like just about any Hogwarts graduate who did Runes(if runes are even required for the trip) could do it.
