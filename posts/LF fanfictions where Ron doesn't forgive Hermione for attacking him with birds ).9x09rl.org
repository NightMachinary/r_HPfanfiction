** The end result is pretty much the same, you aren't stuck with Ron/Hermione and can therefore find a better suited partners for both.

** ...You know that's just the equivalent of an angry slap, right. Not something to hold a grudge over. Maybe something to joke about over drinks at a future date. I mean, if someone shot angry birds at me because my teenage self was an asshole or an idiot, my friends would tease me about it forever --- all in good fun.

I doubt a /well-characterized/ Ron is /that/ petty.

*** Hermione sent birds at Ron over him dating Lavender when Hermione had feelings for him and never told him. She attacked him /over something he didn't even know/, just for walking in on her and Harry in the corridor. And it was not "just an angry slap", though that doesn't even make it better because you don't assault people over being upset with them - especially not when you haven't even /told them why you're upset with them!/ It's inexcusable. She attacked him as soon as he walked into her presence, over a reason he didn't even know. She's horrible. Not to mention there is no crime in him being with Lavender. Hermione doesn't own him, she's not owed him; she's petty and vindictive because she doesn't have him.

And even then, it doesn't seem like a good thing to attack the boy you have feelings for - that isn't going to make him like you back, is it?

  Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. "Gerremoffme!" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it.
#+end_quote

Hermione is a vindictive, horrible person.

And it is also an obscenely sexist point of view to try and pass it off as "an angry slap", likely just because it's a girl doing it.

Imagine it swapped: Fourth year. Hermione is dating Krum without realizing Ron has feelings for her. Ron goes off alone to cry about it, Harry goes to comfort him. Hermione shows up in the corridor on accident along with Krum. So Ron gets pissed off at her and sends birds to claw and peck at her /face/, and then he leaves her alone to it.

Doesn't it just sound HORRIBLE? Doesn't it?

What if it WAS ALSO "just an angry slap"?

"Ron, with a look of vindictive fury, slapped Hermione across the face."

Horrible. Just horrible.

**** Valid points, I'll conceed. And maybe I'm biased because I /don't/ hold grudges and perhaps can't quite understand the mindset of those who do.

But, considering that this is the magical world with magical healing, getting a face full of angry magic birds does not equate to getting your face clawed by the woman's fingernails, even if the injury is the same. This is a world where people hex each other all the time, can get better in an afternoon, and know these facts to be true. These two facts innately shift the scale of what is "acceptable" violence and what is too far.

Furthermore, unlike the real world, where men are measurably stronger than women and are stereotypically the aggressors, that power imbalance and social dynamic /can't/ exist in the magical world. Ron mauling Hermione shood be looked at with exactly the same weight as what se saw in the books. Relative to what wizards AND witches are capable of, it's the equivalent of an angry slap both ways.

My point isn't that what Hermione did wasn't wrong --- because it was. My point is instead that Hermione was an emotional idiot that acted stupidly, but within the context of a culture that doesn't quite equate to ours, it was an act that ultimately is forgivable. Ron isn't dumb and immature to the point that he'd swear an undying grudge, and even if he was, he'd probably grow out of it soon enough if he didn't get bored of being mad.

They're both idiots at that age. They both will, as a product of growing up, will one day realize how stupid their past selves were. Nothing is forever.

...also yeah, from a muggle point of view, Hermione absolutely was a bitch right there, even if she was too upset to realize it at the moment.

***** Hmmm. Yes you have valid points too. But I don't think just because they can heal that kind of thing faster means it still doesn't hurt the same. I mean if we get to the point where our medicine can instantly heal wounds will we stop taking assault seriously? I don't want to know that. :(

But in the context of the world, yes, you do have points! :) Yes, there is equality because magic balances the equation in a way.

****** I kind of agreed with you the first time. Their being magical hasn't tipped the violence scales to equal measure on both sides. Ron never does attack Hermione the way she attacks him in this scene, and even within the context of the books, it would have been seen as a much more egregious fault if he had been the one to do it.

I'm more willing to forgive it on the basis on their ages, but not their genders, and I'm certainly not willing to condone it. It bothers me that Hermione doesn't get called out for this kind of behaviour, and she absolutely should be.

****** Oh no, pain is pain and that will always be bad. But when the choice is lots of pain or lots of pain /and/ permanent scars... That's the distinction, and why it's not as big of a deal.

What if the power imbalance is based on magical prowess, though? I think we can all agree that Hermione tops Ron on this one. (Okay, I stole this concept from somebody's else post about Hermione's attack. I forgot who, however.)

Not arguing anything, just interesting in hearing your opinion.

****** But then that is an individual-by-individual basis, not a systemic one. You can't predict who's "stronger" as easily. Maybe Hermione is pretty strong, but what if Ron is faster than her? Or really skilled at a narrow set of spells? Or just more creative in which spells he does use?

Comparing Hermione to Ron might very well be like comparing a weight-lifter to a sprinter, or an archer to a skeet shooter. There, any bias caused by biology (like gender) is completely overwhelmed by individual skill and is heavily dependent on circumstances.

#+end_quote

I'm really not arguing either way, but didn't Hermione ask Ron to Slughorn's Chrismas party? I know that's more subtle than Ron could ever figure out, but it did happen. Just because he's not emotionally mature enough to realize it doesn't erase it from history.

Oh, sod it, I am arguing the other way. Kind of. She shouldn't have sent the birds.

But then Ron shouldn't have been dating Lav-Lav after he already had a future date with Hermione. Something he apparently only did because he was jealous Hermione had snogged Krum two years before.

Either way, this whole argument is just testimony over why the Romione ship would never work. They are BOTH just too volatile to be together long term. The whole relationship just screams verbal abuse (and magical abuse) both ways. They'd hex each other before they consummated the marriage.

***** Well I mean they've been best friends for years, so even if she did ask how was he supposed to just /know/ she meant it as more than "let's just go have fun as best friends"? That is still Hermione's fault for not clarifying anything isn't it? If she never indicated anything otherwise, then Ron shouldn't be beholden to her "future date" and he shouldn't not be allowed to date lavender like a normal person. Again Hermione is not owed him when she doesn't make anything clear.

Yes I agree, this entire thing is why they'd be horrible together. They'd realistically have domestic abuse incidents the whole way through, with Ron yelling at Hermione and with Hermione hitting Ron.
