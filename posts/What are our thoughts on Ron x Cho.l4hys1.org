Do people find it to be a good ship? A bad ship?


** If we're sticking to canon characterizations, they're a horrible fit.

Ron is more tactless than Harry and I don't think Cho is capable of arguing back like Hermione.

Cho also had no problem trying to make Harry jealous in OotP. Ron spent at least a week making everyone on his vicinity miserable because Hermione kissed Krum two years prior. Ron would mention Hermione or Fleur and Cho would shoot back with Roger and Cedric. She wouldn't be the only one yelling in Madam Puddifoot's.

*** Not to mention how defensive Cho is of Marietta.

"Her mum works for the Ministry! She's under a lot of pressure!"

** I can imagine it working post-Hogwarts, especially if they both become professional quidditch players. But it's hard to imagine it working well while they were still in school, unless you're going for some large AU changes.

I'd be interested in reading about it though.

**** Because it's basically a blank slate where you can justify any changes to the characters that you want. Most importantly, Cho should be over Cedric's death by then, so another relationship can actually work.

** Ohhh I never considered this! I don't know why. When I thought of quidditch girls I always thought of Alicia spinnet for him. Duh other teams exist.

This would be cute. I think I blocked out most of book 5 (where we get to see her personality) but I remember her being sweet

*** I don't really get the hate... she seems like a genuinely nice girl but she was going through a rough time. That's not to say Harry wasn't but most for pretty much anyone their problems are more important than other people's problems and whoever denies it is a big liar.

**** She stuck up for Marietta after she sold them out to Umbridge. And Cho must have known about the scars on Harry's hand. Not only that but the DA was their only measure against Voldemort, who had killed her previous boyfriend. So despite the fact that Marietta directly helped both the killer of her previous and the torturer of her current boyfriend, Cho defended her.

That's what makes her unlikeable. Well, and the fact that she was the one who brought Marietta to the DA in the first place.

***** Well Marietta was her friend while the DA was just an extracurricular group so seems reasonable to at least stick for your friend... and after the failed date, it's pretty implied that Harry and Cho were not a couple. Liking or disliking her is of course a matter of preference but I don't think any of her actions in OotP should make her that hated.

****** So Marietta helped the two people who killed/tormented her ex boyfriends rather than the ex and the current one. I don't see how this makes it any better. Not to mention that Cho apologised once she read about the interview.

I mean, loyalty to friends is one thing, but this isn't Marietta nicking a bottle of vodka from the store. She just sold everyone including Cho to a torturer and directly helped the magical Nazis with that, it is high time to re-examine that friendship.

******* Marietta was a piece of shit on that one... there's no denying in it. However we're not given any information on the dynamics between her and Cho. But based on the fact that Cho was described prior to OotP as one of the popular girls and by book 5 only Marietta remains her friend, I would think that the latter was quite supportive while she was going through her tough moments. And, if anything, Cho should be viewed more sympathetically since she shows a great deal of empathy to have gotten over it. Just like people bash Ron for turning his back on Harry in the fourth book and are shocked that Harry forgave him. Not sure if those people had a really good friend whose shit they had to forgive and forget every now and then.

Depends on what they did. Forgot a birthday or something like that? Yeah. What Ron or Marietta did on the other hand? Cut them out of your life. Something I had to do once, and have no regrets about.

********* I personally find Ron's deed even more forgivable. For someone that didn't have all the information, his anger was even more righteous... after all Harry had a streak of situations where he got glory for breaking the rules such as the time when he flew on a broom without supervision and became the star seeker or when he got rewarded for breaking into a forbidden corridor or sneaking out of the room or releasing two prisoners sentenced to the capital punishment.

Ron's thoughts probably were something like: "I rescue you from your abusive adoptive family, I have you at my house and treat you like a brother, my family even goes so far as to buy you a ticket at the Quidditch World Cup despite our financial struggles and you won't even share with me the fact that you plan to circumvent the rules again."

At the end he apologized and made amends for his outburst while Harry knocked him unconscious with a badge. Only a self-entitled cunt would hold a grudge against Ron in that circumstance. And Harry almost was that but return to more positive thoughts.

Note that I only referred to book 4. In book 7, I think Ron was a jealous asshole, horcrux or not but still he eventually saved Harry's life.

********** I get plenty of flack for being a "Ron apologist" on the harmony subreddit but honestly I think you're taking it a bit too far.

Harry did not knock Ron unconscious, he just threw a badge at his head (admittedly, still very not ok) and Ron definitely got off lightly for what he did. Harry has made it extremely clear that when he does benefit from his situation, he's just making the best of a bad situation. He does not care one whit for his fame nor does he particularly care about his money nearly as much as he values his human connections like friends and he has demonstrated this many times over. That being said I agree that plenty of people are also overly vindictive of Ron over here. I would say that harry at least should have let Ron finish apologizing and then have had a good talk with him about why Ron's behavior was extremely not cool before going back to how things were although it also would've been fair to accept the apology have the talk and say things will not immediately go back to how they were and tons going to have to work to earn harry's feeling of kinship to the degree he had before the tournament again
