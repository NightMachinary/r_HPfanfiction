There have been many threads about what we hate in fanfics, but what do you look for in fanfics? What cliches, characterizations, plot twist do you find intriguing or amusing? What are the crossovers you consider worthy? Which characters do you like to be developed more?

For me it's whimsy and fun. I love the feel of the earlier books and want that explored more. The joy of magic and the fantastical world. If I want gritty realism and politics I'll go for a Tom Clancy book or something. Not that it hasn't a place in HP fandom, I enjoy those fanfics as well, but it's not my first choice.


** For me? Number one is good writing. A poorly written fic just... Never seems to hook me properly.

Second is that it has to convince me that it's reasonable - believability. Eg, if the author starts with Harry having the exact same backstory up through the end of year 3 - but studies during the summer, it doesn't convince me that a sudden massive power up/massive personality change is warranted. I can stomach big/massive changes as long as it's believable within their story/backstory.

Third is appropriate challenges. A main character that goes about easily winning at everything gets boring fast. This doesn't have to be in fighting or villains - it just has to have some tension.

Fourth is imagination - I'd look for something that brings something new. That could be with exploring another character in more detail, a new section of the world, politics, magic, etc.

I find the first two to be my major hurdles - I think I've gotten fairly picky recently

*** Oh yeah, the sudden shift in Harry's personality never did it for me. I agree with that 100%.

As to the challenges, it's best explained with the fact that if you give Harry the Force then Voldemort gets the Death Star. The hero is only defined by his opposition, and Voldemort should be super powerful and competent to pose a credible threat.

As to the imagination, I could not agree more. Although I dislike if the author just creates an artificial world with politics that make no sense (Harry being a Lord at 11 and being a political animal comes to mind, who could even consider a minor with no backing a political powerhouse).

**** Exactly!

Politics wise, I feel like people shouldn't be afraid to bump ages up. Like I've had the idea of a few fics/setting twists bouncing around in my head for a while - and it'd just make sense to bump Hogwarts up into a secondary school/university (eg - start at age 14, at 18 (end of 4th Year) take OWLs, those who want to study further stay for Years 5-7, at 21 take NEWTs). 14 would work well enough for precocious political figures - eg, Phillipe Auguste, one of the most successful French Kings, took the throne at 15.

Also it'd make sense to expand the Wizarding World for those types of fics. The reluctance to do so in many fics surprises me - an older cast of characters and more 'realistic'/sizable wizarding population raises the stakes further.

For Harry being a Lord, it'd certainly be possible in a political focused fanfic, though the powerhouse bit would have some prerequisites of course. It'd be interesting to see a highly feudal structure to Wizarding Britain - with the 'great lords' having lower vassals under them, and controlling the society to a greater degree - and with the increasing tension muggleborns would bring, with their exposure to the much more egalitarian muggle society. It'd fit well with the older date for magical education as well...

** - Character arcs and character development. My problem with OP Harry and Super Hermione boils down to them being static characters that everyone else reacts to.

- British dialogue. When Ron says "Blimey, Harry!" instead of "Jesus Christ, what the fuck!" then I'm happy.

- Kids that act like kids. Eleven year old Harry should love broomsticks and Christmas. He shouldn't be thinking about how Hermione being the oldest kid in their year means she has the "juiciest young ass" or best developed "sweater puppies".

- Canon style magic. Everyone uses familiar spells in familiar ways. No family magicks, Deus ex Machina goblin magic, creature inheritance, Parselmagic, or mugglewanky magic where Harry gets a cellphone because he's special.

*** I agree with most of these, but I also like when a fic introduces some form or aspect of the Wizarding world that was never mentioned in the books. World building, I guess. One of the things I like about Fantastic Beasts is that is expands the scale to the entire world, not just Britain. How other cultures handle magic could be unique and fascinating (ex: Celtic myth and legends, Wiccan-style magic, and Native American shamanism.

*** Oh, yeah, I agree on all of those, especially the 11 year old's acting like 11 year old's. I know it's super difficult, and JKR couldn't write a 15 year old to save her ass, but still, at least some effort would be appreciated.

British dialogue is always a plus, especially with all the americanism that permeate the fandom.

I really dislike super Harry or super Hermione, the latter more than the former, though.

And yes, canon magic for the win. From what we know of canon, magic is difficult and not that OP, especially combat spells are difficult, and yet (like someone said) Harry with his summer training montage can tackle people who studied magic for decades... it feels cheap, even if it is gratifying.

A kid that is as neglected and/or abused as Harry is (or at least implied to me) would be similiar to Hermione in acting older than he is. Things like that tend to have kids develop more intellectually, and make them a bit more cynical then they more be normally. Emotionally, he's probably more around a kid.

** - Talented Harry. Anything from Voldemort-level genius to a logical extrapolation of his canon talents (Patronus, able to resist Imperius, beat Voldemort in priori incantatem, natural duelling talent).

- Expansion of magic. So many fics re-write magic to be something completely different to how it is in the books. For me it's much more exciting to see original magic which slots in logically and thematically with the magic in the books.

- Magical supremacy over technology.

- Complex politics where characters come to understand that there are always reasons for why things are the way they are (causal reasons; i.e. not the same as justification). That because of those reasons, change is difficult to achieve and will generally only occur in increments. That there's no such thing as the low hanging fruit of easy solutions to important problems, because if those did exist then someone would have already done them.

- Fleshing out wizarding Britain with a social dynamic similar to a small town (e.g. 20,000 people), albeit geographically distributed. In particular, fics which flesh out what most wizards actually spend their life doing i.e. coming up with inventive and logical magical jobs, hobbies etc.

- Connected to the above, a pastoral/ecological wizarding society where wizards are generally a very rural group who despair at the spread of urban Muggle civilisation and the effect it has on the natural environment.

- Fics which build the world up rather than tear it down. That is: fics that see an apparent tension in canon and think about why things might be that way, building the world so that the tension makes sense (as opposed to declaring canon silly and either papering over the tension with AU or having characters exploit it as if no one had ever noticed that tension before).

*Explanation of building the world up*

A concrete example of a canon "tension": "Why isn't veritaserum used in trials?"

A constructive approach to this question is to come up with an answer where veritaserum generally works well AND there's a good reason why it isn't used in trials. E.g. legal protections against self-incrimination, groups interested in protecting civil liberties, the "one-in-a-thousand" cases where the accused knows occlumency making it unreliable as a basis for a justice system, etc. The tension is maintained, but explained.

The destructive approach either says "actually veritaserum is shit" or "wizards are so stupid it just never occurred to them" or "they do use it, and now I will have a character exploit that fact to solve all the conflict that exists in canon, even though logically if that were possible someone would have already done it."

*** Interesting on the dynamics you mention for Wizarding Britain! I tend to have the 'opposite' reaction to yours from the small scale of the canon magical community size - that is, to expand it drastically in size. A pastoral/rural magic community would be an interesting dynamic to explore, like you mentioned.

I don't think I'd like manic fics that focus on it still - I think my tendency for big, sweeping, complicated societies would drive me the other way instead!

The comment on characters exploiting the highly visible faults/tension in canon is a good one too. It's often used as a way to showcase how smart an Independent Harry is, but it's just heavy handed. Again I think I'm more likely to fall on the side of 'fixing' canon without beholding myself to it too much, particularly with the magic/societal aspects of it - but you've got some great points.

I like a motivated Harry, one who knows that Voldemort is still around and works his butt off to learn the wanded classes, potions and arithmancy. Anything else he only does enough not to fail.

Harry not paired with horrible people, Snape, Malfoy, Umbridge, Riddle.

** - Harry centric, particularly dark, curious, and/or wealthy, landed gentry Potters.
- Canon divergence that actually and eventually deviates from the canon plot(s) and builds on characterization.
- well characterized characters. Hate Snape, Draco, Dumbledore, Umbridge, James, Sirius, etc all you want just stop making them not know the right end of a wand. Also, stop making Harry cry, sob, or terrified to say what he feels.
- More minor, rarely used characters, less holding onto canon friendships/acquaintances. I'd love to see more Patil twins, Cho, both Crouches., Scrimgeour, Moody, Emmeline, etc. Less Neville, Dobby, and Hermione.
- mentor fics
- logical conflict. For instance, regardless of who the girl/woman is, I find it hard to believe that Harry's closeness to Ron and Hermione wouldn't be an issue. There's also the Slytherin thing where people believe they'd all be cruel to Harry despite the fact their parents were hoping he'd be a Dark wizard.
- action

I'm also still looking for a (well written) story where Harry who takes issue with Dumbledore's canon actions and it's not swept under the rug, but Harry also doesn't whine about it for the rest of his life.

Be edgy about it, I don't mind! Hell, my fics are really edgy!

The best example for what I really enjoy in HP fics would be the Jen Black Saga, to be honest. SilentlyWatches completely broke the norm of everything I was used to. Such an incredibly different approach. Magic itself got expanded by introducing different approaches and practices, by introducing big players in patrons, by being CREATIVE with what the HP universe already offers. I mean yeah, SW did use a few tropes, but they were at least made readable. I honestly wish that ff writers would be braver instead of rehashing the things we've already read a million times.

** of course good writing, an interesting story and personal preferences for characters all come to mind, but in the end what makes or breaks a story for me is how well the author is able to make the world their own. The stories I tend to love are the ones who don't just take a carbon copy of the world, how the world works and how the characters in it act, and really just add their own magic (harr harr) to it.

Harry Potter and the Jade Dragon linkffn(12046790) is not the best fanfic out there, but definitely the best example for what I mean.

Why I started reading it was because of three reasons.

1. the story was going to take place at mahoutokoro, the japanese school for magic, and I was very interested in what the author would do with that place.

2. the absolutely immense list of minor and major OC's that were listed on the authors page, on first glance all seemed to be promisingly fleshed out enough to work in a story like that.

3. I am a simple man, and was in the mood for some 'American Pie' style alcohol induced banter and sexual foolery.

Why is Harry Potter and the Jade Dragon definitely not the best fic out there? well, let's summarize the first 40 chapters (probably like 15-20% of the story, keeping chapter lenght in mind): Harry potter becomes Harry Potter-Black-Peverell-Ravenclaw, becomes practically a billionair, spends his time touring his new properties, is legally allowed to marry multiple women, has a huge crush on Hermione (who is still with Ron) and continues to have sexual encounters, of increasing intensity, with tons of canon established girls.

I plowed through 150-200k words or something and no japan, no mahoutokoro and no fleshed out OC's. The only thing I get is the multi house heir, filthy rich Harry, for whom every single girl seems to fall for. Does that sound bad? I think it sounds bad. It was definitely bad.

And then after chapter 40 or so we finally get to mahoutokoro, and the author just kills it. When reading the original books, Hogwarts always felt like this magical place that had so much more mystery still left untouched. Where, when reading, it felt like if you'd ask J.K. Rowling some random question about the place, she'd probably have had something in mind while writing and would be able to supply you with an answer (although, looking at her twitter, we probably shouldn't have asked).

Reading this had the same effect. Mahoutokoro felt as grand as Hogwarts did. All the classrooms, the common rooms of the different houses, all the scenery described; it just fits the setting so well and it is clear to see that a lot of thought has gone into them. On top of that, the massive amounts of OC's all have a very clear place in the world. All of them feel unique and all of the major ones serve a purpose. It just feels like there is so much more to the world that the author is ready to tell at any moment in time that it simply captivated me.

Alas those first 40 chapters were atrocious and the fic is pretty much dead and abandoned right now, but it will always have a special place in my heart, simply for how well the author owned mahoutokoro.

** - Consistent characterisation. Characters should either behave like their canon counterparts, or have a good in-story reason why they've changed. For example, Forging the Sword has Harry and Ron behave much more seriously and work much harder, but that's triggered by Ginny's death, which has a profound effect on them. That works. Fics that have Harry suddenly discover in fourth or fifth year that he's been attracted to Hermione all along, or be making out with both Fleur and Gabrielle Delacour after the second Triwizard Task - not so much. (NB I don't mind a well-done Harmony, but there has to be some kind of divergence to account for it.) Conversely, I like the characterisations in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past so much that they've pretty much taken over my headcanon for Neville and Luna's personalities, and to a large extent Ginny as well.

- Thoughtfully exploring the world. Preferably /without/ inventing lots of overpowered non-canon magic, rather considering, What would the world possibly/probably look like? That can include fleshing out the backgrounds of minor characters, getting a close look at magical homes or workplaces, perhaps going international but only with careful consideration. I like MarauderLover7's stories for this reason; they do a great job of developing many characters from the previous generation, such as Marlene McKinnon, Gawain Robards, even Lupin and Tonks.

- Humor can cover a multitude of sins. Canon Harry Potter was not a comedy, but it was funny, and that really helped it to shine. It's fine for some stories to take it up to eleven, like Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions, but even without that, it's worth cracking jokes. See point #1 about characterisation; Harry /needs/ to laugh, it's how he copes with the world.

- Spelling and grammar are important insofar as they affect reader immersion. Typos are distracting, especially when they get to the point where it takes multiple tries to understand a sentence. They're secondary to the content, though, and if I like a story well enough, I might take the time to report typos to the author.

** OK, I have to start with one thing I have just discovered which make me stop reading even somehow interestingly looking story ... there was a story Harry being a Triwizard Champion for Ilvermorny, starting dating Hermione (who was bullied in the Ravenclaw, being without any friends except of similarly bullied upon Luna), and then ... Harry got proclaimed adult (because of his participation in the Tournament), declared Lord Potter, etc. and ... then informed that he will have to have three wives to seer heirs of three families. And I couldn't stop reading faster. I wouldn't mind the Lord Potter (actually, a story of Harry and Hermione discovering the world of the wizarding politics and how to be Lord and Girl-betrothed-to-Lord Potter could be interesting one), but polygamy is 100% showstopper for me. Just “Ewww”!

Anyway, what I like is magicians realism or “normal magical life”. Stories like linkffn(Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31) (unfortunately, most of its sequels are just empty fluff without much any story and certainly loosing unique flair of the firs tone), or most [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] stories. linkffn(Exile by bennybear) is another one (and really lovely one!). Or from fluffy one-shots “[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][Rows by Antosha]]”

Probably the best idea how to write a story I would like is to get out of the standard wizarding environment. If I read yet another story which happens only in Hogwarts, Burrow, Ministry of Magic and Leaking Cauldron, I will start to cry. Get out somewhere else! (that's BTW one of very strong sides of Northumbrian, most of his stories are “somewhere else”).

I can survive most normal ships (I don't do slash for major characters), I don't care much about crossovers (unless they help the story, linkffn(Operation Wandless by LadyDunla) was a lovely one) and they shouldn't mix something which doesn't mesh well (Harry in LotR world doesn't make much sense).

Keep characters of main heroes mostly canon. It doesn't have to be set in stone (slightly more reasonable Luna in linkffn(Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor by Arpad Hrunta) is not that bad, and her friendship with Lavender Brown is priceless!), but DarkLord!Harry ... just why? If you don't like who Harry is as a person, then just take some other character or write your own.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him... "So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdoes how to do our job?" "Yes, that is the general idea." Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done.

*** This, but with Draco/Daphne × Harry for me.

A common theme is for characters to be bashed for things that should be legitimate concern and the Ice King/Queen never work for redemption. I'm no fan of Hermione, but she has legitimate reasons not to accept those two or Pansy.

I have very low standards.

1. Trashy insulgent plot that if its bad it kinda embraces that.

Oh and if the interesting ideas are actually explored even if they arent dont very well.
