It always bothered me in Canon that Harry was essentially guilted into teaching the DA. Are there any fics where he just says no to tutoring everyone?

*** I've read that one, but I meant saying no to DA to begin with.

** A minor portion of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][this one]]; Harry turns down the DA offer to spend time with Daphne.

*** An interesting take on the Canon OC, Daphne Greengrass, I haven't seen before. I could imagine Hermione trying to control how Harry studies.

** I really hope people find more of these stories. It always really bothered me that these people derated Harry for most of his Hogwarts career by this point, and still don't believe him about Voldemort. Yet he caves to Hermione and teaches them all.

*** I know! I don't like that Harry caved in. It's 5th year, arguably the second most important year barring 7th year, and Harry is stuck in detention with a blatantly evil teacher, had his rightful prefect badge given to a friend, private "lessons" with a teacher that despises him, and she adds on to it by guilting him into tutoring DADA. I think a book 5 schism where Harry ignores Hermione would have been good for him, and also helped Ron's character a bit.

** There's a harmony one, and a Susan bones one but do you think I can remember there names... it's funny since Umbridge is trying to call him on it and it's just him and Hermione, he's like; it's just me and my girlfriend practicing for owls

*** I'm not fond of Hermione trying to set an idea then abandoning it. Like the DA. She suggested it, if Harry says no, she'd either try to get him to teach it or eventually try to teach it herself.
