** Huh. One thing that I'd change for sure is the Basilisk part - if the cave was the first test, it would also be the one most often attempted. Breeding enough basilisks to last until canon (and beyond) would be unfeasible if they were set up to be killed. Setting up automated breeding grounds to create them on demand too complicated.

At the very least, I'd allow for somene who knew what they wanted to just politely ask the ruddy snake to let you pass (like metallic dragon challenge in DnD) or trick it so that you could enter the hole and solve a riddle to get past a fake back wall of the tunnel. Getting past the snake on one's way back would be part of the challenge, of course.

TLDR: I'd keep the basilisk as a top-rated murderbeast well worth the rating and change the requirement for passing the first test from 'kill' to 'get past'.

** Or it could just test if someone is the heir of one of the founders depending on your approach to how you'd handle the Basilisk. If you controlled it with Parselmouth you were the Heir of Slytherin, if you would defeat it you were the Heir of Gryffindor, if you would trick it you were the Heir of Ravenclaw and if you befriended it by feeding and petting it you were the Heir of Hufflepuff.
