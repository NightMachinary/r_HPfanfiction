Not as a pairing, or anything, but the character of Salazar has always fascinated me and I wished there were more stories with him available.


** Have you read the Of a Linear Circle series?

  Salazar Slytherin did not have an easy life, and he finally died alone after an argument with his dearest friends. Then he was reborn. Somehow. But life as the Boy Who Lived might be too much even for him. At least he doesn't have to do it alone.

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.

  They don't question why Hermione Granger is able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seems to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really notice her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they call her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?Year 1: Salazar Slytherin is reincarnated as a "booksmart" muggleborn girl, a debutante again in a much changed magical world. The plan for the year should have been perfectly simple: be insignificant, stay uninvolved, and observe instead of jumping right into action like a certain somebody. However, upon arriving at Hogwarts to find Slytherin house overrun by blood-purists, a murderer on the staff, a treasure on the third floor and over-adventurous children all around, even the serpent lord starts to find it difficult to stay out of trouble...

** Two that come to my mind are linkffn(11446957) linkffn(13140418). one has him teaching Harry as a portrait in the chamber and the other gives details of his life and personality through his journals. It also delves pretty deep into magical theory. Both are very good in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
