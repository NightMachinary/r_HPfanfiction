I don't know why I suddenly want this, but for no specific reason I want to read a fic in which Hedwig is either A: A human all along, be it an animagus or something similar, or B: Is turned into a human through PLOT. Preferably Human!Hedwig should be female. I don't really care about pairings...I guess with Harry? Or none at all? IDK.

If my memory doesn't fail me, I recall reading a fic with this exact premise, except it later devolved into nothing but smut three-way between Harry, Human!Hedwig and Hermione because apparently a human can somehow "share" a familiar bond with 2 other humans, so I dropped it [Found the link: "More Than Familiar", linkffn(4882425) ]

So in summary: Human!Hedwig (If this even exists), example fic provided (that turned into smut sadly) and that's pretty much it.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

** It would be funny if Hedwig ended up as a /man/, because Gizmo and all his stunt doubles were /male/ owls. Maybe Hedwig is simply an effeminate guy who doesn't mind being incorrectly referred to as "she."

** Ah, you drove me to a trip down memory lane. I believe the trope creator of human!Hedwig was Master Eldryn with Harry Potter and the While Owl. Was quite fun.

** "Core Threads" doesn't have a human Hedwig, but does have a /sentient/ Hedwig, who is persuaded she can become the Dark Lady of Owls and conquer Britain so that owls will rule over humans. Harry just kind of lets her do her thing, as long as she delivers her mail --- she's just too cute trying to be an Evil Overlady. (Mind you, all this is a minor part of the plot.)
