See title, through pure skill in herboligy, neivile develops parsley-mouth the ability to talk to herbs/plants, which one would expect would him at least partially in potions, but nooooo, ever merlin damned magical plant has a extremely self-important attitude, and frankly full of itself. This causes lots of misinformation, untill he comes to ignore them achieving the potions skills he has in canon, and discovering quite a few new potions, because despite their boastful attitude, herbs know what they're useful for, provided you can get it out of them.


** Thought it was a typo and came to make the same joke.

Would have loved to see Neville excelling in potions after Snape's treatment of him. With his greatest fear being Snape and his parents condition, I thought that would have been his story line during my original read. Creating some sort of potion that would prove Snape wrong and cure his parents.

** And also Draco becomes a Parcelmouth. At first he's confused and a little disappointed, but then he quizzes various letters for blackmail.
