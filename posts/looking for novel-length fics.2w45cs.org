I'm really wanting to find some fics that are similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356][Bobmin356's Dumbledore's Army and sequel]]. Or if anybody has some post-Hogwarts recs, I'd be extremely grateful.


** Bobmin also wrote [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset Over Britain]] and the sequel Sunrise Over Britain. They're even longer than the ones you mentioned. You'll have to register to read them as the rating is a bit higher than the Dumbledore's Army ones.

Also on Fanficauthors.net are Bungle in the Jungle and the sequel Turn Me Loose as well as a separate fic called To Fight the Coming Darkness. These are by an author named JBern. They're really long and in the same vein you seem to be looking for if it's the action-y kind of stuff you're after.

These are all Hogwarts-era stories, BTW.

*** I actually had read Sunset Over Britain first, and then read some of their other works. But I'll check out the others you recommended! Thanks!

**** You could also try Melindaleo's works -- there's a 2-piece series she's written, the first one called Power of Emotion and the second one Curse of the Damned. There's also The Seventh Horcrux, also by her, which has widely been regarded as the Death Hallows leak before the book was actually published. (Yes, it's that good).
