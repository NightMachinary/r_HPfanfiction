:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic that I can't remember the name of. Hermione goes back to the past in order to stop Voldemort and save the Potters. Originally they all believe her and the order all want her to help. She has a super cute relationship with baby Harry. She even has a few moments with Sirius.

But then some events don't happen in the right order and they don't want to believe that Peter would betray them so they start acting sketchy towards her and James gets mad at her and won't talk to her. She become friends with the Prewett brothers when the others are ignoring her and she catches Sirius with Marlene?

I think they realize Peter does betray them but that's all remember. I don't think it was a completed story though but I want to reread what was done if anyone can help me!


** ooooh if you find it again pls tell me the name, i'm interested
