** I am absolutely certain it was a story by alienyouthct, but it seems to have been deleted by the author from what I can tell. The story had Lily cheating on James with Narcissa, Hermione as a tough sporty girl, and Neville as all the tropes of WBWL leading him to being abused whenever he opens his mouth. If that sparks your memory maybe you can find someone with a copy.

*** I have actually been looking for this exact story for forever now, and I'd almost cracked and assumed the whole thing was a mad hallucination.

I think the reason for it being deleted though was that it shared quite a bit with their other story 'Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru.'

***** It might be? I know they shared quite a lot though, so it's definitely possible that it was in both. I only vaguely remember the unique details of Wand of Uru, though, since I'm allergic to bullshit unique wand cliches.

*** edit: I think [[https://github.com/robertseaton/fanfic-analysis/blob/master/fanfic/alienyouthct%20-%20Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Second%20Life_06hhpuuihtb14pkk789tskalh2.txt][that's]] it. Skimmed through some parts and I'm pretty sure it is. Don't know how I missed it last time I was looking for this fic.

I'm almost sure the title has been Harry Potter and the Second Life and it was rewrite of SilverAegis' fic, but it was removed and I can't find archive anywhere.

Seems ridiculous and overloaded with tropes, but it was an okay guilty pleasure fic which I reread occasionally. I'm so sad I removed my whole calibre library at some point and it got lost. Never ever doing that again.

#+begin_quote
  After slipping diagonally through time and space to a familiar time in an unfamiliar world, Harry finds himself fighting to save a future that's not quite what he remembers? Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with homebrew X-Men and Inhuman elements because studio politics suck.
