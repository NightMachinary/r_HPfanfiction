*** He's essentially looking for a story where the MC isn't locked into any one relationship and is polyamorous, or at least has undertaken flings with a variety a of girls. I think parts of linkffn(Too Young to Die) meet that requirement, however it isn't the main focus of the fic, despite there being plenty of it over the stories duration. If you enjoy dark!harry, and in this case I mean seriously dark then give it a read. What you're looking for should be scattered throughout the fic but the largest concentration should be in the middle to later stages of it. It's complete by the way.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
