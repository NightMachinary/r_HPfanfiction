He can be in school or out of school as a teacher I don't have a preference. Would be nice if he is paired with someone at the school. No slash

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by jeconias]] comes to mind. Harry is at Beauxbatons for a bit but not a huge amount of time. I expect you're familiar with this one, though.

linkffn(Vanishing Illusions). Harry is a Durmstrang student at Hogwarts for the TWT. Does not spend really any time at Durmstrang though. Also abandoned.

A Very Long Engagement by Bioplague. You must have access to DLP's WbA Forum, I believe. It features a Beauxbatons Harry, yet there are only two chapters if memory serves. What little of it there is, is good. It is abandoned as well.

  Harry Potter, previously thought to be dead, arrives to compete in the triwizard tournament. How will being raised by a former Death Eater and attending Durmstrang, alter the boy's intended course.
