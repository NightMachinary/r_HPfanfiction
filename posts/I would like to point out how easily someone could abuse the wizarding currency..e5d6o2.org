** We're never told if the coins are made of solid gold. Most modern-day coins are made of alloys and only coated in silver or gold. And even if they are I don't think anyone magical is stupid or desperate enough to risk another goblin rebellion because I can't imagine the goblins will be impressed.

** Goblins could even more easily prevent people from doing this. Even if it wasn't possible to prevent people from melting down the coins, they could just have capital controls. Limit the amount of wizard money that can be bought with muggle money to, say, the average amount muggleborn parents pay to educate their children per year.
