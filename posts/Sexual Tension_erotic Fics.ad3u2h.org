Preferably with Harry. Maybe he and Fleur get stuck in a closed and limited place (like an Elevator) and the more time they spend their, the more uncomfortable it gets. Not because of their Relationship, but because the circumstances force them to get "real close". Humor is ok. Its not necessary for them to have sex. The Top should be, that one or both are in their underwear....or if nudity is included, they dont see the other, although im not rejected if it is the case.

Or tboth of them are on to something an she uses her Veela allure to gain access and Harry is unlucky to be affected by it as well.

â€‹

Malfoy and Hermione or any other pairs are also fine (although i would be glad, if Draco wouldnt have Canon traits here)


** There is "A boy and his cloak", which has Harry walk in on Hermione under his invisibility cloak and the resulting tension. Perhaps the best character depiction in a smutfic. No sex, but pretty much everything short of it.

No link due to Rule 5, but Google is your friend.

** I think you'd enjoy the early chapters of "Searching for the Power", so long as you can stomach a Harry who's a bit of a wet blanket.

In later chapters it just devolves into a free-for-all harem.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many
