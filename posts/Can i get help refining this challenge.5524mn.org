here is the basics of the challenge

in the challenge world Voldemort never made horcruxes he was more of a loner

Voldemorts goal is a magical world

he also doesn't appear in the uk again till 2010 so the first and second war never happen

when he appears he does two rituals

the first ritual that turns all fossil fuels,uranium,pollution and muggle infrastructure built in the last 200 years into raw magic that is pumped into the air. while that is happening he also downloads the whole internet onto a magical computer and puts all muggles that need it on a life support spell

the reason he download the internet is because the information is to big a resource for him to let it be lost

the reason that puts the muggle on life support is for the second ritual

the second ritual turns the Life force and physical body of all muggle men into raw magical power that is pumped into the air. the ritual takes on a life of its own and also targets all muggle women over breeding age. it also targets all muggles on the life support spell

buy doing the second ritual he ensure the extinction of muggle as a subspecies of human.

with the amount of raw magic in the air casuses the power of all magicals to be boosted. A first year would be as powerful as Dumbledore. Voldemort was a lot stronger than a first year he has practically become a god.

using his new magical power he summons all sentient humanoids he then explains what he has done an offers the option for muggle women to follow there loved ones into death 9/10 take the obtain leaving him with 350000000 muggle women of beeding age.

he then explain his plan to for the muggle women to be impregnated by the muggleborn males to create a sustainable number of magicals now that he has ensured the muggle extinction.

the women in Voldemort new world would exists outside the class system. with them being kept happy and healthy so that they would birth healthy children.

the mother would also have full rights to the child not out of any kindness but to keep the mothers happy and healthy and because the men would be fathering hundreds of children.

while pregnant they would be free to peruse that they find interesting from education to entertainment.

the class system :

muggleborn men with no living family at the bottom they would be made to impregnate the muggle women weather they want to or not all day every day.

muggleborn men with family's would have live a bit easier if only to keep the females in there life happy and healthy

half-blood males would able to impregnate muggle women or muggleborn women and magical beings like veela

pureblood males would be made to impregnate muggleborn and halfblood women with the option of muggle and veela women if they want to

pureblood woman would be able to have any male they like impregnate them Although if the man has a wife there might be some negotiations

magicals with rare gift like metamorphmagus,parseltongue,ect would be in high demand

Voldemort would also set up suicide booths for any one to use that would turn the rest of there life force and body into magic for people who did not want to life anymore. if you don't want to live who is he to make you stick around and suffer a slow and painful death by organ failure otherwise known as old age.

the reaction of the magical would be mixed some of the younger wizards and witches would be horrified but most will just shrug there shoulder and go back to there research. it doesn't effect them.

can you please help me refine this challenge

for the main point of view I am thinking 30 year old bacholar harry potter.

threw him we can see the reaction of his pureblood grand parent his muggle born mother and any siblings he has. I would give him as least one female sibling.


** It's not a challange - it's some crazy wish fulfilment power fantasy. A nonsense one at that.

There is not even a hint what a story would be about. It's just "Voldemort is OP beyond any acceptable degree, destroys muggles in one ritual, makes wizards greater than even (in a way that doesn't even fit with the setting), and allows them to have sex with muggle women all day, all night.

Pleas do everyone a favour and think what you post about before you post.

*** It started off as a thought excise on what a competent sane Voldemort would Do to ensure muggle extinction.

The rituals later become a means to an end because the idea become not how he would ensure muggle extinction but what he would do with the world after he has done it.

And how he would ensure that there is enough genetic diversity among magical so that they could survive

for the muggleborn men this story would class as a horror story

*** To simplify the challenge because I can see I let started to answer it myself it has two parts

1.how would the writer ensure the extinction of muggles as a subspecies

2.what would they do with the world afterwards to ensure magicals can survive with the muggles gone

** You keep saying challenge and I'm not sure what you mean. Is this something that you want to write, or are you opening it up as a challenge to other writers? If it's the second, you've outlined exactly how you want it written and I don't think anyone is interested in just connecting the dots. It also sounds like some sort of weird fantasy.

*** It started off as a thought exercise.

The original thought was how could Voldemort ensure muggle extinction because the way he was going about it in the books sure as hell was not going to work.

So then came the two the two rituals

The rest was going threw the now that the muggle extinction as a subspecies has been ensured how to make sure that magicals survive.

now I would be interested in some one actually writing that world because I sure as hell cant

I tend to do thought exercise like this but this is the first one I. Have put down on paper

*** To simplify it it can real be broken down into a two part challenge

The first is if you how you the writer would go about causing extinction of muggles as a subspecies .

The second is what would the write do once they have done done part one

As you can tell from the blotted first challenge the first this I would do is make sure that there is enough genetic diversity for the magicals to survive
