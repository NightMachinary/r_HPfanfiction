  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  Tom Riddle has always believed he was special, but having a girl only he can see constantly criticising him wasn't what he had in mind. [Semi-AU/Canon AU. Crack. Ghost OC.]

  Tom had just finished creating his Horcrux when Hermione had appeared, spilling out of the air and carrying another freshly-torn piece of soul with her as she crashed into him... and the next thing he knew, there was a distinct sensation of someone settling down next to him, inside of him, his Horcrux now home to two souls.

  Hermione Granger has found herself inexplicably tossed back into time to Tom Riddle's Hogwarts. And he's a Veela and, wouldn't you know it, she's his mate. Could life get worse? But he seems to have an endless supply of out-of-season fruit so it can't be all bad, right? Tomione. Major character death, musical theater, and all that fruit. COMPLETE.

** Wait I also have another, this one doesn't really focus on Tom at Hogwarts, its an SI-OC fix-it fic from her point of view but it's one of the best Tom Riddle fics I've ever read! Also Dumbledore isn't evil but he is pretty manipulative and the MC has some resentment towards him for this, but he's not genuinely evil or purposely an asshole.

I love this fic so much, I literally have no complaints about it everything about it is perfect. And this one is all complete!

***** I started reading this one. I'm like 10 chapters in and it's surprisingly good! I enjoy SI stories, but for whatever reason, the HP SI fics are almost all terribly written. Whatshername in hufflepuff and magical me (I think that's the one) are the only good SI fics I'm aware of.

****** Right!!!! I feel the same way!! But this one surprised me too and I find Dumbledores character is done pretty well. I think the balance we got between him being good and bad is accurate seeing as he's not a BAD person just has his own agenda which Marina KNOWS because she knows his character well enough. I also love Marinas character, she brings the right amount of humour in inappropriate situations and I guess because I feel like I can really relate to her

******* I agree, Dumbledore is really well done so far. It's a portrayal of a realistic human, without bashing or deifying him. He says and does all the right things in line with his espoused philosophy, but he's also no fool and has seen too much of Voldemort's life to start trusting him, even when presented with evidence Tom is starting to change. It's a natural response and it lets him take on a slightly antagonistic role in the story while still being sympathetic and in character.

******** Exactly!! I thought this authors interpretation of Dumbledore was spot on. Which is very rare to find for Dumbledore, so it was very refreshing.

** I really enjoyed this one it's a Tom/OC time travel fic. Though I should warn you the first book is complete with 50+ chapters, but the second is still ongoing.

Really really well written the plot and pacing is amazing in my opinion and I liked it because there was no Dumbledore bashing. Mainly I loved how the author delved into Tom's character and who he was at Hogwarts and then how he changes. I think they did a really good job of showing just how dangerous and dark he can be, but still distinguishing his teenage self from Voldemort because he's clearly not too far gone.

Only complaint I had was the author sometimes doesn't start a new paragraph when a new person speaks. It's one of my biggest pet peeves but I was actually able to look over it because I loved the content so much!
