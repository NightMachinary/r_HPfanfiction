I'm rereading pretty much all the fan fiction I've ever downloaded and recording my thoughts on it, and after going through about sixty of them, I've just about had it.

Can anyone recommend a fic that has at least two women involved, in proactive roles, who talk to each other about something other than romance, without sexual violence or being subservient to a man, and where women have at least 30% of the dialogue?

These basic filters have taken out 92% of what I've read. The ones I've found that pass:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/109558/chapters/151674][In Loco Parentis]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] -- just barely; Hermione only speaks to women on two or three occasions.
- [[http://hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] -- probably fails the dialogue percentage, but it passes everything else.

**** I loved the start of this fic but felt like it so quickly devolved into Hermione worship...

Hermione seems so overpowered and doesn't act her age anymore. She acts like a prim, nagging 20-something year old. She has an answer to everything and everyone, and the story has her solving or leading almost every situation/plot point.

/shrug/ Just wanted to throw out a disclaimer to temper people's expectations.

** After reviewing my favorites list, the only ones I can think of have massive caveats, that will cause most people to discard them for other reasons. I also realized that I need to clear out my favorites list, a lot of it is crap:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10881593/1/Riding-Acromantulas-and-Understanding-Magical-Biology][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]]. This is a massive crossover, where you need to know the other setting. Two main characters (both women) from the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm][Wormverse]] get abruptly dropped into Harry Potter, and are very confused upon finding themselves in 1990s Britain. In the Wormverse, they both have superpowers.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]]. Very straightforward self-insert. Main character who's read Harry Potter and HP fanfiction wakes up as a newborn girl in the Malfoy family.

When I went through my favorites, I just realized how many of them fail this, and a surprising number of them on the sexual violence portion. Every Other Midnight--not enough women in the proactive roles. Princess of the Blacks--sexual violence. Firebird trilogy--sexual violence. Maybe someone who's read Stages of Hope recently can say whether that one makes the cut.

**** I did finish it. If you had too, you would have seen that Voldemort, the violently misogynistic sociopath, is one of the main antagotists and (Spoiler Alert) dies. The Goblins, who in this universe propetuate their race via rape of witches, are also major villains and (Spoiler Alert) are killed. There are a multitude of witches shown in a positive light, and not just the hot ones. For example (Spoiler alert) Augusta Longbottom, Molly Weasley, Amelia Bones and a number of OCs from both Britain and America. As the series goes on, the gender politics become more and more nuanced to the point that I was unable to say that the witiches were not justified in the initial creation of the Sabbat and the draining Bonds. But, like all systems of power, it became corrupt over time and needed to be replaced with one that valued equality for both genders.

TL;DR You quit too soon.

** You should start a blog or something with your findings. I'm sure people would be interested in your thoughts on various fics. Especially (no offense to anyone) the Tumblr crowd.

Sadly I can't think of any fics like that off the top of my heard, aside from maybe the Alexandra Quick series.

** Well, my list is significantly shorter, and I only read canon-compliant, but I think I also have the same problem. In fact, there are only two in my favorites that fit your requirements. The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] (mentioned elsewhere on this thread), and, oddly enough, the other is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]].

The main character in "Alexandra Quick" is a young girl, and she doesn't even get interested in guys until about the fourth book. She has conversations with a bunch of other noteworthy female characters including: her school headmistress, her teachers, her best friend Anna, the Pritchard twins, her half-sister, and her mother. It passes your requirements with flying colors, although people tend to find Alexandra very off-putting. She's extremely headstrong and stubborn. I would describe her as having ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), meaning that she has a real problem listening to authority. Makes the story very interesting.

"The Life and Times" is about the Marauders, and it splits the focus between James and his friends (probably about 60%), and then Lily and her friends (40%).There is a whole host of interesting female characters including: Lily, Donna, Marlene, Mary, Carlotta, and Shelley. However, I should warn you, the story intentionally reads like a teenage drama, and the focus is on the budding romance between James and Lily. They do talk a lot about guys (especially Mary, Carlotta, and Shelley), but it's handled pretty well. I think when you read the description, the immediate reaction is to think that it's going to butcher the female characters...but honestly, they are all pretty dynamic. They make mistakes in romance, suffer from them, recover, call others out on their bullshit, and of course, discuss the upcoming war.

"Alexandra Quick" has four books in the series. The author is currently working on number five. "The Life and Times" has not been updated in almost two years, but it's super long and was last updated at a point that could potentially be the end.

Most fics with rough equality in number of lines said by gender are heterosexual romance fics. In a heterosexual romance fic, the male love interest typically is involved in things besides romance. This necessitates him talking to various people about those things -- for instance, defeating Voldemort. The female love interest typically has less involvement with the world in general. If this happened once in a while, with a good split between the female love interest being more awesome and the male love interest being more awesome, this wouldn't be indicative of sexism.

The fics I'm reading and rating are typically not primarily romantic. However, they often have a heterosexual romantic subplot. In these, the protagonist is almost always male. The love interest rarely does much useful aside from supporting the protagonist. It's not "here's a character who is splendid and worthwhile in her own right, and she's also in love with the main character." Rather, the author wanted the protagonist to have a love interest and didn't bother fleshing out that character any more than necessary to establish a particular flavor of love interest.

If there's character growth, the love interest doesn't grow. She can incite character growth in the protagonist, but she will always be supportive. She will always be submissive to a degree, even when she really shouldn't be. If there's a Harry/McGonagall pairing, McGonagall would never try to use her authority as a professor to stop Harry from a suicidal charge, for instance. If there's a Harry/Hermione pairing, Hermione will dedicate her studies to keeping Harry alive (admittedly a high priority) and abandon studying for exams without so much as a wince if it could help Harry. If it's Harry/Tonks, Tonks will be only mildly concerned with keeping her job if the alternative is getting to bed Harry.

Harry, on the other hand, will remain concerned with a wide array of things. Harry can have a mission. Harry can go off on a desperate attempt to save Sirius's life. Harry can be worried about Quidditch matches. Harry can be proactive, while his love interest can at best demand to come along with him to help.

I've seen one fic in which this trend is reversed: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]]. It's explicitly a romance fic, and it features a Hermione that's pretty much exactly as we'd expect from fandom: no major flaws, brightest witch of her generation. (I can't recommend that story because it involves emotional abuse.) One. Out of the two hundred or so I'm reviewing.

The median isn't equality. It's male-dominated. This is true whether you include romance or not.

Which is 100% a mysoginistic issue. Well I mean it's either that or something totally innocent like the protagonist of the series being male.

I think the majority of what you are complaining about is just shit writing that is a side-effect of the fact we are discussing fanfiction largely written by teenagers. It's not shocking that the side-characters get poor motivation going on, are you even bothering to compare the love-interest to say the male best friend? Because i'm betting they're about the same in terms of motivation, that being 'oh fuck our bff is prophesied to defeat Voldemort, who gives a shit about our petty bullshit'.

Not in authors it's not, it's overwhelmingly female. In fact the most common pairing is Hermione/Draco from Hermione's POV so tbh it seems like your sample size isn't accurate of the actual fanfiction being written.

** I'm currently writing a fanfic which I think fits your criteria. One of the central POV characters is Hermione. It's not romance. I'm actively trying to avoid a lot of what you've mentioned because I don't like it either.

It's an AU set in the future (2011) of a world where Harry and several of his friends were kidnapped, in 2001, by Unspeakables, and Voldemort took over the wizarding world. It's currently at 63k words. There should be another chapter (~10k words) by the end of this month (June). It features a strong supporting female cast as well as two female POV characters, Luna Lovegood and Hermione Granger. Hermione and Harry are probably the two primary characters.
