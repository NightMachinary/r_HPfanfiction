** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Harry accidentally flies past a camera and the order forgets to obliviate, and suddenly he's in a Super Bowl ad seen by millions and the statute of secrecy is trash.

In a world without secrecy, everything turns into a massive mess. Osama Bin Laden starts recruiting wizard jihadists, MIT experiments with brooms, Voldemort discovers Bioweapons, Vernon got a cousin in Westboro (that place with the baptist church), 9/11 looks tame in comparison to what happens when christian and muslim anti-wizard terrorists team up, Arthur Weasley gets a job in the automotive industry, Flamel gets trouble with Big Pharma, Harry falls for the same trick /again/, Malfoy infiltrates Saudi Arabia, Kim Jong-Il's plans for a wizard army doesn't quite work out when they all defect to South Korea, and the entire religious world is thrown into mayhem when the ghost of a biblical prophet tries to reunite Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

The American wizard culture plays a role since the breach happened there. The story jumps all around the world though.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** American wizarding culture isn't featured as much as America in general in linkao3(7833937) Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton. The trio fuck off to the Bay area after book 4, and just live their lives while things get progressively worse in Britain. In my top 5 favorite fics of all time.

#+begin_quote
  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.
