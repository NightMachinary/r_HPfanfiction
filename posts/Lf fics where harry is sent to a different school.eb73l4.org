Haven't read it in awhile, but it was one of my favorite stories back in the day. Sadly the last new chapter was almost 5 years ago.

It is one of these where there are two children of the potter family, with the other child getting the title of boy-who-lived,. It was the only one of those stories which I found interesting, thanks to not bashing the Potters so that Harry gets victimized, he ends up becoming a dark wizard and going to Durmstrang.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
