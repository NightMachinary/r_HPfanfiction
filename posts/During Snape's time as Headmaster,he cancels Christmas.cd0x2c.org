**** I've read the occasional SS-centric Christmas Carol, and the past is usually Eileen, probably because Lily would introduce a big can of worms from her appearance alone disrupting the typical flow of such a story (Present being Dumbledore, and future being... well, nobody specific). Past generally does have scenes involving Lily, though.

*** First the Grinch has to devise an overly complicated plot to reinstate Christmas. Didn't you read the prompt? Snape cancelled Christmas. There's nothing to steal until we get it back somehow.

**** Maybe I'm reading too much into your comment, so I'll just point out that in this case I was referring to Snape as the Grinch in this story.

***** The Grinch is far more charismatic than Snape. He also bathes more often.

** That actually sounds like a great idea. Cancelling the 'overly muggle tradition' gives him a little credit with the Carrows in the castle, and not holding a Christmas feast means that the rebellious students (that I think he's supposed to be secretly rooting for?) have more time in the day to 'make merry'.

** Someone needs to come up with a song that starts out, "You're a mean one, Mr. Snape, you really are an eel, ..." but that would be more Fred and Georges' forte, and they're not in Hogwarts anymore. Maybe Ginny might have written to her brothers about Christmas being canceled, and then Hogwarts students who tuned into Potter watch might hear such a song, and everywhere Snape slinks throughout the castle, someone surreptitiously plays the song. Maybe the twins create and distribute records of themselves singing the song. But would Snape actually slither and slink about the castle, literally stealing Christmas? He might just order the house elves to do it.

** This actually would fit the Death Eater's and Snape's hidden agenda in cannon. The Death Eaters want the children as hostages, and Snape wants them where he can keep them (relatively) safe.
