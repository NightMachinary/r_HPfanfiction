So I've been reading /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ by Lomonaaeren and I've been loving it. I love the twist of Harry's parents being the ones in St. Mungos, and I really love Harry's single minded determination to restore his parents sanity.

My question is, are there any stories that are somewhat similar to /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ where Harry manages to return his parents to life through some immense magical trials or something that isn't simply a deus ex machina?

I want to read about his struggles bringing them back, all his failures, his search for knowledge, his sacrifices. If such a story exists I would love to read it.

linkff(The Art of Self-Fashioning)


** I've actually been thinking about this same idea for a while and have been planning on writing one like that. I've always wanted a story where after Harry learns of magic he refuses to believe what people say is impossible and dedicates all his time, even if it takes years, to bringing his parents back to life. It could become like an obsession for him. I never understood why he never even thought that in canon. It would have been the first thing on my mind if I were him. He sort of did that after Sirius died in a way.

*** That's pretty much exactly where I am. I've begun writing a little of it, and it pretty much starts when Harry sees them in the mirror or Erised. Massive revelation occurs, Harry becomes obsessed with death and all sorts of dark magic etc.

Basically, it would be pretty similar to The Art of Self-Fashioning. Harry would delve into dark magic, or magic that people say is incredibly dangerous or even impossible. But he doesn't care because it /might/ help bring his parents back.

**** OK cool. My idea was for that to start after Voldemort offers to bring then back at the end of PS. Harry obviously doesn't believe that he would, even if he could, but it plants that idea in his head. My idea though, based off something i read on another fic, is that Snape is also has been working on the same thing for years. He is obsessed because he somehow convinced himself that if he brought Lily back she would realize she is in love with him and eventually Harry figures this out and gets really creeped out. I should probably check out the The Art of Self-Fashioning though.

***** Oh snap I would love to read the scene where Harry confronts Snape.

I can just imagine how mentally unstable Snape eventually becomes in his thirst for bringing back Lily.

****** I haven't completely figured out that part yet. What I have planned is to have Harry sort if figures out how to do it but can't complete the process yet and then he sneaks into Shapes private quartets to retrieve the marauders map that was confiscated from him and accidentally happens across a hidden room where Snape has the work he has done so far. What he finds allows him to finish the process. Im thinking maybe Snape is working in the room when Harry finds it and he overhears him talking to himself. Because of circumstances that will be elaborated upon in the story, harry can only bring back his mother. Eventually when Harry sneaks back in and completed the process, Snape figures out what happens and has some kind of mental break down I'm guessing. Lol.

*** There's a story where Harry's parents are alive, but his sister is killed in front of him. He then goes /really/ dark in a life-long quest to bring her back. He's almost insanely obsessed with her and bringing her back.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** The Last Casualties is really good. Like stay up late into the night reading good. Fair warning though, it gets a bit slow and preachy at times. Believe it's by muggledad. It's super long and not even finished with updates taking a while but I suspect that may be because author is in school. Another good one is Society of the Vesta Accolates. Sorry but I don't remember the author. Also taking a while with updates. James and Lilly haven't been brought back yet but if you read it you'll see what I mean. Be warned: there is dumbledore and Molly bashing in the second one. Edit: The Society fic also has a really interesting take on the Malfoys.

*** Actually, Muggledad is a husband and father - twin girls and a son, if memory serves. So "Real Life" is interfering with writing, not schooling.

But he's still around - saw a review from him on someone's story a few days ago.

I agree that "Last Casualties" is good. He's one of the more consistently better writers out there. "The End and the Beginning" is also quite good - a really gripping start, too, though the end is more than a bit anticlimactic. When you build up the bad guy so much in a story, you need to give readers a more cathartic fight with him at the end.
