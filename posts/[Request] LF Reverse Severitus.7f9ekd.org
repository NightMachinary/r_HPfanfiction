******* How is that? It sounds like a bunch of nonsense. Like a ton of fluff or something, which is fine, but I don't usually like fluff pieces if that's all there is to it.

** Here's one: "No Difference" linkffn(4860602). Otherwise, "Raising Snape" linkffn(12550041) might be up your alley. In it, Harry who was partly raised by Severus, is now raising Severus after he's de-aged.
