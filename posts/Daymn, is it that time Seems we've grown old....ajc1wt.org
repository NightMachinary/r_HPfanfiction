For some godforsaken reason I decided to try and find a number of old (really old) shit, and after some minutes of blasting my memory I remembered it was on fiction alley.\\
Cue my horror when I found out that website is now dead.\\
After some more searching, I happened upon this 6 year old post :\\
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/]]

90% of everything there is dead.

I remember when portkey. org died. I actually cried, that site had some of the best fiction written in human history. I grew up reading that site, I discovered fanfiction and learned how to read 10 hours a day without stopping to eat even, on that site. And most of the others? I knew or visited them, some quite a lot. All dead now.\\
The vast majority of my teenager-hood is defunct and buried. I am feeling feels of undetermined and unquantifiable levels of sadness and horror.\\
Small ray of hope tho, that AO3 has their "save a website" program. Thank all the dark gods for small miracles.

Guys and gals, fic readers and writers of this planet - do you feel the boom, the age, the days of prolific fanfiction are coming to a close? HP is pretty deflated as a fandom, compared to 5-10 years ago. Bleach Died, Naruto is pretty much over as a fad, only the more dedicated are still around, other books and movies + anime are really not generating fandoms which write fanfiction, as far as I can see...\\
Am I wrong here, too blinded by grief to see a second renaissance ?\\
What are your thoughts and opinions on this ?


** I remember the old days when I had a sticky note on my computer monitor with a list of Geocities pages of HP fanfiction that I checked reguarly for updates. This was in the early 2000's. There were certain fics I read and re-read so much that I ended up copy-pasting them into a word doc and printing them for a ring binder.

Geocities was nuked, and all those fics are gone. Some of them have been mirrored on FFN, but I can only check the ones whose titles + authors I remember from 15 years ago. And my mom threw away my fanfic binder years ago.

At least these days data is cheap and Ao3 has a Download function so it's much easier to save fics for posterity, outside of copying to a Floppy drive or printing in hard copy.

** I actually don't think the HP fandom has deflated that much. It's not the all pervasive craze it was, but it's still surprisingly huge, just a bit more incognito. I helped run a local convention for a few years and even though there hasn't been much new HP stuff in a while (this was before Fantastic Beasts) there were still SO many people who came in cosplaying HP characters, asking where to find the merch, looking around to see what they could find- we had to have HP themed activities every time or else we'd have upset patrons.

** I don't think the HP fandom is dying out. It's not a worldwide phenomenon that everyone talk about anymore but more and more people I know read fanfic low key and don't really talk about it. It's easier for FFN and AO3 to survive because they cater to almost all fandoms.

However I am extremely paranoid. If I come across a fic I know I'd enjoy reading again, I immediately download it, regardless of completion. I'm scared of websites and authors deleting fics I love.

Thankfully someone put the site back up and I was able to download the story but that piece of me was almost lost forever.

** Yeah, Fiction Alley is being imported to [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/fictionalley]], but there are only 73 works there so that can't be complete. If you remember specific titles or authors, it's possible they've reposted their own stuff on FFn or Ao3.

Fandoms do tend to die once there is no more original material. The movies drew HP out somewhat, but it's pretty natural it would die down. That said, I still feel like there's plenty of stuff being posted for HP on the big 2. Maybe not as much as the heyday, but still a good amount.

** For now, but given the culture, I'd give it a decade or less before HP is rebooted in some form, be it anthology, animated series, or something else.

The worldwide impact of HP, its British origin and status as a standout British export of the last 20 years, and the ongoing Newt films should buff it up even if the original core canon fandom depletes a little - and even then we still have, I would say, at least ten years of authors coming up from the kids of original fans who read them at the time and have passed the love of their favorite series on to the younger generation. That in particular might be an exciting time as a new generation becomes the dominant reader and interpreter of an unchanged canon from two decades ago. Already tbh over the last 5 years and since HPMOR there's been influx of new opinions to shift the tide of fanon.

** IMO the HP fanfic community is experiencing what a lot of other entertainment media have gone through historically--diffusion of their userbase.

Like how 25, 30+ years ago cable was almost the sole provider of film entertainment for the masses, such that you could talk to almost anyone about the latest episode of Friends or Law and Order because available options were limited. Then, as options grew, DVR became a thing, and everyone started diversifying what they watched, those flagship shows seemed to fade into the background a bit.

Now you have the same thing that happened here. While HP certainly wasn't the first fanfic fandom, it was by far the one that pretty much anyone who heard of fics at the time knew about, and enjoyed massive amounts of quality contributions to it. Now with HP no longer being so viral, that fandom has proliferated out into countless other series, giving a more "even" spread to author quality.

I do not think you will ever see a Second Renaissance of the HP fandom, as you put it, because it's very hard to re-monopolize cultural attention like that. What we will find instead, is smaller "renaissances" as different series go in and out of vogue, until the next super-viral story takes hold and captures everyone's attention again.

The fandom is quieter these days, but I really don't think it's in danger. Change isn't death. On AO3, if you filter to all Harry Potter fics, you can refresh and get a new one as the most recently updated fic every few minutes sometimes.

*** Same. That's where I first started posting back in 2005. I even became a beta reader for that site, mostly so I could post my stories myself instead of having to wait for my beta to do it. I remember it as a very well-designed site with a good posting interface, message boards, and comment section. I liked that it was a curated archive, so there wasn't any of this “I wrote this at 3am lol” dreck that we have to wade through now. The community surrounding it was very active and I made some good IRL friends, including my beta that I still work with.

This sub and the associated Discord are great, but nothing like the old CM community.

** I've been reading fanfic for six years, so it was after the movies ended. I wouldn't say it's gone downhill, but it hasn't experience the renaissance I hoped might be coming from /Fantastic Beasts/. I'd also say it's evolved. When I started reading, there were a lot of derivative Super!Harry and Harmony stories. Now, it feels to me like there are a lot more dark stories, Slytherin pairings, and even Harry/Tom and Hermione/Tom stories (which I really don't understand).

I've been on FFN from the start, so I've been lucky enough to avoid any sites dying on me, but I've also downloaded all of my FFN favorites with Calibre, just in case the site finally collapses under its own weight.

I started with the most popular stories on FFN and quickly realized so many of them followed the template you listed in your post. Add in Harry calling manipulative Dumbledore "old man" every other sentence and pretty much everything is covered.

It's obviously an exaggeration to say all popular fics include all these things but it is shocking how many well regarded fics retread those ideas/styles over and over again. They read as extended therapy sessions for venting all their personal frustrations with canon.
