I prefer writing in third person limited, cycling character perspectives each chapter. Who in Harry's year do we not hear from much? I was thinking about having at least one perspective from each house (not including Harry), to follow and focus on throughout. They will probably all need to get along in some fashion so I don't have too many diverging plots.

Thanks!

edit: I am planning at this point to roughly follow the same /timeline/ as canon, but not at all follow the canon /plot/.

*** People say this a lot, and I think I get what they mean but I also don't. Maybe you could help me out?

I understand that it's really boring to read over and over again "they went for the stone then they went for the basilisk then someone escaped from Azkaban and then Harry got put in a tournament," even if it's slightly different people (Harry and Draco being best mates rather than Harry and Ron for example) or done in a slightly different way (Harry befriends the basilisk rather than kill it).

BUT. If you want to tell a story about Harry and his time at HoggyWartys and how he destroys Voldemort, are there not some fixed points that have to happen? At the very least, the Sword of Gryffindor has to get the basilisk venom into it so it can destroy Horcruxes, Sirius has to appear in some fashion so they eventually meet Kreacher and can destroy the locket, and Voldie has to be resurrected.

Unless by "don't follow canon" you mean "throw the whole thing away, no horcruxes, have Voldemort destroyed in a completely different way," which I would support because it's, as I'm sure you'll agree, more interesting than a tweaked rewrite. But I've rarely seen it done well.

So, if you're a "don't follow canon at all" person, what sort of things would you like to see? Asking for a totally self interested reason as, much like OP, I'm looking to move on to the "Hogwarts" section of my WIP!

**** I would pick different ways to destroy horcruxes and/or Voldemort. Well, I did so in my stories multiple times.

***** Cool. I've already planned that one is found pre Harry starting Hogwarts so I think we're on the same page here. Always nice!

In all honesty the more I think about it, the more I think the events of PS are not necessary to the wider story. Let Quirrell get trapped in the mirror of his own volition. Harry can concentrate on another, unique, adventure in his first year!

*** Not planning to follow canon plot, going to diverge rather quickly, but certain events that aren't going to change get repetitive told from Harry's point of view. Like for example, his sorting. Or, almost any lesson with Snape.

** Please don't repeat same scene from different PoV. I read few fics where Harry does something and author talks about the same scene in different perspective of every character present. It was all about how Harry was powerful, awesome ...etc.

*** Ha, that would be terrible. I'm planning on doing a plot with other characters... Harry just happens to be in Hogwarts at the same time as a side character. First impression of Harry is along the lines of "who's that small speccy bloke in the corner?"

** I think a thing to decide early on is how much divergence you're willing to deal wtih. My partner is writing a year-per-longfic story with a very different POV and the initial year follows closely to canon because the viewpoint character isn't involved enough to change things, although some small things DO get changed by their existence. These changes snowball over time and by 5th year, the existence of the out-of-canon viewpoint has interplayed enough with the canon HP events that things start to happen very, very, VERY differently. Books 6 and 7 will basically be entirely different.

I think it can be difficult to do a story where events diverge very little from canon while still keeping things feeling fresh, especially with a Harry viewpoint, unless he makes some very different choices. And if he makes different choices, depending on what those choices are... it'd be weird for things to play out exactly the same, and the further along you get, the more things will diverge. I think the further your viewpoint character is from the canon trio, it gets easier in some ways to maintain the canon timeline, if that's what you want to do.

*** Thank you, that's really helpful. I'm actually planning on a lot of divergence happening almost immediately which will directly impact Harry's life (including but not limited to replacing one of the trio)... but despite the twist, I don't want the focus of the story to be all about him.

What I'm going for is matching the timeline, in that there still 7 years at Hogwarts, and some events outside of their control will be affected by the divergence, but not prevented by the divergence.
