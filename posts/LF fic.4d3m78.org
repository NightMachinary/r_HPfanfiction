I remember reading a fic where in the 5th book Harry goes though the veil and finds out that he is related to death or something. I just remember Harry using the veil to visit his parents in a house. I am not sure if that's really helpful.


** Yeah I remember this one. He can go back and forth through the veil freely can't he? I can't remember much else though.
