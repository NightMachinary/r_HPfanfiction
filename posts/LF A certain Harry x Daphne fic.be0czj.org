Hoping someone can help me out, because at this point I feel like I may have imagined it. I remember it playing out like this:

Harry travels back in time to about fourth year after things have gone piss poor in the future. He had fallen in love with Fleur during their time at Hogwarts and ended up marrying her. Something happened which caused her to die and Harry to become (maybe) a dark lord. He decides to travel back in time to get Fleur back and keep her safe this time but ends up falling for Daphne G, who was something akin to a magical assassin who fought against Harry in the future.

Does any of this sound familiar for anyone out there? On a long car ride and I want to re-read it or at least make sure it exists.

Any help appreciated!


** Wrong flair; should be 'Fic Search'.

I'm afraid I can't help with the actual fic; I haven't read much Harry/Fleur at all, and this doesn't sound familiar.

** This sounds very good. I'm going to have to read it. I love Daphne being a magical assassin---usually it's Harry!
