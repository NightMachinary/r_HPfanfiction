Let me say that i really don't like Snape. I get his redemption part and his angist life, but for me he remains a bully and a very horrible teacher.

I remember once in a math class i ended up standing up to my teacher as she refused to answer a simple question i had as she had Better things to do than answer idiotic children (i was 19 at the time) .

And i just remembered Snape at that moment and thought well i always blamed Harry for never standing up to him, well let me do it instead.

Best moment of that year.

Anyway, i am looking for fics where Harry or any other students stand up to themselves and actually do something about him, he doesn't get instant redemption but someone actually shoes that they are paying money for education so they deserve it, or honestly anything that stands up against him, not picky.

(Sorry for formatting and spelling mistake, posted from my phone)

In this fic, Harry and Hermione deal with Snape. But no direct interactions. More dealing with him via Dumbledore. It is minor part of the whole story. Worth a read, though.

** linkffn(3384712) Not precisely to your more extensive specifications, but given the part that James plays in this story, you can see how Snape is not coming out smelling like flowers.

Also it's a good read.

*** Great story, but I want to mention that this fic is set up as part of a series. Unfortunately, the sequel has been abandoned, so you might want to avoid this if that's a concern.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
