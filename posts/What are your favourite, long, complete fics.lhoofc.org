** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: 643k words, awesome and revolutionary Trio, good and competent Dumbledore, rational and flexible Voldemort, intrigue, politics, and war galore

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 660k words. No magic? No problem because it's a darn awesome story with an awesome Trio. Everyone is a lot more dangerous than in canon, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lflrst/lf_ruthlessly_efficient_hermione/gmn8ph0/][especially Hermione]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]: 392k words. A very enjoyable time travel and a credible Harry/Bellatrix story

** It would be a crime not to mention A Cadmean Victory. Grey/dark Harry/fleur great writing, great characterization, this story had me hooked into binging the entire thing in a week pretty much.

I'd also like to recommend The Legacy by StorytellerSPW, but that story is less finished and more abandoned right before the final climax, but is still 800k words long and every bit of that is worth reading. I think my favorite of the Harry/Daphne stories so far.

Can't link them bc on mobile and I can never get it to work

** I haven't read it yet but i've heard good things about

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1085412/chapters/2182999][A Marauder's Plan]]

which is basically if Sirius had stayed and gotten harry after 3rd year. The main "relationship" is Hermione/ Harry so idk about that but its 865,520 words so thats good.

*** It sounded like a good plan but I only read about 20% before I couldn't go any further.\\
It's so much much much of politic blablabla and hurt. I had to stop when Sirius made Harry promise to go to a mental clinic.
