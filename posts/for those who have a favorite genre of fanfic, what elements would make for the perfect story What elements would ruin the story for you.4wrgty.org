Many of us have favorite genres of fics that we read (Marauders era, Founders, Time Travel, etc). I'm currently reading a ridiculous amount of Harry/Ginny post-Battle fics and I realized that I've developed a list of personal preferences for what I'd like to see in a story. I have yet to come across that perfect fic that does everything I want it to do but also avoids the things that i hate in the genre. I was wondering what other readers look for in their favorite genre. What plot points/characterizations would make for the perfect fic in your preferred genre?

Here's my list of what I'd love to see in my perfect Harry/Ginny fic (caveat that obviously all of these elements couldn't be in one fic):

- true to canon. Harry and Ron become Aurors, Hermione goes back to school, people wind up with who they canonically are supposed to wind up with.
- the characters remain true to canon. Ginny is not weepy and lacking confidence. Harry closes himself off when things get bad. Ginny and Harry both can be jealous at times.\\
- dialogue that sounds like them.
- heavy presence of the Weasleys.
- some sort of falling out between Harry and the Weasleys over his and Ginny's relationship that eventually gets reconciled.
- Ginny gets angry at Harry right after the battle for leaving her to suffer during her 6th year at Hogwarts but they reconcile during the summer. I just don't like making it too easy for them.
- While Ginny is at school and Harry in training, the long-distance relationship takes its toll on both of them. Harry gets jealous, so does Ginny. Lots of guys hit on her since they don't think her and Harry are really a thing or just don't care. Specifically, Dean tries to get back together, which really makes Harry upset. They eventually break up while she is at school. This has always struck me as a realistic thing to happen since long-distance relationships require good communication to work, and Harry was never good at that.
- Ginny goes on a date at school after they break up with a new character who she befriended or Neville who she bonded a lot with the year before, but it gets no further than that as she realizes Harry is the only one for her. Harry comes to same conclusion and they figure out a way to make it work.
- there is an auror case that plays as a backdrop to the real story of their relationship. This is more for pacing.
- the feelings Ginny might have of not being part of Harry, Ron and Hermione's special bond is a major plot line
- the realities of Harry's job force Ginny to make a decision about whether she can be in a relationship where Harry is constantly in danger. I know canon Ginny likes that about Harry that he won't rest until the world is safe, but it can't be a healthy way to live worrying about whether your husband is coming home that night. similar to wives and husbands of military. Ultimately, Harry gets through the most dangerous cases of rounding up death eaters and the job gets far less dangerous.
- Ginny wants her independence after living with 6 brothers her whole life, but Harry dislikes her not wanting to live with him.
- significant attention to Ginny trying out for, making, and playing for the Harpies
- Ginny gets a bit too crazy partying with her fellow Harpies, causing a drift in the relationship that ultimately is repaired.

What I hate to see:

- any sexual assault. A lot of fics mention that such things happened during Ginny's year at Hogwarts. It completely takes me out of the story and is just one of those triggers for me that I can't move past.
- Harry and Ginny become the perfect couple who are madly in love. there is no conflict in the story and they just aren't the type who profess their undying love to each other every time they talk.
- random divergences from canon. I don't understand why someone would want to change canon in relatively inconsequential ways, but it happens all the time.
- too heavy a focus on auror cases. i want some focus but don't make it overshadow the character development.
- making the Dursleys a large part of the story.\\
- Not enough Ron and Hermione. I like the idea that the four of them are all good friends.
- Super Harry or Soul Bonds. Just not my cup of tea. I want Harry to be normal and I want their relationship to be normal.
- Everyone being amazing friends with each other. Sorry, I just can't imagine Harry, Dean and Ginny all being super chummy. Same with Ron and Lavender.
- If Harry and Ginny break up, I don't want them dating other people. I just hate the idea of either of them being with other people in a significant way, especially if the other person is an existing character. I read one fic where Ginny dated Dennis Creevey, who was two years younger, and it just felt wrong on a lot of levels.
- weird conversations between Harry and the Weasleys about him and Ginny having sex. In what world do these conversations occur?
- Harry and Ginny getting married so soon after the battle. Even worse, joint wedding with Ron and Hermione

I disagree with this point. Ginny couldn't apparate, had trace on her, and would be a major liability on the horcrux hunt. She might have suffered a lot at school, but she also recruited an army for her (ex)boyfriend and provided just enough manpower to win the final battle. Looking back, I think she would rather be very proud of that achievement.

Speaking of her ordeal at school, Snape probably reigned in the 2 Carrows until Eastern holidays (when she went into hiding), and most likely bailed her out of several tight spots. So it's very conceivable that Ginny felt she owed a lot to Snape and wholeheartedly agreed with naming their child 'Severus'.

*** Canonically, you are probably correct that Ginny wouldn't have been angry with Harry since she understood why she couldn't go. Then again, Harry broke up with her to keep her safe. But it's possible that from her point of view, she wasn't safe at Hogwarts. So Harry left her for no reason. I don't necessarily agree with that, but I could see her rationalizing that in her mind. Also, Ron mentioned that she was very hurt by him ending it, despite it seeming like she fully understood why.

The point in my including this is that it would be a source of conflict in the story. Too many stories in this genre show little to no conflict, and what's interesting about that? I don't necessarily disagree that Ginny would not get angry, or if she did, it would be irrational. I'm just saying it was a possibility and an interesting plot to explore.

**** Manufacturing angst and conflicts is a big No-No IMO. I will categorically refuse to read those stories. For example, *The Hogwarts Strike Team*, linkffn(10807718), started out wonderfully. After the author started manufacturing angst in chapter 15, this fic fell apart, the reviewers were furious, and the author has all but given up.

One major source of conflict between Harry and Ginny immediately after the war was whether Harry should return to Hogwarts or not. If Harry was inclined to join the Ministry, Ginny could have been potentially furious: they had already suffered one year of separation, now Harry wanted another year? What was this guy thinking?

Once more separated, they would face endless temptations from other people. Staying true to each other and still believing in each other would be no easy thing.

***** I completely forgot about Harry choosing not to go back. You're absolutely right that I could see Ginny really being upset by that. The only issue with that is Ginny seems to get what Harry really wants, and being an Auror is what he wanted to do, so could she really get mad? But then again, it could be a case of the brain fighting the heart. In her head, she would understand why Harry couldn't go back to school. But her heart would tell her it made no sense. It could be construed as Harry choosing the job over her.

That's another plotline I like to see. Harry and Ginny's adult relationship is a great example of family vs. work. Chasing down death eaters is Harry's passion, but so is Ginny. Her passion is quidditch but also Harry. Neither job sounds like one where either can devote enough to the other while also being fully committed to their work. So how do they make it work?

**** I agree that sometimes these stories are too easy where nothing ever goes wrong, but to me its worse when an author puts in lots of relationship angst just so there's angst. That drives me up the wall. I hate when there are romantic subplots where the author keeps the main couple apart longer than necessary just so there's more unresolved tension or adds on ridiculous miscommunication for no reason. Ive seen so many horrible fics where some crazy fangirl stalker polyjuices into Harry's girlfriend (be it Ginny or whoever it is in the story) and then has said girlfriend walk in on him making out with the imposter. I think that is the worst trope possible and there are so many more examples of stuff like this.

*TLDR:* Its ok if things don't always go right but issues that come up must be believable. Angst added for angst sake is an instant bail for me.

***** Agree with you. Though I'd prefer angst for angst's sake rather than literally nothing happening, which I think is just as prevalent.

I also, as mentioned in the original post, would not want all the things I mentioned to happen in one story. But, for example, Harry and Ginny struggling because they don't spend much time with each other is a completely realistic scenario and one I wondered how Rowling would deal with if she ever were to write that story.

****** Have /something/ happen, then. Unless writing a story that does not deviate from canon at all, in which case there's no effing reason to add gratuitous angst, there's always a way to introduce something or someone that will serve as a source for some kind of conflict. Adding angst that is not necessary instead of doing it is basically like going swimming, having a floating wheel that's not inflated, and going “well, this thing doesn't work and thus won't help me, I guess I'll better take this big stone with me instead so that I won't sink” instead of just inflating the thing; meaning, it's a really stupid decision.

** Most of the stuff you want to see in your perfect pairing just seems like a bunch of contrived drama, just for the sake of drama. To each their own, I guess. Harry/Ginny post-war fics were what I started on as well, since I wanted to know what happened before the epilogue, but I eventually expanded my boundaries.

For me:

*I need conflict. There needs to be some overarching goal or plotline. There has to be a sense of danger, not necessarily in that anything and everything could suddenly go wrong, but the subtle reminder that something significant is happening beyond their periphery, and that you can't really just sit on your laurels waiting for something bad to happen.

*I hate arbitrary cliches. Sure, I get that sometimes you can really come to a natural conclusion that Harry using the Marauder's Map to uncover the fake Moody really does make the most sense in a story, but things like calling Daphne "Ice Queen" out of nowhere, or randomly mentioning magical cores with no buildup or followup is really jarring for a story.

*A story need a conclusion, or at lease some semblance of closure, even if it's just for the main plot. This isn't a knock at incomplete or WiP works, but rather those that leave a reader unsatisfied, or perhaps with more questions than answer, with no answers in sight. Feels bad, man.

*There has to be some semblance of realism, even though this is a fandom of magic. Like, I don't get the point of multi-pairings. So many people take a rare pairing with almost no good fics like Harry/Fleur, and then they randomly add Hermione into it (because she was his first friend! Then she gets transformed into some BDSM taskmaster) or Gabrielle, because of some veela nonsense. Same thing frequently happens with Harry/Daphne.

**** sure

*Ginny and Harry both can be jealous at times. --- When was Harry jealous of anything? The one time he saw her with Dean?

*some sort of falling out between Harry and the Weasleys over his and Ginny's relationship that eventually gets reconciled. --- Why would they get mad enough at Harry breaking up with Ginny that they have a falling-out over it, in the middle of a war? Needless drama.

*While Ginny is at school and Harry in training, the long-distance relationship takes its toll on both of them. Harry gets jealous, so does Ginny.--- Very arbitrary. Why would it take a toll on them? What are they getting jealous over? Is Dean really going to hit on the girlfriend of the person who just killed Voldemort, and someone he is a friend with as well? Doesn't seem realistic.

*Ginny goes on a date at school after they break up with a new character who she befriended or Neville --- Very random.

*there is an auror case that plays as a backdrop to the real story of their relationship. This is more for pacing. --- Whose Auror case? If Ginny is at Hogwarts for her seventh year, that means Harry is in his first year training - what kind of cases do you think a green Auror trainee is going to be handling, especially ones that are long term?

*the feelings Ginny might have of not being part of Harry, Ron and Hermione's special bond is a major plot line --- might be a major plot line, or it could be something that doesn't exist and is arbitrary. Harry chose Ginny to date, not Ron, and not Hermione. And, Harry certainly feels closer to Ginny in some aspects, i.e., they've both been possessed by Voldemort, whereas the others haven't.

*the realities of Harry's job force Ginny to make a decision about whether she can be in a relationship where Harry is constantly in danger. --- Harry was nearly murdered as an infant. There wasn't a year that went by at Hogwarts where Harry wasn't in danger, and didn't ultimately end up in the Hospital wing. This should be a non-issue, since it comes with the territory, Auror or not. But, if Voldemort couldn't off Harry, then I doubt anything he encounters as an Auror will.

*Ginny wants her independence after living with 6 brothers her whole life, but Harry dislikes her not wanting to live with him. --- Again, seems arbitrary. Drama for the sake of Drama. Canon Ginny seems like she would be more than happy to move in with Harry, if asked. I don't see a world where they are dating and the two options are 1) live by herself or 2) live with Harry, and she picks the first one.

*Ginny gets a bit too crazy partying with her fellow Harpies, causing a drift in the relationship that ultimately is repaired. --- Again, drama for the sake of drama.

***** Well I asked and you certainly answered. You're definitely right about a couple at least. All I can say is that these are new stories. All plot going forward will be contrived to some degree. I can suspend a small amount of disbelief for a good story. But going point by point:

1) Ginny definitely showed jealousy in the series. Harry definitely showed jealousy with Dean. So I don't see how this is contrived at all.

2) I'm not talking about the Weasleys being mad for Harry ending it during the war. I'm talking about after the war when they get back together. Perhaps Harry does something to Ginny that the Weasley brothers gets upset about. It could be anything, really. If done well and realistically, it could be interesting. Think about it. The Weasleys are the closest thing Harry has to a family, so if something happened that caused them to get angry at Harry, this would be a very interesting plotline.

3) Why would a long-distance relationship not take a toll on them? They are still a normal couple of teenagers who get jealous and act irrational at times. Harry is a poor communicator and Ginny has a quick temper. Surely you can imagine a scenario where the distance and not seeing each other often creates tension or misunderstandings. Regarding Dean, he is an ex boyfriend who would be around his ex while her current boyfriend is not there. Yes he is friends with Harry but he is a guy too who clearly liked Ginny. I'm not saying this is the most realistic plot I would support, but it is not so far-fetched. Plus, me including Dean is more a reaction to fanfics I've read where they make Dean way too platonic with Ginny. So you're not that off on this one.

4) The Neville one is random. Again, it's based on a very good fic I read that basically made the point that because Neville and Ginny were so close during Deathly Hallows (which I think is a fair assumption), that perhaps Neville developed feelings for Ginny. Honestly, it is not that realistic, but if you avoid a few minor events in canon, an argument could be made that Neville would be attracted to Ginny and she could feel a bond to him as well, though perhaps not an attraction. But the idea that Ginny might date someone else if she breaks up with Harry is certainly not contrived.

5) So you're saying it would be contrived for Harry to be involved in a case during Ginny's 7th year? You mentioned you liked conflict, but I'm having a hard time seeing where this conflict would come from for you if even the idea of Harry working on a case is contrived.

6) Of course it could be arbitrary. All of these are ideas as the whim of the author. It's up to the author to make sure the idea sounds natural. I think that such an idea is natural. Harry starts dating Ginny, but still falls into old habits of only confiding in Ron and Hermione. And thus, Ginny wonders if she will ever be as close to Harry as Ron and Hermione.

7) I personally think, and its backed up in canon, that Ginny would be able to deal with Harry's job, in the same way military wives and husbands often do. But it is not insane to think it might not be something she could deal with. Just the fact that many wives and husbands of military members do get divorced is proof enough that it's a tough role to play. As far as the dangers of the job, Harry couldn't be killed by Voldemort for very specific reasons that had little to do with skill. Those same protections do not exist against other dark wizards.

8) Again, you are right in that Ginny would likely live with Harry, but the question is really whether it is at all possible that she might want some time to live by herself. And of course that is a possibility, for the reason I mentioned.

9) It was a plotline in a northumbrian story, and I really liked it. That's really the only reason I included it. However, it is certainly a plausible plot line. Ginny is known for being fiesty and up for having fun, joking around, etc. I'm sure that she will go out with her teammates to blow off steam after practice and games. She would also be newly independent. She doesn't have Hogwarts or the Burrow to constrain her, if she want to cut loose. Harry seems more reserved; he likes to have fun like anyone but just never seemed to be the partying type. So perhaps he sees Ginny having a bit too much fun in a way he doesn't really like and it causes issues.

it's cool if you don't agree that these angles would be fun to read. But it seems like you are looking at these plots as if I'm saying they would be likely to happen in canon, rather than if they /could/ happen and if it would be interesting if they did.

I don't see how most of these are contrived. If nothing else, they are no different than pitfalls that could befall most young couples. The fact that Harry saved the wizarding world yet still might find challenges living a normal life is interesting in and of itself. Perhaps if I said that Ginny breaks up with Harry because Batman enrolled at Hogwarts, that would be contrived.

I'm curious, do you think any drama in their relationship would be contrived? If so, why? Or if not, what sort of drama would not be contrived?

I like the idea of seeing how these characters who went through extraordinary events adjust to normal life. How do these relationships develop in the context of everything that happened? For example, I think Harry and Ginny being apart the year after the battle (him in auror training, her at school) is a very interesting plot to explore given the context of the previous year when they were also separated.

** linkffn(10099028)

Pretty much ones like that. The only person I missed in that fic was Luna. It is also the only unconventional shipping story I liked. Best part is no Voldemort, and I like stories where he isn't there anymore, or gets killed off early, the setting of magical Britain is interesting enough without dark lords.

Shipping of any kind is optional for me and mostly unimportant, but don't just follow the canon timeline until school starts and suddenly announce random things like Draco/Hermione. Try and write an AU atleast. These things don't just happen like that.

I don't care if the entire fic is a mary sue driven wish fulfillment fantasy, if it is well written and lets go of the rails of canon. I've seen so many writers stick to the most minute details, and it is annoying as hell to see Hedwig die the exact same way, or the chess match in the first book always requiring that Ron sacrifice himself, or Sirius fall into the veil, etc etc. There's other ways to develop your characters.

I think changing the sexual orientation of characters is okay in fandoms where there aren't many prominent gay characters, but not okay in others like Mass Effect.

** I generally avoid any kind of pairing unless it's a romance fic. In fanfiction, pairing generally destroy the fiction when the authors focus so much on romance. And I have read so many good fic being wasted due to improvise some stupid romance (whether it's normal or slash). For example, linkffn(8149841) - this story has an unique plot at the beginning, was fun to read. But as soon as it started to focus on Harry's(and others') love life, the story became meh.

And this happens 99% of the stories when it started to focusing on romance.

  the long-distance relationship
#+end_quote

There is no such thing in the wizarding world. Floo-Powder, Apparition, Portkeys are all more or less instant-travel. The Hogwarts rules may play a part, but still.

I don't really have some favorite genre, but there are a few things that may keep me off reading a fic if another option is available. There are also a few things that will instantly pull me to a fic, and make me keep reading even with some lame points in it.

My list:

- I simply don't like the canon pairings. I dislike Harry/Ginny and I dislike Hermione/Ron. If either of those is present in a very story-driven fic, I could deal with it, but in a character-driven fic I wouldn't keep reading.

- I love it when the story goes outside of Britain. The wizarding world is so underdeveloped that I like it a lot when authors explore it. However, what makes me put away a fic almost instantly is Murica-wank, Weaboo-Japan-worship and similar things.

- I don't like slash. Not because it is same-sex, but because the authors often make such a huge deal about it being same-sex.

- I heavily dislike worldbuilding that isn't labeled "AU" and moves outside of established rules. Especially Magical Cores and magical exhaustion. One of the appeals of HP's magic system is that the resource "magic" is infinite and its use takes no more energy than waving the wand needs. Its limit is only your knowledge.

- It will be an instant favorite from me if I see creative and new magic.

- If I see a rare pairing, I'll probably read too, if just to look at how the author does it. Rare meaning from Harry/Tonks or /Fleur to rarer stuff like Harry/Bellatrix or really unique stuff like Harry/ Amelia Bones or Harry /Bathilda Bagshot (I am currently searching for it in my bookmarks. If I find it, I post it).

- I love well done completely OC fics (looking at you Alexandra). I think they represent whats missing in HP fanfiction. Exploring a new set of circumstances, a new area, a new time, new characters is wonderful.

But at least as far as Hogwarts goes, it would be difficult for them to regularly see each other. Same if Harry is bogged down with Auror training. Maybe the physical distance is not much of an issue, but they still aren't seeing each other very often.

**** Sure, but A) who is going to tell the savior of the wizarding world that he may not visit Hogwarts whenever he pleases? B) Even Auror training has weekends (I guess).

What I'm saying is that I think long-distance or something of that kind isn't a good way of creating tension here.

***** I don't see any reason why the writer can't set rules that wouldn't allow them to see each other. Just like a writer could set it up so Harry, as savior, could come and go when he pleased. Fanfic largely addresses the question of what if. For me, so long as a potential plot is plausible within the world Rowling created, I'm fine with stories that explore that possibility. Regarding the long-distance angle, Rowling never said in canon that Harry, as savior, would have free access to Hogwarts. So it's equally fair to think there would be issues with them seeing each other and there wouldn't be.

******* Regarding physical distance, I guess you're right. I generally look at the phrasing of long-distance in the Harry Potter universe as something that keeps two people from seeing each other somewhat regularly.

** Hmm ... well, my favourite genre is the coming-of-age one; not necessarily as a story about children growing up, but rather about characters learning from their mistakes, maturing emotionally and intellectually, that sort of thing.

That said, I can't really make a list of what makes for a perfect story because with this genre, more than anything, it's important for the characters to be themselves and as such every character's story has to be different. I guess this means that the “perfect” list only has two things on it: “variety”, and “quality”.

That said, there definitely are things that ruin the story for me. Gratuitous romance is one, gratuitous preaching is another, and contrived plot progression is the last one.

** Ok, my list - I'll start with what I like first:

- not Harry/Ginny (I don't believe it, hell not even the movies believed it IMHO!)
- No Hermione/Ron or Hermione/Draco (come on, the former is disaster waiting to happen and the later would probably lead to murder - sooner or later!)
- either Harry/Hermione or Harry/Uncommon-Female!
- lots of interesting new magic
- some quidditch
- maybe a foreign school
- no canon-rehash (OP might like it (I wounder why - canon isn't that great...the world is, but what happens in this world? Nope!), but me? No, if I want to read canon I will go read the books again!)
- Voldemort dies a different way (less "succeeding through luck, chance, stupidity and the sacrifice of others"!)
- either no horcruxes or a better method of removing the one in Harry
- no children, marriage or pregancy (might just be me, but I don't want any of those things in RL (can't get pregnant as a man, but you know what I mean) and I think that Harry is more muggle than wizard, so IMHO he wouldn't have kids straight out of school or even in his twenties (no real reason to...wizards age way slower so why do this?))
- Dursleys in prison (neglecting a child...well, let's just say that in Harry's shoes I'd have the Prophet print my life-story (including Dumbledore leaving him on the doorstep and the neglect or even abuse he suffered!)...I guess a lot of vengeful wizards would be looking for those crappy muggles afterwards!)
- some pointing out the flaws in characters (without necessarily bashing them - on the other hand: What is bashing? Seeing a character punished for crappy behaviour? I don't think so, so having the Dursleys in prison wouldn't be bashing...neither would be taking Dumbledore down a few notches and ruining the man's reputation!)
- No slash
- No soul-bonds (that's like mind-rape and a marriage-contract roled into one...I'd probably kill myself if those things were real and if it happened to me - why? Because I'd hate to be acted upon by outside forces like that...I would cease being myself if something like that happened!)

What does ruin a story for me?

- magical talents (aside from being a metamorphmagus and maybe a parselmouth), I prefer that every wizard can learn everything if they only want to!
- magical cores and power-levels (those for me come down to intelligence, knowledge and thinking on your feet - meaning Dumbledore isn't powerful, he just knows a lot and that makes him hard to beat!)
- slash and mpreg (I don't have a problem with homosexual characters, hell I don't have a problem with Dumbledore getting it on with Grindelwald - I do have a problem with changing a characters sexual orientation just because you'd like to stick him into bed with somebody they'd never even look at that way in canon!)
- teen-pregnancy (that's never a good thing and don't try to tell me other wise!) or any kind of pregnancy (don't like to read about that - I don't even want kids in RL!)
- mediocre Harry etc. (sorry, but I read fanfiction to see the characters (not only Harry) live up to their potential and not stay mediocre and be lead around by the nose (Sorry, Dumbledore, but I don't think you know best - your approach didn't work during the first war, so step aside!))
- whipped characters and women being written as all powerful (and their men are just yes-men who don't think for themselves and allow her to shame them in public etc.)
- weak women (so yeah - I don't like either sex getting short changed!)
- overprotectiveness (don't care if it's brothers, fathers or boyfriends - can't stand it in RL, so I will not read about it either!)
- stupid antagonists (Voldemort isn't only using the cruciatus, no he also rewards his guys for example, otherwise they'd desert him or they would try to kill him - dark wizards aren't dogs you can kick around as long as you give them some table scraps every now and then!)
- etc. etc. etc. (many many things!)
