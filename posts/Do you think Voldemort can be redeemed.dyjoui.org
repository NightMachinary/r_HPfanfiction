before godrics hallow, Voldemort could have been a true believer in his cause someone who cared for in his own weird way his followers and wanted to bring out the best in them magically someone who wanted to push the boundaries of magic, and gather people like him to push knowledge of magic to new heights.

then after godrics hallow, he was diminished with only his power remaining the years ebbed away everything but his most bitter and vile aspects

**** Now, I don't read Tom/* ships. But I think most most of them deal with the teenage version of him, before he turned out the way he did. Before he started murdering people in cold blood, I think he's -- at least in theory -- still redeemable. Of course, it'd require a lot more work than fics probably put in, but still, it can be done at least in theory.

Either that, or the fic is some noncon dark fic, but I stay far away from these, no matter which people are involved.

******* I'm writing a fem!Riddle fic centred on the diary, and yeah, it's hard. Ultimately, I recognise that a total redemption would be impossible, so I'm trying to give her more depth to her actions while not attempting to say that she isn't a bad person. Sure, she has done terrible things, and no matter how much she was pushed in that direction, she's still the one who ultimately chose to do those things, no matter her justifications.

Then again, this will be a darker fic that won't leave Harry with clean hands by the time it finishes, so Riddle having one death on her hands is relatively tame by comparison.

#+end_quote

I've read a few fics which handle that confrontation well by interpreting it differently.

In those cases Riddle Jr. /doesn't/ blame his father for abandoning him/his mother before birth. Instead, at that moment he's focused on the crushing disappointment of both branches of his family not living up to his dreams, and perhaps even worse, both of them writing him off as worthless as soon as they meet him. He's an orphan who's fixated on the idea of proving himself better than the situation he was trapped in by birth, so it's easy to imagine that a moment of callous dismissal by his rich family could have pushed him over the edge. In many cases the fic authors depict the murder of the Riddles as a crime of passion after Tom's father insults him and/or attempts to shoot him in fear after realizing he is like Merope.

Point being, there are believable reasons for Tom to have killed the Riddles that don't require victim-blaming or premeditated murder.

********* I'm drawing inspiration from Limpieza de Sangre and having her kill her father in an act of self-defence after he tried to shoot her. The man had a pathological fear of magic from his bad experience with Merope and didn't react well to her showing up on his doorstep. Riddle doesn't hate her father because he left her mother; she hates him because he refused to accept his daughter for being magical.

That doesn't change the fact that she used the killing curse on his whole family, even if it was done in a fit of rage, and even if there were compounding factors that I've yet to mention in my story

***** This is really the only reason. Neither this sub nor fanfic authors in general know what "abomination before god" means (and I don't mean because of slash, that's mostly fine unless it's pedophilic or tom/anyone), so they ship the guy who put his soul into a book with a boy whose parents he murdered and then tried to murder (while said boy was one year old. Think about it. he's a lil babby and ol' tom just straight up fires the spell).

Like, He's literal snake satan.

Even if you use diary version, that's a cold, psychopathic murderer who has at this point already unleashed a basilisk on a school full of children.

Speaking to a snake is the more likely way to stop the harassment. By age 16, he is known as the heir of Slytherin after all (everyone connects the CoS to his persona), so he would have persuaded people a lot earlier to build that repurtation.

While there is no cure for being a psychopath, i'm pretty sure people like that can become semi-well adjusted and not go into a murderhobo lifestyle, and if they get off of torturing rabbits in their basement... well, it's awful, but better than going on a genocidal rampage and not yet worthy of some capital punishment.

** No, I don't think Voldemort can be redeemed. But then time travel is a thing. AU is a thing. Magic is a thing. What I do think is that this sub needs to lay off on the shaming. Y'all are taking all the magic out of the fandom.

I think this sub has gotten into a very, very bad habit of assigning moral values to fannish preferences. While I'm not a tomarry fan unless it's time travel or very, very au, in which case he's just a handsome, charismatic, amoral OC with a recognisable backstory; the very fact that Dexter and Hannibal exist should show you the way evil is so easily found sexy so very, very often even in the mainstream media.

The actor who played young!Tom is very good looking, and in the kind of fics you're talking about, they tend to make Harry evil anyway. Evil characters are fun. Portraying evi as protagonists or as less evil, or as their evil mattering less because they're pretty, is neither new, nor unique to this fandom. In case you haven't noticed, Bellatrix gets the exact same treatment, and she's exactly as bad as Voldy is. Yet nobody protests pairing Harry with her, post-azkaban murderous psychopathy and all, half as vehemently as they do Harrymort. She's not any less vile than him just because he's the official villain and has been around the block a while longer.

  And if you do time travel, remember! It has to be before he fucks with the orphans minds and kills their pets just for shits, so yeah.
#+end_quote

I don't think it does. Kids don't get charged as adults when they commit crimes because their developing brains don't realize all the implications of what they're doing in most cases. Yeah, young Tom is a disturbed kid, but there's nothing saying he killed that rabbit and fucked with those kids "just for shits".

So, as I understand it, antisocial personality disorder happens due to brain damage. Damage can happen in the womb during brain development, it can result from head trauma, or it can occur from lack of proper development of brain pathways due to abuse and neglect during childhood. But it isn't a done thing to diagnose a child with it until at least 15 years of age, and that's because, with proper intervention, personality can be changed.

Orphanages were pretty fucked up during the 1930's, y'know? So let's say Tom Riddle is fucked up due to that and not a birth defect or head trauma. He was probably neglected, underfed, bullied and maybe abused as a young child, and he acted out and hurt people and animals just like he'd been hurt. If he'd been shown another way and put in a situation where someone loved him and was able to devote time to only him and he wasn't in competition with other children for the basics of survival, he very likely would have been able to develop some empathy.

**** Also there was the war in the muggle world to consider. I mean he was born in what 1930? So he was a child when that whole thing started. Just imagine growing up there. The innate fear in everyone would have been very high, food supplies low and more children being orphaned every day. People lash out in those sorts of environment, especially if they had been picked on from a young age for being "strange". Sure Harry turned out different, but everyone acts different even in similar circumstances. Also I can totally imagine an orphanage being into the religious stuff in that time and trying to exorcise him for any accidental magic he might have shown.

And then he discovers the magical world and is then told he cannot stay there (where it is save) during summer, but has to go back to the orphange, during a time where bombs fell on London (which started in 1940). That would have to be horrible! I imagine that is also where his fear of death comes from.

**** Many people /today/ come out of orphanages just fine. I doubt you've met any people who were orphans in the UK from the 1930's, when people believed things like losing both your parents was a divine punishment, people could be "born evil" some kids were "born to be hanged", etc. In that time a lot of orphans just did run the streets and become thieves, kids at orphanages actually died of starvation, priests at the ones run by the church basically had their own little sex slaves, etc. They were absolute hellholes.

Also some people might lose their parents later in life. If you wound up in an orphanage at age 9 after being raised by loving parents before that, your brain pathways are already developed very differently than Tom Riddle's, who has been there since birth.

His upbringing absolutely does not justify what he eventually became. But I think he could have been redeemed at any point before he actually killed a person.

** So, I am going to ask you the obvious question here: What is redemption?

I am asking because honestly I don't think you get that redemption is entirely subjective. This means redemption is something everyone has a different opinion on 'what it means to be redeemed' and 'what is enough to be redeemed.' And thats not even getting into the fact that their is a big difference between if you yourself think you have been redeemed and what everyone else thinks. Redemption is a choice at the individual level, unlike by society which sets rules and requirements that serve as judicial or legal redemption. So you also ask the question of whether you are referring to whether X person thinks he is redeemed and whether he has/can be redeemed through societal definitions.

So that needs to be asked before you try and parse out morality I suppose. Perhaps a better question would be what would it take for Harry to think Voldemort was redeemed, as that seems to be what you are really on about here.

Which is stupid, if Voldemort wants to redeem himself and be a better person than he should, but on a level others will not.

I dont think Harry hates Voldemort, he only fights Vildemort for his safety not over the fact that his parents were murdered. To me this implies that Harry doesn't hold any attachment to Hames and Liky as he was young when it happened so he doesn't go looking for revenge but after he kills Cedric Harry has to fight.

** I enjoy Tom/Harry fics, but I actually dislike it when the fics try and redeem him. Any redemption of Tom feels sloppy, lazy, or half-hearted, because Voldemort is a fucked up monster. Frankly, the sheer fucked-up-ness of the situation is the real appeal of Tom/Harry fics. Attempting to half-heartedly redeem Voldemort ruins that.

** As a kid sure. Any point after he kills Myrtle is too late I think. I read a couple of fics about it, with Luna doing the redeeming both times funnily enough. One was a one shot where Luna from a bad future goes back in time and raises little Tom proper, and another where Luna gets her hands on the diary.

Can't say I get the shipping aspect of it, but shipping is an irrational beast; expecting it to make sense is asking too much.

I hate that trope. This is the magical equivalent of "go back to kill baby Hitler", and for some reason killing Hitler as a child is commonly accepted as "has to be done to save millions" because "the danger is too great", but "kill magical Hitler as a baby" is out of the question for some reason. And before anyone points out the resulting lack of conflict, there is still that dark wizard called Grindelwald who comes very close to conquering Europe (and has implied ties to the Nazis). He is more than enough challenge after you dispose of baby Voldemort.

** One thing to recognise is that redeeming Voldemort requires he be punished. Perhaps even killed for his crimes. But that's fine, because we already have plot mechanisms in place for this.

Horcruxes can only be reabsorbed into the body, and the souls restored, if the person feels genuine guilt for the murder that split it. There is a story to be written about a Voldemort who, for whatever reason, feels guilt and regret. Perhaps a greater evil could exist which he has to destroy, which ends up giving him perspective. Eventually, when his souls is restored and this greater threat destroyed, he could face his greatest fear, death, execution for his crimes willingly. Because what is guilt without acceptance of the consequences?

That in my mind is the way Voldemort can be redeemed partially. It would be so interesting to see this Voldemort interact with those he has wronged, and face justice willingly. How would Harry react if Voldemort was actually sorry? How would Hermione and Ron?

** I do think that redemption is possible for Tom for several reasons :

1. I don't think that Tom was a psychopath in the beginning, it is the abuse at the orphanage and slytherin house purebloods that started his psychopathology and the horcruxes destroyed definitely the rest of his psychological stability.
2. Emotions are relative not to magic, nor mind but to the soul in first instance. The trauma of splinting seven times his soul have made him unable to feel any emotion that need to be expressed all the deepness of a whole soul (Any form of Love : Philia, Storge, Eros and Agape, any positive emotion like Remorse)
3. To repair his soul , he must a at soul level feel remorse , impossible on his own. Harry and him are bound at a soul level so he could help.

- In Time travel, Prefect Tom and Harry could balance each other, Tom could be saved by being balanced against a soul with more Love to give but that could only happen with a time loop because the past has to happen.

** Benefits of Old Laws was a half decent redemption fic that I think has finished since I last read it. The basic premise is that destroying the diary returned a big chunk of Tom's soul, which he started to feel after Harry escaped the graveyard. I liked it, but I didn't feel like he could ever reach complete redemption within the span of a year or two that the story sold. Still a decent story.

** I do not care for slash, but am happy to weigh in on the exercise.

Part of Voldemort's canonical villainy was that he was incapable of love due to being conceived under the influence of a love potion ( he can't be the only one so I don't know if I buy that but the poor treatment from birth at an orphanage didn't help.

Harry's blood protection was based on the magic of love, however. Voldemort recreated himself with it making it a fundamental part of his existence.

If you want to go the 'love redeems all' route have his conscience kick in after the rebirth and make him seek atonement for his now realized crimes.

** The problem about Voldemort he has crossed the line long ago that he's far from able to redeemed himself, that it would take a lifetime to compensate his sins.

And even then, there will always be people who see what he was in the past than what he gave become or wish to become, a man who wish to atone his wrong doing, a man who have regrets.

Worse, he's not that great of character writting, he's pure black character, evil for the sake of evil but not that bad compare to other series character, not gray or between. Compare to better writting character like Lucius and Draco Malfroy, Petter Pettigrew, Severus Snape before he become double agent. Or great evil character from outside HP, such as Lord Shu and Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda movie series, one man who have been spoiled to the core and end up walking on the wrong path out of rage, hatred and disappointment, other, Lord Shu who more of great example of a great character writting of pure evil, deadly, powerful character, despite being written as a Peacock and not a more badass and deadly animal like a Tiger. And yet he's more terrifying and dangerous than Tai Lung can ever become because of his intelligent of making deadly weapon from gunpowder, which is more powerful than Kung Fu until The Dragon Warrior walk in Inner Peace mode.

If I was an ff author who write about Voldemort being redeemed, I would just make him hide and run away from the wizarding world where anyone know about his wrong doing or just experience the horror first hand, and quitely without attracting unwanted attention, atone his sins somehow in someway. And somehow the MC or someone meet Tom Riddle before and after realizing he is Lord Voldemort or used to be. You get where this heading.

** /Ahem/

First of all, you seem to have a tiny fact wrong.

It is widely accepted that Tom was bullied in the orphanage, so he struck back the only way he knew - hard.

The environment of orphanages at that time also helps children develop cruelty.

I would redeem him quite easily - he's insane.

Insane people tend to not go to prison for their crimes for a reason.

So all I have to do is restore his sanity (and soul) and he becomes that much more decent.

I don't downvote pairings that the others like, because those pairings are fine, long as it isn't zoophilia or something, and even then, only if the person is serious about liking animals that way.

Back to the topic - he may change while in Limbo, of course, and then go and redo it or be ressurected.

Almost every murderer has some kind of psychological damage, otherwise, they wouldn't kill. We still lock them up or outright shoot to kill when we see them (to stop them from carrying out their attack).

** I can't think of a punishment that is cruel enough for him. I suppose death since he was so terrified of it, but people in general aren't fond of it so there should be something more satisfying. I guess I'm as evil as he is, but it's a pity no one spotted thos tendencies of his before it was too late. I mean,'I can hurt people if they annoy me' terrifies me every time I read it, and I remember thinking there had to be some reason he became so evil. But that was before I read that chapter where he talks about how he can use his powers to punish everyone. I suppose not all psychopaths take over the government, but I can't bring myself to feel sorry for him even when he was 11. Those fanfics where he gets with someone from the good guys are a bit unsettling and I'm curious how people manage to write a convincing paring in this case, but I just can't force myself to read them. Even though I remember reading one where Luna finds that diary and writes in it. I haven't finished it, but I'm guessing they ended up together. But the first few chapters were so funny. Maybe humour is the only way to write a paring with him because it seems so scary that the only thing you can do is laugh.
