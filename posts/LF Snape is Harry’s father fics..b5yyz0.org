  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions)

Harry is manipulated by Voldemort into going back in time and changing something pivotal to the story (more on that once you read the story)

It turns out that in this alternate timeline, Harry's stepdad is Snape. (Lily and Snape)

** Resonance would be the sub favorite I'm guessing \linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]). AU after book 5, three sequels, loved this. Harry gets OP powers but really takes the time to develop them so they don't feel OP and Snape is an amazing character in here. Takes a while to really get good but when it does it's amazing; some of my favorite OCs.

If you're looking for a shorter one, Blood Magic was okay ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911]]). Read it a while ago so don't remember as many details but some of the scenes were really nice without being too out of character.

In Prince of the Dark Kingdom \linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) Snape fulfills a father ish role without breaking character. Serious AU if Voldy had won the first war, and is Harry's mentor without Harry being Dark!Harry. One of the best fanfics I have ever read.

Also, not quite what you asked for but might be what you want: in the Callista Snape series he has a daughter and is still v Snape-y, but a bit less douchey eventually. Series swaps btw their perspectives. \linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4294544/1/Always-In-Your-Shadow-Calista-Snape-Volume-I]]).

Not sure if you were looking for more obscure ones; feel like these get mentioned a lot around here, but rightfully since they're amazing.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.
