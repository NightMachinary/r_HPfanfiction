** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force by DarkKing666). Cross with Ah! My Goddess. The Norns and Keichi move to England and adopt Harry to put the prophecy back on track. Pre-Hogwarts. Has an unfinished sequel.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Gaining of Faith by chadmaako). Faith runs away from Sunnydale, comes across Harry and Dudley just as the dementors attack.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Key of Dagon by Don Sample). First in a series.

linkffn(It's All In The Blood by Sam-453). Buffy is Harry's older sister, given up for adoption because James and Lily were too young.

linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg). Xander is pulled to Hogwarts.

linkffn(White Knights and Dark Lords by Sherza). The Council sends Xander and Spike to help Harry.

linkffn(Reinforced Magic by Lupine Horror). Reinforce tried to commit suicide, ends up w/Harry. Has sequels, which I didn't like as well.

linkffn(Eyes Like Mine by Scotty77). A little short (about 66,500 words). Naruto goes dimension-traveling, runs across young Harry.

linkffn(What's in a name? by muishiki). Might violate your "no slash," depending on how strict it is. While hunting vampires, Harry meets a beautiful and very capable woman (who was originally male, but ran afoul of a curse).

linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream). Also a bit short (about 63,000 words), but quite good, if unfinished. Harry disappeared. Years later, Sherlock is brought in when the Dursleys are murdered on his birthday.

linkffn(Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard by Charlotte Anne Kent). Sherlock investigates the locked-room murder of Amelia Bones.

linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon by Kenya Starflight). Again, just a little short (about 76000 words). Dumbledore hires Darth Vader as DADA instructor.

linkffn(The Boy Who Fell, A HP Starwars Crossover by Darth Marrs). Harry died at age 5. Luna wishes for someone who can make things better, and Ben Skywalker crashes nearby.

linkffn(Crumpets Aren't My Style by Marz1). While visiting England, O'Neill runs across Death Eaters using alien technology.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Mask of Loki by Marcus S. Lazarus). Harry finds the Mask of Loki, goes hunting horcruxes on his own.

  She is a slayer. Born to fight the demons, vampires and the forces of darkness. Now, because of bad luck and bad mistakes, she's running. He is The Boy Who Lived. Destined to destroy the Dark Lord. Now, because of a loveless home and a manipulative old wizard, he's more alone and frustrated than ever. Together, these two lost souls discover that they are far more powerful than they ever were apart. Brute strength meets magical finesse in a story of young love and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't. It's Faith Lehane and Harry Potter, people. They don't do mushy. A slayer being dropped head first into Wizarding Britain? Shit's about to get real up in here and nothing and no one is going to be the same. Gloves are off and with Faith's help, Harry ain't buyin' what the dark lord is selling.
