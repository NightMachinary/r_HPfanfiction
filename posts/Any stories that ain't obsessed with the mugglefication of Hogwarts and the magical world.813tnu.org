apart from the Internet which only took off in the last 30 years the magical world is mostly superior to the muggle world so what is it with authors trying to replace parts of the magical world with shitty muggle version?

So any stories were when the wizarding world upgrades something they don't just take the muggle way of doing things which is just as flawed and instead use magic they have available to create a new way of doing thing that is designed for a magical world ?

Hogwarts may have it flaws but trying to turn it into a muggle school is not going to make it better, after all the muggle school system was created to make factory works that would do as they are told.

I am perfectly fine with the wizarding world takeing ideas from the muggle world of which they have no equivalent like the Internet.

But why would they want tv when they could use something like the day dream charms that the weasly twins were selling at there shop to instead of watching a character have an adventure instead have a day dream of there own adventure were it's like they are actually there.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** In direct combat, magic sucks. Yes, apparation and the imperious curse exist, but if you take these factors out, like in the Battle of Hogwarts, it quickly turns into a turkey shoot if the defenders have muggle weapons (and knew how to use them). An uphill frontal assault against a fortified position bristling with machine guns, mortars, AT rockets and anti-material/tank rifles would have been a very short affair (and magic does not stop these from working since there's no electricity involved). And I'm not even taking artillery, chemical weapons or airstikes into account here.

And it's not just weapons and the internet. Television, game consoles, trains (the Hogwarts express is slow as hell), refrigerators, advanced medical DIAGNOSTIC devices like MRTs or ultrasound, there are plenty of areas where magic is behind. Just as there are plenty of areas where Muggles are behind. Sadly authors either go for total Muggle wank or make magic the solution for everything instead of trying to find a balance between both.

Edit: How do you come to the conclusion that I am defending muggle wank? I am saying that OP is not accurate when he says that magic is better in everything besides the internet. Magic has far superior travel methods and magical healing is at least decades ahead of mundane. And stop making this about wizards vs the military. I am talking about WIZARDS using guns to kill other WIZARDS (Death Eaters).

Edit2: You know what? I am done with this thread since everyone insists that I am talking about Muggles vs Wizards. I was talking about WIZARDS using guns to kill other WIZARDS because it is far easier to learn how to shoot with adequate accuracy than it would be for the average witch or wizard to learn combat magic to the point where they can match an Death Eater.

The ability to protect oneself from a gun does not change depending on who is using it. "Shield charms would stop bullets" is just as valid if wizards are shooting the bullets.

*** So here you are defending muggle wank and I'll bite.

I'll start with the obvious, magical healthcare is the best. Period. They can regrow entire bones, that is something that science is barely even considering possible and wizards have had it long enough a school nurse can apply it.

I'll hit magical warfare now since you spent so much time on it. Sure muggles have guns and tanks and planes, but there's more to combat than raw numbers as many generals have proved over millennia. A weapon is only as useful as the person using it, what is there stopping a disillusioned/invisible wizard from imperiousing a machine gunner or just unleashing feindfyre on the entrenched position. Sure, wizards don't fight the same way as muggles but the Russians don't fight the same way as the German or French and we all know what that did to Napoleon.

TV is a technology not seen in the magical world but they have moving pictures, painting that retain the personalities of the dead and a functioning radio, one is more impressive than the other.

On a finishing note, I don't read Harry Potter to hear about his big gun and how he shot all his problems away. There are certain things that must be assumed for a fantasy story to work and poking holes in it may be easy but really doesn't contribute to many peoples enjoyment.

Also apologies in advance for the formatting, this was done on mobile.

*** I have this little neat theory. Let's start with my favourite quote from Pottermore - "I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature." (Pottermore: Illness and Disability).

Okay, so we have magical reality overwrite physical one. And we have that neat thing called Shield charm. Spells can break through it, as magic's ability to change magic is limited. But it also protects from physical damage, and we can assume that the Shield charm is not limited here as it is "mundane" kind of damage.

The Shield charm can be adjusted in terms of size, the Shield charm can be used to protectively enchant place, the Shield charm can be enchanted on clothes (as of HBP).

Assuming, my theory is true, wizards could just wear Shield hats and tank everything muggles throw at them or drink their tea in Shield charm protected houses as bombs fall around.

Do you have any idea how much energy there is involved? If Dumbledore couldn't slow Harry's fall enough to stop him from passing out in PoA, and Harry's kinetic energy was below 100 KJ, how do you expect magic to shield you from explosives where a single gram of it has 4 KJ (and we are talking about at least 500 kg of explosives, meaing at least 2000 KJ on top of any kinetic energy of the projectile, which on its own can surpass 50000 KJ).

Energy doesn't matter - physics doesn't matter in a world where 11 year olds learn how to make a mockery of it in their first year of schooling.

So all of these weapons - /all of them/, from the puny .22 LR rifle, to the nuke, can hit once, they may hit twice, but they won't hit a third time.

Introducing muggle weaponry as a suprise is probably worth it. Make it big enough, make it count and you got yourself a good hit on the enemy. But almost as an immediate reaction wizards and witches will adapt and introduce magical ways of dealing with the threat.

***** Then there's still disillusionment charms, portkeys, etc. There are so many possibilities.

You're also assuming that the wizards would allow the muggles time to gather their armies. Wizards can travel way faster and would already be at their enemy's doorstep before they have time to roll up their tanks.

They can use the fidelius charm and make the location of wizards unplottable so the muggles can't the place they're supposed to shoot at.

The wizards can use muggle repelling charms, so whever a muggle with a gun comes close, they turn away and leave. You really haven't thought this through.

The fact that you have to limit the kinds of spells wizards can use to make the muggles and wizards in your scenario even remotely equal is telling enough.

Also, as Rowling said:

When a magical fire suppression system doesn't catch those, it won't work on bullets either.

And basically burning is just a reaction with Oxygen, and should you magically suppress that, it would most likely kill everything in its area of effect since oxidisation on a micro level is essential to life.
