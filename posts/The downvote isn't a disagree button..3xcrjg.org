This sub is getting ridiculous. The way people are using the downvote is to disagree with people, which leads to their comment being censored.

#+begin_quote
  From redditiquette under /Please Don't/, " In regard to voting.
#+end_quote

Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your own reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons."

The downvote is a tool to hide comments which don't contribute to the discussion or are low effort click bait or other such comments.

There is a post which is currently on 0 points with a 40% upvote rating. Is it low effort? No. Is it contributing to the discussion? Yes.

The post is a request from a user which is tagged correctly and contains nothing against Reddit ToS but it is being downvoted because people don't like what the OP wants.

If you don't like someone's opinion, don't do anything, or leave a comment. Don't try to bury their post by downvoting.

As your parents probably told you when you were younger, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."

*Edit. Currently at 69% upvoted. Thanks for being mature adults and leaving a downvote!

Welcome to reddit. It's the same in every sub.

My two cents as a mod: trying to police downvotes is pointless. Up/downvotes are de facto like/dislike buttons, regardless of what reddiquette says, because that's how the majority of people actually use them. There's no accountability so you can't penalize it, and anything you do to make downvoting harder is easily circumvented.

*** I'm reminded of those pictures of well paved paths with nice clean corners... and the little bit of dirt path that cuts through, making a triangle as people save themselves a few feet of walking.

But yeah, I agree. Reddiquette can say whatever it wants, but it's the users ultimately that determine what those up and downvotes mean. It's NOT a failing of reddit or the mods... it just sort of IS, the same way that 2+2=4 just sort of IS.

Anyway, thank you to the mods for their work, even if its not always possible to curtail every unfortunate oddity we users get up to.

I'm sure you're right, but have you ever noticed brigades from other HP communities? (e.g. /HPMoR fans coming en masse to defend Ebenezer Yanakovitz or whatever his name is or /harrypotter fans coming to downvote anything that isn't a canon pairing)

** Hmm.

Recommend that this be tagged 'Meta', but Discussion works, too.

I upvoted this because it bears saying and is worth discussing, but at the same time I'm not sure I entirely agree, even though at first my sense of decorum replied 'Of course'.

Whether a system is being used as designed isn't always a demonstration of whether it is being used effectively/*. If all we saw was positive activity for relevant discussions, it'd be difficult to distinguish a popular topic from a controversial one.

As a participant, my ability to upvote and downvote is the system's function for expressing my positive or negative reaction to a post. If the person isn't contributing to the discussion I'd Report the post, and I usually adjust the filter to see more of the negative posts just so I can follow interesting lines of discussion. This works against me in larger subreddits where there are literally thousands of garbage replies per popular post, but that's why I like hanging around in this more cozy community.

/* I used to get annoyed at people on fanfiction.net for Following a completed story- "It's complete dodo-head". Then I realized that sometimes a person wants to keep track of stories that they liked but didn't want to /advertise/ as being liked, and since then I've been looking at how many ways people find to 'misuse' system designs to their advantage. It's the basis of many off-label medical techniques that become life-saving procedures.

Thats not what my parents told me. All I ever heard was " If you don't have anything nice to say, be sure its true before you say it."

But anyway, you're right, of course. But this is reddit. This is the internet. Whatever system you install will eventually be misused and corrupted. Sure, people shouldn't use the downvote button as a opinion-underliner, but people who are petty enough to get heated up about some pairing (or whatever), sure won't hesitate a second to use this questionable power.

** No, the downvote button is to hide comments from anyone who enjoys or recommends fics you don't like. At least, that's what any new subscriber would learn from the example we set.

On a more serious note, that really is a problem. I've noticed several threads where unpopular fics that fit what the OP asked for perfectly get highly downvoted, while off-topic fics that aren't what the OP asked for at all get upvoted because people here approve of them. In my mind, we should be downvoting recs that don't fit what the original poster asked for, regardless of quality or our personal opinion about the fic itself.

Thanks for leaving the passive aggressiveness at home. Oh, and let me remind you of the reddiquette document:

#+begin_quote
  *(Please don't...)* *Complain about votes you do or do not receive.*
#+end_quote

Which is non-binding, just a set of guidelines and suchlike, just like my downvote of this thread (which was because I think this tired topic adds nothing to the sub).

About the only useful thing the upvote/downvote button /does/ do here is serve as a gentle reminder to posters to try to not be annoying: Authors should not recommend their own stories (even if they happen to match an OP's request). OTP shipper zealots should keep it mellow (I know you luuurve Harry/Draco or Hermione/Snape, but not everyone shares those views). DLP haters should live and let live. Same with DLP zealots. And the Author Who Shall Not Be Named (or MoR) should not be invoked in every blessed thread--anyone who was going to read that story already has; anyone else has already worked through their issues.

Upvoting/downvoting helps gently police community norms and lets the rest of us talk about fanfiction without all the insipid drama. (Which you decided to shine a light on, bless your soul.)

** I completely agree with the OP. It is very disheartening to see topics downvoted because they contain things that are not popular with this particular population of the Harry Potter Fandom - even though it's a perfectly acceptable post. Examples include slash and cross generational pairings that do not involve Harry, but if it does include Harry, then it's okay - as long as it's not a slash pairing (Harry/Lily or Harry/Narcissa gets upvotes, Harry/Snape, Hermione/Snape - downvotes).

I think the downvoting as disagreeing hurts the community to a certain extent because it makes this subreddit an unwelcome place if you don't have the same tastes as the majority. The beauty about the Harry Potter fandom is that it is so large, the world is so robust that there is literally something for everyone here and personally I think that there's room here for everyone's interests.

** I've seen this used most egregiously when it comes to discussions about characters, not fics. If two people have a difference over opinion regarding a character trait, the downvotes positively rain down. It's quite distressing to see disagreements handled this way.

** Thanks for this post! As a new reddit user (who incidentally started due to this subreddit), it's good to know what the "ideal" is. I'd argue that the best way to get someone to avoid a reading a recommendation is to reply to the rec with useful feedback (poorly written, mary-sue, super angst, etc). I tend to give recs with replies more weight (both positive and negative) when there's more than one user talking about it. When the [LF] post interests me I read all of the replies anyway, even the down voted ones.
