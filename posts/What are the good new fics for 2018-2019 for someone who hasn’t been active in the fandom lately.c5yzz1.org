  How far would Ron and Hermione go to save their best friend? Where would their choices lead them - to doom or salvation? This is a look at what those two of the Golden Gryffindor Trio can and will do in a world darker than canon: their choices, their journey and the result.

**** Bit late, and not sure about the fandoms you like, but here are the HP Sci-fi crossovers I would recc:

Linkffn(10784770) by far the best Mass Effect crossover out there imo.

Linkffn(8551180) Part 1 of a trilogy. Not a crossover itself, but it sets the scene for part two which goes into Stargate and part three which goes into Mass Effect.

Linkffn(11157943) Star Wars crossover, sadly seems to be abandoned.

Linkffn(4753440) Actually the same situation as above, not a crossover itself, but part two goes into Star Trek:NG while part 3 goes into Star Wars.

Linkffn(11577249) Star Wars crossover, also one of my all time favorites. Its great.

Thought about adding Browncoat Green Eyes to this, but you surely know about that masterpiece.

As for my favorite non sci-fi crossover:

Linkffn(9586702) is always great, but it is fuckin long at 1m words, and has a sequel in progress.

Probably forgot about a ton of others. Will add when I think of them.

** I think linkao3(A Game of Chess by Kirinin) might be my favorite time travel story.

Follows the standard "time travel back from an apocalyptic, war-torn future", but there's no faffing around or stations of canon involved, the entire issue of Voldemort is wrapped up in a single year. The protagnist is a competent Ron, which I'm always a fan of and is far too rare, I think. It also focuses each chapter on a particular fanon cliche and either deconstructs it or inverts it, which tickled my fancy after having read so much fanfiction. Lastly, it has, in my opinion, the only realistic ending for a Peggy Sue time-traveler. Highly, highly recommended.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), features a BAMF Petunia Evans who is yet very recognizable as her canon self. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur are the stars of this fic. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), focuses on the Trio and involves some nice world building.

There are several Voldemort centric fics that were published in 2018 and are in progress:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210): A genre savvy SI replaced Voldemort. He's still a totally evil SOB, but he is at least rational and has humor. There are several really nice battles in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]], linkffn(13275002): Diary Riddle got a body without killing Ginny. He decides to fight his older self, and has gone through some harrowing adventures already.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/Departure-from-the-Diary][Departure from the Diary]], linkffn(13299443): Fem!Diary Riddle identifies the scar in Harry and manages to share a body with him. Their interactions are quite fun to read.

*** Impostor Complex is a fun read, but just know going in that the MC sounds nothing like what you'd expect of a sociopathic young man born in the 1930's, desperate for power and recognition.

Treat it more as an OC and it's a great read.

**** I have to agree with this. The version of Tom in that fic is a standard snarky antihero who dives into danger without thinking. It's a personality type common to many male power fantasy fics (A Black Commedy, Wastelands of Time, Wind Shear, etc.)

But as long as you aren't looking for canon compliance, period appropriate dialogue, or britpicking, it's a fun and fast-paced action filled romp.

I'll take your criticism to heart when I start to write the next chapter, though.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** linkffn(Novocaine) is a pretty good one that comes to mind if you enjoy the Uber Political story, and a version of Haphne that comes across as believable without having some random moment of OOCness to break up Harry and Ginny. In short I'd say it's definitely one of the better fics I've read recently, and it only came out in late 2018 so it fits your timeline.

Although it has been a few months since we've got an update, so I hope it doesn't get abandoned.

** LD50 by We Built The Shadows Here on AO3 linkao3(17357999) is only 5 chapters in, but it is an incredibly character study of key players during a tense point of the Wizarding War - Snape, Lily, Peter Pettigrew so far. It's the best fic I've ever read for evoking the grubby fear of working undercover. If you want a new fic to follow, I heartily recommend it. Even if it got abandoned right now, it would be worth reading.

  In scientific parlance, an LD50 is an amount of a substance that constitutes a lethal dose for fifty percent of the tested population. Everything from poisons to common medications in your cabinet right now has an LD50. It's 1981, and the walls are closing in. There is a spy in the Order. Lily, James, and infant Harry Potter are in hiding but not safe under Fidelius yet. Severus Snape is not a trusted enough Death Eater to pass on crucial information, and Dumbledore still doubts Snape's loyalty. Peter Pettigrew is chewing at the walls where no one can see. And poison persists in the blood.

** "The Divide" linkffn(13022404) is a really good OC-centric next-gen that's come out in 2018. In it, there are a pair of identical twins, one magical, one not, and the story explores their struggle with this as well as their fight to turn the non-magical one magical. What I especially like is the story is playing with some lesser explored elements in the book, like flying carpets, as well as bringing in some new ones, like djinn.

The OCs also don't stay at Hogwarts either for the whole story, which is cool. Currently, they're in the middle east, which isn't some place I've seen another story really explore.

** It's not precisely new, as it started back in 2013 or so, but the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series (or as I like to think of it, "I, Wizard") has continued to steadily churn out great stuff. The latest book, which started in 2018, is Intensity.

The series starts when Harry is 9 and has reached his fourth year at Hogwarts, with over a million words already. The starting point is that Sirius escaped from Azkaban earlier via accidental magic, with no leads on Peter, and so instead of going on an immediate vendetta, he instead went to check on Harry. And since Harry was unhappy with the Dursleys, Sirius took custody of him - while still being in hiding from the law.

There's epic amounts of worldbuilding, especially fleshing out many characters from the Marauders' generation, and lots of alternative points of view, especially Sirius.

** Stepping Back, linkffn(12317784), the best time travel fanfic I've read in a very long time. Has Harry/Bellatrix pairing which is pretty nicely done in my opinion.

His Angel, linkffn(8135514), The best Harry/Fleur story in existence. Sadly it's discontinued but it has almost 400k words of pure fluff if you like the pairing.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent, linkffn(13133746), one of the few Harry/Daphne fics I've read but probably my favourite. No political shenanigans, a pretty good story overall.

Harry Potter and The Dark Soul, linkffn(13277523), a bit of self promotion for those interested. I by no means claim that it is a good story, on the contrary, English is not my native language so the writing probably sucks. But I do believe it is something creative. I have fused the Harry Potter universe and Dark Souls universe in one! For those who are not familiar with the latter, everything will be explained as the story progresses. Harry/Fleur pairing. Updates should be fairly regular once my exams are over.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

  Heavy AU, starting from Harry's fourth year. Harry has to face both new and old dangers and when a stranger offers to help, he gladly accepts. His view on magic will be changed forever. New friends will be made while matters of the heart will complicate things along the way. Times of war are coming and maybe, just maybe, Harry will survive to see the end of it all.
