I'm trying to find a story I read a while ago, it's about Harry finding out he is an Heir and that there isn't a lot that goes into it. Dumbledore never told him I think Gringotts or Sirius did. Dumbledore told him like at the end of the summer where he then went to the Weasleys and Hermione was there and everyone was suprised that he was only just finding out because it takes a while to learn more than a few weeks in the summer ( they don't know he has been studying for longer, most the summer I think). He also sends George and Fred to Diagon Alley to buy all books related to being an heir because they as well as Ginny figured out that he knew by how he was acting. So he spends the rest of the summer studying new things as well as pretending he's studying things he already knows. Hermione is also upset that she can't read the books or they don't apply to her I can't recall

That's all I can remember about it, please help me find the story and any similar would be appreciated


** Found it, it's called Becoming Lord Potter-Black
