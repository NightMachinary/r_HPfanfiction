I remember Harry runs from the Dursleys. Its after 1st year I think. He lives in a building with vampires. He makes potions for st mungoes. He might be pomfreys apprentice or snapes or something. I remember snape having quite an interest in him. They dont know he is harry, he is disguised, probably metamorphagus abilities but i am unsure. He might be something like a natural healer? And i am pretty sure its a work in progress at the moment, or it was when i last saw it. I simply cant find it in my bookmarks :( ideas? Heeeeelp :'(


** Fuck, I know the exact fic you're talking about. I'm pretty sure it's {The Leader} by Dbestheslytherinsnapefan but I'm not sure.
