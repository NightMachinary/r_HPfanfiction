** Check the wiki --- it's a good place to start. Otherwise, search for your fic interests and see what other people recommend! There's so much out here it's hard to quantity what makes a story ”the best”.

** [[/u/vir_innominatus]] is kind enough to run a script that ranks the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=00][top 100 most recommended fics on this sub from 2011 to November 2017]]

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlWrlHvaHc9jVkI5kkcWuIZ3hEmwY_08fNdcUPHyeY0/edit#gid=2086651006][This file]] also has top 10 by individual years.

--------------

Some on that list that have been published or finished in recent 2 years are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a great dark!Harry fic, in which he and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot after Voldemort's fall. The Trio lived and slept together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is an extreme AU in which a more cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore, however, would finally have his revenge after almost 20 years. Best Ron/Hermione romance I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw]], linkffn(11574569), contains almost every trope you can think of: WBWL, evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore, IceQueen!Daphne, Pureblood Culture, Lords and Ladies, and etc..., but it's so well written that many people like it every much.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146][The Accidental Animagus]] and its sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(9863146;12088294), have Harry raised by the Grangers. Both good and bad guys got competence boosts. The first four years more or less followed canon stations, while things become completely different in the sequel. The dark lady La Pantera is a great original character.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non-magic scifi AU. If you can get past that, you will find it an excellent story.

--------------

There are a few more great fics that failed to make that list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): A manipulative!Harry expertly used Daphne for advancing his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): humorous dark!Hermione story with a fresh take on occultism. Its companion piece [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12644815/1/Hermione-Granger-Dermatologist][Hermione Granger, Dermatologist]], linkffn(12644815), is a fun one shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): If you like Muggle involvements, you will love this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425): What would happen if Harry's hair was red instead of black? Hilarity and chaos ensued.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408): Best canon compliant Year 7 Hogwarts fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously, and the entire plot began to unravel. It's refreshing to see adults taking charge for once.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. In its second year, recently returned to weekly updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12417372][Old Blood]] - Harry Potter mixed with Arthurian legends. Pretty interesting so far, especially in terms of Harry's relationship with (female) Quirrel. Unfortunately after the initial quick burst of updates came silence.

**** Darklordpotter.net. Several regulars here on this sub (myself included) haunt the site, some (myself again included) for more than a decade. Several others find it a target for vitriol, their experiences being less than positive. The site appears to be at least as polarizing as HPMOR in the fandom. On DLP, there's a general dislike of lazy writing, slash (with a few, well written exceptions), or some of the trendy pairings in the fandom (Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, etc.) and the general trend is for edgier, darker fiction than the norm on ffn.

DLP tends to polarize the fandom, particularly amateur writers who think more of their skills than is perhaps warranted given their skill levels. The site is known for blunt criticism; authors looking for smoke enemas or who haven't a thick skin tend to come by, strut around a bit, have a melt down, then go elsewhere and natter on indefinitely on sites like this sub about their unfair treatment. The site boasts several reasonably well known authors who are regulars: nonjon, jbern, joe6991, shezza, the santi, Taure, R-dude, Scott Press, Serious Scribble, Steelbadger, newcomb, Cheddartrek, Big D on a Diet, enembee, Silens Cursor, nuhuh, and Heather Sinclair, to name a few.

It's a fairly educated crowd: there are at least a half-dozen Ph.D.s in a variety of disciplines, from chemistry to theoretical physics to religion, a dozen or so M.D.s and practicing attorneys, and generally a higher brow level of discussion than the "4chan for HP fanfiction" impression one might get from reading the posts here.

Those who do stick around generally find that people there do try to help out when they can. I can confirm that their Work by Author (WbA) section is an excellent resource for feedback and advice and, while not sugarcoated, gives largely impersonal feedback to writers. (Site rules do not permit ad hominem attacks in the WbA threads.)

I suggest you consider the possibility that you're just a really annoying person and attempt to address that.

***** You can't know if every downvote is from a redditor who's also a DLP member. Deleting is exclusive to the poster or mods, isn't it? I actually don't know. I engaged you because I check the sub frequently, but not every DLP member does, or is even on Reddit at all. Pointing out Narf and Taure is just pointing out best known DLPrs who are on Reddit. I would argue that 10 downvotes is huge, and there's nothing wrong with DLPrs downvoting you for attacking DLP collectively, or non-DLP Redditors downvoting you if they simply disagree with what you said.

I downvoted you because you came not to offer anything, but to bitch about another site and hijack the thread for your hobby horse. If this sort of thing is what you pulled on DLP, it would be unsurprising that you didn't find a warm welcome there.

Perhaps you might share whose sock puppet account you are and then we might all be able to compare our relative contributions to the sub or the fandom over the years? Until then, I think I'm done with you.
