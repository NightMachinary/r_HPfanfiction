So I read this fic a while ago, it was a "Harry gets thrown into a dimension where the potters are alive" thing. The one thing that stood out was that Lily and Narcissa Malfoy were having an affair, as was James Potter with an OC. If anyone knows what I'm talking about.... please help.


** linkffn(HP and the Wand of Uru by alienyouthct) - it was called HP and the New Life, until the author decided to rewrite it as a Marvel crossover and disassociate it from the SilverAegis challenge.

*** Hmm. I must say, I much preferred the original. The original, while admittedly not perfect, didn't need the forced marvel verse that this has, the plot lines were much nicer.

**** You'll get no argument from me on that. Rewrites seem like a good idea but I've yet to see one that really improved on the original. While the style may be more polished, the inertia is lost that drives a story to come alive as it did on that first journey.

***** One of the only reasons I consider reading rewrites is for a more sophisticated grammar usage, along with a more detailed plot line. Haven't seen the latter in many places, if at all.

#+begin_quote
  After slipping diagonally through time and space to a familiar time in an unfamiliar world, Harry finds himself fighting to save a future that's not quite what he remembers? Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with homebrew X-Men and Inhuman elements because studio politics suck.
