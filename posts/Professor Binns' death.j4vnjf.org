Professor Binns died in his sleep after...talking? Why at that moment only though? Simple.

James Potter thought falling asleep would serve as a lesson and prank together, so he snuck a sleeping draught into the History of Magic professor's tea. When Binns died, James had seal the boring fate of every Hogwarts student still the end of time.

Just a little thought...
