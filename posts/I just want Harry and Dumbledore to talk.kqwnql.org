Almost every fic is like:

Harry: I'm pissed at you for sending me to the Dursley's but I'm not gonna tell you what happened or why! Good luck having everyone you know and love die!

Dumbledore: Wait bu-

Harry: Now excuse me while I go bone my hot girlfriend/wife!

Ginny/Hermione/Luna/Daphne/Susan/Downright Mary Sue OC/All of the above together: Hi!

Dumbledore: Okay hol-

Harry: Bye! *Disappears using magic pulled directly from the author's ass*

Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good power fantasy. The problem with this fandom's power fantasies is that they center the tension around conflict. A good power fantasy either A. centers the plot around the hilarious reality of being an invincible hero (ala One Punch Man) or B. introduces emotional obstacles that the hero can't beat the shit out of (ala Misfit of Demon King Academy).

Now some of you are going to ask, "If it's that easy YOU try writing one!" and I probably would if my shitty brain wasn't a fucking potato and forgot everything I've mentally established as soon as my pen hits the paper.

*** Agreed.

I mean, I can accept and even enjoy that kind of scene... If it's at least somewhat realistic.

That can happen as a result of the adult not wanting to set off a clearly unstable magic-powered teenager, it can be because the boy is actually that powerful and they have some survival instincts... But such would need a bit of build up to be believable instead of simple asspull, as per Sanderson's First.

If there is no preparation and the adult actually holds the advantage, I'd expect some firm chastisment (if the accusations are groundless) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11613187/1/What-Was-Your-Plan][this]] (if Dumbledore is actually a Master Manipulator Lemon Drop).

As for the harem... If they bring up their 'loved ones' in a rant against their enemy (real or imagined) then they should be ready to bear the consequences of the Death flag that raises.

** I'd /love/ to read a fic where Harry does his edgy indie thing, only to get stopped at every step because he's grasping at straws.

"Harry, why would I steal from you? You know I'm fucking loaded."

"You think I'd hire /Ronald/ to spy on you?! Come on Harry, I have dozens of ways to get information that don't involve relying on an eleven year old boy."

"For the last time Harry, nobility was abolished generations before /I/ was born, you are /not/ a lord."

"By Merlin, that girl tried to slip you a love potion? Head on over to Poppy for a checkup while I contact the aurors..."

"My boy, I truly don't mean to sound controlling, but I literally fought Cyrus Greengrass on a death eater raid last night. There's roughly a zero percent chance his daughter has noble intentions towards you."

"Harry, for the last time, I'm a school headmaster that holds a ceremonial position in our country's legislative body and another ceremonial position in our international legislative body. I had absolutely no impact on your placement with the Dursleys."

"I get that you're trying to make new friends, my boy, but are /hufflepuffs/ really the way to go? You spent two of your four years here at Hogwarts being shat on by them, that's not a good track record."

Damn it, now I want to write a powerwank with Dumbledore being Harry's enabler.

** All the bashing fics (or most of them anyway) are so bloody cringeworthy.

Harry: "I HATE YOU DUMBLEDORE, IT'S YOUR FAULT MY PARENTS DIED. YOU KNEW VOLDEMORT WAS AFTER THEM AND PETTIGREW WAS A TRAITOR, BUT YOU WANTED THEM TO DIE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO CONTROL ME BECAUSE OF THE PROPHECY! YOU PLACED ME WITH THE DURLEYS, KNOWING THEY'D ABUSE ME, SO THAT I'D SEE YOU LIKE MY SAVIOR! YOU SET UP MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH ME WITH GINNY SO THAT WHEN VOLDEMORT KILLED ME, ALL MY ENORMOUS WEALTH WOULD GO TO THE WEASLEYS! AND SHE WAS JUST GETTING READY TO FEED A LOVE POTION! BUT BECAUSE I'M LORD POTTER-BLACK-GRYFFINDOR-SLYTHERIN-RAVENCLAW-HUFFLEPUFF-PEVERELL, I HAD THE CONTRACT BROKEN! THE GOBLINS DID IT OF COURSE, SPECIFICALLY GRIPHOOK WITH THE HELP OF THE BANK'S DIRECTOR, THE GOBLIN KING RAGNOK! AND I'M NOW GOING TO USE MY ENDLESS POLITICAL POWER TO RUIN YOU FINANCIALLY AND POLITICALLY. YOU'LL REGRET WHAT YOU DID TO ME!"

I'm sure I missed some cliches in that, but seriously, there're so many bashing fics with "evil" Dumbledore where Dumbles is so cartoonishly evil, he might as well have twirly moustache instead of the beard and let out an evil laugh every couple of minutes during his obviously evil inner monologue. Half the time (or likely more often) his evil acts don't even make sense. Seriously, I'd love to see a fic where Harry tries to drop accusations like this, and Dumbles calmly debunks each and every one of them. Or have a true evil Dumbledore, but a logical one, not the cartoonishly evil caricature. That'd likely be a one-sided slaughter, though, since I don't see how Harry could compete against all the resources Dumbles has at his disposal.

** This made me think of a quote from Phineas Nigellus Black:

"You know, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet lead you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning."

IMO It's not appreciated enough.

** Dumbledore:- You may hate me Harry but I will say what I have kept saying it was for your best.

Harry:-No it was best for me to look up to you as a saviour.

Dumbledore:- I believe Mr Potter you are forgetting your place. You are a student in this school and I am the headmaster. Regardless of what your opinions are, the people of this country has seen it fit to have me as the headmaster so you will show me respect.

Harry:-Respect has to be earned professor.

Dumbledore:- And I have earned it Mr Potter. I have been regarded by many as the best headmaster to ever walk through Hogwarts. I had so much power at my disposal but I became a teacher. I defeated the Dark Lord Grindelwald with my skills not a fluke or sacrifice like you. I have earned my place as the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW.

Harry looked stunned.

Dumbledore:- And to clear your doubts Mr Potter, I am not answerable to you. You come and criticize my faults. Do you not have your faults. What happened to this self righteous boy when sneaking out at night, sneaking a dragon, making Polyjuice potion to sneak into another house's common room, sneaking out to Hogsmeade without permission. Well then I believe you would have loved to die at the age of 11 after leading a loving life with a family over living with the Dursleys for 11 years and survive and live a long life. You surviving Quirrell was evidence to the fact.

And as for you looking up to me as a saviour, if I wanted that I would have placed you with members of my Order of the Phoenix or better yet, went myself to collect you form the Dursleys.

Now sorry for thinking about your own good. You may live wherever you want. Maybe divination really is as futile as Minerva says. Now I have much work to do. You really should learn respect. Now go and do whatever you want with your wife/girlfriend who is waiting for you. I am a busy man.
