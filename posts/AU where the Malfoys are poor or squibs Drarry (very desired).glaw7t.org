Hi! Is there anything good like that? Or may be not poor, but weak almost squibs?

I thought of how this pureblood family will raise Draco, what ideas will be in their heads, may be another perspective to events, special kind of honor and pride. Will they be kind or even more cruel? Will Draco be quieter and friendlier or opposite? Will the Malfoys live in fear? Will they work hard and what professions? I don't care if it's Hogwarts era or post Hogwarts.

I mean it may be lack of money or magic powers. The main thing is that they don't lose everything they have at the spot (they're a lot stories like that) but live all their lives like that.

If there's no drarry like that, may be just gen with the Malfoys?

Thanks for any suggestions!
