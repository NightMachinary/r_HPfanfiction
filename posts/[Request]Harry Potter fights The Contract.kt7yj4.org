Any type of contract. Goblet of fire. Soul bond. Marriage contract signed by his drunken grandfather after a binge. Any story where Harry is forced into a binding agreement but instead of accepting it, he fights it with everything he has. And hopefully wins.

Such as the soul-shattering example of linkffn(Playmate by Yunaine). But perhaps something a bit more uplifting and happy where I see Harry holding his own against an unfair contract.

*** Although the part about fighting the contract was tiny, this was overall a fun read. Thanks!

** I dont remember the name, but Harry had a marriage contract with Daphne Greengrass he didn't want. The Greengrasses wouldn't cancel it, so he and his lover (it was either luna, gunny, or hermione) met with the greengrasses and told them that if they didn't nullify the contract, he would treat Daphne like shit (give her a tiny house with only a house elf for occasional company, and she wouldn't always get meals, or something like that). He was allowed to do this cause patriarchy or smth. The greengrasses backed out im pretty sure.

** There is also another fanfic about a marriage contract with the greengrass family (i don't know the name of it) where harry uses his right of the contract to only house her, just to get out of said contract... it's a rather hilarious oneshot, and worth a read

** Don't know how to make fancy links, and the premise is Harry not exactly fighting the contract but as you put it “holds his own against it”:
