There's strong indications in canon that Voldemort's sanity is questionable. He's already emotionally stunted from his upbringing, and the love potion that birthed him, and the horcruxes will not have helped his cognition. Do you know of any stories where the blood purists can see this, and actively manipulate him as little more than a means to act against the pro-muggle(born) side?


** I only have a one shot for you, but since it's from one of my fave writers, I'll link it anyway :p

** There was a dimension travel fic where super!Harry has to fight Lucius Malfoy who was secretly using Voldemort. I can't remember what its called but I'll do some digging. I remember Ron and Ginny were in Slytherin and both shitty people. Harry mom and sister are alive in the new world as well. It's definitely a HHr fic too.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
