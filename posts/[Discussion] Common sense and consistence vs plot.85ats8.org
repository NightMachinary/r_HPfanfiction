What is more important for you in fanfiction?

As a reader will you continue reading a story with inconsistencies in plot, characters behaviour or that just lacks common sense?

As an author will you trade them for the sake of moving the plot forward?


** It depends on the inconsistency, but if one chapter says something and the next one contradicts it, I'm usually out.

Also, why would you have to disregard common sense or consistency to move the plot?

*** I'm not an author. But I see it quite often in the stories and so I wondered how much others value a plot over consistency and common sense. My own opinion is quite strict about it, but I understand that I may be too extreme.

**** Ideally, you want both and compromising on one to get the other is a recipe for writing yourself in a corner.

***** Is it really true? If we look at original books, neither consistency nor common sense are their strong points.

******* Partially I agree with it. There's always some part of subjectiveness. Still there's some level of logic that is applicable for the most. Without it we couldn't even communicate with each other.

****** Because they are aimed at children, who interpret the books in different ways. For example, they wouldn't make the connection that the Death Eaters probably raped hundreds, if not thousands, because that's what usually happens in war. They would probably also not know what Centaurs are infamous for and probably think that Umbridge got roughed up a bit, not that the centaurs ran a train on her. They probably also don't realise how utterly incompetent any adult in the series is and the moral implications of certain things like Dumbledore admitting that he knew about the Ten Dark Years.

I love the Harry Potter books for their idea, the outline of the World with a magical school, the different groups and characters. Yes, it is vague in some places, but that makes it a great canvas for fanfics. Compare that to GoT, where the sheer amount of interlinked plots makes any sort of fanfiction fall short compared to the original works.

******* I don't criticize original books :-) I'm just stating that despite their logical flaws they are popular and loved for other things.

** Depends on the type of inconsistency.

Logistical inconsistency is something that I'm relatively flexible on. How a character gets from A to B, or the Hogwarts timetable, is not something I consider all that important unless it feeds into a plot point.

On the other hand, I find few things more annoying than inconsistency in a character's abilities. If you establish a character as having a certain level of magical skill but then have them lose to someone much weaker than them in order to force a certain plotline, this is not acceptable to me. The prime example of this is how a time travelling Harry with Dumbledore-level skills (or at least, the skills of an experienced Auror) still gets disarmed by Pettigrew in the graveyard.

It could work if that much weaker person used master strategy to ambush him or something.

**** But then it is not a fight but an assassination. Like, sit on a rooftop/behind a tree 300 meters away and use a sniper rifle. You can kill people who would trash you in a 1vs1, but it is not really beating them in a fight.

** In the end, for me, plot trumps all. The end goal is telling a good story. However, that means that there has to be consistency as well in terms of characterization and character abilities. If you use a deus ex machina by making the main character suddenly perform magic way beyond his capabilities in order to beat the bad guys, then that takes away the suspense. However, used well, you can use magical capabilities to tell a story of growth and overcoming impossible odds.

There's a balance to be found here, and as you get more and more experienced as a writer, you get better at finding that sweet spot between plot/consistency priorities.

** Yes those things will stop me reading. As far as I'm concerned it's the authors /job/ to create consistency and plausibility where it may appear there is none. And I speak as someone who is writing a Cursed Child fic (yes I know no one will read it), so I could write a book about laziness, complacency, inconsistency and the lack of even the most superficial common sense in plotting.

Oh.

** Tough question.

As a reader I guess common sense is the most expendable, after all irl people won't always act according to common sense. Character being OOC irks me, but can be tolerated. Plot definetely has to be consistent though.

As a writer, if I can't have all three it means I've failed, and the chapter has to be rewritten. Again, though, common sense can be left out if it's in character for someone to act that way in a certain situation.
