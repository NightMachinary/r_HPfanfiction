** Would you consider a magically powerful but realistic Harry ? I mean not on Voldemort or Dumbledore's level.

I for example would consider him to be at same level as Dumbledore and Tom were at young age.

** I'm only about midway through it but I'm really enjoying it so far: linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip)

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
