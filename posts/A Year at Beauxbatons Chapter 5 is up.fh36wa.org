I can't believe it's almost been a whole year since I've posted a chapter! I got so busy with college things and working and person stuff, but I'm back now! I hope you all enjoy! linkffn(12921072)

#+begin_quote
  With the threat of Sirius Black looming, Dumbledore feels it best that Harry Potter does not attend Hogwarts for his third year. Fortunately, there is an alternative. Hopefully Harry enjoys France!

** The description sounds kind of wholesome? :) A good compassionate Dumbledore? :) :) Does he send Harry to Beauxbatons to avoid Sirius out of kindness, or is it a bashing thing where Harry is just going to be swearing at him and hating him in his head all the time?

*** Definitely not the later lol. I'm trying to stick fairly close to canon characters' personalities, so Dumbledore isn't going to be some manipulative ass, and Harry isn't going to be a prick.
