:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fic I recall reading on fanfiction, though it may actually be two different fanfics veing blurred together. I am pretty sure if Harry is a street and/or runaway. When he discovers the Hogwarts Express (which I think was more accident?), he decides to take it, but not throughbthe normal route: He hops ontop of the roof and lays there. I can't remember if it was suppose to be his first year, or earlier/later then that (later, only if he never went to Hogwarts at 11 when he should of; otherwise, it would be at or before he was 11). I think he mightve steaked in (though I might be wrong) +and fast forward a little bit, to where the staff discover him, witha glamour hiding his abuse+. If you know what this might be, please tell me, and thank you in advance!

Edit: Of thise details listed, the train part is the main thing that I've been trying to find, hint the title.

Edit: I think the glamor section might've been from one if the various abuse!Harry out there (for example: Believing is Seeing, which does use a glamor Harry unknowingly has to hide his abuse). Since I found a few fics with this trope, I'm just gonna cross it out since its 50/50 whether it actually includes this trope.

*** Ooh, nice fine. While its not that, since I can't remember reading aboit the prefect incident, it does it include him going to the roof and includes the whole thief thing and, i am guessing, street!Harry. Thanks!
