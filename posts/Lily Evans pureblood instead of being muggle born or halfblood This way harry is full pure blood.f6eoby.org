I'd love to read a fanfiction where Lily Evans is actually a pureblood and that maybe evans isnt her last name in this fanfiction. I wonder how much different harrys life would be at hogwarts and instead of dursleys maybe he lives with a magical family.


** The flair you want is "Request"

There are many fics where Lily is actually descended from Salazar but nothing off the top of my head right now

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

She isn't aware of it until after the story starts though, and it's a bit of an issue for her.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!
