A while ago I read a SS/HG fanfiction and I can't seem to find it. It was an epic fic, rather long, and I believe it was inspired by the Crystal Cave. It involves Snape being a descendant of Merlin and involves the crystal cave. I think his ancestry also was a way in which to defeat Voldemort. Does anybody know what I'm talking about and have a link/the name of the fic?
