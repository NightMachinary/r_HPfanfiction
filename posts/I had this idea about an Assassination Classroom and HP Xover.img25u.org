I read one called “Thanatos” and it was inspiring. What if Harry was one of those dimension travelling peeps because he became Master of Death, he died, became Death's partner, blah blah blah. Anyways, I just got this scene of Harry being dropped off in the Assassination Classroom dimension because Death thought he was overworking himself. He makes a name for himself as an assassin and the Japanese government hire him to get rid of Koro-sensei. I just imagined Harry pretending to be a little kid lost on the street and Koro-sensei passing by and picking him up and placing him on his back. (I KNOW HE HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR KIDS) When Harry gets to class 3-E, Karasuma-sensei (did I spell that right??) just sighs and walks away and (maybe) one of the students knows Harry already and starts grinning. Then right when Koro-sensei starts introducing Harry to the class, Harry gets his knives out and slashes him on the back and Karasuma-sensei walls in and introduces Harry as a government emergency consultant.

And then I checked to see if anyone had an idea similar to this with a dimension hopping! Harry and also an assassin! and MoD! Harry but... nope. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Only the “Thanatos” fanfic came close.

So if y'all want, y'all can take this as an idea! Or just recommend me something. I am dead bored rn.
