Preferably /without/ bizarre kinks or shoehorning in mates for life/soul bonds/etc. The vast majority of ones I've stumbled across so far tend to fall into these categories, which is frustrating.

I'm curious about any stories that deal with part/non-human main characters in general, but would prefer it to be from Harry's point of view.


** Serpens Arcanem was quite good. It has a sequel that's abandoned and it's pre slash.

But still a decent story.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

** Basilisk Born by Ebenbild (I read it on FFN but I'm not sure how the bot works as this is my first post in this sub) is an excellent story about Harry as a time traveller and spending a lot of time with creatures rather than humans, with a hint at creature birth himself. It gives a very different, and at times comical, look at the origin story of the modern wizarding world.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) is about Harry's interactions with creatures in general and particularly Vampires. No slash or romance. It is somewhat dark, and is definitely not in Hogwarts, though. Very good writing.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** If you can find it, Drop Dead Gorgeous by Maya. Harry is part Veela. Cleverly written and very funny. It deals seriously with the topic of what it would be like to live as a part blood both from Harry's perspective and in wizarding society through auror cases involving part-creature victims. The romance (Harry/Draco) doesn't rely on the soulmates/bond tropes at all, as I think the story predates that fad.
