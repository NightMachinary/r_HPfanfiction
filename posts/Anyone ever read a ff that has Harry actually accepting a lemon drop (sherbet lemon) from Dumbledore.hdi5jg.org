I find it funny that a lot of fics have Dumbledore offering a lemon drop (sherbet lemon) but I don't believe I have ever read a single one them that has Harry (or anyone else) accept them. Feel free to post links to the ffs that have this, but I am still flaring as a discussion. Thanks!


** There was a fic (was it a one-shot or one scene in larger story? not sure), where Harry having his thoughts elsewhere mindlessly accepts one, and Dumbledore goes all crying that he is the first person to accept a sweet from him since like forever or something.

And in some time-travel-Harry-goes-to-Marauders-time story (was it linkffn(The Winds of Time by ausland)?) Harry suggests to Dumbledore lemon drops as better alternative to whatever confectionery he was eating at that time.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

I also remember a Peggy Sue where he accepts them readily and comments on the fact that there's Calming Draught in there (which, as far as potions go, isn't actually that bad).

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I think he does a lot in linkffn(11364705)

He's learns an objects history by touching it, so he's mentally super old, which means he and Dumbledore are bffs. He spends a lot of time with him and eats his candy. No idea if it'll ever be finished though. Just recently started being updated again.

Yes children, down vote for giving a link to a fic where he eats the candy. Grow up.
