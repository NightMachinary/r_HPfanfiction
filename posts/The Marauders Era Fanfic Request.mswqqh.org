Hello I am looking for a Marauders Era fanfic and I have quite a bit of specific requests:

- Years 1-7 of the Marauders (Ootp aswell is fine)
- Multiple POV or like 3rd person
- Canon or (very) close to canon
- Long (above 50k words per year or so)
- No wolfstar (not a really big problem tho)
- WIP is fine but atleast multiple years finished

What I found myself: the lost generation & All the Young Dudes. It would be nice if anyone could tell me if these are great for me. Or suggest a new one :D

â€‹

Thanks!!


** All the Young dudes is the best one. It hits all your requirements, incredibly written, completely heartbreaking and funny and tense and clever. Wonderfully real characterisations and just, eugh just a hug to read.

It is Wolfstar. But it's good Wolfstar. It's slow, deliberate, and not fluffy. Its very much set in the 70s and all the stigma and 'britishness' that comes with it. I wasn't a Wolfstar fan. And then I read this, and I understood why that pairing works and the tragedy it brings to the story.

And there's more to ATYD than Wolfstar. You see the war progress, you see characters grow, theres a whole werewolf side plot. Lupin is not the "quiet bookish" kid. He's a rough, carehob yob who slowly learns to trust people and it's wonderful to watch.

Just a genuinely excellent story. There's a reason why it's so acclaimed. Cannot reccomend it enough.

*** Thank you very much. Is it only Remus' POV or are there also parts without him?

**** Just Remus for the most part. There's one or two chapters from Sirius's PoV.

There are side-stories from other characters points of view though. Which I highly recommend you read but after the main story because... Jesus they will break you... I think of a beach in wales and just burst into tears, it's a problem..

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275]]) is a Marauders story from multiple PoV's if that interests you more? But it's a WIP and only starts from 5th year. Book one is completed (5th year) and Book 2 should be coming out in June according to the author. There (hopefully!) Will be four books in total. Just if you wanted another suggestion.

**** Not a stupid question! Wolfstar is the name for Sirius Black/ Remus Lupin pairing.

It's a good pairing imo. Both have pretty crap childhoods. Both are desperate to be loved but rarely see it. Sirius has been cast aside by his family and is called "broken" all his life. Remus is cast aside by society and called a monster. There's a similarity to both that works really well.

And then in canon (because it makes canon waay more tragic). Both boys fight in a war. Remus is off hiring werewolves and not able to say where he's going. Sirius (being manipulated by Peter) starts to not trust him. Their relationship strains under the pressure of war.

The Fidilius charm is cast. Sirius, worried Remus is the spy, forces Peter to swap with him in secret, thinking he loves Remus too much and might tell him by accident.

Then Voldemort attacks. Sirius spends 12 years in Azkaban knowing he trusted the wrong person and wrecked his relationship for nothing. Remus has to deal with the man he thought he loved and knew being a murderer.

Then they reunite in the shack and get a mere 2 years to try and fix 12 years of errors before Sirius is killed and Remus is alone again... (And I'm giving props to Oldman and Thewlis especially for playing the part so excellently it's difficult for me not to assume Wolfstar in the movies)

Anyway! Sorry! The pairing just brings more tragedy to canon is all, I got carried away!

** There is one on wattpad, if you search for the marauders year one.

It's complete years 1-7 matches all your criteria except it is wolfstar. It's an incredibly long read. No idea how many words but i remember enjoying it.

** I've pretty much given up on the year 1-7 fics because I've found that shorter ones depicting one year or one event are written more to my liking. However, I have read the ones you mention. I think I skimmed some of lost generation because I got bored and same with the middle of atyd. I also didn't like Sirius or Remus in atyd, and I usually like wolfstar. I've been told it's a bit of a gateway fic atm, lots of new people are finding fanfic through it and it seems to hit a sweet spot for a lot of people, so it might well work for you too? Depends on taste, as with everything. Lg is focused on all four marauders, it drags on but it covers a lot more of the day to day. atyd is mainly about Remus, who gets a brand new backstory. Lots of werewolf stuff too. Best bet is probably to read the beginning of each and see if you like the style.

We were infinite by Wolfstarpups90 on ao3 is similar to both of these and I liked it a bit better, personally. The life and times on ffn has no wolfstar and is seen by many as the golden standard for jily, it has decently written marauders too. Shoebox project is another classic, more art than novel but worth checking out if you haven't.

Hoping someone else in this thread can recommend something new!
