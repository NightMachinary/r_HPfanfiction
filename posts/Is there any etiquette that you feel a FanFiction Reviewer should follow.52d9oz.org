** Be specific. Even if you only have a few words to say, make sure they're saying something! I love hearing about your favourite line or how you felt reading the chapter!

If you are criticising, be kind about it. We're all learning and it can be nerve wrecking showing your writing to the world. You might well have a valid point, but if you've called me an idiot during it I'm more likely to disregard you. I appreciate spelling and grammar errors being pointed out, but you don't have to be rude about it. Manners cost nothing.

If you don't like the way the story is going in regards to plot, make your point and then move on. If you're coming back chapter after chapter telling the author what you think /should/ be happening, perhaps you're just looking for a different kind of story. This one is trickier, because I think it is valid to criticise plot and such criticisms can be helpful, but often I have seen reviewers trying to boss the author around, when really they should be reading (or writing!) something else. I don't mean this in a don't like/don't read way, I just mean don't leave a review on each chapter of my crime/suspense story asking for more Harry/Ginny.

** The least you can do is write more than two words. 'Good story'. And even if the story is horrible I tend to be polite. These writers spend hours writing and they aren't paid. It's all for entertaining people. The only gratification they receive is from reviews.

Being polite and considerate of the above fact is not asking too much in my opinion.

**** True. The writers who are generally anal about reviews and only want lengthy concrit are writers who already receive a ton of reviews with each chapter. I mean, someone could release a chapter, and a week on, get two really lovely, well-crafted reviews. But if they don't get even a single review in the meanwhile, including the two-worders, that's seven days of the writer looking at their review/follows/favs count going "why do I even bother with this shit?"

It's almost always better to leave a lengthy review, but even "good story, pls update" is better than the writer shouting into the void and getting nothing back.

I urge for reviews of people correcting my work, else I'll never improve. I'd rather pure criticism that is constructive than criticism hid in praise.

My only issue is that many feel on the fence about leaving 'bad' reviews, whether that's from other authors going off the handle or because they fear I'll take down the story if they offend me. I've stated many times that I can handle reviews as long as they at least offer me a method to improve.

** I think that FF.net reviews --- like book and movie reviews --- should aim to inform the potential readers of the fic first and foremost. Their roles as a medium for communicating a message to the author should be a distant second consideration. For detailed feedback, PMs work much better for a whole host of reasons, not the least being that they are private and it's possible to communicate back-and-forth.

From the point of view of a reader (of this reader, at least), two-word reviews are pointless because they are not informative. Rather, I want to be told whether the spelling and the grammar are good (with details sent to author as a PM, ideally), whether the characters strike you as OOC and how, whether it looks like the author had bought into some fanon worth noting, whether you feel that some characters are being bashed while others elevated, whether it hit any of your pet peeves --- because there's a good chance that you'll be saving someone with similar pet peeves from wasting their time.

I do find it quite frustrating when people put spoilers in reviews of one of my stories which is supposed to be a mystery, but I'm sure they do that because they are speaking to me and not deliberately to give spoilers to other readers.

I rarely read reviews before I look at a story. Sometimes I'll read the reviews afterwards to see if other readers have agreed with my own thoughts but usually they don't.

I should have been more clear about this: certainly a reviewer should avoid spoiling, precisely /because/ the review is meant to be read by potential readers. Exceptions might be where the item being spoiled is something based on which a large number of readers would have chosen not to read the fic in the first place (such as a dramatic reveal that two characters in a sexual relationship at the center of the story were siblings all along).

***** I think on an online platform like FF.net (not just FF.net, but sites like Wattpad as well), though, it's important to consider that most people on it aren't professional writers. Because of that, I believe the reviewing system should be geared towards helping fellow writers improve or offering an aspiring author emotional support through simple praise (Great job! Amazing chapter!).

Professional writers don't need the same kind of support, or at least, don't need support on the same level as beginner writers do. And, professional writers can easily get this kind of support from their fans through social media platforms, that writers on FF.net just can't get otherwise. So, book reviews become very different tools in professional writing and online sites like FF.net and Wattpad. In other words, book reviews for professional writing are more critiques to help inform readers on whether the book is worth reading; reviews for FF.net tend to be a way for writers to get support and opinions that are otherwise unavailable to them.

That's my opinion on it, at least.

****** There are as many different sorts of writers as there are readers as there are reviewers. Some fanfiction writers do aspire to move into professional writing, some aspire just to be as good as they can be without having ambitions to be published, some don't care, and some (the ones you need to treat with kid gloves) are writing as therapy. The trouble is, we are all there on the same platform and there is no way of knowing which is which.

If you want to leave a critique do look to see if the writer actually wants that - because some really don't. And if you do leave concrit, put some praise in too - don't make it completely negative. After all, if you hate the story, why are you reading it?

I mean, I understand the drive to write and all, but when I want my work to stay my own and don't have feedback at all, I just don't show it to anybody. But I don't really understand why making it public (in a non-profit enviroment, that is) if you don't want those reviews that can help you or make you think something you didn't think in the first place.

**** I don't understand it either, and in my opinion it is both naive and self-defeating, but the fact is plenty of people really can't handle criticism. It's pretty clear that they shouldn't be posting online, but they do and the system encourages it. Even though the site itself warns that all feedback won't be positive, it comes a nasty shock to some people.

ETA last week someone posted on this forum plugging a story they had written. They received several detailed and useful critiques in the thread - some of which probably took at least an hour of work by the readers. The writer later posted a very unhappy and indignant reply to all of them, expressly saying they hadn't wanted criticism (though why you would plug a story here if you didn't is anyone's guess), and then proceeded to delete the whole thread. Upsetting for the writer but bloody annoying for the people who had taken the time to critique. So really, do try and assess what the writer wants, or risk inadvertently hurting someone's feelings. However you feel about special snowflakes it doesn't hurt to be considerate.

***** That goes beyond being considerate though. I think I'm fairly empathetic as a reviewer because I've been in the writer's shoes and I know that it hurts when someone doesn't like your story (especially when other people are telling you it's great) and how much of a blow to your ego it is.

Whenever I criticise something I didn't like in a story, I also point out things that I thought the writer did well. I point out ways the writer could maybe fix the thing. I love engaging in discussion when they respond to me and tell me their reasons for it because I'm open to my mind being changed too. I never, ever use hurtful words or abusive language.

But I don't particularly care about hurting someone's feelings when the review they're offended by is "hey I don't think this works in its current state; maybe you could try to flesh it out somehow?"

If the writer feels hurt by reviews containing abusive language and telling them that it sucks and they should just die in a hole, then that's obviously totally different and I'd be on the writer's side one hundred percent.

Some people just need to get a grip tbh. Not everyone's going to like the content you produce and that's fine. Listen to their criticism -- if you think it makes sense then you can incorporate it into your future writing. If it doesn't, you could respond to that reviewer politely and explain your reasonings. Or another option is for you to just ignore it, whatever. But don't throw a hissy fit and respond with something akin to "don't like, don't read." I've had someone respond to me like that and it was infuriatingly condescending.

And yes, I know that fanfiction is free content, so the writer doesn't owe the reader anything. But when I type out a fairly long review with constructive criticism, I do it because I like the story, I think the writing has potential, and I recognise that passion for writing they have in myself. I want all of us to be able to write better, to keep improving.

That people don't want that type of review is just mind-boggling to me. Especially when so many other budding writers would kill to be able to have someone read their story and critique it fairly.

I didn't understand that. Why would you post it to fanfiction.net or mention it here if you didn't want people to comment on it? One person in the [[/r/HPfanfiction]] topic pretty much beta-ed/edited it, which is absolutely awesome.

** I have two main rules when it comes to reviews on my stories.

I want them to be actual reviews, not sycophantic dribble because they think that I'll stop writing or kill myself if they say they didn't like something. It's annoying, they're called /reviews/ for a reason.

If you mention grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors, point them out, don't just tell me there are errors, because clearly I missed them while I was proofreading.

There's a lot of smaller, more pet peeves than anything, honestly, like use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation if you're going to criticize mine, and other such things, but those first two are the main "etiquette" for me.
