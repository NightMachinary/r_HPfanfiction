There's a lot of character bashing the fanfiction communities nowadays, and I've seen almost all of the plot important characters in the HPverse bashed more than once. The person with the least amount of bashing though, is Hagrid. I see more Ollivander bashing than Hagrid bashing. If a story writer doesn't like Hagrid or doesn't feel he'll mesh well with the other characters, they don't just start bashing him. They ignore him nine times out of ten. This is why Hagrid is best girl.


** /In which Hagrid is a cute anime girl that is still a half giant breed, except the only traits she got from the giant ancestry is intelligence and boob size/

** There are plenty of manipulative Dumbledore stories where Hagrid is bashed for "indoctrinating" Harry (mostly against Slytherin), even if very few suggest malice over of being simple.

**** Usually, Hagrid's role is minimal, and he is treated as Manipulative!Dumbledore's innocent patsy rather than a villain in his own right. I don't know whether that counts as "bashing".

***** Too stupid to see through the kind of manipulations eleven-year-old children notice is bashing.

****** Hard to say. If it were, say, Hermione rather than Hagrid, yes; but Hagrid has a whole "gentle giant" motif going for him; and, well, he does, in fact, fall for 11-year-olds' manipulations in PS.

**** I don't know, I always imagine that when she gets serious she's shallow and wordly in the best possible way.
