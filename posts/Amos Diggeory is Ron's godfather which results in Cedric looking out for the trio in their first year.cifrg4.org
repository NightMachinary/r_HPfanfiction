** It would be straight fucking sad for a boy with three elder brothers in his own house (one of which a prefect) to need a family friend in a different house to look out for him, but certainly Percy and the twins were never mentioned to be very helpful to Ron at any point.

It sure would be nice to have more fics involving Cedric tho. He seems like such an underused character, even in fourth year fics.

*** Maybe Amos didn't tell him too and Cedric just feels obligated too. Maybe make Arthur Cedrics Godfather and have it so Cedric would hang out at the weasleys over the summer and he got close to Ron and Ginny and decided to act like another sibling for them

**** Thing is, there's only so much looking out a kid can need. If Cedric, being further removed from Ron, can still find ways to help where his three brothers failed, chances are said brothers weren't being very attentive in the first place.

But hey, it's fine. Making the older Weasley brothers a bit inattentive is hardly bashing, many older brothers are like that. Plus like I've already said, I'd like to see more Cedric in fics beyond him competing in the TT.

*** Sibling relationships are often strained during the teenage years, while relationships with cousins and other relatives of the same age often aren't. Just because some people are related "closer" doesn't mean they have to or can provide every need.

Cedric being attentive to Ron because he's a Hufflepuff/only child/etc would be a decent reason, and making it doubly devastating to lose him at the end of the fourth year.

Actually Percy, being a Gryffindor prefect, kinda does. Or ought to in light of what prefects are supposed to be in british boarding schools (which Hogwarts imitates/parodies).

But I think you're missing the point: I'm not saying that it would be implausible or anthing, I'm saying it would be sad. All three of them, hardly paying attention to the littlest brother? Sad.

You've never had a cousin who was nicer to you than your siblings, or that you confided in instead of going to a sibling? Ron doesn't need anyone to help him in the literal sense, he's a decent student with decent social skills, he needs someone to give him attention his older brothers don't have. I don't think it would reflect badly on his brothers at all if Ron were to go to Cedric instead for help. The very fact that Cedric is not his brother is the balm that Ron needs in this scenario. That's something none of his brothers could provide, for obvious reasons.

Nope, I barely have any relationship with them. On the other hand I was always super close to my elder sister, so it always feels pretty sad to me when other sibling relationships aren't similarly close.
