He's seen the future and decided he'd be willing to sacrifice his timeline for his father's happiness.

Doesn't have to be Hermione. Doesn't even need to be Draco (Astoria instead). I just thought it was an interesting choice, however basic.

** linkffn(Turning Time) has a similar premise with SM->HP, DM->SS, HG->LE.

I don't know any other fics with a similar premise with the characters you asked for, but I'd be curious to see one.

  After the War, Harry travels back to the Marauders' Era in disguise to get closure and improve Snape's life. How drastically will Harry change the lives of the Marauders, Lily, and the man he once hated? Should he reverse the deaths, mistakes, and heartbreaks of the past, or let them be? [Some Severus x Lily, Harry- and Severus-centric, Time Travel] (The sequel is on this account.)

** Teddy's Excellent Adventure does this with Teddy getting Harry/Nymphadora together.

Blamed Lupin for losing his mother, considers Harry his father because he raised him.

linkffn(13021745)

Scorpius doing this for his mother would probably make more sense, you could spin the whole 'Draco never really recovers from the war'. Would be an interesting hook into a Daphne or Astoria pairing.

You could do a similar thing with Draco, but rather than a particular pairing, focus on 'if dad joins the dark side he will never recover. Gotta get him to switch sides earlier'. That could then lead to Draco/Ginny or Draco/Hermione, or another light aligned character.
