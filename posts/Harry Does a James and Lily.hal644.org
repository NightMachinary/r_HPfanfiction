  It all started with a blond strand of hair. From there, all Harry Potter has known about his life begins to unravel as he finds out the truth about his past and who he is, unearthing secrets that he didn't believe possible and finding family he didn't know existed. But maybe these changes could be a new beginning, a blessing in disguise, if he looks at it the right way.

  AU. Harry, just another normal Hogwarts student with no evil whatsoever plaguing his life, really likes Hermione Granger, who won't even give him the time of day. How is he going to win her heart? By being a complete tosser, of course. Boys are idiots.
