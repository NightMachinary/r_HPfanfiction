I wandered into this today and really adored the Drislands post (Ministry and Magicals are hiding from the SCP Foundation, a group that hunt down weird shit and contain it and study it) and wondered if there were more fics like that, where Magicals went into hiding not out of irritation with Muggles, but in fear of some superior enemy. Can be another nation, another race, extra-dimensional horrors, 50ft Squirrels, whatever. I just want fics where Magicals are hiding for a better reason than being irritated by people trying to burn them at the stake.

Also, since I've mentioned SCP, there is an issue some of you might've not heard of - the SCP Foundation is a collaborative thing online, hundreds of authors partake in it, and it comes under what's called a Creative Commons License, and some Russian wanker is trying to violate that. They're already doing pretty well with funding to fight him legally, but it's an important case to keep an eye on because if one person is allowed to violate Creative Commons like this, it's possible in some legal frameworks for others to do the same. Sets a precedent and all that. If you want to donate, please do so as any excess money will be retained to fight lawsuits like this in the future, but I'd recommend keeping an eye on the case regardless.
