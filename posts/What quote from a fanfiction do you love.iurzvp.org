  A flick of his wand coated the fire with snow and water as he had done all those nights ago. But he was no longer the prey, hunted by a pack of Voldemort's bruisers.

  He descended upon them like the first lances of dawn piercing through the morning mist, invisible save for a glowing, electric blue eye that shone through the darkness. The snake remained affixed to the ground, hidden from its protectors in the night.

  There were cries of '/Mad-Eye!/' The same fear that cut deeper than any blade was as heavy in the air as the scent of death had been.

  He seemed a hundred men, instead of one. Thought himself a hundred things, instead of one.

  He was vengeance, justice, fear, retribution. Thousands of words to justify the urge, thousands of hours to ponder on such.

  He couldn't put words to what he felt. But he knew a single truth at that moment, hidden amidst the fog of frost.

  /I am the Mad-Eye./

  “Just... tell me.

Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

I miss Dashboard; Apple should've removed Launchpad instead), I saved this quote to a sticky note:

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore

  Tenured No-Longer-Respected Professor

  Manipulator-at-Large

  ex-Headmaster of Hogwarts

  ex-Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot

  ex-Supreme Mugwump of the ICW

  ex-Leader of the Light

  ex-Whatever else you wanna throw in there (Hidden) Dark Lord

  Albie-old-boy!

  Many thanks for the disappointing and surprisingly rude attempt to kidnap me, this morning. It made for an interesting start to the day. I hope you thoroughly and in good humour enjoyed the visit from my house elf. He, though, thought your hospitality was dreadful.

  Not even the offer of a nice cup of tea? Really, Albie? Such poor manners! You should be ashamed of yourself. You need to work on that.

  I must say, though, the aurors were less than impressed. But, at least you were kind enough to give them a chance to put their investigation skills to the test. That was nice of you.

  I think they would have preferred it if you'd at least asked first, though. They might have made other plans and your interfering with their day ruined those for them. That was rude of you. Tch! I'm so disappointed in you, Albie.

  And you did it while wearing your title as 'Professor', too. How will the honour of dear old Hogwarts survive such a besmirching? But, to be fair, it's not as if you have any other title you could use, is there? Of course, there's still 'Mister'. Maybe you should try that one the next time you come up with one of your Troll-brained schemes.

  Or, maybe we'll soon all be lucky and the title will become 'The Late'. Well, lucky for everyone else, I suppose. The rest of us will all be singing and dancing in joyful celebration in the street on that wonderful night. My, the Obliviators will probably be even busier than the night my parents took care of Tommy-boy for you. With all your experience at it - Obliviating staff, Obliviating my relatives, attempting to Obliviate me - you could probably give them plenty of pointers.

  Oh, wait! You won't be there. Oops! My bad.

  On to your error of belief I have to attend some cockamamie Yule Ball in Hogwarts on Christmas Night.

  Pftftftftftft! (That's as close as I can come in writing the sound of a big raspberry being blown in your direction.)

  Really, Albie? Is that the best you've got? Have you really reached such a low point of written cognitive discourse you now resort to poorly concealed threats couched within the adverbs and adjectives of admonitions?

  Oh, Albie! I am, again, so disappointed in you! Tch, Tch, Tch! You need to learn to accept, Albie! It's For the Greater Good! Alas! I have other plans for the evening of Christmas.

  I'm actually going to be spending Christmas with the people I now consider my true family. It would be rude of me to hare off to 'Good Ol' Hoggy Hoggy Hogwarts' to be at an event I really have no desire to even think about, let alone attend. And you don't actually want me to be rude, do you Albie? What sort of message would that send?

  But, do not despair. I shall advise Hogwarts's new Headmistress, Lady Griselda Marchbanks (and isn't that such wonderful news, Albie?), that I shall not be attending for her to have plenty of time to make other arrangements. I'm sure she'll be able to weather any criticism that comes her way. After all, she's currently managing to weather through the criticism that she has a manipulative, conceited, up-himself, Dark Lord for a Professor soon to begin teaching there. That Lord Harrison James Potter, Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Potter, has sent his apologies should be a bit of a doddle for her.

  However, with all your worldly wisdom and experience, perhaps you can actually be of assistance rather than the minor annoyance you've been. Perhaps you can help me with advice regarding a well-earned Christmas present I've been considering for my house elf friend. I'm thinking of giving him a pillowcase with the following motto on it:

  Yay though Dobby be walkings thru the office of bad 'Perfesser Whiskers'; Dobby be not afraid. For Dobby be the biggest, baddest 'female parental figure' fornicator in the room!

  What do you think?

  Looking forward to your next communication only via owl post, I am,

  Harrison J. Potter

  Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Potter

  Heir Tertiary of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black

  Godson of 'Padfoot' of the Marauders

  Boyfriend of Hermione J Granger
