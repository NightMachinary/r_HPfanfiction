*** It doesn't really have a set schedule but about once a month. Sometimes twice and sometimes it misses a month.

It used to update weekly, or even multiple times a week for a while, but then the Author got a new job and is much busier. The current chapters are longer I think though.

***** Full disclosure, when the author first got the new job they didn't update for like 6 months, since then it's been pretty regular though.

******* IIRC the initial reason given for the hiatus was that he needed to plan out the next book, however later one authors note elaborated that his previous rapid pace was when he was underemployed and that was no longer the case.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Eeeh, some people hype it, sure, but I would say that it's worth the read. There's some really fascinating explanations for things that made absolutely no sense in canon (there's a sensible reason for the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet!), and quite interesting takes on the Wizarding World.

*** Story gets way better when you pass the tenth chapter. I was in the same boat, attempted to read it twice, but dropped it fairly early on both times until I Eventually pulled through, and I'm very glad I did.

*** I had a really hard time getting invested as well. The author makes a note about trying the first 11 or 12 chapters before passing final judgement. I can't remember exactly when I personally became fully invested in the story but it was probably before that. The world building is really good though and I would definitely recommend it.

**** I think its mainly because the author was getting their style down. The plot gets a lot better as does the writing when you get to a certain point.
