** First story that comes to mind that handles a budding relationship is Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746)

At this point, I probably reread this story five times because it's just that good.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** I suppose everyone that reads fanfiction is familiar with Jeconais. He's the reason I read fanfiction. He supports his own website [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]] All of the authors he has invited are good writers. Most have stopped producing lately, but some of the older stuff is wonderful.

** I agree with the Jeconais comment.

I thought Heart and Soul by Sillimaure did a good job. It's a harry/fleur/hermione story and is over 751K words long.

*** I second this fic recommendation. The relationship is written very well, especially on Hermione's end. Especially liked the plot points revolving around the horcruxes. Also has a very good portrayal (albeit minor towards the latter stages of the fic) of Ron and Ginny which is a plus, considering how some authors write them.

** I know I'm self promoting here but I do think you'd like my Harry Black Series. It's about a Harry raised by Sirius who starts as a playboy and begins to actually fall for Daphne in a manner similar to James and Lily all while struggling with his one track mind for revenge and solving the riddle of Voldemort.

Whereas Daphne is struggling with her own roadblocks that prevent her from opening up. Over the course of the will be tetralogy the two fall deeper and deeper in love, though they are officially a couple by the end of book 1.

Check them out here if you'd like:
