  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust, and how the Battle of Hogwarts might have been fought. Rated MA for tender sensibilities.

****** Sorry, I have no idea what chapter it's in. It's between the chapters set at Hogwarts and the ones at Shell Cottage, shortly before they figure out the major plot thing that helps them defeat Voldemort.

It's the LML version of the Malfoy Manor scene from DH, if that helps you place it? Quite close to the end, relatively speaking.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element) There is a lot, and I do mean A LOT, of emocional rollecoaster, teen angst and misunderstandings that lead to shit happening, and love potions, but it is a romantic, at heart, fanfic. Not great plot though.

** Not what you're looking for exactly but I just read this harrowing fic about Andromeda Tonks as this needy, yet closed off and self-destructive addict with a tempestuous relationship with Kingsley Shacklebot after the war. It's very well-written and it's a unique and flesh-out look in to what Andromeda's past might have been like, her complicated relationships with her family, and a stark parallel of how the Wizarding World deals with sexual assault and addiction. It's rated M for some pretty intense scenes of physical intimacy and mentions of prostitution. It's a sequel so there are some non-canon ships that play a part in the story (like background Dramione, Severus/Narcissa) but nothing that isn't filled in through context. The relationship of Andromeda and Kingsley through their ups and downs and their love for each other is so well sweet isn't the right word but it feels right and they've worked to earn each other's love and overcome their issues along the way Linkffn(12742851)
