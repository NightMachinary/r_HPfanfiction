** Bottom line is that mostly girls like slash and mostly guys like femslash

Most fanfic authors are girls

1+1=2

For recommendations, there is some good Hermione/Fleur stories. On my phone now so I can't link, but off the top of my head there is either entwined or entangled (one is the sequel) and also "Aucune Defense pour Toi"

*** Interesting thing though, in Japan, both Yaoi and Yuri are written by and for females. There are a type of Yuri written for men of course, but they're borderline (if not) porn, and the plot are kind of shitty

This claims to be a fem!Harry fic but it's really an OFC imo. It's also pretty dark. First in a series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9309630/1/Ginny-Weasley-And-the-Riddle-of-Tom-s-Diary][Ginny Weasley and the Riddle of Tom's Diary]]: GW/HG/LL I think. First in a series.

* I've read most of these, but these are the ones I actually remember well enough to recommend.

** Math bender pretty much explained it perfectly.

Personally my favorite in that genre is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and fates fool]].

** One of my favorites in that category is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8783437/1/Written-In-The-Body][Written in the Body]]" by Poetheather1. Most of my stories end up going femslash-y, though the two HP-verse ones I'm working on at the moments don't have any (HP character) pairings decided yet.

** I'm not big on femslash/yuri so I can't help with specifics. But I do read almost exclusively slash. The slash HP fandom was huge on livejournal years ago and I'd occasionally see various femslash stories posted and recced by people there. So I would check there for communities and authors. In addition to the various livejournal communities, also check out archiveofourown.org or possibly also skyhawke.com.
