I was bored during spring break and dug up the genderbend name list I made last year. Thought I could add some explanatory commentaries and share it with you here. It's my first post ever so please tell me if I did anything wrong. Question: do I need a spoiler tag for plot points mentioned in conjunction with discussion of appropriate names for characters?

Apologize in advance for awkward writing as I haven't written something like this in a while.

Here's the first part with the Potters, Evans sisters, and Weasleys.

The Potters

James Potter: Janet/Jane Potter (later Evans). Jane I have seen for several times and it, like James, is a pretty traditional, common, and wholesome name. I personally prefer Janet, however. It has the final consonant, and is the medieval diminutive of the common name Jane, just like James is a version of the common name Jacob. Since James and Harry are also names of kings, Jane has the advantage of regal association in the hapless Lady Jane Grey. But Janet Stewart is an illegitimate daughter of King James IV, so there's also arguably some sort of royalty, not to mention connection with the name James, in the name Janet. But Jane serves as a nicer middle name for fem! Harry, so there's that.

Lily Potter: will be treated in the “The Evanses”

Harry Potter: Holly/Helen Evans. Holly is also a common gender-bend name for Harry. This is obviously a good and suitable name for Harry for various reasons already stated by so many authors and fans. If I ever get to write fanfic I'll probably do with Holly. The name Helen, on the other hand, is sort of my own guilty pleasure. It's nice and traditional, of course, and a Helen of Troy reference would not be too out of place on a girl who always finds herself causing troubles. More importantly, Helen means “torch” or “corposant” (St. Elmo's fire), which seems appropriate for the hope and savior of the wizarding world that everyone looks to. I couldn't really figure out how to do the regal association actually. Out of all combinations Holly Jane Evans has the nicest ring to me, so another point on both Jane and Holly. I would not consider Harriet at all, being not very popular and quaint-sounding. Heidi and Hilda are simply too Germanic.

The Evanses

Petunia and Lily are two floral names that have their own internal logic. The two names are just like their owners: Petunia means resentment and anger, and Lily possesses a variety of positive connotations like purity, devotion and love. I would like to keep the common theme, so here's some ideas.

Petunia and Lily Evans: Percival and Lancelot Evans. A pair of very British names from Arthurian Romances. Percival risks reminding one of Percy Weasley, but not distractingly so. In some versions of the story, Percival had a glance at the Holy Grail but failed to obtain it, somewhat like Petunia's relationship with magic, a thing that she knows and wants but can never have. Aptly, the hero who achieved the Grail quest in the end is Galahad, the son of Lancelot, which has some resonance with Petunia and Harry. On a side note, the name of Galahad's mother is Elaine, a form of Helen, which is an interesting coincidence if anyone wants to take up the name Helen for Harry. Lancelot is the paragon knight of bravery and prowess in battle, fit for a Gryffindor. The affair with Guinevere is certainly not very Lily, but it could be fun if Jane/Janet made use of it (“Evans, just want you to know, you can always commit adultery with me.”) (Ignore my horrible sense of humor please). Lancelot is also the object of hopeless love by many ladies, so there could be a hint of Snape's love, too (and Remus' if one takes Pottermore seriously). Lancelot also gets the double L sound of Lily. I thought of doing a tragic lover theme, so they could be Pyramus and Leander Evans, but it's unlikely any (at least muggle) parents would name their children that.

The Weasleys

Alas, here's a tricky one. The Weasleys, firstly, would just be the Prevetts. Secondly, it's nearly impossible to make everything align: the children mostly have normal English names that happened to be that of kings (and a queen) which nicely corresponds to Arthur, the name of THE king. But I have an idea, which may be ingenious or stupid. What if we do a floral theme instead?

Arthur Weasley: Antheia Weasley (later Prevett). Antheia is the goddess of flowers. Antheia Weasley might be especially fond of flowers or gardening, and named her children accordingly.

William “Bill” Weasley: Wisteria/Wistaria “Billie/Bee” Prevett. Admittedly it's not so easy to find a flower that starts with an “W”. Wisteria symbolizes “welcoming”, a fitting name for a first-born! Some spell the word as “Wistaria”, which I found prettier. The name could easily become Billie or equivalent due to the weird non-distinction of B and W in English that gives us Bill from William. My personal guilty pleasure (yet another one) is for her to be nicknamed “Bee”, which is both floral and cute. Maybe the young fem! Bill could have a phase in which she kept buzzing like a bee or something like that.

Charles “Charlie” Weasley: Camellia “Callie” Prevett. Camellia symbolizes “unpretending excellence”. Well, we all know how appropriate that's for Charlie. The nickname Callie is just randomly generated by my brain to sound like Charlie, but it could be connected with the ancient Greek word for beautiful, kalos (feminine singular nominative kale)

Percy Weasley: Plumeria Prevett. I liked Primrose for a while but Plumeria has the better symbolism of “perfection”, and Plumeria would of course be a perfect good girl. It also means “new beginning”, which fits Percy's estrangement and return to the family.

Frederick “Fred” and George Weasley: Felicia “Felix” and Genista “Genie” Prevett. This one is just flat hard to figure out. After losing countless brain cells I settled for Felicia and Genista, both genus names for apparently hardy plants. The short forms Felix and Genie would sound very appropriate on two merry troublemaking geniuses. Felicia has this meaning of “lucky/happy” and Genista nods to the royal name George by being the origin of the family name Plantagenet, or planta genista.

Ronald “Ron” Weasley: Rosemary “Rose” Prevett. Rosemary means “remembrance”, which nicely foreshadows Ron's action in the last book. I like the potential for a running joke that people assume fem! Ron's full name is in fact Rose, to her immense irritation. Or better yet one could turn it around and have a fem!Ron who dislikes her full name for sounding “stupidly romantic and elaborate” and tries to go by the plain Rose at any possible opportunity. People might mix it up with the name of Ron's actual daughter Rose Weasley, but it does not seem that big a problem to me.

Ginevra “Ginny” Weasley: Gladiolus “Garry” Prevett. Gladiolus is a plant that symbolizes “strength of character, honor, conviction”, and Ginny sure has all of them. Gladiolus is diminutive for gladius “sword” in Latin, and “little sword” sounds just right for the little but fierce redhead.

Molly Weasley (née Prevett): Morty Prevett. I put her last because a male Molly would not need the floral theme. I personally has no strong opinion on the masculine name for Molly, and Morty is just one of the several names that could do. One could have Mark or Mike or something else. I like Morty because it sounds like Molly; it's also short for Mortimer, which means “still water”, and the often-underestimated Molly is certainly an example of “still water runs deep”.

What are your thoughts on these? I will probably put up a part II soon with the Blacks, Malfoys, and others, but the quarter just started and I've been scrambling to consolidate some semblance of a schedule. Thank you all for reading!


** Wow! this must have taken a lot of effort. I personally prefer Veronica for Ron, but Rosemary fits with the flower theme i guess. also kudos for the twins names- il them

*** Thank you! I just love thinking about names. I like Veronica a lot too. It's such a beautiful name in itself.
