Basically, Harry goes to Hogwarts, then leaves/gets kicked out (not sure which). He then finds out Figg has been keeping two kneazles captive and frees them. He takes them back to the Dursleys house (the Dursleys having gone away on vacation, possibly with Figg, for a couple of weeks to a month?) He's trying to make a potion but doesn't have a binder so tries using kneazles whiskers. Miraculously works. Then he tries baking them in the oven and using them which turns out to have a large effect on the strength of the potions. Basically, he's a potions prodigy, moves into a place (above a bar?) where a bunch of vampires live, catches the attention of Snape( as his alter ego) and starts working at St. Mungo's. I just remembered half of this as I was typing, so I'm sorry if it seems obvious now with so many more details.

  Between trauma after being attacked by Quirrell, harsh comments from Snape and being told he has to go back to the Durselys, Harry has had enough. This summer he starts kicking back and watches as Dumbledore's carefully laid plans for him crumble -- Yaoi Boy x Boy

** I think that one ended as Drarry, not Snape/Harry. I'm pretty sure Snape ended up with some vampire.

*** That is correct, much to my surprise as I read. I completely misremembered that. Must've been because they spend a lot of time together, so I assumed.

**** It's understandable. They did spend a lot more time together than Draco and Harry, which is why you probably got mixed up.

Also, while I did find the ship cool, there wasn't that much buildup towards the Sanguini/Severus thing. Probably because Saguini went immediately towards seduction without the "getting to know you." phase.
