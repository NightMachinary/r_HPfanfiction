***** What would've happened if they were actually communicating about this particular subject? “Hermione, I don't want you to come with me, hunting Horcruxes. It is too dangerous and I don't want to risk your life.” Hermione would obviously answer, “Of course, I shouldn't be with you, at all.” That would've certainly achieved what Harry was looking for. There is no way Hermione would let Harry embark on this journey alone, let alone mention it. Considering the changes I have made in canon, I do believe that extremely hard wouldn't be close to define the difficulty of persuading Hermione. The obvious solution has the 'Brightest Which of Her Age' as seen it: Obliviation.

** This is so out of character, at least for Harry. He and Ron would have gravitated towards each other since they were roommates and classmates in any case, and Ron'd be the fun friend that Harry needs. He often finds Hermione tiresome to be with even after they become friends, and he mentions in GOF during the temporary fallout with Ron that Hermione just wasn't the same, and he constantly thinks about how much he wants Ron back as a friend. He doesn't want to be hanging out in the library all day. And Harry, at least in school, isn't emotional to show that comforting that Hermione appears to need at times. He would certainly not profess his love very easily, like that.

*** Well, as you see, I have changed the character traits of Harry from lazy to diligent and skillful in terms of studying magic. So, It is a good thing that it is out of character, I suppose. However, the thing is, I do believe that Ron was just a toxic friend. He may have a good heart deep inside, but the reader must dig really deep to just see it.

**** Yeah, the friend who is able to help Harry have fun for the first time in his life, who worries so much about him that he flies his dad's illegal flying car to help him when he doesn't receive answers to his letters, and who faces his worst fear to stand by Harry's side is toxic. Right.

Just because he didn't push Harry to study all day, as Hermione would (that shit is unnatural for kids; Hermione is the odd one out who actually wants to study that much), doesn't make him toxic. It doesn't make Harry lazy to not want to study as much as Hermione does. It makes him a kid.

Yeah Ron has flaws, but he apologises for his mistakes. Hermione is also jealous, but she never apologised for attacking Ron. I find that Ron has a very big heart, and it's not hard to see. Why else would he take a job at the WWW if it wasn't to support is brother, when he struggled after losing Fred? Why else would he follow Harry into danger time and time again? One of Ron's best traits is how much he cares about and how far he's willing to go to support those he loves. If you claim that his goodness is deeply buried, and that he's toxic, I believe you have read too much Ron bashing fics, and need to brush up on canon.
