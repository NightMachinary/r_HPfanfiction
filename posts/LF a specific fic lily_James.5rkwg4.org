I'm looking for this fic that I read a long time ago, I don't even remember which platform I read it on.

It is a Marauder's era fic, based on Lily's pov. Very close to the original story line. All I remember is that Lily had a (childhood?) muggle friend ? This muggle friend found out about magic through lily. Lily considered going to muggle college. Lily likes to go on wild adventures like hiking and climbing (I think she was pregnant with Harry then and James got mad at her?) the story ended with the night Voldemort came to kill Harry. Lily possibly had 3 other close (girl) friends that found out about the marauder's secrets. Lily's group of friends are just as smart and also enjoy pranks (but rarely ever get caught).

Hope that helps !!!


** Hmmm, I'm not sure if [[http://unknowableroom.org/39/1/][this]] is it, but it has Lily with three OC friends during their Hogwarts time and after.
