So I'm making a dramatic readind of FaCe ThE sTrAnGe, and I was wondering if that would be okay to post here. I'd make a self post, so as not to karma whore, but it does have derogatory and homophobic language in the actual fic.

I wanted to know if that would be okay to post (nothing soon, not done yet), and if it would be even wanted.

Thanks in advance!

** Sounds like it might be something that would be happier on [[/r/WhatTheFanfic]] perhaps.
