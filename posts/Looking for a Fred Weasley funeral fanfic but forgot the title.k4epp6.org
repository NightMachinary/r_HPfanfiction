:END:
Hello all.

Ages ago I read this incredibly well written fanfic about *Fred Weasley attending his own funeral* and seeing all the gut-wrenching reactions of his loved ones before he eventually moves on. I've recommended it to everyone on the web and forced all my friends read it. To my great shame I can't seem remember the title or the author after all this time. Google has not been able to help. I was wondering if anyone else here ever came across something like that? Did I imagine the whole thing?

If nothing else I would kindly ask for recommended fanfics of the same topic.

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask for something like this.

Happy Holidays to everyone!
