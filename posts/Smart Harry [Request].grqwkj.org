Does anyone know any Fanfics where Harry is super powerful and smart but not one the dark side or evil?


** Bit of self promotion but in this story Harry Potter is raise by Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes. It's crack but the characters are very intelligent.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
