I read this a year or so ago, but I can't remember the name of the story. Here is the scene as I remember it.

Goblet of Fire names Harry as the 4^{th} champion as usual, but in this story Harry is rather powerful for his age. He's sitting with Hermione I think and notices magic from the Goblet trying to ensnare him. He kinda freaks out and does /something/ trying to stop it. After a bit, Dumbledotre yell out to Harry to stop fighting it or he could die.

I thought that this story was The Wizard of The Kaleidodcope but I just re-read this scene in it and it didn't match.


** Closest I found was Brutal Harry, where is is Hermione that tells him to stop.

*** Thanks, I'm pretty sure that this one is it. I'd definitely read it a while ago, but couldn't place it.

*** At a brief glance reading the first chapter, I don't think I've ever read this before. But I'll go a bit more and see if it rings any bells.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
