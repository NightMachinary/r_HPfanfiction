Tell me the most obnoxious nickname you can think of for Hermione? Something George would call her when trying to rile her up. Preferably something that could be a diminutive of her name, but not an obvious one. Pretend he's already gone through the old standards she knows and loathes (Herms, Hermy, Mia, Mione, etc.).

I've got "Hermzie" in there now, but it I think I could find a worse one...

*** I have to agree with this one. While Mione kinda annoys me, Mine just makes me want to puke in my mouth.

Honestly I have never liked the idea of a shortened name nickname unless your name is super long or a pain to say. And i think Hermione is a neat name to begin with so why chop it.

I am still waiting for a Fanfic that has Harry calling her Chipmunk as a nickname (But in a sweet way) LOL.

** There were a couple of good ones in A Very Potter Sequel that I remember. Hermononucleosis was one. Also, Hermonoboingo. And just plain Herman. Though it more had to do with Harry and Ron's inability to pronounce 'Hermione' than any attempt to give her a nickname.
