Daphne is a normal extroverted teenage girl who actually emotes (no stoic Ice Queen of Slytherin bs here), who desires to become a muggle psychiatrist with no political ambitions despite her dad desiring for her to follow in his footsteps.

Daphne is not formal in an over-the-top either, as if she's a character living in a 19th century historical drama while the rest live in the 20th century. She uses Mum and Dad, like a normal person would.


** Wouldn't Daphne use Mama and Papa? She may be more down to earth and informal in this prompt, but if her background is the same as in fanon (and the comment about her father makes me think it is the case), then she would still be /incredibly/ posh.

*** Mama and Papa is considered posh somewhere in the world? To me it is just German for Mum and Dad. Source: I am German.

**** If said in the correct HRP (Higher Received Pronunciation) accent. Ma-mahh and pa-pahh

I don't think I've ever heard them used outside of a Royal context though. I have heard â€˜Mummy and Father' or â€˜Mother and Daddy though'. For more well to do families.

***** Interesting. I have heard "Mama" and "Papa" used in English, but always just assumed some German ancestry.

**** Posh (aristocrats) English people use those instead of Mum/Dad. French was the language of diplomacy and nobility until the early 20th century and so English aristocrats used to put add some French words into their English usage.

** There is an incomplete quidditch focused fic called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711029/1/A-Game-of-Style-and-Brutality][A Game of Style and Brutality]]" where Harry goes pro. Daphne seems like a pretty normal teenager and is studying to be a healer. We don't know much about her parents though. Overall there is a good amount to the story that is AU and OOC and the author never got around to explaining many of the divergences from canon.

#+begin_quote
  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** I don't have the story to back it up, but in my notes for a fic I have Daphne having been introduced to trashy dime mystery/intrigue novels my Tracy Davis's muggleborn mother and being convinced that Slytherin is going to be all Machievellian Plots like fanon. She is never successfully convinced otherwise due to all the actual plots leveraged against Harry and the ridiculous efforts of Draco.
