** In the original superman canon, magic was one of the weaknesses of superman, helping him not to be an unstoppable juggernaut of superstu-ness.

*** It's actually not that magic is a weakness for Superman, it's just that magic impacts him like it would everyone else for the most part. He's human in the regard.

**** But all things considered when your damn near immortal unless magic is involved you do have a relative weakness to magic. A disembowling curse affects superman the same way it does roonil wazlib while after attempting seppoku superman gets a little scab that heals into nothing.

*** yeees, but in the extended canon there +is+ was a subsection of the Kryptonian species that practiced magic and used less tech which people refer to as Kryptonian magi the same way that humans with born magic can be referred to as homo magi especially in fanon be cause fanon likes to give long-winded explanations instead of the light taps of comics and the occasional word of god from the creators. so while there are tons of bullshit smallville crossovers that have harry being kal el or kal el's twin or bullshit like that I want to see a crossover where harry is actually a proper kryptonian mage that uses proper kryptonian magic/technowizardry and maybe expands on what kryptonian magic is. so yeah not krytonian!harry but kryptonian magi!harry is a go for team super nerd.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
