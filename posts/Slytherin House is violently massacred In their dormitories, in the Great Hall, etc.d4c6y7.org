I remember this being requested before, a long time ago, but I can't find the thread.\\
There was a fic recommended that had a spontaneous mass slaughter of Slytherins in the Great Hall, I think it was something to do with Ginny or Hermione or someone else being kidnapped and a letter being sent to Harry? It wasn't the main focus of the fic, it was in one of the later chapters happening about halfway down or something...


** Slytherins were all massacred in the Great Hall in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Butterfly-Effect][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect]], linkffn(9065880). Ginny was kidnapped in this case.

*** Ah, yep, that's the one I was thinking of. Chapter 29 to be precise, right near the end. Thanks!

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

** I think I might have read the same fic? But if I recollect arightly, it was because of the basilisk, rather than Harry going apeshit or what have you.

This may be the thread I was thinking of. It's asking about war between Hogwarts Houses rather than Slytherins being slaughtered, but the top response has two examples of the latter.
