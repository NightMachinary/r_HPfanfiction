** In the Archmage of Arda Harry can't live in his world anymore because he's a walking contradiction. He has the most potent forces of destruction and creation flowing through his veins (the venom and tears) so Death basically says "either let me kill you or go to Arda" Harry chooses to go to Arda.

He's functionally immortal because of it. He will literally live longer than multiple universes

#+begin_quote
  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

*** It wasn't that her couldn't stay it was just he would not be able to learn how to be immortal of he stayed, so he went to Arda and lived with the functionally immortal elves to learn how to be like them. Really want a sequel to this.

** That's a very interesting premise, though from the title alone, I wondered if you meant a story which took the canon fats "snakes can talk" and "murder damages your soul" to their logical conclusion, and had Harry's soul damaged by the stain of having, you know, stabbed the Basilisk through the brain.

At any rate, I am enough of a pedant to point out that within canon, the Basilisk venom isn't supposed to harm the soul shard itself --- rather, it damages the physical container to a sufficient extent that the Horcrux enchantment loses hold, “freeing” the soul shard, which, unable to subsist in the physical world on its own, immediately disperses. So the equivalent for a living being who gets bitten by a Basilisk is that they die and so /their/ soul leaves their body.

But, of course, that's not to say you couldn't have it work differently in an AU.

*** I was thinking more along the lines of a au where the venom actually corrodes/warps your soul. Since Harry is (possibly) the only person to survive it, it could lead some really interesting places.

  "... and while the Basilisk venom simmers, add a dash of Soul. Gently stir in the phoenix tears and garnish with some Mother's Sacrifice. Your freak of magic is now ready to be served". AU GoF packed with dark truths,betrayal, and new hopes. The world has no idea what was awoken deep under those stone halls...
