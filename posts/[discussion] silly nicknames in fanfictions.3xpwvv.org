Sometimes, especially in AUs or canon divergence the characters get uncommon nicknames.

Mione for Hermione is all good and well but I got irritated at Mia. Or Har for Harry - why would you shorten a name into what is essentially an exhale.

Also Dray for Draco - it just sound so silly and american. Especially if you think about it in a British accent, just doesn't fit. at. all.

Though, one fic had Pansy and Potter calling themselves /Pots and Pans/ and thats kinda cute and I love when Narcissa calls Draco her Dragon.

Thoughts?


** I absolutely detest nicknames in fanfic. 99% of the time it is overused, uninventive, and pointless mutilation of a perfectly fine name.

** The concept of the word "Moldyshorts" coming into existence makes me want to murder someone. Voldemort is not a school bully, he is a murdering Dark Lord with a blindly loyal army at his side, whose name /most people don't even dare to speak/.

You're gonna have to try really hard if you want to convince me a couple of teenagers would say that. Even then it's just so dumb.

**** Are you serious? Don't you know how Hitler was mocked by allied propaganda and soldiers during WW2?

Google "Mocking Hitler", and look for the WW2-era stuff.

The Weasleys were both Gryffindors for Generations, and proud "Blood Traitors" for Generations. The twins making fun of Voldemort makes perfect sense.

***** I guess I don't get why the mocking is seen in a positive light, as it stomps on the victims feelings, at least in HP as his name was feared in a /magical/ way with the taboo and making fun of that is just way different then mocking AH. For me. I didnt say it was out of character for the twins, just insensitive regardless.

** Dray and Har would bother me if I ever saw it in a fic because of the reason you mentioned. They already have super short names.

Hermione at least has a long enough name that I could justify nicknaming her to shorten it.

BUT...

Am I the only one who's nicknames for their friends rarely have anything to do with their actual name?

I use something like Elisabeth -> Bub as often as I do something like Christopher -> C.

I suppose at least both of those make a certain kind of sense if you have a Sirius who is, maturity wise, stuck in his late teens or early twenties due to Azkaban putting his development on pause or even regressing it.

Not that making sense and being a good read are always the same thing. Remus of course ought to groan and smack him every time he does it too.

** I can deal with silliness on occasions, mostly when the fic doesn't take itself seriously.

But way too often those things are used seriously, and that sometimes makes it ... well, kind of wrong. Like “Mione”, which I can tolerate in a comedy fic but that does not change the fact that it's basically Hagrid-speak that happened because a certain other character was trying to eat and talk at the same time and it's really easy to make “Her” inaudible when you are doing that.
