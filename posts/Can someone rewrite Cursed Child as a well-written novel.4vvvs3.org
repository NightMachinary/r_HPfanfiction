I think someone should try to rewrite cursed child in novel form. Or is there already a fanfic similar enough to it that I could read?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12080429/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Child-prose][This was posted yesterday.]] I haven't read it because I'm not wasting my time with anymore nonsense than is necessary.

*** I'm with you, the format was not the reason I disliked the story. I'm continually amazed that JKR is insisting that CC is Canon.

**** I have friends into HP but not fanfiction, and some of them seem to like it. I think it is mostly a "we care and think about the world of Harry Potter more than most anyone else" kind of thing.

** The medium is not the issue with CC. There are so manyissues with narrative and the world building that no change in format could help it.

** The reason fanfiction is (vaguely) legal is because it is transformative and because it can be said to fall under fair use. Basically, in order for a fic to be legal, it has to meet two criteria:

1. Transformative, not derivative. A fic needs to tell a new story. A rewrite of CC, telling the exact same story as the play, does not fulfil this, and is therefore not legal. But also:

2. The legality of a fic can depend on it's effect on the potential market for the original work. Again, a rewrite of CC, written as a novel rather than a play, will likely draw readers who will read the fic /instead/ of the play. This would, legally, be seen as devalueing the original work, and therefore, again, a rewite is illegal.

So basically, an exact rewrite of Cursed Child, without any plot changes, would be pretty firmly illegal. Illegal enough that I would not be surprised to see a DMCA takedown notice served to the author of the work linked in this thread, should the story become well-known.

I'm not a lawyer, but I have been paying attention to laws that impact fanfiction for about ten years.

TL;DR, read or write it if you want, but be aware that it won't slip though the legal loopholes that most other fanfiction does.

*** To what extent would the plot have to change for a fanfic of CC to be legal? I know a lot of fans wished [[/spoiler][Scorbus was made canon]]. If that happened, [[/spoiler][instead of Scorpius asking Rose out]], would the fic be transformative enough for it to be okayed? Also, how much dialogue could you reuse from CC without being derivative? I'm not planning on rewriting CC myself, but I've seen some suggestions of a collaborative rewrite and I'm curious on whether that would be legal.

** This isn't exactly what you had in mind, but I'm currently working on a version that has some very basic similarities in set-up and plot but that is more true to the original stories and eliminates or reworks most of the stuff that people had issues with. (OOC moments, weird time travel, T-1000 trolley witch, etc) I'm not quite sure where I'm going yet and I'll have to see how it's received, but I'll post here about it once I have the first bit up.

*** Ohhh! I can't wait. I was actually going to write a fic as well, taking the best of HPCC and getting rid of the stuff you said. However since you are doing just that I will back off. Although if you need input or a colaboration let me know. I am willing to help!

** The best (most likely only) one so far is: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7666957]]

It's up to the end of Act 1 and updates quickly. I've read it, and it's excellent and brings much more depth and thought to the story.
