** I think something like this is implied in a lot of tomary fics. Maybe not being manipulated in the relationship, but the "love can save Tom, so I'll allow it" kind of way.

** Hmm...I don't know about that particular plot, but I remember one where Harry learns that the 'power he knows not' is love, and sets about convincing himself to love Voldemort.

In the end, it actually works; when Voldemort corners Harry, the first thing the latter does is give the Dark Lord a genuinely loving kiss...which disintegrates him.

Oh, and, I'm pretty sure [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2289300/Paimpont][Paimpont]], the guy who did To The Waters & The Wild (with the elf-raised powerful all-loving Harry) likes to write Harry/Tom stories which often end with the latter swearing off horcruxes.

**** That one isn't bad. The characters are really out of character and its a ridiculous plot, but iirc, it was supposed to be like that. I liked it, but I read it a few years ago though, so maybe my memory is off.

** I remember a one shot where they tried to force Harry to marry Lucius Malfoy, so he pays a voodo witch to revive Voldemort. That was a lot better that what your asking. Never understood Hp/Snape or Voldemort. One is an asshole child abuser who “loved” his.mother and the other is a crazy killer.
