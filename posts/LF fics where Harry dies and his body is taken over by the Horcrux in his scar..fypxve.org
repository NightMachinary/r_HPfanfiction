I basically want to see what would happen with two versions of Tom Riddle walking about. And since I highly doubt there's a Tag for this in AO3, I thought I'd ask.


** If you want a story about the horcrux taking over Harry's body while Voldemort is still alive, then here's a good fic that would fit: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5601229/chapters/12905599][The Carriage Held]] linkao3(5601229)

Otherwise, here's one about the horcrux taking over Harry's dead body after Harry's final encounter with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20631227/chapters/48990380][Pretending to be Harry Potter (and Other Heartwarming Activities)]] linkao3(20631227)

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

  Horcrux Tom Riddle wakes up in a clearing in the Forbidden Forest in Harry Potter's body. Vanquishing Lord Voldemort is the easy part; being attached to Harry Potter's soul for sixteen years may or may not give one a bit of a hero complex. Pretending to be Harry Potter, however, is much, much harder. Especially when all of his friends are actually kind of nice. This is a story involving the start of Tom Riddle's (very, very long) road to redemption.

TL;DR: Diarymort dies, horcrux failsafe activates and they seek... hosts. Trelawney is freaking hilarious in this. H/HR even though they barely matter in this.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
