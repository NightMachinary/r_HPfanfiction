I've read so many fanfics in which Harry ends up in the Hospital Wing and dryly quips about how often he ends up there. Additionally, there are a fair amount of fics that have him as being on first name terms with Madam Pomfrey. How much of this is actually canon?


** He ends up in the hospital at least once a year, it isn't like he is in there every week. The important thing is that most students would never be hospitalized at all, if they need a pepperup or something, they just get it any go.

***** That's pretty poor medical care. I bet they didn't give him counselling, either.

******** I read in a fic, can't remember which one, that Ginnys possession and then lack of treatment is why she can lie so well when all the other Weasleys can't.

** The best thing for this would probably be to go through the books, and note when he's there.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hospital_Wing]] - This notes 6 specific times, though it doesn't note the patchup after the first or second task in book 4.
