Stories like Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage. So far I haven't seen anything like it in my search and it hasn't updated in a while. I actually didn't expect to like it when it was first recommended to me but now I have an appreciation for it. Can anyone help me out here.

NOTE: MUST NOT BE TRANS!FEMHARRY! X DRACO, LV/TOM RIDDLE, RON, GINNY, OR SNAPE. I see saw so many in my search it seriously was just ridiculous. Just like to find something a little different is all.

NOTE II: If anyone can find one where the transition is done fairly quickly that would be nice. As it seems to me that switching your Gender would be fairly simple with the right magic in HP. I mean they have a potion that uses DNA/Essence of someone that can turn you into a perfect copy (even switching gender sometimes) . Not to mention rituals to form bodies, I imagine altering one would be fairly simple. Am I right?


** The one mtf trans Harry that comes to mind is linkffn(red headed stepchild by sfjoellen)

It's sadly incomplete. It's been a while since I read it but I remember it being pretty enjoyable. For what it's worth, Harry's state of being trans isn't exactly the main focus of the story.

** I intend to start writing one of these myself! There are parts of Magical Metamorphosis that I'm really not a fan of now, as much as I initially liked the series. So as soon as I figure what point I'll be starting at, I'm going to get writing. In the meantime, I do have a fic about Parvati Patil as a transwoman, starting from the first year, which is more glimpses of her life than full chapters.

** linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) seems to match what you're looking for. It's unfinished but very long, and the best version of the idea I've read. Focuses on her mental state and coping with all of the different parts of her life.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** This seems more male genderswapped Harry than trans-fem Harry. As Harry seems to identify himself as male from the begining within his own mind and has trouble accepting his new gender.

**** She definitely changes her mindset as she stops repressing things throughout the story. If that's not what you're looking for then fair enough but the author (who is trans iirc) tried to show gradual realization rather than immediate acceptance.

*** Don't give people hope by saying it is unfinished. The author has said she is most likely not going to write more. That being said, it is fucking amazing and the chapter it ends on isn't a terrible cliffhanger.
