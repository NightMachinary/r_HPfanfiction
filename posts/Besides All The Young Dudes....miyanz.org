Hi everyone!! Any recommendations for good Sirius Black/ Remus Lupin fics? This will be my first maurderer era fic and I'm looking for something that grips quickly to get me into this world! Thanks so much! (okay with any ratings!)


** [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][Shoebox Project by Rave and Jaida Jones]]! I was shocked when I got on this Reddit and realized there was a Sirius/Remus fic more popular than this one. It's so charming and very close to canon.

** Very explicit but linkao3(Remain in Light by Veeagainst) is very good at showing then during the war. The ending was more tense than canon.

linkao3(Dress up in you by MsKingBean89), linkao3(Text Talk by Merlywhirls) are two fantastic muggle AUs that are genuinely adorable.

linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) is a darker story showing the 12 in between years brilliantly.

linkao3(Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) is an angsty story at the height of the war where Sirius doesn't trust Remus.

I havent read it but a lot of people are talking about Blends? No idea what it's about. We have a large ATYD discord of you want to join? Im more of an angst person but the Library there is full of fluffy Wolfstar recs?

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

** If you want to branch out beyond the classic favorites, try Wolf, Wolf, by sebastianL (felix_atticus), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862/chapters/37676804]]). It is heavy going and hard to read at times, but just so brilliant in writing, characterization, depth, originality... really stellar (and the ending is good!). The author is truly on another level.

(Actually, going beyond Remus/Sirius, I also highly recommend by sebastianL: The Man Who Lived, which is Drarry, but not like any Drarry I've ever read, and I've read a lot! And also Let Go, which is Albus Severus/Scorpius. Both brilliant.)
