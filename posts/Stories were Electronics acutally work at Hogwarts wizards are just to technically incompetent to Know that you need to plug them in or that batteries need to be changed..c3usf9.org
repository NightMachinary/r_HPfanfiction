Mabye wizard tried to plug the electronics in not realiseing that there is more than just the part that comes out of the wall.

Edit:This thread went about as well as a lead balloon, but seriously cant anyone else see a pureblood Wizard sticking a power point to a wall connecting it to nothing and then wondering why nothing they plug in works? and then concluding that electronics don't work around magic.


** I'm with you, this would be hilarious.

Also consider: the ministry's expert on Muggle technology is /Arthur Weasley/.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** It'd be a funny anecdote, but wouldn't really work, because the people who'd want electronics to work most and try to make them work would be muggleborn, so it doesn't make sense.

*** Muggleborns that try would obviously knowthat it works, but why would the Ministry listen to them and by the time that harrys generation comes round it would largly be accepted as fact that magic dosent work around magic so new muggleborn children like Hermione wouldent even think to try.
