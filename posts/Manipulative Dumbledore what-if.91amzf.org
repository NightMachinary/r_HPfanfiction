Lots of those Dumbledore bashing fics seem to assume that Dumbles manipulated everything in canon /and succedeed/. As in, it's always fic!Harry who makes things differently and foils Dumbledore's plans by going dark or whatever.

But take this: what if Dumbledore /wanted/ Harry to turn dark /but it failed/. Because canon!Harry was such a good two shoes. What if Dumbledore sent him to the Dursleys precisely to recreate Tom Riddle's circumstances? What if Dumbles told the hat to try and place him into Slytherin, but fricking Hagrid and Malfoy accidentally pushed him away? What if Dumbledore just wanted another Dark Lord to defeat? What if Dumbledore wanted Voldemort to kill Harry so Harry wouldn't become the prophecy boy and he could take the credit for offing another Dark Lord? And when that failed, decided to turn Harry into a Dark Lord instead?

What if Manipulative Dumbledore was a super terrible manipulator?

(Note, I'm not talking about this actually being canon, just wondering what kind of fanfiction it would make)

Discuss!


** So one of those 'manipulative old fool' stories, but instead of Harry being dark and opposing him, Harry lives up to the prophecy and that opposes him?

I am intrigued by this idea.

  alright, can't wait for that kid to come to Hogwarts all bitter and get sorted into Slyth- GRIFFINDOR? WTF??

  Ugh, imma pester Snape into being mean to him. "Hey Snaaaape, remember that promise you made about taking care of Harry /Potter/? Yeah I need you to 100% not go against me on that and be /super nice/ to him, mkay? /s" Haha, nailed it.

  Whoooooa wtf? Voldy is /alive/? I thought our DA teacher was just another incompetent dumbass like all the rest. Hmm, maybe I can let Harry die after all. Alright, lemme talk to the teachers about lowering the difficulty of the protection layers to riddles a first year can solve.

  GOD DAMN IT I CAN BELIEVE THAT LITTLE S#1T OFFED MY DARK LORD AGAIN. "Nice going Harry, power of love, blah blah blah." Back to the Dursleys you go. Maybe if I separate him from his friends, now that he has friends, he'll get evil enough.

  I can't believe I'm f**/ing dying without having killed my second Dark Lord and it's all idiot Potter's fault. Well, if I'm going down, then so is he.

** Dumbledore is a behind the scenes sculptor of Dark Lords: the director behind the play

-Grindelwald: gave him lines like the greater good and ideas for the hollows. Dumbledore ended Grindelwald's reign when it was time for Dumbledore's upcoming prodigy to take the limelight: Enter Tom Riddle, recent graduate from Hogwarts.

-Tom Riddle: "The way you treat people is the way you become". After scouting Riddle at the orphanage when riddle was eleven, Dumbledore saw his potential and made sure he stayed on this path by treating Tom Riddle as dark. Dumbledore never gave riddle the benefit of the doubt and was always suspicious of him. Thus, manipulating riddle into the belief that, well if he's already being accused of something he didn't do, he might as well do it.

-Harry Potter: Dumbledore's failure. Despite how hard dumbledore tried to make Harry Potter his next Dark Lord, Harry Potter just couldn't make the cut. He even manipulated Potter's predecessor, Tom Riddle, into passing down a piece of his own evil soul..... He tried getting harry in slytheryn. He even handed harry his own first kill on a platter: Quirrell....

---When that didn't work, he tried what had worked with Riddle: treating him the way he wants him to become. He set up rumors about harry's dark powers during harry's second year so harry would be treated as a dark wizard. And yet, when handed this basilisk who harry has the unique ability to communicate with, harry goes and stabs it with a sword....

---POS: Power makes people get power hungry and go on rampages. Dumbledore gives harry the power of time. And harry uses it to... Save a pet... lovely. And not only that, but the Death Eater role model Dumbledore released from prison for harry turned out to be innocent. Figures

---GOF: People are willing to act more violently and immoral for self defense. If I just put harry into some life-threatening situations.... Flying tricks around a fire-breathing dragon and Expelliarmus... Are you shitting me.

---OotP: When dumbledore gets discouraged, is running out of ideas, and says fuck it all, "Maybe I should just ignore him, things will just work themselves out on their own."

---HBP: Last ditched hope. Show him memories of Tom Riddle, and hope that harry takes something from them to heart and finds a role model in Riddle. Maybe Riddle can continue off what Dumbledore failed to finish. One last piece of advice for harry before Dumbledore dies: Dumbledore gives harry a front row seat for a demonstration of a successful murder courtesy of actor Severus Snape.

** >> just wondering what kind of fanfiction it would make?

It would be a fanfiction that will attempt to justify every silly action Harry makes in the canon. All of those impulsive decisions of doing before thinking through, now in new light would be beneficial.

It can also be taken in a comical route. More of a crack/parody fiction

My personal preference is that Snape knows that what Dumbledore is trying and is secretly gleeful that the young brat is somehow saving himself by acting like a dunderhead.

Heck, make it dry wit recollection of each year's event as a Snape's musing and commentary.

** Why would Dumbledore create "another" Riddle when he suspects that the first one isn't properly dead yet? Also, the "set-up" would have to begin far earlier, while Voldemort was on the brink of total victory. You could argue that it takes a Dark Lord to defeat one, but that would require 20+ years to work and by that time Dumbledore would have been driven away long ago or died and he cannot rely that Hogwarts would still be the same and breed another Dark Lord with no way for him to influence things.

The other option would be a spur of the moment decision when he saw Harry, but implemeting such a complex plan on short notice is practically impossible or relies on a shitton of "lucky" coincidences like Sirius getting framed, the Dursleys hating Harry/magic, no other relatives, no intervention from somebody else (like McG or Minister Bagnold.

And wouldn't be easier for Dumbledore to do the dirty work himself and frame an imaginary Dark Lord (just apparate around and unleash Fiendfyre)? Once this Dark Lord is infamous enough, kill a random person, disfigure the corpse and present it as evidence to the public.

#+end_quote

Okay let's break this down into parts:

1) Why would Dumbledore set up another Voldemort. Is it because “it takes a Dark Lord to defeat one”?

I think the thesis for this kind of fic is that Dumbledore doesn't care about society nearly as much as he cares about being in power; and him being the savior of the wizard world during the last Dark Lord's reign makes him most powerful while there is a similar threat.

2) Why “create another Riddle when he suspects that the first one isn't properly dead yet”

The first one not being properly dead /was only a suspicion/. You might also argue/create a more powerful Dumbledore who had back up plan upon back up plan. Who's to say Harry was the only one he groomed? Who's to say he didn't know far more about the Horcrux's than he let on? Maybe he was waiting to see if his other plans fell through before allowing Voldemort to rise again. Maybe his fatal flaw was hubris and while he suspected something, maybe he never realized Voldemort made more than one Horcrux until after Voldemort rose again.

#+begin_quote
  Also, the "set-up" would have to begin far earlier, while Voldemort was on the brink of total victory.
#+end_quote

Of course, or maybe even earlier with Dumbledore manipulating/observing student relationships and betting on certain events to take place. This may sound like extremely far odds unless you take into account that this Dumbledore is a master schemer and this is only one of hundreds of little nudges and gambles. Not all succeed, not even close, but like Artemis Fowl he has contingencies to ensure he always comes out on top. Sometimes he has to take drastic measures, fleeing the school for example, but he still never ended up in prison. He's not infallible, he underestimated Tom Riddle and in a moment of vanity/compulsion sealed his doom with a cursed ring. His plan to turn Harry hadn't worked, as such plans often do due to the fickleness of human nature. However he put that and all the knowledge he had accrued so far into a bid for revenge. Sacrificing everything to secure his last plot. To kill the man that killed him.

Or maybe he knew his death wouldn't cost him /everything/. Maybe that quarrel with Gridewald back in the day served another purpose. Maybe Voldemort wasn't the only one with a Horcrux.

That was a fun flight of fancy, and I agree with the last paragraph

But maybe that kind of cheap trickery doesn't give the same kind of thrill to Dumbles as creating and defeating a real monster does. Not Heroic enough.

Well to be fair, many of the usual 'manipulative Dumbledore' stories either imply or outright state that those "coincidences" were't coincidences at all. If Dumbledore didn't already know the Dursleys were magic-hating monsters, then, what the hell, he actually /Imperiused/ them to be so terrible (yes, I've seen it happen); Dumbledore purposefully denied Sirius a trial; etc.

**** And Dumbledore obliviated Sirius and Peter Pettigrew! You think that /Dumbledore/ wouldn't know which of them was the secret keeper really? In truth it was Sirius, but Dumbledore used the power of the Elder Wand to subvert the magic of the fidelius charm and forced Sirius to tell Voldemort before obliviating Sirius and instead making it appear that Peter was the one who had betrayed the Potters. Covering his own back Dumbledore then had Sirius attack Pettigrew and apparently confess his guilt before locking him away in Azkaban for the day when he needed leverage.

Pettigrew meanwhile was imperiused into being a rat for the Weasleys for years, where Dumbledore could keep a twinkling eye on him. Driven slowly mad by his life Pettigrew's already feeble mind folded leaving him a puppet for Dumbledore.

*** From the moment Voldemort cursed Harry the prophecy became active. That means that only Harry can kill Voldemort and presumably only Voldemort can kill Harry if you take it at it's most literal meaning.

What's worse, trying to teach a kid who may not be at all inclined how to fight a Dark Lord with a 50 year headstart on him, potentially get a lot of very handy people involved and then lose or to 'encourage' the kid to become a second supervillain and then engineer Voldemort's return knowing that Voldemort will brook no opposition. Your enemy is infighting, killing off their supporters who oppose you and whichever of the two comes out victorious has lost the prophecy protection so can now be killed by Dumbledore.

There are plenty of easier solutions for the Prophecy than "let's raise a new Dark Lord" or "let's raise that boy like a pig for slaughter". And the scar Horcrux can be dealt with in a similar fashion, from simply cutting it out with a scalpel to killing Harry and reviving him.

#+begin_quote
  cutting it out with a scalpel
#+end_quote

is just a big no, for me. I read this in a fic once and just found it so /weird/. I mean, in my understanding the Horcrux isn't a physical thing that got stuck in Harry's scar, but a non-physical piece of a soul that got attached to Harry's own soul, and the scar is just a mark of, like, that there is a Horcrux there, but isn't the Horcrux itself. Maybe a sort of crack, a hole through which feelings and stuff pass between him and Voldemort.

My headcanon is that what the killing curse does is cleanly separating a soul from the body, which is why it doesn't leave a mark and the person just dies. So the only way for Harry to maybe live after Horcrux removal would be for Voldemort himself (because "one must die at the hand of the other") to cast the killing curse on him, therefore separating Harry's soul from his body, but most importantly, the two pieces of soul /from each other/. Without damage to Harry's body.

****** I've used the scalpel method in one of my fics. You don't destroy the Horcrux with a surgical tool, you cut it out clearly and then dispose of it.

I never got behind those "mixed with Harry's soul" or "cursed him" theories. Voldemort did not intend to make Harry a Horcrux. Harry just got the most effective magical shield which blasted Voldemort out of his body. No way the same protection, which literally burns Voldemort, wouldn't work on the soul shard. (On a similar note, the blood should have burned Voldemort during the resurrection ritual, but that's another story)

If you remove Lily's protection, then the whole "entwined souls" thing becomes feasible, but as long as the protection is there I don't find it believable. Especially considering how painful any interaction is for Voldemort.

*** The answer would be Magic.

An off-hand thought: Dumbledore has discovered a method of communicating with a small number of alternate versions of himself.

One of his alternates has read of a historical account of someone in his universe being a living horcrux and when that person themselves created their own horcrux there was some kind of magical backlash that killed him, the guy he was bound too, and both of their horcruxes.

Dumbledore believes that if he can make Harry evil and reveal to him the secret of making a horcrux that Harry will make one and this same result will happen: both harry and riddle and all their horcruxes will be destroyed.

I just thought that up off the top of my head. Im sure that putting actual effort into a story could come up with any number of reasons for Dumbledore doing what he did.
