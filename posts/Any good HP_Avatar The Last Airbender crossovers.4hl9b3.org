  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]

*** Oh wow, I've mentioned it before but I didn't think anyone actually remembered! I recently finished the outline and now I've started writing the first chapter. I've got a few things with the plot I'm trying to work out, but they're not too big.

** I know this is specifically not an HP crossover, but if you like ATLA I think you'll still like this one.

  The spite of the spirits opened a door better left untouched. On the other hand, with Fire and Earth as one's allies, sometimes escaping is the easy part.

#+begin_quote
  A modern college AU with an original plot, SRU is based in part on my own personal college experience, weaving together characters, concepts and themes from ATLA & Legend of Korra with my own life to create a tribute to the Avatar series and an exploration of young adulthood. SRU!Gaang & Smellerbee (& later on Korra) are protags along w/large supporting cast. Some strong language.
