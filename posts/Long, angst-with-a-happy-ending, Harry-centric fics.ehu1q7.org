Long, angst-with-a-happy-ending, Harry-centric fics?

What it says on the tin, plus the following:

1. At least 60k words if it's complete. If it's a WIP, it only has to be at least 20k words currently, but has to have been updated within the last month.
2. No BDSM
3. No genderbending
4. Only gen or slash relationships for Harry
5. Preferably set during Harry's school years
6. No abandoned fics


** Here are some that I like:

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel.

And my own fic, Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone | T | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][AO3]] | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][FFN]] | [[https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/208609546-basilisk-eyes][WATT]] in which Harry is blinded by the Basilisk in the chamber of secrets.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

#+begin_quote
  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.

#+begin_quote
  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.

#+begin_quote
  As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom... some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.
