[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673824/1/End_Of_the_Line][End of the Line]] is a really interesting series of fics that are one shots of different characters when they reach Kings Cross when they pass away.

Each chapter focuses on one character as they come to terms with their life, their fears, the people in their lives, and ends with each of them finding peace. It's a really great series of short fics. It's a little melancholic, but also really positive. My favorite chapter is probably that of the Black sisters.

The ones that are focused go as follows:

- Snape
- Fred/George
- Tonks/Lupin/James/Sirius
- Peter
- Bellatrix/Andromeda
- Regulus/Kreacher
- Barty Crouch Jr.
- Helena Ravenclaw

I'd love to hear what people thought of them. I can't say that I particularly liked Barty's chapter, but I enjoyed the rest.


** I forgot to leave a comment, but I read a few of these, and though a bit confusing, I really liked the style. Discworld was a plus. Great rec :D

*** Yea, I can definitely see if as confusing. I had to read through it a couple times in order to really understand what was happening. In fact, I probably had to get through a couple chapters to really understand how they all played together.
