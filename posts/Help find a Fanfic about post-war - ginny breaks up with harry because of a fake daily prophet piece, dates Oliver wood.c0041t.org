:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fan fic like 5 years ago on [[https://fanfic.net][fanfiction.net]] where Ginny and Harry are together, but a women fabricates a daily prophet article that makes it look like harry is cheating, and Ron won't talk to harry. Ginny plays for the holyhead harpies then dates Oliver Wood for a while. Eventually harry and ginny get back together and ginny gets pregnant but thinks she has a head injury. I have spent over an hour searching and I can't find it. Has anyone ever heard of this/can tell me what it is called. Thanks!
