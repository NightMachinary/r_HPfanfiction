Hey all,

As the title says, I just finished reading Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, and am looking for another epic length fic (preferably completed, although regularly updating WIPs are fine). I've read a lot of the longer ones out there, to name a few, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, Princess of the Blacks (and sequels).

Bonus points if the fic has good politics in it :)


** Prince of the dark kingdom. Not completed, worth reading anyway. It's over 600k words and has excellent word building

** I've got two completed stories over 500K words, "Patron" and "Divided and Entwined". Both feature politics.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Methods of Rationality is long, and complete. Opinions are sharply divided on its quality - some love, some hate - but if you haven't read it, it's worth checking out and deciding for yourself.

**** This one is a lemon fest, so be prepared for that. The language leaves a lot to be desired, but the plot was entertaining, and I like shut, so I enjoyed it. Parts of it were a little.... out there. But overall I liked it, probably wouldn't be a re-read for me, though.
