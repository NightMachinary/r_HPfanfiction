My absolute favourite would be LullabyKnell's "face death in hope" as he's a hilariously snobby and snarky and the author doesn't diminish his reason to be a death eater to 'he had to because Sirius ran away'. He's also very interesting in izzythehutt's "The Black Sheep Dog" series but we haven't seen from his POV yet, so it's a bit muddy yet.

Any recommendation where he is like that? I don't like the meek versions of him.


** Have you read linkffn(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian)? He's certainly got a snarky disposition and a dry humor in that one.

*** Yes, I have! It's still haunting me. I was hesitant at first because I do not like Wolfstar but it was thankfully a very small component. I actually read it after I've read your post on fanon vs canon Sirius. The ones I've mentioned and Blackpool are literally the only fics that I both enjoy Sirius' and Regulus' characters.

**** That's funny because the only reason I halted reading Blackpool for so long was because of Wolfstar as well! But I regret it now, TDC really manages to invert all fanon Sirius clich√©s. The writing itself was a highlight, they've got such beautiful prose. There's also Styx, but you've likely already read it.

Have you tried renascentia? It's also got two wonderful authors who capture Sirius and Regulus extremely well. There's also this one-shot about Regulus, less well known but beautiful writing nevertheless. Linkffn(4010893).

***** I've tried reading renascentia but I don't think their writing style is my cup of tea, I could only read 4 chapters. It's a bit too formal and less emotional than I prefer. Maybe because they are both grown ups. Does it pick up?

Thank you for the recommendations. I've read "Coup de Grace" and loved it.

****** It's a bit emotionless, yeah, but it's been such a long time since I've read it to be honest, so I can't really give you a good recounting. I just remember it was good. I guess Sirius is pretty disillusioned with the world by then, and a very embittered man. Regulus was also a bit lonely (wasn't he solitary in a French village? I'm kind of rusty when it comes to this fic).

Guess we're in the same boat now though, because I've read everything you've read. I'll be following this post to see what others suggest. Good luck

******* I've read this fic recently and it's brilliant, though quite dark. Regulus survives the cave and has PTSD, works as charms prosfessor. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23261428]])

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** If you're okay with the pairing, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22211695/chapters/53032402][Black Star]] is a Snape/Regulus fic that portrays Regulus as a bit of a snob, with a definite violent/mean streak, but also with love. A lot of it is from his POV.

** linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21585361/chapters/51465247]] ) I read this a bit ago but I think Regulus was snarky in it?

linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13296222]] ) Regulus isn't the focus of the fic, but he is a snarky supporting character in a lot of the fics in this series (although they are all very au)
