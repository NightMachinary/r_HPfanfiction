#+TITLE: I'm looking for a fic where there's a scene with Hagrid that he shaved all his hair and beard and painted his head with (i think) gaelic symbols to go to war, using a battle-axe, against Riddle and dies at that battle. Dumbledore is also fighting Riddle.

This battle happens in Hogsmead and I think Dumbledore either dies too or is cursed. There may be a inferi dragon involved, and the acromantulas are actually on Dumbledore's side. I think its either a Harry/Susan or a Harry/Hermione fic. That's all I remember.

*** Ahhh, that's the one? I thought it could be (there aren't that many gritty Harry/Susan fics) but I wasn't sure and I didn't remember at which point in the story that happens. Thanks.

**** Hagrid does fight Voldemort using an axe, and paints some kind of symbols on his body. But I don't remember if it has any other of the stuff you mentioned.

***** It was just that I remembered reading a fic where Hagrid goes full Ragnar on some bitches and that one was one that popped up in my mind. Its rare to see a badass Hagrid.

** I've seen a fic where Hagrid uses an axe on Voldemort. Don't remember the name, but it might have been one of those popular ones back in the day. I think Hagrid is killed in the middle of legilimacy, to try and get Voldemort caught in a loop or something? Also I think the basilisk is involved somehow.
