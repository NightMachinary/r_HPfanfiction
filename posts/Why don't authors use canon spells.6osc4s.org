There is a wonderful list of canon spells on the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wikia]] and even more, there are curses, jinxes, even hexes, so instead of making your own *ahem* shall I say, interestingly named spells just use these spells that are both canon and aptly named (with proper latin, unlike some other fics I have read recently)

TL;DR : Instead of using their own oddly named spells, fanfiction authors should use canon spells that are easily found. *Edit* : Thanks for the answers guys! Basically you're saying that there isn't enough variety in canon spells, but the reason I made this post was because half the spells I saw in these lists I had not seen in fics very often, I guess you guys are just reading different fics than me.


** I do all the time. But sometimes i need to name canon spells such as fiendfyre(mal-IG-niss) or need to use a non-canon spell or ritual. And her 'latin' is so not proper.

** There's just not that many spells in canon. Supposedly Harry is going to class every day, yet we only see him learn a handful of new spells a year, and most of them are pretty benign.

** Authors do use canon spells. Problem is, the variety present is extremely limited.

** Because much of the fandom is attached to the irrational idea that what year you learn something in Hogwarts determines its utility.

*** Hey, all my intelligent characters are /all/ up on their Wingardium Leviosa levitation charm. That's the first truly lethal spell kids learn, and they can only get better with practice and growth.

*** What I am saying is that the authors that create spells that already have a counter-part in canon and then they name them some weird completely random name, they should try to look at the canon spell list instead so they don't just make a "new" spell that already exists. (I have seen this often) I'm not saying fanfiction authors should uncreative, the opposite in fact, if more authors apply canon spells, curses, jinxes, hexes, and spell theory to their fics it will spice up the story a lot more. For example, I have rarely seen people use jinxes or hexes in their fics instead they opt for the most flashy /Incendium Magnus Flagellum Maxima/.

**** Jinxes and Hexes aren't Battle Magic, sure they can mildly inconvenience someone, but they won't hurt you if you are a mildly experienced Mage. Curses are used quite a bit, but I think it's pretty overblown, they're smoke and bangs with no real punch, just about the simplest amount of Abjuration is capable of blocking some of the most powerful Curses if you time it correctly.

So I guess people really wanna do Flashy Battle-Magic etc.... Because it makes more sense.

What I really can't stand is the lack of Transfiguration. McGongall creates Smoke Daggers from an extinguished flame, that's the most badass thing ever.

***** You clearly need to read the DA sections in the Arithmancer series. Making eyelashes go into a persons eyes, forcing them to speak in iambic pentameter (which ruins most of the more dangerous spells casting, and the counter-curse uses a different rhythm, preventing the victim from undoing it themselves.)

****** Arithmancer is filled with principals and theories that don't work in any other fanfiction due to it thinking that Spells can be created with simple mathematical calculations (which isn't described nor shown).

Next, we have a spell that only effects speech, so basically useless against anyone past Sixth Year in education.

And as I said, all these do is inconvenience someone. You can just as easily vanish your eyelashes or use a more powerful Anti-Magic to get rid of the Pentameter. No spell is without weakness, but Battle-Magic is so powerful it virtually has none.

** I certainly try to use canon spells where there exists an appropriate spell for the situation. Generally, when I make up spells it's to either make a duel more 'flashy', or, more often than that, because I need a small 'convenience' spell for that scene which probably won't be seen again. For instance, I have a scene where Harry is preparing for a ball and uses 'Semper floreat!' to conjure a white rose to pin on his lapel. It's a small, aesthetic detail, non-essential to the plot.

The other reason I am often tempted to invent /incantations/ (not necessarily new underlying spells) is that my Latin is better than JKR's. So whereas she uses many verbs in the first person present active* (e.g. 'Protego!', 'Expecto patronum!'), I prefer spells in the subjunctive. I remember reading in a linguistics paper that, from the point of view of grammar and semantics, spells tend to be utterances somewhere mid-way between commands and prayers. Since you are literally conjuring and manifesting a counterfactual reality when you cast (in most cases), the subjunctive just feels more natural for a linguistics geek such as I. I also like using the passive when the effect on an object feels more prominent or important than the caster's will; for instance, one of my spells for taking down the magical equivalent of those laser beam alarms from movies is 'Filum laceretur!' (lit. 'Let the thread be cut').

*Of course, not all canon spells are in Latin. Off the top of my head, 'Avada kedavra' I think is Aramaic, and 'episkey' Greek. I generally try to do my made up incantations in Latin; if I ever chose to use a different ancient language for a spell, I'd feel compelled to add a historical in-universe justification.
