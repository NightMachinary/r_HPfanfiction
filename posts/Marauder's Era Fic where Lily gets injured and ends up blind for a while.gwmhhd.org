:END:
The four boys take care of her, she ends up having panic attacks, I remember a specific scene where they put her on Remus or Sirius' bed while she's having a panic attack because his bed is against two walls and creates a corner so she knows two sides are protected. I think there's a scene with a secret passage and she gets scared by the rat(Peter) running around.


** Sorry, don't know it. I've seen one where she gets accidentally glued to Sirius for a few days and is forced to spend a few days in the Marauders' company and sleeping in their dorm as a result (the teachers don't trust the Marauders to maintain order in a classroom, but they do trust James to protect Lily), and starts to come around on her dislike of James.

**** Sure, linkffn(White Flags by Marauderlover7)

The author's magnum opus, though, if you're up for a long read, is the Innocent series. Sirius escapes from Azkaban several years early and raises Harry; he makes mistakes, but he does his best. Harry's view is, "He's loads better than the Dursleys." Lots of characters are fleshed out, many canon events are accelerated or derailed, and the Malfoys have a second son and some disturbing plans.

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

  What if James Potter was blinded in a Potions accident? Non-canon Seventh Year of the Marauders. James/Lily. NO SLASH.
