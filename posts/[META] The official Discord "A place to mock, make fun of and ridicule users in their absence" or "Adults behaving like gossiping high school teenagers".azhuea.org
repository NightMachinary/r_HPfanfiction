I'm not quite sure if this is the "exposé" that deathcrow thought it was - it's not like this is some secret conspiracy. The views expressed in the chat logs are already well aired on the sub itself.

** I'm an active member of the discord, but am not a moderator in any capacity or form.

First, I'd like to say: Generally, you can talk to people first before trying to start a shitstorm, but hey - outrage is modern.

My only comment is that context matters. A chat is a different context than a subreddit. Here I think before I type, in discord I'm hanging out with friends. That is a fundamental difference, and equating them is not fair.

I do agree that there were comments that were over the line, and from time to time the tone was inappropriate. But to add some context, we mock /everything!/, including myself, each other and random things.

A few examples from our quotes:

#+begin_example
  [379] <Tarantula Squid> When my mother gave birth to me, she cried, because she knew I would be the most persecuted, as a gamer

  [386] <Lis> fflai: like, did you look like you'd shaved your pubes and just happened to fall into a pile of them?

  [403] <Sparrow> age is just a number
        <Sparrow> (pls don't quote this)

  [408] <TrueLucifer> Don't remember me for sexting my cousin anymore <TrueLucifer> Remember me for denying her

  [413] <Darsynia> ON WITH THE VERBAL DIARRHEA

  [423] <Blandge>  Maybe if your using gdocs
        <Pashow> you're
        <Blandge> Their isn't actually and real time when "you're" is appropriate. Its a made up word used to trick student's
        <fflai> How do I delete someone elses post?
#+end_example

The point I'm trying to make isn't that we're funny, or that the behavior is 100% fine. We probably need to change our behavior, but it's unfair to compare a discussion that isn't meant to be public to public statements. I'll talk differently here than I do at work, or at home, or in the discord.

I agree. Tone is always going to be different and more lax in a live chat room. But there's little to no examples of people going "Hey, isn't this a bit too far?".

Also I think we can agree that there's a big difference between jokingly disparaging each other (I do this with my friends all the time) and what's been going on in the Discord concerning people who were never there.

Yeah, maybe we should get better. I still do not think that making a thread list with over 130 screenshots and publishing them is the right /first/ course of action.

I'd disagree. My statements usually have a very defined target audience (which is: "The people I'm currently writing with", or if I just joined "The people that I usual write with"), while on reddit I don't only answer you, but make a public statement as well.

Statements I make on here show up in google, to search the discord you are (in theory) already part of the in-group.

At least that is the difference to me, and maybe I'm wrong in perceiving this difference - but it doesn't change the sense or reason I made these comments.

Whenever I wrote about you (or anyone else not present), I talked about their public image, and you are very prominent in this subreddit, maybe more so than any other of the 13'000 subscribers.

For testing purposes, please include the culture you most identify with in your response (e.g. young adult American, or teenager European) I'm curious if different cultural backgrounds give different insights.

If someone has a negative opinion about them communicated to someone else and they don't know about it, is it bullying? Is knowledge of the negativity required?

Probably not under the most strict definitions of bullying, but I think the term is broad enough in common parlance to apply it here.

I don't think this kind of semantic exploration is very productive: Independent of whether you'd describe the behavior I documented as "bullying" or not it is clearly toxic and distasteful, especially on the official server for the subreddit.

People are obviously free to be as disgusting and uncivilized as they want in their own private chat rooms (which I assume exist anyway), irrespective of whether that's "bullying" or not.

But these are not excuses for them to respond negatively. What other people do to us isn't in our control - we can only control what we choose to do. Reacting isn't choosing anything, it's a reflex, a dog salivating when the dinner bell rings. No matter how anyone else is acting, we can choose our path.

However, I think this is one of the cases where what's obviously morally right happens to conflict with an interpretation of the letter of the rules. My answer is simple: if the Discord is as much of a personal-attack-replete troll hive as OP's evidence makes it look, I think it loses the right to be considered a legitimate fanfiction community, if indeed it ever was one per se (is a metaforum discussing the inner politics of our fanfiction-recommending sub what the sub rules mean by "fanfiction community"?
