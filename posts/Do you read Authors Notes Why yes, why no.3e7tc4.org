So, this is something I wondered about for quite a while now. Does anybody ever read the AN? I personally only read them at the very last chapter of an incomplete story, looking for a clue as to when, if at all, the story is continued.

I also don't understand the need of authors to excuse their story-decisions. Or, even worse, start to argue with readers about why they haven't jumped 10 chapters of build-up to get some pairing up and running.

Whats your opinion? Do you read them? Do you expect them? Do you, maybe, even enjoy them?


** I read them because the author put them there for a reason. If the author continuously uses the author notes for stuff irrelevant to the story I'll stop reading them, but I have yet to encounter that happening on a story that's worth reading in the first place.

** I do. I actually get tired of people bitching about how someone's A/Ns are too long and distracting because it takes less than a second to skip over it if you don't want to read it. With some fics that span over years, it's kind of fascinating to see the author grow up through the A/Ns--such as the story starts out with the author saying "Sorry this chapter is late, but I had to study for my AP Lang test" and then later on "Just graduated college!" and then "Sorry this chap is late, my son's being a nuisance again."

However, I also think that A/Ns should never be necessary to read to understand the story. I do really enjoy the little tidbits about their lives, or the story choices they made, though.

** Generally, if author's notes are rare or include useful information (e.g., translations of non-English words/phrases that the author included for fun), I'll read them. If they're on every chapter and include a laundry-list of responses to every reviewer, or contain justifications (your story should justify itself!) or spoilers... then no.

*** This 100%. Also, I often (but not exclusively) find that the stories that have a quality type of AN don't have a note on every. single. chapter. That makes me value more the info in the AN, because the author really felt something was necessary to add.

** Depending on the author note. I like extra story meta, so I don't mind that sort of thing or when authors talk about their writing process. I post author notes and usually it's brief and just thanking reviewers/readers, sometimes it's clarifying something that I see a lot of in reviews.

eg; in the 2014 Pottermore article it says Hannah retrained as a healer and applied to Hogwarts. I have her in a story and people were leaving me reviews saying it was 'cliche and uncreative' to have both Longbottoms work at Hogwarts, so I clarified that that was canon because I don't appreciate someone calling me 'uncreative' over something that JKR wrote. Sometimes it's just easier to leave an a/n explaining a decision than to get a bunch of reviewers telling you "Lavender died at the BOH". (I have some sticklers for canon who read my stuff?)

** Some author's notes are useful for context or to explain which version of canon they are abiding by. I despise the ones where they respond to reviewers' questions in such a way that you feel compelled to look up the comment to figure out what the comment refers to. Apologies for real-life matters have a relevant half-life of one published chapter - when you get a second chapter past that, the note should be removed.

I do enjoy historical reference information, which is usually the type of author's note I would post. My favorite of my own notes was a dedication to my late great-Uncle Milton, whose personality had inspired some of the character hijinks in the chapter.

Oh yeah: except for the 'foreword' of a first chapter, they belong at the end.

*** Eh... the foreword by definition belongs at the start of a book, I don't see why that would be different with a fanfic. Although it should be written /after/ the actual story. As long as the the author doesn't start posting until it's fully finished, I don't see why it should be different than from an actual book.

**** Fanfiction (with chapters) is different from published books in that it is posted as a serial with the audience afforded the chance to comment as each episode is released. In that way it acts more like a television show or a comic book.

Most fanfic authors who put in a foreword aren't even calling it that- it's just another author's note. What I see them as is more of a project's 'statement of intent'; the intention at the beginning rather than the assessment once complete.

Why I like them: it informs me as the reader whether the author is just shooting from the hip or has a concept with a goal in mind. I'm willing to afford a goal-oriented concept more leeway when it comes to weird plot developments, and it makes making commentary more relevant. If I know what they're trying to do, I can say whether I think they're veering off-track or not, and why I think so.

** I tend to read them, but they're almost always useless. Begging for reviews, promising the story is going to get better are the two big ones. I also really hate the notes you see at the beginning of amateur stories, where they basically outline the entire plot of the story, and put in every single applicable code they can think of, even if it's a spoiler.

** I used to write author's notes. Thank reviewers, try to include a timeline update, clear up some misconceptions.

But then I realized very few people actually read the author's notes.

So, now I just include a grossly optimistic update estimate.

**** There is another reason I started leaving out author's notes.

I wanted write in such a way that the fic didn't need explanations in the notes. A friend in the publication world explained that a lot of fanfic authors she worked with could not write a story without the reader's knowledge of the HP construct or inserting information in the author's notes.

As part of my attempts to start writing more original works, I started leaving less and less information in the author's notes. If I ever convince myself to write original, I won't have the crutch of an author's notes to explain character motivations or plot turns.

It will have to stand on it's own.

I still enjoy the meta that exists in author's notes though.

** I generally don't read them anymore since I've been spoiled by them a few times. One author in particular would put in a note explaining something in the chapter, but it was at the start of the chapter instead of at the end. (I'm also not a fan of authors who feel the need to explain things from their chapters in great detail - if it's not clear in the chapter, then I'm probably not going to enjoy your writing.)

I also tend to skip them if they're very long. A/N should be short and sweet, IMO.

** I only read maybe the first one before the story starts because they often give us a better idea of what the story is about, especially if the summary is cryptic.

I usually don't read any others because authors unfortunately spoil a lot of the upcoming plot in their A/Ns (ex. warning: character death ahead or explicit scenes ahead, etc.)

** I skim over the long replies to reviews, the regular "read and review!" lines, the "I'm (username) on tumblr/twitter, pls follow!" repeated on each chapter, and disclaimers. I read everything left, and if I feel the ANs are not worth the time reading them, I usually just drop the story. I do understand how authors may want to leave a long AN to ward off weird reviewers with ridiculous demands, but I don't think they should be needed.

I expect there to be chapter specific warnings at the top of a chapter when needed, and the citing at the foot when they quote things. I like it when authors leave translations for the words/sentences in other languages they used.

** It depends. I don't mind reference information, or a shout out to someone for a particular idea. But, please, put them at the end, after the chapter. And don't respond to each and every review there, that's what PMs are for. If they don't have it set up, then that's their problem.

** Sometimes. If they're long, or I know the author uses them for unnecessary commentary, I'll skip past them. But if I know the author answers questions that don't exactly fit into the story itself, I'll make a habit of reading them.

They make it interesting sometimes- I don't always look at when a story was first published, so I'll see notes about the author waiting in line for a book release or movie showing.

** I do, in part because they're entertaining, whether or not they're quality.

In most top-notch fanfictions, there either aren't ANs or they are there to add some sort of context that isn't common knowledge.

In the rest of them, they give random personal anecdotes, review replies of varying degrees of seriousness, and in some of the so bad it's good guilty pleasure fics, a healthy dose of randomness that hasn't been enjoyed since the days of Myspace.

Whether they're good or bad, they have an entertainment value.

** I have a love/hate relationship with A/Ns. Even from the same author (Bobmin for example) - sometimes I'm in the mood for goofy omake-like A/Ns...and sometimes I just get frustrated when I realize, /wtfity, that A/N was half the fracking chapter!!!/

A/Ns saying how reviews help them write faster actually make me puke in my mouth a little.

A/Ns that insist on replying to /each and every person who has reviewed/ frustrate the ever-loving sh1t out of me and make me want to reach through the computer and slap someone upside their head.

Sometimes I /love/ A/Ns ... if someone say, plugs another story as opposed to some kind of self-fappening of their own work. I forget the author, but at the beginning of each chapter of a story I once read, they recommended someone else's story. And it turned out (as I was enjoying the current story) each story that author recommended was also enjoyable. So there is the love for the A/N. I would have to go through my favorites to figure out who did this - if I have time I'll try to figure it out.

** It really depends on the author. I'll read them the first couple of times and keep reading them if they pertain to the story itself, like things that happened in the last chapter, or where song lyrics they've incorporated came from.

I'll skip them if the author is just blathering on about why their update schedule is taking too long, or thanking the usernames of people who helped them, or answering questions from their reviews about where they plan to go with the story, etc. Some authors take themselves way too seriously and will call their readers stupid petnames or get mad at people who leave bad reviews, I tend to skip those too.
