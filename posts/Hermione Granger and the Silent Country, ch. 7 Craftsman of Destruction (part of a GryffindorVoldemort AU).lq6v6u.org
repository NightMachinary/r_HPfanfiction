The latest chapter, "Craftsman of Destruction," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/72886791][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** This is really good! I love the premise and can't help but like Riddle character alot. Is like you would think that equality is a good goal but is still Tom Riddle so is still a very twisted revolution.
