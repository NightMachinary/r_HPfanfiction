****** He does learn some politics though under guidance from Sirius, Andromeda, etc. At first they didn't want him super involved because he's still young and shouldn't have to worry about Voldemort and whatnot. Of course towards the end he gets involved because things involve him. Pure blood politics are not mentioned every ten lines.

This is one of my favourite fics and Harry is OP here purely by a magical power sense, not a smart/intelligent way. He doesn't command people randomly like what you are describing.

****** Well Harry being absurdly involved in politics is definitely a thing here; most of the story kind of revolves around Wizengamot and Harry's status as heir to both Potter and Black.

** So here I am again. The guy that always shows up and defends this fic. I personally find A Marauders Plan to be one of the best father figure sirius fics written. It's certainly in the top three along with the Wise One series and the Innocent series. If you like fics with elements of politics, family fluff time, and a romance that is actually fairly close to what romance is like at that age then it's a pretty great fic. It also has some good magic and fairly competent enemies. On the other hand Harry does become a bit OP and there is a lot of noble house oaths and such thrown around so if those really bother you it might not be for you.

*** Personally I think A Marauder's Plan doesn't hold a candle to the Innocent series, but I'm very biased because by the time the "Portus Maximus Hogwarts" scene happens in AMP I was already so fed up of giving it second chances that I just tried to delete it from my memory... What's the Wise One series like? I haven't heard about that!

**** Oh yeah I completely agree that those 2-3 chapters are pretty terrible. I actually skip them when rereading. linkffn(4062601) so the Wise One trilogy is 3 books that start with sirius kidnapping harry and traveling the world as fugitives with him then eventually returning to home. Once again Harry becomes a bit OP because he's exposed to all the not british magic and blah blah but the relationship between him and sirius is pretty fantastic. Unlike a marauders plan the romance in this one eventually becomes "I'm 16 years old and you're the only one for me!" but the build up to that point is slow and interesting.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

** If it's the fic I remember, I couldnt get through the first few chapters. IIRC, the first portion focuses on Sirius tricking Fudge into giving him a trial through pureblood politics or whatever, and multiple people proclaim what a genius Sirius is and how clever he is for doing that. It just checked most of my boxes about cliched, tired, and boring crap.

** Im halfway through my second read of it, i really like it a lot. The characters are fleshed out, harry has a /real/ family here, there are elements of dealing with both his and sirius' pasts, there are elements of canon, but a lot of them are twisted a bit- the basics are still there, but some are aimplified and some are more complicsted. I really enjoy it.

** Technically, the story is 893K words but yes, it's extremely long. And its length is exactly what deters me from reading it. The longest fic I ever read was Vox Corporis at 323K words. And while I love the story in its entirety, parts were sluggish to pull through. Having said that, I've heard both good and bad for A Marauder's Plan. My two cents: Give the first few chapters a try and see if you like it. If so, then continue on. If not, then stop.

** I enjoyed it when I tried reading it. There's claim of OP, but its at a cost that is implied early on. I never finished it though, after seeing a super clear Dumbledore manipulation and the mess it likely caused, and ended up dropping the fic because I wanted to Sparta kick Dumbledore off a cliff, and never got around to picking it up again. One of those "Dumbledore, you're either a retard or an asshole if you think this is a good idea". Seriously, Trelawney!? As a 'guard'!? I hoped someone punched Dumbledore after that fact was discovered, but like I said, I never got past that point.
