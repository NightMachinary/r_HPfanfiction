"Soldiers!" The general barked, "the war is upon us! For months those bastards have killed our families! Or sons and daughters dead in the streets. Innocents civilians dead by the thousands!"

"The enemy might have automatic rifles, missile launchers and all sorts of nasty weapons, but we have our tazers! We will not be dragged down to their level! We will stun them with our tazers and be victorious! The dark will never prevail!"

And the war was summarily lost, because as any sane individual know, in war you fight to win, you kill so your loved ones can be safe.

**** When Dumbledore stumbled into the wreckage of Godric's Hollow, his heart sank. All three Potters were dead. He cradled the empty, broken from of Harry Potter in his hands. Voldemort was gone, but not defeated. What would happen when he returned? He closed his eyes, weeping silent tears not just for the Potters, but for all the others that would die when the Dark Lord returned.

No. Dumbledore clentched his fist, gripping the elder wand. He gazed down at the dead child in his hands. No. No, there would be a defender of the weak, a protector of the innocent. He knew just what to do.

Rabbi Eliyadhu Bar-Emon of York ran a small yeshiva attached to the Synagogue, where he had a dozen jewish boys he taught daily. He spent his evenings in the small house next door, studying the ancient texts or eating dinner with his wife and two daughters. And, on rare occasions, practicing magic.

Eilyadhu was a graduate not just of the yeshiva, but also of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He had spent his life in the pursuit of wisdom, both as a Ravenclaw, and as a Jew. He had largely abandoned the magical life in favor of teaching the holy scriptures, but he had more than a few ancient texts of Hebrew magic. On occasion, he even wrote down some spells and lore he had uncovered on his own.

The night of October 31st, 1981, Rabbi Eliyadhu was copying a passage of an old mystical text when his wife knocked on his study.

"Eli, someone is here to see you," Rachel said.

"Oh? It is late, and I am busy. Can they not see me tomorrow?" Eli asked.

"It is the Headmaster, Dumbledore," Rachel said. "He seems concerned."

Rachel had not attended Hogwarts, but rather had attended a yeshiva in New York where she was born where young jews with magical heritage were taught. Eli had trained at the same yeshiva after he had graduated from Hogwarts, and fell in love there.

Eli stood and hurried out, finding the old wizard standing in the hall, carrying a small wrapped bundle.

"Headmaster, it is an honor," Eli said, bowing. Though Dumbledore was a goyim, he had Eli's respect both as a master of the arcane and as a wise and venerable man.

"Rabbi, I come with a terrible request," Dumbeldore whispered. There were tears in his eyes, and his voice was pained. "There has been a great and terrible tragedy. The Potter family was finally attacked by Voldemort. All were slain."

Rachel let out a soft moan and covered her eyes, rocking back and forth. Eli closed his eyes and muttered a short prayer. "This is terrible news. But why do you come to me? My wife and I, we live apart from the magical community. Our daughters are not yet old enough to take a wand. Why do you come to me with this news?

Slowly, Dumbledore unwrapped the tiny bundle. Eli gasped to see the child within, it's forehead marked with a scar. But a moment later, he felt his heart sink. The child was dead, pale and lifeless.

"This was Harry Potter," Dumbledore said softly. "But he has been slain. However, there is a prophecy. Voldemort is not dead, only banished. He shall return, and only a child marked by him may slay him."

"Why do you tell me this?" Eli asked. "I cannot raise the dead."

Dumbledore nodded. "No. But you could create a Potter. From this broken form, you could create a golem. I know you have the writings of your ancestor, the Rabbi of Chelm. And you have long experimented with perfecting such a form." Dumbledore held out the dead child to Eli, and after a moment's hesitation, he took it.

"Eli, no! Such a thing is forbidden!" Rachel warned.

"Perhaps," Eli muttered. "But I have longed to make a golem for years. Headmaster, are you certain of this?"

Dumbledore nodded gravely. "There is little time." He held out a small device, like a golden watch. "But I can buy you a few hours."

With a trembling hand, Eli took the Time Turner. Rachel's eyes were wide with horror, but Eli met her gaze. "The prophecy must be fulfilled, my love. Only the Creator Himself can cause such a thing. It must be done." With trembling hands, he spun the Time Turner twelve times.

Nonetheless, lack of intent aside, I did consider Vernon's personality to be a fit to a word that was close enough, and as for Lucius while I personally find nothing pleasing about that fop whatsoever you can fairly easily find fics in which authors wax poetic about how aristocratic and pleasing to eye his looks are, which added to the fact that some authors seem to think that his name actually is “Luscious” made me think that the alleged meaningfulness of his name is absurd enough to be a perfect opener.

Though, seriously now, it's fairly obvious that out of all the Malfoys he, despite being seen after Draco, is the one who is most defined by their name, that being “bad faith”, but that would leave us with trying to find a meaning for Draco and he'd have to be called “Titill” for that.

Book 3: Sirius escapes from Azkaban, the Ministry issues what amounts to a kill on sight order for him.

Book 4: Fudge finds an Azkaban-escapee, he executes him extra-judicially, nothing happens to Fudge.

Book 5: The ministry literally allows an employee to torture children, this person keeps their job, no major scandal results from this.

Book 6: Wizards are wrongfully arrested just to look like progress is being made against the Death Eaters.

- If you are caught on any suspicion of being a Death Eater, expect Azkaban.
- If you are subdued and are a Death Eater, expect to wake up in Azkaban with a life sentence.

****** I very much disagree with your assertion.

The DoM battle was a perfect life and death situation where 12 hardened terrorist killers were trying to torture and murder 6 school pupils. More than half of these 12 were also prison escapees and should already have kiss-on-sight orders after them.

If Dumbledore was willing, he could perfectly use lethal force to get rid of them all under the need to protect innocent children. Azkaban, by this time, was already known to be a revolving door facility. The Ministry was also known to be infiltrated with Voldemort's spies and sympathizers.

Later, these 11 would cause untold harms to hundreds, if not more, innocents. The two Carrows alone had crucioed countless Hogwarts children and traumatized many of them for life! Dolohov murdered Remus, and Bellatrix murdered Tonks. Yaxley was instrumental in taking over of the Ministry and rounding up many Mugglesborns and shipping them off to death camps.

Furthermore, the stake against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy even worse than the Nazis or ISIS), and yet JK Rowling wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle.

For example, the Trio knocked out Fenrir Greyback after he had already mutilated Lavender Brown. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again.

I say fuck that!

I totally despise the argument "killing will make you as bad as them".

No, killing the psychotic inbred serial killer isn't going to make you as bad as a psychotic inbred serial killer. Everyone who dies from here on out is all your fault. Fuckin' idiot.

We know how all of it continued, but the characters in the book didn't. Dumbledore didn't know the future. At the time they still had a functional Ministry, so the better question, in my opinion, is a) why they didn't sentence them to the kiss and b) why they didn't make changes to the prison. We know from Nurmengard that not all prisons are guarded by Dementors, we know from the DH that there are charms that can stop even Voldemort from entering.

Also, later on even Harry did go in for the kill. When the 7 Potter's fled Privet Drive, he stunned Death Eaters fully expecting that the fall would kill them.

I think it is important that the Ministry is still in power at the time. Dumbledore is part of a society that has an agreement on how to deal with criminals, and him being a powerful individual does not give him the right to disregard it. You kill criminals when necessary, capture them when possible, they get a trial, they are sentenced either to prison or to the Dementor's Kiss. Like I said, I think the fault in how they dealt with the Death Eaters happened after the battle. If they knew they couldn't hold them in the prison as it was, then they should have acted accordingly.

And after Voldemort broke them out of jail, it was obvious that they couldn't be kept in prison anyway. Killing them was the only moral action at that point. Every murder by the ones Dumbledore spared is his fault.

He did what was in his power, for example trying to convince the Minister to remove the Death Eaters from Azkaban, but at the end of the day, Dumbledore is one man, part of a larger society, that chose a way to deal with the Death Eaters that did not work in the end. Should he have started murdering them, because he did not agree how his society dealt with them? What would that have made him? Also, the Death Eaters were not broken out of Azkaban until shortly before the Ministry's fall. During Harry's sixth year, they remained there. It seems it wasn't that easy for Voldemort to break them out again.

I just don't agree that it was Dumbledore's duty to kill them and that he somehow failed by handing them over to have a trial. As I said in another comment, I think if anybody failed on that front, it was the Ministry. They could have sentenced the Death Eaters to the Kiss, they could have improved the way Azkaban was run. They didn't. Had Dumbledore started killing Death Eaters, disregarding his society's rules on how to deal with them, claiming that he alone knew how to deal with them, that he had the right to determine who got to live and who to die, even though the democratically elected government, the people had not given him that power, he would have started working outside of society, like Voldemort. He would have been a very different character altogether. I see him in a different role in the war. He worked at dismantling Voldemort, at figuring out his secrets, a job others could not do, did not even know that it had to be done. The "small squabbles", the fighting and chasing down and imprisoning/killing of Death Eaters was not his main objective, that was the Ministry's, the Aurors' job.

He was an intelligent, powerful wizard and his contributions were integral to Voldemort's defeat. Did he have his mistakes? Yes.

And he founded and led the Order of the Phoenix - arguably a general in the war. He couldn't have done that if he actually believed he wasn't to be trusted with power.

And no, he had no right to sacrifice innocents for his beliefs. I don't give a fuck about anyone's faith, belief, or principles; the lives of innocents take precedence over all of that. If you need to kill to save a child, you have to kill.

Voldemort is my most disliked character, both in a literary sense and his in-story behaviors. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain. Such a villain would be easy to beat if the protagonists actually knew something about politics, strategies, and tactics, especially if someone with equal combat power was on their side (Dumbledore).

Basically, if you just increased canon Dumbledore's competence slightly, as in "Petrification Proliferation", you would have canon plot shot easily and Voldemort crushed like a bug. Where's fun in that?

Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: “But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!” Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

****** I was thinking of an attack by Dostum (I think) forces during the first month of Afghan war, where attacking with horses was basically the sole solution (only way to attack quickly enough) and the airstrikes just helped hiding the attacking forces long enough (a strategy invented with artillery, long before aerial forces).\\
And yeah, in the battle of Hogwarts, as it was fought, two of three machine guns nests would have been enough; well, till L.V. started explaining that they were wizards, and that brooms were usefull sometimes.

********** I never said to become a psychopath or go out and kill willy nilly. There's a big difference between what Voldemort/de do (which is just go kill, execute, torture) and self-defense.

in the heat of a battle when they are throwing avada kedavras at you, 5 to 1 (Lets no forgot that the DE's, dark creatures, people that were imperio'd, people that were blackmailed, etc all out numbered them 5 to 1 at least) I wouldn't be worrying about if I stupified them.

Same as if lets say I was in a corner, unable to escape someone who was raising a knife to stab me, but I had a gun. I'd shoot. Not stop to think 'oh god if i shoot him when he's about to stab me and kill him i'm just as bad as he is'

And common wizards are nowhere's near the greatness of Dumbledore, look at what they teach at hogwarts, they teach things like stupefy in seventh year? (Based on triwizard when harry and hermione train they say Cedric and other champions know these spells, perhaps 5-7). When you're going to battle dark wizards and witches that know how to eviscerate you, skin you alive etc. They have spells you can't even block. Dumbledore has a great vast knowledge of spells, the common wizard does not. Surely the common every day wizard have more than the spells taught at hogwarts, for sure. Dumbledore might be capable of taking those alive and doing as you say, just like the best boxer might be able to knock another one out, but I could not; nor could the common wizard. Dumbledore easily could defend himself against Voldemort, while many familys, Aurors, other dark wizards, etc could not even with all their knowledge and training; nor could they do so against even his death eaters (Longbottoms, among many others).

So what Dumbledore could do is not a good measure for what a normal magical person could do. And by the time the war really broke out, (IE Book 7) we didn't have dumbledore.

You first action shouldn't be kill--I agree on that, you don't just go out and kill people you don't like, but when there's no other option than I think it's fine.

That does not mean one should go seeking them out and execute them one by one. Or torture, etc. But in a life or death situation with no other option but to kill or be killed....than yes. And I do personally believe that by Book 7 it was just that.

Otherwise let's just throw Molly Weasley (She killed Bellatrix, and did not in fact take her alive), Harry Potter, and I'm sure a few other students who ended up killing in self-defense, or in battle into prison. It just makes no sense to me.

It is BECAUSE there are so many other legitimate options that killing with magic (or the Force!) is such a big deal and so frowned on! Because there are a dozen ways that you don't have to! At least that is part of my harry potter head canon on the unforgivables and why azkaban is even a thing, and in my head canon or maybe canon, only murderers and torturers go to azkaban.

Doing anything else than full strength is just giving the enemy an unfair advantage.\\

The wizarding population is /tiny./ Britain all together is only about 3000 wizards. They can't kill them, they need them.

This is also why the wizarding government has always been so lax on allowing former dark wizards to exist alongside the rest of society- they just can't survive without them.
