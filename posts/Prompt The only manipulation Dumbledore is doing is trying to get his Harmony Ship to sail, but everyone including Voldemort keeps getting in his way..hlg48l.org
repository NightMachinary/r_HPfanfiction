The Wesleys are avid Hinny Shippers. Minerva wants Harmony as well so she's thoroughly on his side. Fillius is firmly in camp Huna, Pomona is a Husan shipper while Severus doesn't care (though is trying to push his Haphne ship on the side, Dumbledore sees through Snape's bullshit.)

Sirius is the biggest problem he's on team Honks and is the person Harry is most likely to listen to, while Remus is firmly in Dumbledores pocket...now if only Voldemort would stop trying to push Harry/Draco...

He remembers suddenly of some stupid TV show his cousin used to watch and now it doesn't appear so stupid anymore as inspiration strucks him.

Hermione, Luna , Susan and Ginny were going on with their everyday lives when suddenly they were whisked away by a flash of white light.

Draco and Daphne suddenly disappeared from the Slytherin common room, kidnapped by the same strange light.

Tonks was just completing her shifts before going home when she disappeared, along with Oliver Wood leaving only his broom hovering mid-air much to his teammates stupor.

When all of them appeared back somewhere the first thing they noticed was Harry Potter, standing in a suit in the middle of this beautiful garden, a Rose between his teeth. "Wha-" someone started questioning but they were interrupted as an hominous voice greeted them out of the blue.

** The most awaited staff meeting of the year was going on, and it was all according to plan for Albus Dumbledore, he even managed to thwart Dolores from interfering, a very powerful Confundus made her think it was Friday instead of Saturday, so now she was teaching an empty classroom(The Elder Wand was truly without equal).

But he considered this a small victory compared to the others, he received confirmation that Harry and Miss. Granger had left the grounds before lunch to Hogsmeade, Mr. Weasley having other plans with one Miss Brown. (he barely had to push for this one)

It was all going well this last month, a few chosen words, some comments, and Harry had spent many afternoons with Miss Granger, as far he knew they had only studied but he knew some youth were oblivious like that, especially Harry who had just recently shown interest in females.

He smiled to himself while seating in the still empty room, he had outmaneuvered his entire staff, yes through their efforts, Harry had established a close friendship with Misses Lovegood and Bones, and some weird rivalry/friendship with Miss Greengrass, but Miss Granger was his best friend, no one could beat that advantage.

Minerva was the first to enter, she looked happy, but he saw some concern in her eyes, perhaps she thought it was too soon? But before he could think further, Pomona followed her in, her expression was neutral, but when her eyes met the Headmaster's she huffed, and went to sit, as far away from him and Minerva as she could.

He struggled to keep a genial smile in, it would probably offend her.

Filius followed them, greeting Albus with a shrug and a self-deprecating smile, always a sportsman that one.

Albus waited with bated breath for the other Head of House, the one who pretended to be above such 'games' but Dumbledore knew he was playing like a Slytherin, putting Harry to partner with Miss Greengrass in all his classes, and in detention whenever he could.

Of course, Harry's charming personality formed a friendship with the personable Miss Greengrass, and Albus could certainly see Harry found her attractive, but Miss Granger had been his friend for too long, perhaps without his own interference it would have happened, but alas, Albus was far more experienced(and had a lot more rapport with Harry).

He was alarmed then, when Severus appeared with a /gleam/ in his eyes, not exactly the gleam of victory but a mocking one, what had happened? The students hadn't returned yet, but he was sure Harry had left with Miss Granger.

Dumbledore called the meeting to order, and tea was served, but before he could rile them up with inanities(no one questioned Delores not being here, they always found a way to avoid her), Pomona placed her cup back on the saucer with a bit more strength.

"Oh, Albus let's skip the pleasantries, we all know why we are all here, can we get this done early? Susan must be devastated"

Snape couldn't stop himself "Perhaps she wouldn't be if you hadn't filled her head with impossibilities"

"Impossibilities? Oh, please Severus, we all know that for all you say about this, you have an interest in it too, detention for talking in the corridor too loudly, and always partnering them up so 'her skill could nullify his ineptness' " she huffed "We all know Mr. Potter likes redheads anyway, so it would never work."

Filius cleared his throat "Er, actually Pomona, I have it on good authority that Mr. Potter prefers blondes"

Albus had his suspicions but even he followed the rest of the heads in looking at Filius with interest, so much so he barely noticed Severus nodding as if to confirm something.

"And how would you know that, Filius?" Minerva asked, the concern in her eyes increasing by an order of magnitude.

"Why, Luna always says how he compliments her on her silvery blonde hair" his smile dimmed a little "it always lifts her spirits," he said in an undertone and Albus noted in his mind to speak to him later about Miss Lovegood's treatment in his house, Harry and some of his friends had been shielding her lately, but Albus swore he would make it so they wouldn't need to.

Pomona glared "Mr. Potter always has a kind word for his friends, this could mean nothing" she turned her glare to Albus "Apparently he likes brown hair too" completely missing Minerva blanching and whispering "/Silvery?/"

Filius nodded "I am just saying it wasn't impossible, but clearly we have been outplayed" he glanced at Dumbledore "and as agreed, from here on out, no interference, who knows, teenage love can be...fickle."

Pomona huffed again but nodded, but she knew Susan was interested so maybe when they matured.

Minerva was pursing her lips, glancing at Snape and then Dumbledore, who was beginning to get concerned, but before he could announce their 'victory', Snape snorted and looked at all present with a mocking sneer.

"You are right Filius, we've been outplayed" he looked at Albus and grinned"/All/ of us" Minerva deflated, while Dumbledore was confused, "We have a saying in Slytherin" he continued, "the unseen dagger is the one that hurts the most."

Pomona looked at Minerva, who shook her head, not Miss Weasley then.

"Severus, I know Miss Tonks is out of the country, and she was very offended at Sirius' suggestion, she sees Harry as a little brother."

Snape looked at all the occupants in the room, seeing the tension in some increase, but decided to end it before tempers could rise. He turned to the Headmaster, wanting to see his reaction.

"Tell me, Albus do you know what Miss Granger has been tutoring Potter in these last few weeks?" when Dumbledore answered negatively,(he valued their privacy in that, at least) Snape sneered "According to Miss Greengrass he asked for her help too, which she was happy to provide, apparently it's something both her and Miss Granger are good at."

Filius was thinking quickly, and Dumbledore was reaching other conclusions, Minerva just looked defeated and Pomona confused.

"Runes? Spellcraft?" Filius blurted, probably fishing for the real answer.

Snape continued looking at Dumbledore while answering, drawing pleasure from the dawning realization on the older man's eyes "No, Filius, both Miss Granger, and Miss Greengrass are fluent in /French."/

Pomona dropped her cup, shattering it, Minerva sighed mournfully, while Filius' eyes widened, he then laughed and slapped the table.

"Ha! Beaten before the game began."

But Dumbledore was speechless, he knew Harry was exchanging more letters than normal, but he just thought it was due to his bigger friendship circle(he only checked Miss Grangers and Mr. Weasley's letters so they wouldn't be revealing of Order business), he never checked for /international/ letters.

As if summoned, a beautiful and regal white owl appeared, dropping a letter in front of Dumbledore, his heart fell when he recognized the seal, Beauxbaton's.

The letter contained a note and another envelope but Dumbledore chose to read the note first.

/My Dear Dumbledore,/

/In matters of love, the French are always one step ahead./

/From Paris with love,/

*** Cont.

Albus opened the envelope, now noticing his staff was looking at him with uncommon intensity, he took one look at each wizard photo, before throwing them down the table, face down, as one folds a losing hand in poker, his feeling was certainly similar.

The other Heads of House looked at the pictures, Snape snorted and shook his head, Pomona sighed but smiled, the same thing for Minerva, while Filius cheered subtly.

One picture showed a very happy Harry Potter, with his arm around a very happy looking Fleur Delacour, both of them smiling with flushed cheeks in front of the Three Broomsticks.

Another showed them inside the pub, that was without it's customary tables and chairs, apparently turning it's interior in an improvised ballroom, inside which the couple(for it was undeniable what they were) was happily /dancing/, holding one another /very/ close, there were other couples, among them...

"Is that Mr. Longbottom and Miss Granger?" Dumbledore could hear the smile in Pomona's face "I can actually live with that! Go, Neville!" the boy looked happy, if a bit nervous but Miss Granger was smiling happily, and Dumbledore couldn't stop himself, noticing the proud look in Minerva's eyes.

The third picture was of Harry presenting something to Miss Delacour, a box from which she removed a very beautiful necklace, with a good-sized sapphire adorning it.

"That was his grandmother's" Minerva smiled "His grandfather gave it to her, when...well..."

The fourth photo was turned, eliciting gasps, and a muttering of 'Potters' from Snape, the picture looked to have been taken from a hidden position, and very soon after the last one, it showed Harry and Miss Delacour kissing rather passionately, and when they separated Miss Delacour was hugging him and repeating something over and over.

'Je t'aime' Dumbledore was always good at reading lips(and French), and Severus too by the slight curling of his lips.

The fifth and final picture was turned with a combination of resignation and contentment, and it answered a few questions, it showed Harry and Fleur sitting in a bench, smiling happily with arms around each other, and behind them with arms over both their shoulders and a smiling face over theirs, was a very pleased looking Gabrielle Delacour, who had the audacity to look at the camera and /wink/.

Pomona clapped her hands "Well, beaten by a child, this feels like 1991 all over again."

Minerva and Filius chuckled while Snape snorted, the defeated(but also pleased by Harry's happiness) Heads of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff left after finishing their tea, with promises of having their real meeting on Monday(Filius was designated to Delores duty), leaving only Snape and Dumbledore who were looking each other in the eyes, Severus nodded, turned and left.

-----

Alternate Tropey Ending

Before leaving Severus had some parting words.

"It's over Albus, you've lost," Snape said.

"Why Severus, we both know Sirius isn't planning on marrying and the deleterious effects of long term exposure to Azkaban."

Snape curled his lips "Granger seems to be happy with Longbottom."

Dumbledore frowned "I would /never/ think of it," but "there's Miss Weasley, she would be able to take the Black name"

Now Snape /grinned/, "Molly Weasley would never accept it, /but,/ Miss Greengrass already has, it's just a matter of time."

"Harry..."

"The French girl is a pureblood too, Miss Greengrass is very persuasive and," he sneered, "blonde."

Albus steepled his fingers and pursed his lips "Well then, old friend, I believe the game is still on then."

***** The alternate ending is just for fun, I think it would really detract from the story.

I find it much better to have all the teens mostly oblivious, with the two favorites(Hermione and Daphne) actually helping Harry communicate and court Fleur(Daphne taught him how to dance and Hermione helped him choose the necklace). Maxime just enabled Gabrielle and Fleur, in large part because she wanted Fleur to be happy, and in a smaller part because she wanted to gloat to Dumbledore.

I didn't include Voldemort because I couldn't place him in the flow, but I don't think it fits his character at all, but he would probably be going about it all the wrong ways because he knows zilch about love, Draco would actually be seriously reconsidering his loyalties.

**** For extra tropey silliness, erase the Hermione with Neville part and have Professor Binns show up out of the blue at the end of the meeting (possibly him instead of the Beauxbatons owl), revealing that he's been hinting to Harry about some old pureblood laws (that Hermione and Daphne helped him research) which basically allow Harry to create a harem... bonus points if you throw in such a silly reference as Hermione's favorite childhood bedtime story being 1001 Arabian Nights ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3635811/1/Hermione-the-Harem-Girl][Hermione the Harem Girl]]) resulting in her jumping on board faster than any of the purebloods could, so technically everyone both wins and loses the pot all at once.

********** Mad-Eye sighed. While he was an accomplished man, he was never proud. He had no problems getting his hands dirty, doing the hard job that needed to be done. But he was flummoxed. Never before had he delt with grown-ass men trying to set up teenagers before.

It should surprise no-one that Moody had developed additional anti-polyjuice techniques. He had discovered his protege halfway undressed with a boy who looked like, but was very much not Harry Potter. After some minutes of calming his distressed student, he ascertained that she had been prompted on by one Sirius Black. This in itself was not overly concerning. The man was unstable from his time at Azkaban and a godfather arranging a match was not unheard of .

After a well deserved chewing out of Tonks (she had, after all, not been aware of what Sirius was planning. A bit more Vigilance and she could have avoiding being unknowingly used.) He used the situation as an opportunity to teach her some interrogation techniques.

What he learned from one not Harry Potter was distressful. He was quickly able to rescue a very confused Harry from what seemed to be very polite Slytherins insistent on keeping Harry until the ministry passes a new law. In his many years, Moody had learned Slytherins waiting for a new ministry law was never a good omen.

After stashing Harry in a safehouse, Moody had reached out to Dumbledore, who somehow mistook his inquiry about Harry as part of a celebration planning. He still didn't know what a Bungaloo was, but he quickly disengaged from the conversation and reached out to his feelers in the underworld. After all, there had to be done reason so many of them were obsessed with the love life of a fifthteen year old, even if that fifthteen year old was the boy who lived. A prophecy perhaps, that his lover shall rule the world?

What he learned was downright disturbing. While he found no prophecy, apparently there were multiple factions of *teachers* at Hogwarts trying to set the boy up. Even ignoring Hagrids stangly sweet, but totally ineffective attempts to buy Harry some alone time with a "Noberta", at least four other factions in Hogwarts had various plans for the boy. Two of them had even offered Mad-Eye to join the plot!

Worse, apparently Voldemort was trying to set up Draco Malfoy with Harry Potter. Moody was unable to get concrete details (nor any inclination from Potter he wanted to do anything with Malfoy but turn him into a ferret and cook ferret stew), but the mere interest from the dark lord shot this to the top of Moody's priority list.

The person duplication spell was, of course, highly illegal. While it was not a forgivable, it effectively created another legal entity, something generally frown upon by the wizarding courts. Mad-Eye never cared about getting his hands dirty, but if this was important enough for Dumbledore and Voldemort to be personally involved, not to mention getting their loyal flunkies to actively work against them, it was not something to be left to chance.

The boy was never aware of the magic, he slipped each new Potter off to his awaiting date without them ever seeing each other. The Slytherins never questioned the return of their captive, the Weasley Harry visiting the burrow after Mad-Eyed rescue, or Dumbledore his delivery of Harry to McGonagall for suit shopping. All told, he created 14 cloned of Harry, and shipped them out to various plots. He personally rented a private room for Tonks and his 'rescued" charge. The original he set up an anonymous meeting with the Malfoy scion, winking at the kid and telling him that he had Mad-Eyes full support for /whatever/ he wanted to do.

Mad-Eye didn't know if this was the best path forward. He did know he did not want to be stuck with another idiotic prophecy or something similar.

Moody smiled. He always smiled at a job well done

xyxyxyxyxy

Albus visiting Moody was a strange happening indeed. Although the two had known each other for decades, it was almost always Moody that called on Albus, not the other way around.

After the necessary greetings, Albus dived right in.

"What the hell did you do Alastair" he asked, in a manner most unfit for one of his stations.

"I don't know what you mean Albus. You need to be more specific" he returned, not willing to give Albus free ground.

"You know exactly what I mean, old friend. What did you do to Harry Potter" Albus retorted, with fire in his voice.

Moody just shrugged. "There seemed to be so many plots swirling around the boy, for no sensible reason. I figured I would trigger them all, and see where the chips landed.

"I see", said Albus, "You forgot one crucial fact, Alastair".

Moody rarely liked when the conversation went down paths similar to this. Dispite his indication to continue, Albus just stood there with a twinkle in his eye till Moody broke down and asked.

"You forgot the girls. They evidently shared notes and found out Harry was being thrust on all of them, often being in two places at once.

This was bad, of course. Potter might resent the unapproved creation of his clones/siblings, and in his anger leave the various traps set for him untriggered.

"The Harry you set up with Mafloy triggered it all" Albus continued, ignoring the distress on his friends face. Malfoy was seen fleeing the country, muttering about Potter and impossible proportions. This caught miss Grangers eye, who convinced her Ball date to each out. Once the two Harry's had found each other, they were quickly able to round up the rest, rescuing them from whatever plans await them."

"Err," said Mad-Eye, "Was he mad at having clones?". /Or/ Moody left unsaid /is he livid about the adults and dark lords interfering with his love life/

"Not at all", said Albus joyfully "In fact, I have this note":

/Thanks for the rescue Moody/ the note said /but we plan to forge our own path/

"What the hell does that mean, Albus" Moody started. "And how does he know of my involvement".

Albus grinned a slightly evil grin that was misplaced on his gentle face. "I'm afraid young Nymphadora was able to recognize your handywork. Miss Granger was able to find a solution to the Potter's problems, and they had Susan deliver an application for a Potter only Coven directly to her Aunt, avoiding any attempt at cooler heads to stop it.

"A Potter only Coven?" Muttered Moody, "But don't Covens need both male and female members?"

"Ahh" responded Albus, "Did you know young Daphne is quite the Potions protege? She was able to brew under the radar at the request of the Potters. 8 of the 15 Harry's is now female. I understand they settled it in a very disturbing game of Quidditch."

Albus shook his head "As a bound coven, I am afraid they are pretty much untouchable for now. Do you know the trouble you caused Alastair?"

Signing, Albus reached down to adjust his socks. "I trust you will appear before the Wizengamot why we now have a Potter Coven?"

********** Okay, this is my too-late, tryhard contribution to the thread:

The Dark Lord sat on his throne and twirled his wand about in his long, thin fingers. His gathered Death Eaters watched him nervously.

Finally he said, ‚ÄúWe are not as disadvantaged as you may believe. Black has showed us his hand. And he knows it. He will now keep trying, relentlessly, to ensnare his godson once and for all into a pairing of his choice by appealing to his teenage lust. Thus, we must-‚Äù

The Death Eaters looked at one another and began to speculate among themselves on what exactly they must. They stopped when their master said, ‚ÄúSilence! One does not interrupt Lord Voldemort while he speaking. Rather, one waits patiently to hear him give his Brilliant Evil Plan. One does not speculate as they realize that their minds are not capable of conceiving a plan even half so ingenious and dastardly as-‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not, my lord!‚Äù

‚ÄúTerribly sorry, my lord!‚Äù

‚ÄúWon't happen again, my-‚Äú

‚Äú/Avada Kedavra!/‚Äù

The last Death Eater who spoke toppled over dead. Voldemort cleared his throat, ‚ÄúNow, if you're quite done, I was saying that we must beat Black at his own game, and we must act quickly before Snape or Dumbledore are able to manipulate. Fortunately, we have a unique advantage which-‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it our cheddar soup, m'lord?‚Äù

‚Äú/What/?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was just thinkin', the ‚Äòouse elves ‚Äòere sure do cook up a good cheddar soup, probably gooder even than anything that Black can cook up I'd reckon, so ‚Äòs far ‚Äòs advantages go-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Crabbe. I was not referring to the superior quality of our cheddar soup when I speak of an advantage. I was referring to the direct link I possess between my mind and the mind of the Potter boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. That makes loads more sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you see what I mean? Lord Voldemort. Much sharper mind. Now, given my connection with the boy, I believe it is possible, thanks to Bellatrix's prodding of a defective house elf who's spent a lengthy amount of time around the Order headquarters, to directly implant a particular image on the boy's-‚Äù

‚ÄúWill it be an image of our cheddar soup, your lordliness?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor God's sake, Goyle. You and Crabbe, why don't you go bother the kitchen elves if you're so hungry. I'd AK the both of you right now, but frankly it's not worth the effort of lifting my arm all the way out of my lap, where it's perched so comfortably.‚Äù

The two friends scurried off down the staircase, stepping over Bellatrix, who'd fainted upon hearing her Beloved Master speak her name.

‚ÄúAny more soup related questions? Good. Now, as I was saying, I will implant a vision upon the boy while he is in a vulnerable state, it will be particularly easy now that it is night and he doubtless soon be sleeping. We will need an image so sexy and appealing that the boy's hormone-addled teenaged mind will force him to dive right in and swim directly for our ship. It will be an image so suggestive and so irresistible that no amount of Yule Balls and Auror Shaggings and Polyjuice Kinkery will be able to win him back over to our enemy's OTP of choice. Draco!‚Äù

The pale blond boy jumped and hurried forward to face his master. ‚ÄúY-y-y-y-yes, m-m-m-my l-l-‚Äú

‚ÄúYou will obviously be the focal point of my little project. Go down to your basement and await me there. Wormtail! Can I trust you to set the scene and gather the props?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, my lord. I don't mean to brag, but I took a film class in my 6th and 7th year and-‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don't need to hear about how you had to take Muggle classes for NEWTs after failing all your OWLs. Off with you! I assigned you a role!‚Äù Seeing his minions scramble to carry out his wishes, a deeply satisfied smile spread across the Dark Lord's face. He loved to see his infallible plans come to fruition.

--------------

In the Gryffindor 5th-year boys Dormitory, Harry Potter woke with a deathly scream. He didn't think the sight of Draco Malfoy sporting a pair of lacy lingerie and batting his eyelashes up at him was something he would ever forget.

But it couldn't hurt to try. Harry swiped his wand from his bedside table and conjured a bottle of bleach from thin air. He caught it, unscrewed the lid, and opened his eyes as if he were about to apply contact lenses...

An even louder chorus of screams woke the rest of his dormmates up. But strangely, it seemed to the boys that there was an undertone of great relief to his shrieks of agony.

‚ÄúAh, bloody hell,‚Äù groaned Ron. ‚ÄúWhy didn't I think to siphon some love potion into that? Gotta think quicker, Weasley. The Great Ship War is going on!‚Äù He yanked the covers up, still muttering to himself dejectedly as he fell back asleep.
