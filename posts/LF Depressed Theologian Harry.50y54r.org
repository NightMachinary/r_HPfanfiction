This is a bit of a long shot I think, but I'm looking for a fic I remember reading in about 2007 (if not earlier), which I'm fairly sure was posted on livejournal. It was an AU with no magic, and the general thrust of it was that Harry and Draco were (I think) college room mates. Harry was studying theology under Dumbledore and spent a lot of the time struggling with the idea of Theodicy (the whole God abandoning humanity concept). I'm fairly sure that Ron, Theo Nott, and either Hermione or Luna were supporting characters.


** This sounds interesting hope someone knows it

*** Yeah, I tried that extensively, plus actually searching lj itself. Think that probably means it's gone for good :(
