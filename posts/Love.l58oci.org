Harry doesn't have or believe in emotions.

His first reaction to people getting mad about losing points is to ask quillen for spells that can hurt the other kids cause "People don't listen to words they listen to conciquences."

When Albus tries to guilt trip Harry and talks about some bullshit about love Harry says:

"Peace is a lie tyrants use to keep their pawns in line. Guilt is a tool for the weak to control the strong. Love is a lie parents tell the mistakes they make. No ones life matters except your own." Harry says. "Freaks like us aren't born with the right to exist like normal people. Vernon taught me that."

Albus is so shocked at this that Harry just goes back to his dorm.
