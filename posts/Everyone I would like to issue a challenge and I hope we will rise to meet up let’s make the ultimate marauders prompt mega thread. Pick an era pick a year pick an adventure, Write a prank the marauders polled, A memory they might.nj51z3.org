A joke a laugh a heart wrenching exciting adventure Let's travel down the rabbit hole and follow the map where their footsteps might have been perhaps James serious Remus and Peter climbed the astronomy tower and had a few butter beers maybe they turned the great Hall stone floor into one giant mirror so the enchanted ceiling reflected back on itself somehow creating an internal storm that lasted a week until Dumbledore could fix it. Perhaps right of Lily and James The first time he asked her out and perhaps the last when she finally said yes let's turn this into a mega prompt

​

Let's give the marauders a bit more of a story just pick a one shot pick a moment and Write a small one shot or some thing about it can be a paragraph or a small story let's build a cannon around the characters a bit. Just for a bit of a laugh in honor of the legendary pranksters of Hogwarts
