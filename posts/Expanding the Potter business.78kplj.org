Hi folks, I am looking for well-written stories where Harry invests time in reviving Potter/Black business and expanding it to the non-magical side as well. The last story that ventures into this I've read was Core Threads, linkffn(10136172).


** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), does a reasonably good job in having Harry developing a business empire, and it's a key plot element. This Harry had spent several years in the Starwars Universe while the time in his original universe passed far more slowly, so he gained a significant competitive advantage when putting SW technologies against those puny Earthly ones.

In its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), he, Hermione, and Luna ended up in the Stargate Universe. Despite them possessing both Force and Magical powers, they still faced an uphill battle, as Goa'ulds and Ori were more than a match for them.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

*** On the other hand, very few time travels exploit the option of making a killing in Muggle financial markets.

The only ones I know are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855;10871795). Even then those actions are only marginally mentioned.

I made a thread about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t1jum/hermione_was_thrown_back_25_years_to_1976_what/][Hermione time travel to the 70s]] a few months ago. Apart from all the actions she could take against Voldemort directly in Britain, she could also settle in the US and play the financial markets there. This way she would have minimized her impacts on Magical Britain and let events there play out in a more expected fashion, while building a massive private army using some of her profits in America. She might as well create a new reputation as the “Dark Lady of Harvard”.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
