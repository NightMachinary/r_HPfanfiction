** Before reading: This updating has made my day.

After reading: Aw hell yes. We got a view of Fleur/Bill which was very nice to see. Some Evelyn magic. Weird goblin Medjai stuff. DESERT ACROMANTULA. And I think Ardeth Bay cameo? Aw. Hell. Yiss.

I think this is rising towards the top of my highly informal, unwritten, favorite crossovers list.

**** Well, my body is definitely ready for any and all future updates to this story. There's something about this fic that makes me think waaaaaaaaaaay back to when I was about 7 years old, reading PS/SS for the first time. Whimsical, yet serious. The magic feels organic, the prose does what it is meant to nearly perfectly.

[[/spoiler][I can't fucking wait to see what is going to happen in Hamunaptra, and how the fact that Bill is a wizard instead of a muggle French Foreign Legion veteran changes how Ardeth Bay handles everything.]]
