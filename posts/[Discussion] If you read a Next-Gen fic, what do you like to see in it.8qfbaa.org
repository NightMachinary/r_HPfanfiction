Now, I know the majority of people prefer ignoring the epilogue, but if you /do/ happen to enjoy Next-Gen stories, what do you like to see in them?

P.S.: This story completely disregards the Play-Which-Shall-Not-Be-Named.


** How they live under the shadows of their famous and successful parents

How they treat children of their parents' enemies

How they deal with real or imaginary threats

How they interact with the rapidly advancing/changing Muggle world

How they become their own person

** Definitetly dealing with the fame of their parents is one of my favourite aspects of many Next-Gen stories.

I also like them being their own people and not just mere imitations of their parents. Additionally, their years at Hogwarts should be their own thing rather than just a Harry Potter repeat.

They should have friends outside of each other as I personally think it's a bit boring to have only their relatives as friends. I think that they should have some form of conflict with some of the members of their wider family as well.

An improved Ministry, expansion on the wider world and magic is also something I prefer.

**** I have read a couple of Next-Gen stories that weren't exactly original in plot as they had a new Voldemort type character with similar plotlines to the original books (mystical artifacts hidden in the school and so forth).

***** Ah, I thought so. Well the villain I have planned is /not/ Voldemort 2.0. So no: here's the new teacher, here's the mystery, now let's muck around until Voldemort shows up.

** I don't see why you can't have a next gen story and ignore bits of the epilogue.That being said, what I would like to see is if they feel the weight of the world's expectation. How have their parent's dealt with that. Some rich kids know they can get away with anything because of who their fathers are and go off the rails. Some, like the royal family have the importance of who they are drilled into them and tend to be respectful people. Could a parent hide their past from their own children? Do the kids know what to expect?

** Id like one were they don't have Albus and Scorpio fucking in the second chapter. I swear to god 90% of Next-Gen Fanfics always pair them together.

** No overprotective parents! We are talking about a generation that fought a war and that can lead to that (wanting to protect your kids from having to go through that!), but I for one HATE overprotective helicopter parents (who at worst spy on their kids and make them wear GPS tags (a tracking charm in HP), have spy-software on their devices (PC, laptop, tablet, cellphone etc.) and block websites they don't agree with and (even worse) search their kid's room, schoolbag etc. regularly...etc. etc. (add other NSA-Spook things here, like going through people's trash etc.!)) with a passion and would love to deport them all to an island where they can spend each day spying on each other (note: I'd keep the kids here!) so that they feel watched, judged etc. all the time (and learn that this is not ok and that even kids have a right to privacy! I mean if a kid trusts you, then said kid will come to you if it faces problems it can't handle by itself!)

Good romances (maybe even some that piss the parents off!), some danger and mystery (and no parents coming to the rescue all the time!).

Also: Disagreements with the parents (I'd love a kid who knows everything their parents did during the war and disagrees with them on the how and maybe even on the why! Example: A kid of Harry that thinks their 'crux-hunt with the tent is the stupidest idea ever, especially in a world with the fidelius charm and other concealment spells! Hell a kid that thinks Voldemort wasn't so wrong (disagreeing with what he did maybe, but not why he did it and not with his end-goals!) would also be cool!)

ps: Ich habe fertig :) (translation: I am done) - Sadly I haven't seen many (if any) good next-gen fanfiction (especially since I kind of dislike that the old "heroes" kind of get the Luke Skywalker treatment - "Out with the old, in with the new and if we have to kill "the past" in order to do it!"...not to mention that I think them marrying that early and having kids is so unrealistic (especially for someone like Hermione! She's muggleborn and most of us muggles don't have kids till we are in our thirties (if at all! I mean I myself don't have any and don't want any either!))

** I have been working on a Next-Gen fic for many years now, and I write James as stuggling to live up to his father's reputation. I think it's interesting to see how parentage affects how the kids act and their relationships with other people and how they are treated.

I like to acknowledge the Epilogue as a base for the newly introduced characters, and have elected to ignore the Cursed Play.

*** I've never understood why people focus on Al because it would be /James/ who would be feeling the most pressure. Based on the Epilogue, both he and Lily are forced into boxes where they're expected to be their namesakes. Al, on the other hand, is allowed to be himself. This story, while told from his POV, won't actually about /him/. I also ignore all information published after DH and sorted the kids based on the characteristics presented in the Epilogue, so Al is definitely /not/ in Slytherin. The only thing I take from CC is that Harry is distant from his other children and focuses most of his attention on Al because we got hints of that in the Epilogue, too.

**** I agree. I always wondered why Albus was the one who was cursed and not James, him being the eldest. I know a lot of people do stick him in that box of being like his grandfather, but very few develop him into a three dimensional character with actual human feelings, rather than presenting him as just an arrogant arsehole, with a crush on a girl he can't get.
