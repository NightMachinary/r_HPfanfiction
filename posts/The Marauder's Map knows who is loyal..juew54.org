I remember there being a post about this fic not too long ago, but I can't word the search correctly...

Anywho, The Marauders had a loyalty oath and the map tracks it. Sirius was still fine and good, Pettigrew's betrayal was known, and Remus was put on notice for turning his back for all those years.

This has been eating at me for a couple weeks now... Thanks.

  The fallout from the Dueling Club was worse than in Canon and leads to the release of one Sirius Black from Azkaban. And he is not amused. 1 SLASH couple.
