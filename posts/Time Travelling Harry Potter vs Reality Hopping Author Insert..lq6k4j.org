The basic idea behind this is that, for one reason or another, Harry Potter decides to send his soul/mind/consciousness/whatever back in time to his almost 11 year old body, and re-do his Hogwarts days, with the goal of changing how the future (his past) went. Only when he finally gets there, he encounters someone that he's never seen before, is absolutely certain wasn't there the first time, and seems to know too much about too many things for a First Year. What follows is a battle of wits as the two each seek to alter the course of history to their liking, with it becoming increasingly clear that their goals are mutually exclusive.


** Yooooooo this idea. Two tropes of hp fanfiction but they are vs each other. The funny thing would be self insert doesn't realize harry potter is a time traveler because he assumes all the changes are because of them and the butterfly effect making rippels in the time stream, while harry having managed to send his mind into his past self assumes SI is voldemort from an alternative future that did the same, possessed a body, and now has a new agenda, but can't prove it or expose his own time shenanigans.

Meanwhile the Unspeakables time division is going nuts because they have two competing timeline deviations and they can't figure out what's causing them just that they are happening, and they run around trying to find the source in wacky ways, since they are not the nexus of the changes and don't remember how events should unfold or how they unfolded the first time.
