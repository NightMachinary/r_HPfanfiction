I was wonderings if there are any fanfics where Harry is actually really excited about magic, and therefore wants to learn everything he can about it, it doesn't matter if it's considered dark, light or grey magic, he still wants to learn it all, and Where he always searches for something new to learn

â€‹

And Please no slash, Evil!Harry or heroic-I've-got-to-save-everybody Harry,


** In /The Mind Arts/ Harry wants to learn absolutely everything he can about magic and devotes essentially all of his time to it. linkffn(12740667)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** There was a fic I read where harry figured out how to change his hearts desire and used the Mirror of Erised to a ludicrous degree, ultimately losing interest in the rest of the world because all the information he could ever hope to find could be found through the mirror.

I cannot, for the life of me, think of enough unique information to actually find that fic, though.

**** I actually lost steam later. It basically becomes a book about a wizard no longer named Harry Potter who behaves OOC at a magic school that is very much not Hogwarts. It's okay, but it's just an original fic that had a first chapter that was fanfiction, and it didn't hold my interest as an original fic. Maybe it comes back around to familiar people and events, but it lost me.

******** While my first sentence might be understood as me condoning puppy torture, I think most people are able to understand from the rest of my comment that I merely have nothing against a fanfic containing puppy torture (or any torture at all, or murder, rape and whatever other bad things you can imagine) as long as those things aren't depicted in a positive light.

That I decided to write it in such a provocative manner is owed to the fact that /you/ made an equally outrageous claim that fanfics containing Bad Things shouldn't be recommended even when most fanfics contain murder and quite often worse.

From what I remember of my reading of Black Luminary, the puppy torture is performed by Bellatrix Lestrange, a character known to be deranged and quite possibly mentally ill. I think Harry might even make a mental note about how torturing puppies isn't so great, but it's been a while and I don't remember it very well.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
