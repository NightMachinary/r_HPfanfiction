I'd like to read about a Snape who doesn't try to humiliate his students, doesn't play favorites with the Slytherins, doesn't take house points off people/give detention for no reason, and doesn't try to poison their pets like a sadistic asshole. Do any stories exist where he's helpful and encouraging to Neville or where he gives Hermione the points she deserves for answering his questions right?


** Yup, the series starting with Innocent by Mauraderlover7 on fanfic. Sirius gets to raise Harry and she develops everyone really well. Especially Snape. He is still himself but he is way better and way more developed. Its absolutely worth a read.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.
