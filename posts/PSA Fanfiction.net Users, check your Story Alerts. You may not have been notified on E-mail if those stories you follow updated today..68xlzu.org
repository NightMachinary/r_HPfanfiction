There seems to be an error at the moment with Story Alerts on Fanfiction.net. They may not show up on your e-mail if new chapters have been published today. The same can be said if you published a chapter of your own.

I updated a chapter for a story of mine, and it hasn't shown up on my e-mail like it usually does. Also I checked my Story Alerts on my profile, and three other stories I follow updated today, but I didn't get an e-mail for them.


** TEARS none of them. For a moment, I had so much hope.

** I noticed this for linkffn(Lady Archimedes) but I just assumed that the emails took some time to go out.

** I can add some information. The last Chapter Alert I received was 11:24PM EDT on May 1. However, I've received two Story Alerts since then.

Only one of the stories I'm following has /actually/ updated since that time. (The rest must have wised up and stopped.) When I clicked that story and then clicked "Follow/Fav", it said I was not following the story, even though it's still in my follow list.

** I have received a few story alerts but no new chapters alerts. Is this the same for everyone else?
