I don't know if this is the right place for this and I'm really sorry if it's not.

Anyway I'm having some writers block and am in the mood to write some Harry Potter fanfiction. So I was wondering if anyone would care to give me a list of writing prompts that specifically take place in either second year or third. Preferably focusing on the main trio. Can be a what if this event went differently in the books or like something that could've been explored but wasn't. I just need some ideas to get the ball rolling.

Thanks!


** This certainly is the correct place for it, there are prompts posted here quite regularly.

1. "You must realize Mr. Potter that if she lives then so do I. Our souls are too far bound. In order to kill me you must kill her. Lower the fang Harry."

Harry has a choice whether to kill Ginny or not. Forging the Sword took this one direction, I think it would be intriguing to see someone take it another direction; Harry is unable to kill Ginny and Lord Voldemort returns early.

1. Sirius Black sees Hermione with the time turner, and attempts to steal it, killing her in the process.

2. Peter Pettigrew, upon learning of Sirius in the castle takes preemptive action, rather than just cowering in fear. This could either be him wrecking havoc in Hogwarts to cover his escape from the castle, or taking action to expose Sirius to the staff before he can tell his story.

3. Dumbledore is petrified. Lucius is now unopposed politically and wreaks havoc.

** Hmm... I had an idea while I was reading The Silence of the Lambs, which I don't think I'll ever write. So I'll put it out here and see if anyone's interested in taking it up or twisting it in their own direction.

Voldemort's Horcruxes are all dead bodies of people who he loved, hated or had some strong emotion for. Essentially, he's a psychopathic murderer who uses corpses as his trophies. I thought it would fit a crime/mystery type story, and the Trio go on a detective hunt by studying cold cases where they could never find the killer and places where Voldemort could stash the bodies. Bonus points if the Horcruxes can act, move and think for themselves (while still being loyal to Voldemort). Could be interesting to see how the Chamber of Secrets goes if instead of a diary Horcrux being smuggled in, one of Voldemort's corpse-Horcruxes masquerades as a first year and Harry is confronted with the choice of stabbing not a book, but a Horcrux that looks like an innocent, eleven-year-old child.

** "I didn't know you enjoyed reading so much." She said. Harry ducked his head, just a hint of red on his cheeks.

"I... yes... I like to read loads," He replied softly. "Just, I like to read for me. If Ron knew he'd be Ron about it. If Hermione knew... Well I wouldnt be reading for me anymore I think."

Padma smiled at him. Harry's cheeks reddened a touch more.

"That's lovely Harry. Are there any books you might recommend?
