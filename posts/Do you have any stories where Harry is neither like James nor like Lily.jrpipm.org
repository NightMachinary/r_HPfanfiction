He doesn't like Quidditch, is mediocre at flying, is average at Transfiguration, Charms and Potions and doesn't like pranks

I would like a Harry who is interested in astronomy, history, art and music. Or has interest in muggle classes like Chemistry, Biology and Psychology.

Who is socially awkward, mostly likes to be to himself and sometimes even seems rather cold because he doesn't show his emotions freely. A Harry who doesn't like hurting others but will rip apart anyone who dares to hurt his friends.

Basically, I want an INFP Harry.


** So you basically describing the book and movies.

1.His best subject is DADA, something neither his parents are mentioned being good at. 2. He is a seeker not a chaser like his father. 3. He literally only has 2 (could maybe include Neville as well) friends he hangs out with up until halfway throught the 5th book. Again its unclear if Lilly was popular considering she was best friends with Snape. 4. He is the definition of socially awkward being either hated by his entire school most years or seen as a celebrity figure the rest of the time.

** The Harry from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal]] is pretty different.
