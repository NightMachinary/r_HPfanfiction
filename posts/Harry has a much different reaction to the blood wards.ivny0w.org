“So you are saying... that you created this wards based on my mother's sacrifice to extend the protection to the Dursley's... and this was why they took me in” Asked Harry in a monotone voice.

“Yes, Mr. Potter, so, you see, while you live with your family and call the place home the protection your mother gave you will protect all four of you from harms causes by the magical world, now I understand that comin-“

“Take them off” mumbled Harry distracted.

Silence, for once Dumbledore was caught by surprise. He surely must have misunderstood what Harry was saying. Though as he looked at Harry's darkening face he had some doubts.

“I beg your pardon? I think my old ears are playing tricks on me, I thought you said-“

“*TAKE. THEM. OFF!*” the only surviving Potter suddenly roared in fury.

“Mr. Potter, surely you are not-“ gasped Dumbledore.

“For TEN YEARS the Dursley's have treated me like crap and talked about how much I cost them. *TEN. *YEARS**! And you tell me that my being there was protecting them” and then Harry started to laugh uncontrollably. Dumbledore worried patted him on the shoulder awkwardly not knowing what else to do.

“Now Harry I know you may not have the best of the relationships with your family, but you must see that-“

“I see that they are *not* my family and that that place is not, never was and *never* will be a home” Harry spat venomously. “Whatever atrocities, torture or *whatever* comes their way they bloody well */deserve it/*, I will not in anyway protect them!” At this point Harry was gasping for breath “so you may as well just tear down those wards and we'll see what happens.” The emotionally tired child finished while laying back in bed.

“Mr. Potter- Harry” started Dumbledore gently “while you may not want to extend the protection to your aunt's family” said the Headmaster delicately while avoiding calling the Dursleys Harry's family “doing so also extends your own protections, this was what allowed you to survive Quirrel in your first year, tearing down the wards would leave you exposed to Voldemort.”

“Don't care” Said Harry “I prefer to take my chances with Voldemort than dealing with those /creatures/”

Dumbledore only could watch hopeless, because despite all his knowledge and spells in the end the protection Lily guaranteed her son -protection that only lasted more than a few hours due to the boy's family- responded ultimately to it's charge, and as the young boy decided that the protections themselves were to be defended against the impossible wards he painstaking built turned against themselves. He knew that in Little Whining the wards were falling in cascade literally ripping the area they were set in and all inside it from the face of reality, but could do nothing to stop it or get there quickly enough to be of some help.

And looking at Harry he felt the pit on his stomach grow as his famous scar seemed to become more active, theories and conjecture painting a rather dire picture. And yet he could do nothing to protect him and /refused/ to sacrifice Harry to stop it.

For in the end the choice was Harry's. It had always been his, what was right or what was easy. And in a fit of resentment the boy from whom the world had taken so much, who had been pushed past what he could take...

He /choose/... and the world got a little bleaker because of it.

Just a little dabble that occurred to me, I imagine this conversation taking place on fifth year in the infirmary after Sirius death (maybe some of Harry's friends died and he got injured?) but made it in such a way that it could fit any moment after first year.

To clarify: Dumbledore is not being manipulative, he just was trying to do what he thought the best for everyone (including Harry himself) and didn't realize the damage his choices did. Harry /was/ being excessively angst and spiteful, he is a teen (being edgy is part of the package) and this is supposedly soon after a traumatic event, if he were with a clearer head he wouldn't have done it, sadly the blood wards (plus the Dursley's I guess) are gone and ain't gonna reform just because he changed his mind.


** Harry just looked at his Headmaster as if he was seeing him for the first time.

"So, the reason I had to go back /there/, was because of these protections, that extended to /them/ too?"

Dumbledore felt that maybe talking to him about this just as he returned from the Ministry may not have been the best idea.

"Yes, you see Harry, the wards, or enchantments, are based on your mother's protections, they use the blood you share with your aunt, and the fact you consider her house your home to charge them during summer."

There was the sound of glass breaking.

Harry's hands were trembling.

"Sir," Harry gulped, "do they work outside the house?"

Dumbledore frowned at the question, "I am afraid they are limited to the property."

A small device made of glass and metal exploded on one of the shelves.

"So...if one of /the Death Eaters/ tried to get me at the market, or at school, it wouldn't do anything."

Dumbledore breathed, "Then you would only have the original protection your mother left you, the one that protected you during your first year."

Harry was now gritting his teeth, and his eyes were full of such hatred Dumbledore was taken aback.

"The same one he neutralized by taking my blood in the Third Task. The same one that didn't work against others in all the other times I was attacked, including today."

With a sigh, Dumbledore nodded, "An unfortunate side effec-"

"I am not going back there, I am moving to Grimmauld Place, or another place, I can pay someone to make a Fidelius, I am /not/ going back there."

Dumbledore looked at Harry with a pitying look, "Harry, I know you and your relatives don't have a good rela-"

"DON'T HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP?" Dumbledore flinched as Harry hit the table with both fists, rattling it, and at the same time, several objects exploded, or broke in his office.

"A GOOD RELATIONSHIP? THEY. ARE. NOT. MY. FAMILY. I HATE THEM! THEY HATE ME! THEY /NEVER/ WERE MY FAMILY!"

Harry took a deep breath and sat down, taking deep breaths.

"I honestly don't give a fuck to what you think, /sir,/ Petunia is not my aunt, and that's not my home, it never was, I deny any association with her, she's not my family, she's my jailer, they all are, that's how I see them, that place is not my home, it's my prison and I am not going back there."

Harry barely noticed two devices in one of the shelves that went dark, but Dumbledore did.

"Harry, please, the protections."

"I go to the marked you know."

Dumbledore stopped at the non sequitur.

"To the market, to the park, I used to go to a school near there, and I used to see many people that I now know are wizards, recognize, me, some were passing through the same street."

Harry raised his head, and his watery, furious, and regretful eyes bore at the Dumbledore, his voice quieter, but still carrying.

"They could've gotten me at any of those places, couldn't they? If they really wanted to get me, especially after I came to Hogwarts."

Dumbledore deflated.

"One of them could've asked Snape for the address and he would've had to give it. To keep his /cover/."

Harry shook his head, and spoke with a smaller voice.

"But they never did, did they? They never really tried to know where I was, and before the Fourth Year, they never tried to."

He gave a short, rueful chuckle that almost made Dumbledore grimace.

"The only people who would hurt me there were the Dursleys, the only ones I know wanted to do it, were them," another bitter laugh, and Harry rose from the chair.

"I know Sirius gave me Grimmauld Place, and his family's money."

Dumbledore sighed, removed his glasses, and pinched the bridge of his nose while he nodded.

"I am going to live there now, and maybe go and visit the Weasleys later, but Grimmauld Place is where I will live. You can keep having the meetings there, but there will be rules, and even Snape can come, but if he speaks one bad word against Sirius or my Father, he's out. If I had to go back to Privet Drive for five years and /tolerate/ /them/, he can keep his mouth shut in a meeting."

Harry breathed, calming himself a bit, before looking at Dumbledore.

"Good Evening, Professor, thanks for the tea."

** *Harry's choice*

​

'So, you're saying my blood protects them,' Harry said, thinking. He was thinking of Dudley, who got attacked by a Dementor, Dudley whom he had saved, and his Uncle, willing to throw Harry out for that. He remembered the complains how much he cost them, and fought to restrain a grin. 'And they know?'\\
'Yes.'\\
Well, that sealed the deal. 'The bond does not stop?'\\
'Not until you're 17, no.'

'I heard you need me to protect your family against a newly-risen dark lord,' he told Vernon later. 'So, I provide you a valuable service. Dudley took a lot of money from me in the previous years.' He grinned. 'I want it back. I want to be paid for the privelege of my protection. You won't last /seconds/ without me.'

**** Imagine how they are getting away this time. 'Uncle,' Harry said innocently. 'Those wizards and witches are risking their /lives/ to save you lot.' His Uncle sighted. 'How much?' he asked, already sick and tired of this. '1000 each and you pay their funeral if they die.'
