What would a Wizarding World be like if after Voldemort's defeat, after trying to kill Harry failed, the Death Eaters continued their reign of terror on the Wizarding World as well as the Muggle one?

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have Dumbledore and/or Weasley Bashing

Would rather not have a Evil Harry

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

** My story "The Dark Lord Never Died" should fit. Lucius Malfoy faked Voldemort's survival and kept fighting, winning the war as morale on the Ministry side collapsed. No Dumbledore and Weasley bashing - they're heroes. Harry's not evil. Harry's with Ginny, no Dramione.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
