** Griselda Marchbanks looked over at Bathilda Bagshot laying next to her on the bed. She was not as young as she used to be and the last 2 hours had been exhausting, pleasurable but exhausting. She waited a few moments until Bathilda's breathing returned to normal. Then said "Harry Potter is supposed to start Hogwarts this year."

"Hmm," was the tired reply.

"I was thinking he could use a mentor or two."

Bathilda turned to face her friend of many years and even with her poor eyesight could see the gleam in her eyes. She thought back to the last young boy they had mentored. It sadden her heart to remember he had died so young, but that was tempered by how many deatheaters he took down when he died. He had been a powerful wizard with very good stamina who always looked out for the needs of others first. "Yes, I think that we should take a trip to Hogwarts once the term starts," she replied as she rolled toward Griselda with a new burst of energy.

The second "omake" is this. Quite a short little story though.
