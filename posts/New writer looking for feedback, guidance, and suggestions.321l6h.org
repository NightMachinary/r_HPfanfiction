** It's a pretty decent start but it's hard to review it because even with the second chapter there's just not much there yet.

I like the idea and how it's centered around necromancey which isn't covered much in canon. I also like the Dresdenesque "Harry with his wizarding shop" theme.

I don't like the size of your chapters. Even if both of the chapters were combined into one it would be pushing it for how short a chapter should be in my opinion. I try to write at least 2500 words per chapter and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ea5ij/what_do_you_consider_to_be_an_acceptable_chapter/][others generally have the same opinion]].

** I would edit the chapters and find a way to combine them into one. There's not much in the second chapter that couldn't somehow fit in the first chapter. It would be better to treat chapters as TV episodes instead of just scenes. You might be able to produce more chapters, but the story is more incoherent when broken up like it is currently.

I didn't see anything wrong with the writing. Descriptors and setting are solid. Dialogue tags are mostly correct. Would always recommend a beta of course.

I would watch out for how you want to narrate the story. In the section where you describe Harry, it jumps back and forth between present and past tense. There are other instances where the narrative starts lecturing the reader. It's a tricky area as there becomes a disconnect between the descriptive portions and the didactic sections. Either stick with a third-person omni or third-person limited.
