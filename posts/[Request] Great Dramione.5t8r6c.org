Really in the mood for good Dramione -- currently zipping through /Pirates/ by singerhotti24 and I definitely need more! The longer, the better. I prefer completed stories, but if you know of a stellar WIP, I won't turn it down!

Thanks!


** I have read a couple of fanfictions with this pairing. Most of them have been just fine but they do lack either a convincing story or convincing characters. The best one I've ever read is /Isolation/ by Bex-chan. This story is great and have some insanely well written characters.They are really nuanced and have convincing emotions and chemistry. I won't give away anything but since it takes place during some of their last school years it does change some parts of canon, so be prepared for that :) Hope you enjoy it. I can link other fanfictions to you if you're interested, but as I mentioned none of them are a bit cheesy and short. But tell me then I'll send links :) Here's the link to /Isolation/ : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation]]

** Alright, this is a big request because I have no idea what you have/haven't read already! I'm just going to rec a ton of the Dramione that I have read & loved. :D (can you tell this is my ride or die ship...??)

linkffn(The Die by colubrina; Rebuilding by colubrina) are two of my absolute favourites. I think colubrina might write the best Draco I've ever read. The Die has an alternate ending, After the Sea, but it's Draco/Hermione/Theo so might not be your cup of tea. Colubrina's got another brilliant Dramione on the go right now, linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina) but if you don't like WIPs you can always wait till she's done.

linkao3(As Certain Dark Things are to be Loved by somuchcloser) is great, but as implied, pretty dark.

linkffn(Broken by inadaze22) is also pretty dark, but excellent as well.

linkffn(The Request by redhead14) has a great plot, and I love watching the way Draco and Hermione grow together despite pretty challenging circumstances!

linkao3(Aurelian by bittyblueeyes) is one of my absolute favourite Dramione+child+mystery-ish fics, I've reread it more times than I could count.

If you're looking for more PWP/pure smut, I have to recommend linkao3(The Grotto by bunney; Ardent Bonds by musyc)!

Some more classics: linkao3(Seven for a Secret by musyc; A Pale and Pointed Mirror by musyc) and the already mentioned Isolation by bex-chan. I couldn't get into The Fallout by everythursday but I know it's a very popular one!

If you're okay with interesting formats, I also really loved linkao3(Letters from Everyone by jadepresley), and if you're okay with weirder fics I really enjoyed linkao3(Mind Pop by riptey). Provocative_envy also writes some great shorter fics, usually non-magical. I would highly recommend linkao3(Universally Speaking by provocative_envy; Bite Marks by provocative_envy).

Also, I know you'd prefer no WIPs, but if you like nontraditional/muggle AUs, linkao3(Ride or Die by olivieblake) is INCREDIBLE!

And, a tiny bit of self promotion - it's a WIP but only another two weeks or so from completion: linkao3(Don't Take This Sinner by hexmionegranger).

PHEW alright I hope that at least gets you started, let me know if you read any and your thoughts!!!

  While working her first big case for the DMLE, Hermione finds herself staring down the limitations of linear time--with the help of some thoroughly unhelpful people. Meanwhile, the majority of Draco's mind is trapped in a comatose state, but some of it's still wandering around. Even Seers and queens can't be expected to put up with that sort of nonsense, which means someone else will have to. All this, when Hermione was already more confused than any one person should ever have to be.

***** I think why I don't like her as a person is that during her fanfic hype, before she was traditionally published, she would beg her fans for things like money and gifts, and then "pretend" she never had. I had a small fanfic following at one time and it rubs me the wrong way that other authors would treat their readers like that. The plagiarism thing is also concerning, if only because I've had stories stolen from me before, too, so I know what that feels like. Altogether, it really makes me dislike her.

But I do appreciate the rec!
