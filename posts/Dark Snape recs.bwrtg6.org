I'm interested in reading some darkfics with Snape. Preferably adult rating. I prefer Snape/Ginny and Snape/Hermione, but I'm open to other pairings.

I recently read A Capacity for Love by SwissMiss1 and thought it was amazing, but I hadn't realized the story was more of a genfic. I definitely want a romance fic.

Thank you!!!

EDIT: so weird. Downvoted for what, the pairings? Liking darkfics?


** If you're willing to read Snape/Narcissa, you might try Snapesforte's /Soul Play/. She writes a dark, scheming, ambitious, possessive Snape.

By the way, I'm the author so I'm totally shamelessly promoting myself here.

******** My thoughts on viable partners for Severus boils down to three people:

- Hermione Granger -- postwar to avoid student/teacher, or with teenage!Severus (time travel or de-aging). Both studious and socially awkward, able to bond over their love of advanced magical theory, ultimately becoming friends and eventually something more.
- Lily Evans -- They have a long history as very close friends. They /know/ each other like nobody else, and I can see it go two ways: sibling love (they met when they were 9 years old) or something that eventually develops into romantic love. Canon makes Severus out as loving Lily, but is unclear on whether it was reciprocated or not (my headcanon is that the spark to ignite something was there, but unexplored). JKR has later on implied that had Severus not done the decisions he did in canon, Lily would never have dated James, and if Severus got a second choice, he'd choose Lily over the Death Eaters each time (this is probably what inspired the remarkably common LESS Peggy Sue plot). Make of that what you want...
- Narcissa Black -- The only female person close in age to Severus that he seems to give the time of day during the 90s. She went to him, of all people, to ask to protect Draco, so I assume they were at least friendly to each other. In a reality where Lucius is an abusive husband, I can see Narcissa go to Severus for help and Severus being able to sympathize with his experience with Eileen, with them eventually becoming more than friends in the fallout. I haven't actually read any good NBSS, but it's really the only other major female I can see him with enough to be able to dream up a reality for myself.

Obviously, there's also OCs -- but I can't really comment on them since they can be made out to be whatever the author wants (but I have issue with one particular OC, a 3rd Evans sibling -- to me, these fics usually end up feeling as if Severus' mindset is "ok, I can't have Lily, so let's pick a consolation prize", it does not make for a healthy relationship). Besides that, I've seen the occasional NTSS and one LBSS of all things (and several slash pairings, but I don't read slash), but nothing that has interested me. While I have pondered the implications of GWSS, I've never been able to see it go any further than a temporary fling postwar (similar to Ginny/Dean in canon), because I can't see them put up with each other's personalities longterm. And Severus would only look at Ginny at all because she's a redhead (even if my inner image of her is nothing like Lily -- different hair colors), and Ginny at Severus due to morbid curiousity. Hence why I was curious about GWSS fics to see how it works, maybe they can change my view of things. Thanks for the links!

********* I think any woman besides Lily would be a consolation prize for Snape. It's pretty tragic, but he did devote his life to redeeming her death. Even HG can't really replace LE. There is a SSNB fic rec'ed above.

I like the pairing because Ginny was possessed and influenced by Tom Riddle her first year at Hogwarts. It's frustrating that Rowling never explored this and the effect it had on Ginny. I think it probably made a huge impression on her mind and development. She's basically a good person who was lured to the dark side, like Snape was, but for different reasons. Yes, I do bring up the red hair, but really, Lily's personality also seemed similar to Ginny's in that she was fiery, intelligent, and strong. So the similarities are more than skin deep.

Thus, while I agree to some extent that nobody would surpass Lily in his eyes, I only think this lasts during his spy work. She'll always remain dear to him, but no longer at the expense of anyone else.

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were. They rekindle a love they never thought possible amidst a war that threatens to tear them apart.
