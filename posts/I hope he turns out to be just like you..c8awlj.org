I'm going to put down the details I remember from a fanfiction and hopefully you amazing people will know the piece I've been looking for for years now. Severus x Hermione Hermione has to do some training under Snape at Hogwarts. As both were picked to chaperone the Halloween hayride and later a pumpkin carving contest, they were forced to enjoy each other's presence outside of training. They get in an argument that ends in a heated kiss in front of their students. Later Snape secretly gifts Hermione with a notebook, quill, and ink well. He has a matching ink well in his pocket, because it's magical mood changing ink. This way he can know when she's upset, and cancel any training session before they are forced to put up with each other. Only, an invisible Snape and mystery gifts have caught Hermione's interest. And we all know how driven Hermione can be. At a New Years sleep over with Luna she has the realization that Snape is her invisible admirer. Next comes her seduction. But I don't remember much else. Please help me find this story. Lol
