Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that

You-Know-Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That's a

basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that's glaring at

you has got legs. If it has, it's safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is

You-Know-Who, that's still likely to be the last thing you ever do.‚Äù
