:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I'm looking for a Snarry fic set immediately after Deathly Hallows but without the Epilogue. I think Harry comes back to retrieve Snape's body in the Shrieking Shack but finds him alive instead, or maybe he's the one who saves him, I don't remember that part. What I remember though is a scene in the story where Harry allows Snape to use the Levicorpus charm on him, basically revisiting the scene of Snape's worst memory with Snape humiliating Harry this time in the place of James. Snape takes off his pants as well, leaving him naked and embarrassed but they basically end up sleeping together after that. Can you help me? Does someone know what this story is?


** Is it Time and Time Again by Mottlemoth?

Cockroach Clusters, Please by Ziasudra also has a scene were Snape uses Levicorpus on Harry but thats a time travel fic, so probably not what you're looking for
