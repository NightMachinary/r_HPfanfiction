I remember Pansy's dad being in Ravenclaw but followed Voldemort for knowledge

Pansy's mom was hurt in a spell-gone-wrong and was only kept alive by illegal blood runes

Pansy has a little brother called... I think Colin or something similar

There was also a scene where she went out to buy things and people spit on her for trying to turn Harry in, but she ignored it.
