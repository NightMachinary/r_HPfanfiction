The whole point of the Veil is that nothing comes back out, just like a black hole or something.

If Quirrel with Voldemort on the back of his head was thrown into the Veil, would Voldemort's floaty spirit make it out or would he be gone for good?

If it's the latter then a time traveler Harry could probably solve the Voldemort situation five minutes after arriving at Hogwarts and getting sorted, just tell Dumbledore to tell Fawkes to surprise flame-transport Quirrel straight into the DoM.

Makes Oh God Not Again kinda drawn out.

Or if the Veil doesn't work just hit Voldeface with a dozen strong Obliviates from the entire Obliviator department until he forgets that he's the bad guy.


** Horcruxes have more than enough drawbacks already; what use would they be if they can't do their one job and keep the soul in the world of the living? I'd say Voldemort would just go through it like it's an ordinary veil, unaffected. If it's Quirrel with Voldemort's wraith, I think he would float through while Quirrel is a goner.

On the other hand, the Veil might work for getting rid of Horcruxes.

** I think no one actually /knows/ what throwing a Horcruxed person in the Veil would do because no one's ever tried before, and so Dumbledore doesn't want to risk it. My top two theories are either that it /would/ work, but the Horcruxes would remain and still be able to possess people, you'd have to throw /them/ in too; or that the Horcruxes would protect him and if you tried to throw Voldemort into the Veil he'd just... bounce back against the curtains, unable to fall in. I definitely don't think it would enable him to get in /and then get out/, though --- the Horcruxes anchor you to the mortal realm and prevent you from passing on, but once you /have/ passed on, that's it.

In the case of Quirrelmort, the other difficulty is that Dumbledore would have to be very very quick; Voldemort is likely aware of the threat the Veil presents to him, if it does indeed present one rather than the "bouncing harmlessly back from the Veil" idea above being true. So the moment he realizes where he is, he'd nope out of Quirrell's body and fly away before Quirrell had time to fall all the way through.

*** Alternate possibility: the Veil kills his body, like the Killing Curse did, and he becomes a wraith again.

**** I don't know how that would work. Would his body fall through but his soul be stopped at the gate?

****** Nah, as I said, I don't think Horcruxes should allow someone to /visit/ the Afterlife and then come back, but rather only to prevent one from going there in the first place.

******* Right, his soul never visits the afterlife. It literally goes through the Veil doorway like we'd walk through a door. Like to his soul and mind, the Veil is no different to the door leading into the chamber.it only affects his body. So if you're looking at it side-on, you see his body enter and disappear as his wraith form appears out the other side.

** No one actually knows what happens beyond the Veil (thats kind of the point though - it doesn't matter if it is death because for all intents and purposes they are gone anyway). It could be that it only separate the soul from the body, in which case it wouldn't matter that much for Voldemort. It could kill him, but the Horcruxes pull him back anyway. Or maybe it makes the Horcruxes come alive without a master soul they are subservient to (implied by Tom in CoS).

The point is there is no real way to know, and honestly not knowing might be more dangerous. Dumbledore was suspicious Voldemort survived, and that allowed him to keep some tabs on him. But he wouldn't have any idea about the Veil because nobody really knows what happens, so it would be even harder to justify rallying people to believe he survived. Harry survived the killing curse, so maybe Voldemort could too. But nobody is known to have survived the veil, which would hinder any attempt to convince people.

Better to get a body and make sure it sticks this time.

** They have theories about the Veil but it's mostly a one-way portal to not-in-my-backyard, not a magical soul guillotine (which is what dementors are for).

It may also kill you as a consequence, and they mostly assume it does, but it's not like they can get anything back from the other side to check.

Transmuting Quirrelmort into a rubber ball and chucking it through the Veil would probably get rid of him. Might not kill him, but he probably wouldn't come back.

(This failing to work and making things Much Worse could make for an interesting fic. He comes back with an army of Greater Undead or whatever because it ends up giving him a foot on either side of the underworld.)

Chucking /any random horcrux/ belonging to Tom through the Veil might also solve the whole problem by yanking the rest of him through after it, if souls are indivisible eternal entities that some dumbass teenager isn't capable of chopping parts of it off off with something as simple as a random murder. We only ever get Dumbledore's word for it, based off the one book Tom read, and intentionally avoiding knowing more about how "the evilest ritual" works once he's convinced he knows that Murder Harms The Soul is a Dumbledore kind of thing to do.

(I've read a fic where the Unspeakables deliberately disseminate the horcrux ritual as a way of tricking would-be Dark Lords into being really easy to kill, and the whole mess came about because Dumbledore never bothered to notify them Tom had made a few.)

** I think they would. A hocrux acts as an anchor for the soul that prevents it from moving on. The cause of death does not matter.

** Based on what we know that Horcruxes actually do - that is, tether a soul to the earth and the material realm, thereby preventing final death and the afterlife because a soul cannot pass on unless it is in one piece.

I think the Veil would be solid to a horcruxed person, or perhaps solid only to their soul - so their body can fall through, do whatever it is physical matter does when it passes into the Veil, but their soul would be denied passage and the Veil would be a solid wall to their wraith.
