** I've lost track of my rereads of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. Even though it's incomplete, it's still worth it. Harry's interactions with his friends never fail to warm my heart.

The only place to get all 43 chapters at present is [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][the PDF/eBook version]], although the author is looking at reposting it on RoyalRoad.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** continuing my post because fuck it im already an hour into looking through my list of favorites so i might as well finish.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de sangre]] one of the latest and greatest by theendless7. this one features a fem voldemort who has a ton of character development and a teenage harry who actually acts like a real person.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/No-Competition][no competition]] really funny story about the horcrux in harry making all the dark creatures of mythology/hp lore finding him super desirable to be around. adorable little harry grows up with werewolves and hags and liches and various members of the hell pantheon etc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][old soldiers never die]] this one is pretty old but i still rather like it. this is the quintessential harry gets muggle help story. in this one it comes from some world war 2 vets after he is given a pistol he uses to kill some death eaters. the author is rorschach's blot who is a huge name in hp fanfiction from the old days.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][pranking the tournament]] When harry find out his name was entered into the goblet under the salem witches academy he decides to play along with the joke and take it a step or 3 further.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11675231/1/Shiver-me-Timbers][shiver me timbers]] a hp/starwars crossover. earth is hoth. an immortal style harry eventually gets thawed out while the rebels are there on hoth and he joins them for some star wars adventures with fannon style harry potter magic such as runes. the story is quite funny featuring such gems captured de-aged imperial star destroyer officers drinking juice boxes and playing with blocks and a drunk luke losing a bet and having to kiss admiral ackbar on the lips.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][something wicked this way comes]] hp/disgaea crossover. harry and co summon etna from the disgaea universe. naturally it ends up harry/etna pair as she trains him and his friends up to be a better fighting force. i quite enjoyed this one even having only played disgaea once like 15 years ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][stepping back]] one of the popular harry/bellatrix stories. this one is harry going back to when his parents (and the black sisters) were in school and fighting voldemort at that time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9566537/1/Ten-More-Minutes][ten more minutes]] in canon dumbledore showed up and pulled harry away from his date at the cafe in halfblood prince, this story explores what if harry decided to make the effort to get a date with the waitress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][the archeologist]] harry worked as a curse breaker for a decade then one day he wakes up inhabiting the body and in the grave of an alternate timeline rose potter who was killed by voldemort. this harry has some curse breaking adventures and takes a job as a professor at hogwarts after exorcising binns due to the ghost teaching history really poorly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][the arithmancer]] a hermione focused series where she uses the power of math to do amazing feats of magic. this and the sequels are well written and have great details and character development.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][the observer effect]] this is a hp/iron man crossover. "After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12343855/1/The-Swallow-and-the-Dragon][the swallow and the dragon]] hands down the best hp/witcher crossover you never knew you needed. ciri portals to england and harry helps her escape from the wild hunt. she spends some time there and convinces him to take the war seriously and live his life to the fullest. ciri portals away to continue her flight and harry goes on to win the war and several decades later gets whisked away to the witcher universe where he makes plans to help ciri like she one helped him.
