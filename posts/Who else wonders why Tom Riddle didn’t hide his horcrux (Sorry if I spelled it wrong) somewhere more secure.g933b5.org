In my knowledge, which is limited, a horcrux can't be killed by non-magical means. So why not hide one in like an ocean or a volcano? In my opinion it would have been much harder to get to. Bury one 100 feet under the ground. Sorry if I sound incredibly stupid. I'm just wondering.


** It's not stupid. It's an interesting thought but Riddle is seen as a person who is petty I guess and likes to tie things to things that he knows which is why he chooses the founders things for Horcruxes. Those places have ties to his past that he hated.

*** I just don't think it was very though out, you know? But he is thought to be petty. And it would make sense for the places to be tied to him in a way. Thanks for your reply though!

** I made a head-canon that a horcrux needs to be surrounded by magic, or at least in a magical area, to not die, based on the idea that if a magical had their magic drained from them they would die, and that making an area for one (i.e. the cave with the locket) was just too much effort for an effect that could be achieved sith ease by using already established hiding spots, like the RoR, Gringotts, the Gaunt house wards (plus the resurrection stone, even if Riddle didnt know what it was)

**** You miss the point. A rock on a beach is not something you can deduce, when searching for horcruxes. Studying Tom's backstory will not tell you to look on a random rocky beach for one of his horcruxes.

** We don't have a full background of Voldemort's decisions other than Dumbledore's explanation that he picked trophies and put them in places significant to him. Now, realistically... in retrospective it's easy say that he could have done that or that. But if you did not have Dumbledore's detective skills and Harry's pure luck, who the fuck would have thought to search in a giant room of hidden objects, or in a cave that was visited once by a boy whom most didn't even know that he was the current Voldemort?

Edit: that's if anyone knew that Voldemort had horcruxes in the first place.

** In canon, there's no real reason given - or at least, no convincing reason.

To be fair, though, it'll depend a bit on the form we see Horcruxes take (at least for fanfic purposes). Since so little is known about them, we have to fill in the blanks.

For instance, horcruxes could act as an anchor for the 'main' soul remnants - that is, they're just passively there and Voldemort can just run around as a ghost when 'killed' until he reposses someone. But for that to work, he might need to be within a certain radius of his horcruxes - if they get too far away from each other/him, they might not give him that anchor point. That could explain why he doesn't scatter his horcruxes around the world/universe.

Another view might be that they provide backup - by him needing to come back to one of the horcruxes, and either re-meld with it, or have a horcrux take someone over. This is a bit different from canon, but it would explain why he'd leave them at least /somewhat/ accessible - because making it impossible to get to would prevent someone from being able to interact with/get possessed by a horcrux.

Another option might be that it needs to be either near somewhere that Voldemort has a strong emotional connection with, or in the possession of someone that has such a connection with Voldemort. For instance, Hogwarts, the cave, and the Gaunt house are all vital elements of Voldemort's life - and maybe for the horcruxes to stay 'stable' without anyone nearby, putting them near such locations in the soul's life is magically important. The other horcruxes being in the possession of Bellatrix and Lucius, two of his most important followers, could support that second aspect.

In the end, canonically it's likely just hubris - and to leave them exposed enough for Harry to get to. I think for fanfic authors, it's probably worth re-examining them to find a reason why they are either exposed that way (that doesn't make Voldemort look dumb) or put them in more secure locations.

*** Him needing to remember where they are might be an important part of coming back as well. There's no telling how clear headed he is while as a phantom.bit did take 10 years wandering until coming across someone in Albania of all places. He might very well have been trying to get the diadems original resting place having forgotten it was moved.

** Personally I think it was his narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies that caused him to create the horcruxes he did. He wanted to feel ownership over those things and in some cases (like the diary and gaunt ring) the memories tied to them. If he could make those things into horcruxes, they were his both physically and magically. Founders objects? Boom, now those things and their legacies are his. Diary? Boom, now his time as Heir of Slytherin is immortalized. Gaunt ring? Boom, he was head of the family after dominating everyone else by either killing them or sending them to prison. The only one I see that breaks the pattern is Nagini, though I suppose she was a partial tool for his domination over the wizarding world. That's just my two cents on it though.
