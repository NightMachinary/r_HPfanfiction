:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I dont remember much but i remember one chapter where Minister Fudge notices an expensive room during the quidditch world cup belonging to an unknown lord. And wanting to to meet this mysterious lord he head over to the room along with Harry's parents (and i think Dumbledore and Mcgonagall). When they knock Harry opens the door and peeks his head out while hiding his lower half because ''mature'' things are happening to him.

They dont know it's Harry and Lily appears to notice what's going on behind the door. Fudge not noticing anything asks to come in and meet the lord. Harry gets annoyed and ask them to leave, when they refuse Harry uses magic to push them away from his door.

Sorry for not being able to provide anything but that one Chapter. If you know the name please tell me and leave a link. THX!

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
