*** I've been having kind of a bleh (I'd usually use a stronger word to describe it) couple of days, and finally got around to reading this. This fic will now forever hold a wonderful place in my heart. I loved everything about it. Thank you for the rec.

** The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall]] writes a ton of fics featuring McGonagall and they are all great (as are her other fics!). Right now I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473197/1/Great-Deeds][this one]] which is snippets from McGonagall's life from birth onward.
