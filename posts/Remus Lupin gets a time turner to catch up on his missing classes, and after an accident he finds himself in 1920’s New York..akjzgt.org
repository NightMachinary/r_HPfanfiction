Hint hint hint Newt Scamander later set up the Werewolf Registry :)


** At first I thought this was referring to a crossover with Doctor Who where the Ponds get trapped in 1920s New York (unless it was Chicago? I forget), but with Remus.

** Ok, Timeturners don't send you to different places (only back in time!) and secondly:

​

NEWT wouldn't want a registry! Seriously, that guy is as far from a bigot as you can get and he would never support something like that! The potential for misuse? Damned, just like a fucking gun registry (next step: Take away the guns and in the case of werewolfs: Either discriminate against them, lock them all up or at worst EXTERMINATE them!)

*** I know time turners don't work like that, but y'know, this is fiction after all.

I know it's out of his character, but that's what it said at the back of the book! I'm curious to see if the filmmakers will touch on it.

Maybe everything is not as it seems.

**** Werewolves are supposed to be am analogy of the AIDS epidemic. I could see even Newt doing it if enough werewolves were careless about it.

*** Well, unless you're counting the Cursed Child time turners anyways. I personally like to pretend that bit of canon never happened, but there IS a president for it.
