** Is the character being a Black or a Potter important to the plot? And by this I mean more than providing a lazy way to have canon characters meet the OC.

If yes, you have your answer.

If no, then there's no reason to shoehorn in a character into a place that didn't exist in canon. Not only is it hinting at important connections that aren't there, but it also limits the OC for no particular reason.

** There's a lot of room for playing around with a Black child. But the main thing is that there has to be a believable reason for Sirius to not know. For example, if the child were to be the same age as Harry, then it would have to be something more than just the mum never told Sirius, or she went into hiding, or she moved overseas. To me, that doesn't fly in a magical world. So, the mum would have to be a muggle one night stand, and child raised as a muggleborn. That would be interesting, if the mum sees Sirius on tv in third year and realizes her child's father is a psycho killer.

Or, child is born after that Halloween night. That makes it probably only starting Hogwarts in PoA, which works out....except Harry never interacts with younger students, except for Dennis. So I would expect that the child and the SI are in a similar position to Harry, and that they haven't been told that their (god)father is a murderous psycho in jail.

That means Harry sees no reason to spend any more time with them than he would with Dennis or Romilda. Then after all is revealed, Harry falls more into a big brother role

** Neither, I prefer unrelated OCs.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** I'd go with the Black offspring because I feel that it would be incredibly frustrating to live through the canon Dursley abuse for any amount of time because there's little you can do about short of murder.

Having read a few Game of Thrones SI fics, the best way a child SI can believably influence adults is claiming visions of some kind. For example, say the daughter of Sirius is being raised by Andromeda (her closest relative), you could claim a vision about Harry in the closet. If you tell Andromeda about the reoccurring dream, she would probably decide to check it out, even if it's just to prove you wrong. And once a few of your "visions" turn out true, you can have a larger influence without actually having a child boss around adult (like in your average Lord Potter story).
