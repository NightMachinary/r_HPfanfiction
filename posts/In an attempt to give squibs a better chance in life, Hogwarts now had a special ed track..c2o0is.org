Perhaps they could also have muggle classes for those who want to try their luck in muggle society. And subjects that don't require magic like care of magical creatures.


** There was a nice story about daughter of Neville Longbottom, who grew up at Hogwarts (Neville being a professor of Herbology) but turns out to be a squib. So, she fights for her right to be enrolled in Hogwarts even without magical powers. Cannot find it now. Anyone?

** The problem is that like many of the parallels in JKRs work, the no magic= disability one does not really hold up.\\
The goal of special education (at least in the US) is to level the playing field by teaching the same standards in different ways or a different time frame so that the education given is equal for all. Given the nature of the curriculum at Hogwarts, they would never be able to access even the most basic of classes. In magical society, being a Squib is severely handicapping with regards to learning magic. Creating a special ed track only intensifies Squibs as third class citizens similar to the institutionalization of those with any type of disability in the past. Essentially, Squibs would be in what is commonly referred to as a Functional Life Skills Class because they need to be taught basic (muggle) skills in order to flourish.\\
Actually, I think this is kind of the Idea you mean OP (sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth). A better solution would be another school where people know about magic, so the students don't have to hide, but is otherwise a completely Muggle Secondary School Here is where the "no magic= disability" breaks down because removing a Squib from the magical environment removes their "disability". I'm hard-pressed to think of a disability that disappears completely with an environment change.\\
For example, I have a disability that makes it so I cannot drive. I can change my environment to a city with good public transit and mitigate the need for this. If I was rich, I could hire a driver, but regardless I will never be able to get around entirely on my own even if I wanted to. On the other hand, Squibs can change where they live and hold productive lives. They can provide for themselves, travel, and communicate. That isn't to say it would be easy, but the challenges would have more to do with fixed mindsets rather than a physical or mental barrier they are unable to overcome.

*** I mean there are plenty of write arounds for that. Runes, arithmancy, astronomy, care of magical creatures don't necessarily require a wand....even potions sometimes. And for the parts that do, you could have a "programmable" wand that heats a cauldron or does a specific set of tasks or something.

Like wands for people whose magical energy was...stunted.

**** I guess I see your point but I've also assumed that most things require some activating or latent magic or something. It would still be hard to sell me on the fic concepts. I suppose that such "technology" as programmable wands" could be written but even if it is written well, I'm not sure I could buy a story where a character wants to stay in their culture as a third class citizen when they don't have to.

***** Well with advancements such as those, they could live in the world that they grew up in, so perspectives and the culture may change. Filch for example never wanted to leave the world he knew. Mrs Figg straddled both words but you can tell from her phrases that she was never really muggle.

I mean. If muggles can't see Hogwarts but Filch (/all squibs?) CAN, it implies that there's some latent workable magic in him.

*** In England and Scotland, pupils in special education classes can be exempt from the curriculum. In fact, where I am it is entirely acceptable to teach zero typical education skills (e.g., a target of following time table and accepting adult direction could mean only playing their favourite games for a year). In fact, we are asked to consider whether we are making things overly 'education' looking unnecessarily, for example if you're teaching fine motor then handwriting sheets are boring and unengaging.

Some children will be in special schools (separate schools) that have greater resources, but many will be in resource bases attached to a mainstream school. These pupils are not treated as third class citizens.

I think the difficulty with squibs and the muggle world is that in many cases they may never have seen the muggle curriculum until they reached 11, when no letter came. Some squibs may adjust well, but for others the magical world has their family and their culture. To exist in the muggle world, they would have to lie.

In England, especially the muggle curriculum for primary is hardcore these days for English (especially grammar), maths and science. (In the 90's, not quite so much.) In Scotland, the curriculum is more broad but that would mean that the squids would need a wider range of information and decent grasp on Burns' poetry (I jest, mostly).

I think there could be space for extra classes for the wizards too and that, if nothing else, the squibs could travel via Hogsmeade for stuff like muggle studies. It needs a revamping anyway!

Arguably, it could be a bit like Deafness. If everyone was Deaf and spoke their national sign language, then there would be no barrier. This is why many Deaf people don't consider themselves disabled.

Squibs could do many paperwork jobs in the magical world that they're just not given access to. Similarly, they could be shop owners, radio broadcasters.

Whereas leaving would be like being forced to move country, despite being an otherwise rounded person.

It's something I've pondered many times and I suppose the answer would be on a squib by squib basis. The logical thing would be for the Hogwarts letters to go out earlier, or a dual education schooling (Hogwarts or elsewhere) where pupils took a mix of muggle core subjects and do-able wizarding subjects for the first couple of years. It's typical for English pupils to pick their subjects in the year their turn 13, with another round of picking at 16.

I could imagine a class such as 'Arithmancy and Mathematics'.

So a squib COULD get away with English, Maths and Science (though job hunting, English and Maths is all that will be asked for) for GCSE. Though 5 minimum is preferred (I did 13 subjects). Potentially with the other two as electives. Then 3 subjects for A Level (usually pupils do 4 for the first year and drop the weakest, but some do 5 the whole way through).

Wales have a less threatening but similar approach to England. They have Welsh GCSEs.

In Scotland, although it's expected that you get 5 Standards to do Highers, universities accept that you can progress straight to Highers. So, in theory a squib could do a mixed education and not need to study for exams until the 16 - 18 phase. Probably need to start a bit earlier to get the background in.

Alternatively, they could do SVQs or apprenticeships. Potentially doing mixed until 18 and then joining muggle only but this would require them to have a back story which would be more challenging.
