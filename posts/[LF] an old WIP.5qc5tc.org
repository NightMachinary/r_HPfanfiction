A few years ago I ran across a WIP that I naturally forgot to favorite. In the fic Harry was sorted into ravenclaw, had barely any magic, and could see energy/magic. This was due to when voldemort's AK back fired baby Harry pulled his magic into himself and hid it to protect himself from the horcrux. He saw electricity as red, the Weasley twins looked like barber poles and he could manipulate the magic he saw going so far as to pull magic from hogwarts and convert it for his own reserves. Help would be greatly appreciated.


** Well, linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) fits your description rather well, even if not perfectly.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Doesn't Blindness have Harry go Godmode within the first 10 chapters? It doesn't sound anything like what OP asked for.
