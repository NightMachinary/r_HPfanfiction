Larry Jevrell was born to a family famous for breeding albino gerbils. He named his first gerbil Draco and his second gerbil Lucious. His parents were kind of confused but also very happy that he took such an early interest in the family business.


** I prefer Jerry, so he gets to rough up Tom.

There was also a fic where Harry refused to kill the Dark Lard or his Death cunsumers - instead he transfigured them into a wide variety of cuddly/exotic/extinct magical animals and opened a petting zoo. Voldemort got offered a Devil's Deal for immortality and got conned into being the zookeeper, forever.

*** The point was to avoid overused tropes. I mean, naming albino pets after Malfoys is still a trope, but I didn't want to overwhelm the set up with them.

** Because they somehow don't have enough imagination to do that. That's why those stories are always canon rehashes, too.
