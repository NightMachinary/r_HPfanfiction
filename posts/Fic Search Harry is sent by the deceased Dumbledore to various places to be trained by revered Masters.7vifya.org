So I have to be studying for my exams right now so of course I find myself needing some great fanfic right now.

I read this story a while ago, really well-written but sadly it hadn't come far, maybe 40 k words. Harry was 16-17 in the story and Dumbledore actually had thought of Harry's need to be proactive and able to defend himself.

His first destination was the rainforrest in Southern America, I believe, with a veteran auror or at least someone badass. The second destination was, I'm not sure, but I think Rome, and this is where the story stopped at the time. I want to check it out, hopefully the author has come further than that since then.

Anyone able to help me out?
