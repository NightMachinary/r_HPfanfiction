:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a fic (I thiiiiink Harry dimension-travels to the Dresden universe, but I'm not sure), and I interrupted it because I decided to read the Dresden books since it looked spoilery, but now I can't find it anymore.

I stopped on a scene where Harry Dresden meets Hermione (or Harry Potter is talking to him about meeting Hermione, or /thinking/ about them getting along??? idk, something about Hermione). I'm not sure if she's the one who called them Tall Harry and Short Harry. But it was a girl. Probably.

Pretty sure it was MoD!Harry.

.....that is not a lot to go on, sorry.
