like . firstof.. i understand the logistics of even getting a giant goblin child wouldnt work in many ways and would likely kill at least 1 of them either way they tried to consummate as a goblin would likely have to crawl inside a female giant wich would likely crush them whereas a male giant would likely tear a goblin in half but thats besides the point.

what would it look like

an ugly human sort of being? a boulder width little goblin thing? a giant gangly stick thing? a fucking demon?

personally i believe it would be nightmare fuel.


** Regular human size (average between them I guess) and very goblin like (ears, teeth, the face in general) because I believe their DNA is somewhat stronger (look at Hagrid, besides being "forbiddingly tall", he looks human). I would think they are extreme spell resistant, too (from both sides).

Hagrid happened without anyone dying, and swapping the human for a goblin shouldn't change too much. If nothing else, artificial insemination is always an option. But I'm choosing not to think about the process anymore.

From a giant's perspective, humans and goblins are basically the same height, and probably don't seem that different in other ways.

I imagine a goblin-giant hybrid would look a lot like a human-giant hybrid. They might be slightly shorter on average, and would have more goblin-like features and proportions, and might generally seem more inhuman, but that's about it.

** Troll?

I mean, intelligence wise they are probably dumber than giants but weird things happen when the races that are not meant to join have an offspring...

But I think something more orc like would be more probable. A ugly warrior of moderate intelligence and mighty bloodlust (and maybe some inherited lust for gold too thrown in the mix)

** Hagrid with pointy ears and maybe about a foot shorter.

** Some stories write all the human-like magical creatures as lines of magical humans with an inherited piece of magic on top. This would be why such physically different beings can have viable offspring together: they're all really human under the inherited enchantment. So maybe the giant and goblin enchantments undo each other, and the kids are normal wizards and witches.
