It's been said that at the time of the 7 books, Wizarding Britain had a population of 10,000 people. 10,000 people are still far too few to have a huge Ministry of Magic with 10 floors, Daily Prophet/Witches Weekly, 13 professional quidditch teams, and so much more. If you check out real countries today with 10k population, you will see that comparable institutions are considerably smaller in scale than what's portrayed in Harry Potter (How to you have a 50 member High Court/Wizengamot from a population of 10k?).

It's said elsewhere that Wizards are 1% of the Muggle population. So in a 90's Britain with ~58 million population, there should be ~580k wizards. The wars caused by Grindelwald and Voldemort would probably justify a smaller number than that, but surely not less than half that number (240k). This would actually justify a lot of what's seen in the setting, but the main inconsistency is Hogwarts.

Even assuming lengthened Wizard lifespans (they regularly lived up to 110+ according to J K rowling), higher rate of homeschooling amongst more tradtional families, and that Harry's age cohort were the children of people who had fought in the first voldemort war, either Hogwarts should have been bursting at the seams with students, or there should have been more British wizard schools in canon. There were literally only 5 boys and 3 girls in Harry's year in Gryffindor!

I think the worldbuilding error J K Rowling made was setting Hogwarts up as the only wizarding school in Britain. She could have set it up as the best and oldest, without bothering to name the rest as irrelevant. Thinking of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang as being the only Wizarding school in all of Southern and Northern Europe respectively is even worse!


** When population size mattered and I wanted a large magical population, I personally fanon-worldbuilt this like this:

Hogwarts deals with what I called the "Diagon Alley magicals", which generally means magical people that live and work near or among muggles. Those number around 15k, including the Hogsmeade population.

For the rest I imagined magical enclaves, barred from the muggle world completely, that host another 300k magicals all around the british isles. These are also self-sufficient and generally don't send their kids to Hogwarts. but instead let them go to local schools led by well educated teachers. Following that they also obviously don't have much contact with muggleborns, yet they are still part of the Wizengamot, making the institution naturally inclined to be at least wary, at worst outright hostile against muggleborn and muggle influences.

But yeah, in general if you mill over Rowling's numbers, you have a hard time getting to any coherent result. But on the other side, numbers never really played a huge role for her, anyway. They don't add or substract anything from the story by their absence. Its only when you dissect the lore, that you find these inconsistencies.

*** I guess I'll just forge ahead with my own numbers (~400k British wizards, much less lower class needed due to magic and house elves as sources of labour, wizards mostly living alongside Muggle settlements/cities like Grimmauld Place, etc). I'll change the setting to have multiple less prominent magical day schools all over Britain that purebloods/halfbloods attend if their parents dislike Hogwarts, unwilling to send their children away to boarding school or if the children aren't considered talented enough to succeed in Hogwarts).

The pureblood vs muggleborn conflict would thus be exacerbated at Hogwarts because you'd have Muggleborns on one side whose first exposure to magic is Hogwarts vs the cream of Pureblood society who attend Hogwarts for the connections and prestige. It would also explain the importance Hogwarts has in the society as a symbol of the future of the wizarding Britain. For Muggleborns (and halfbreeds like Hagrid and Flitwick), it's a symbol of equal opportunity when joining the Wizarding world, whereas for Purebloods, Hogwarts represents lost opportunities for Purebloods due to Muggleborns taking space on the rolls. As an analogy, imagine if Eton was the only prestigious school in the UK AND reserved half it's yearly intakes for refugee's children?

Voldemort would represent a subversion of this norm (so would Harry), because although he would have arrived at Hogwarts as innocent of knowledge as a muggleborn, he was actually the heir of a powerful wizarding legacy (Slytherin's heir, Peverell ancestry).

** I'm not sure why people have such a problem with the size of the Ministry relative to the magical population. Magical and Muggle government is nothing alike. Magical government is engaged in a worldwide conspiracy to keep magic a secret and a great deal of manpower and effort goes into this - indeed the entire reason why the Ministry was founded was to handle the administration of the statute of secrecy.

And on top of that you have all the normal functions of government. I have no problem with saying, say 50-60% of the working magical population are employed by the Ministry.

Why specialised wards at St Mungos when they'd be empty most of the time? A 10k population could not support a media and pop culture industry as displayed in the books (Gilderoy Lockhart's book series, Daily Prophet, Witches Weekly, Celestina Warbeck and Weird Sisters), nor could it support 13 professional quidditch teams. How do 100k magical beings attend the Quidditch world cup if Britain only has 10k wizards?

It's written as a weird, magical counterpart to British society, which works very well, it's just the population numbers and Hogwarts roll that have serious problems IMHO.

No author has been lucky enough to have every single person in a country purchase their book, except maybe Chairman Mao. Lockhart getting the DADA job must have been a huge windfall for him! There simply needs to be a larger population to support authors and other such tertiary industries.

***** The problem with 1,000 people out of a population of 10,000 buying a book is that that would make it, in population terms, the fastest selling book series of all time. Not even Mein Kampf, with massive government backing, could sell that fast. It took 14 years to sell to under 8% of the German population.

In fact the book that has come closest was Deathly Hallows, and that didn't come close to selling to 10% of the population of any country in the world within the first year after publication.

After he had initially been defeated in 1981 (and after the community had indeed fully believed Voldemort was gone forever), I'd assume there had been a mini-baby boom in the 1980s and possibly going into the 1990s, up until Voldemort returned in 1995 (but possibly before that).

** The numbers are difficult to reconcile (remember, JKR doesn't do math), but they actually work better than you might expect.

Let's start with Hogwarts. There are 5 boys and 3 girls in Gryffindor in Harry's year /that we know about/. We know all of Harry's dorm, but we don't necessarily know all of Hermione's. JK Rowling originally made a list of 40 students in Harry's year, so that is probably the most reliable (or most reliable minimum) estimate we have. That would naively mean that there are 280 students in Hogwarts, which is actually in line with the movies. But remember that Harry was born at the height of the First Wizarding War, and the birth rate was probably lower that year. By how much? Looking at the demographics of Europe during both World Wars suggests somewhere between 20% and 50%. So there could be as many 80 births in an average year.

Most of JKR's writings suggest that the average life expectancy of wizards is about 120 years. If we assume zero population growth--a reasonable assumption in a world with magic-enhanced resource acquisition and medical care--the population of wizarding Britain should be between 5,000 and 10,000. And that's just wizards, not other species, which at least need to be administrated by the Ministry, even if they aren't integrated.

Now, how big does the Ministry need to be for a nation this size. We can look at real city administrations for reference. For example, I grew up in a town of 15,000, and its police department has a membership (including reserve and staff) of 42, one for every 350 people. (Granted, this is in the US.) But the DMLE isn't just the police. It's also the closest they have to the military. One of the smallest militaries in the world is that of Antigua and Barbuda, which has an active duty membership of 170 for a population of 100,000, or one for every 600 people. The equivalents of various state and federal law enforcement and the prison system might add a few more. Add it up, and it's plausible for the DMLE alone to employ 50-60 people.

Is it reasonable to have this many functions under the DMLE? I think it is. From what we know of the Ministry, it seems like half of its function is maintaining the Statute of Secrecy, which seems to be a difficult job, so they probably do need the manpower. Now, what about other departments? Administrative employees for a city the size of Wizarding Britain would probably number about 30, and if you add up all the other departments, I'd put them at a minimum of 70.

So that's a minimum of about 150 people employed by the Ministry of Magic, or 200 counting the admittedly oversized Wizengamot. It's probably more, but I wouldn't put it above 500 given the implied design of the building in the books and the visual appearance in the films. Even in the worst case, that's only 20% of the workforce of Wizarding Britain, and probably more like 10%, not the 30%-50% that many authors seem fond of estimating. For comparison, public sector employees at all levels comprise 10%-15% of both the US and UK workforces, so these numbers are surprisingly in line with reality.

**** A 10k population is enough to support a daily newspaper, albeit a small one, and a radio station, in my experience. All the other periodicals are weekly or monthly and so will require fewer people. It can probably support multiple of the equivalent of garage bands, singers, and authors, and the magical world is so insular that they would sell better than local artists in the muggle world.

The 13 Quidditch teams is probably the hardest part. The numbers alone imply that just about everyone who plays Quidditch seriously at Hogwarts /keeps/ playing it well into their 20s. My headcanon is that "professional" means that the players get a small stipend, and the whole league is no more extravagant that a local Saturday football league unless you play for a national team.

But you're right; it barely works. The reason I said the numbers are hard to reconcile is that you can't make Hogwarts much bigger and still have it function as a school, but you can't make the community at large any smaller while maintaining the resources for things like that.

I expect magic to be a labour saver and force multiplier, and wizarding britain to be more educated and well magical but the realities of such small population numbers would still be obvious. Please see my other comments throughout this thread.

Countries of 10,000 people have very little need of advertisement, and attempts at mass media have failed due to not having anything to print. Tertiary industries like books, sports and music simply need a certain population size to be self sustainable. This is often solved by reliance on foreign mass media and pop culture in real countries, yet this is not evident of wizarding britain.

Looking at UK fertility rates around WW2, it was falling before the war but was stable from 1938 to 1942 when it started to rise. There was a significant spike in 1946 and 47 (the result no doubt of de-mobbed soldiers going home) and then things went back to following the trend established from 1942 onwards.

But at least some throwaway reference to there being more students would have been good, but like you said, that's far too few teachers if the student numbers were increased! It all comes down to Hogwarts being written as the only magical school in Britain and the implications on the population of wizards if that were the case.

I also think that they made Ron far too mediocre, especially in the movies and the books after GoF. In the early books I feel Rowling did a great job at distinguishing the different contributions Hermione and Ron made to their adventures, but by the end he really was kind of vestigial.

A lot more close knit, a lot more dependent on foreign institutions (not only due to money but due to simple talent pool issues), and simply a much "smaller" feel due to how many people know each other. You may only be capable of having ~150 friends, but a look at anyone's facebook friends list shows people often have ~1000 acquaintances. Having your acquiaintance list be 5% of the population feels very different from having your acquaintance list be 0.1% of the population.

For example, the population of Tuvalu and Wallis & Futuna are both 11k. These are basically tiny microstates where everyone know everyone, there certainly aren't 13 professional rugby/soccer teams, and there's more than 1 high school. I understand that wizarding Britain is supposed to be more educated, richer and well more magical than that, but there's really no getting around that 10k people is a tiny amount.

** Beauxbatons and durmstarng are the best magical schools on the continent, not the only. Durmstrang for example we know does not take muggleborns, muggleborns cannot be home schooled by their parents so there must be a lesser shook to take them.

All the numbers stuff, its universally accepted that JKR was not fantastic at numbers for the series. Other missteps include her dates not lining up with the calendar so September 1st would be whatever day she needed it to be rather than what it was. JKR's numbers are just a number that was used. For the most part using numbers at all are bad when they could be avoided. Notice for example how much better it is that Harry sees mountains of gold in his vault rather than a goblin handing him a note with the vault total.

****** I'm not the person you were replying to.

I also write fanfiction, just for my own fun and as part of learning to write, and, tbh, you really are stuck with handwaving, or with contradicting canon directly. It just doesn't work. None of the numbers work. There are work-rounds for some of it.

For example, Ollivanders just can't exist as a business as the /sole/ wandmaker, let alone merely the best. But there is a wandmaker in Hogsmeade also making a living.

Even if you go with JK Rowling's 'about a thousand' in the school and assume a) they sleep in different dorms and b) they are never mentioned, and even if they all buy five wands each over a lifetime, he isn't making much of a living.

You can work round that by saying a 'first wand' has a Ministry grant attatched to it that Ollivander sorts out in the background. (And then everyone has to pay for it in tax anyway and, well, you covered that.)

Secondly, try working out teacher's schedules, first of all without reference to canon, just, these many teachers and /just/ the kids mentioned in canon.

Then you can add canon times and assume a whole new schedule each year, so you don't have to deal with so many instances of two books having conflicting information.

Then assume there are actually 'about a thousand' kids and work out class sizes.

Add in any Head of House duties - for example, the careers advise, dealing with problems and so on.

It rapidly turns into an ugly nonsense. Time-turners help a bit. A bit.

I have entire plotlines I just have to discard because numbers come into it. My one where I /really/ wanted that plotline, I ended up turning into original fiction, set in the far future on an alternate Earth, and suddenly it was a lot more fun to write because my numbers made sense and so did a bunch of other canon issues.

(Running the numbers on money also makes you want to kick the Weasleys. Poor Ron.)

Except that there would definitely be more than a few dozen. Using the official numbers (10k for Britain and AVERAGE live expectancy of 100), you have 100 kids each year in the UK. Let's say 20% are Muggleborn (given that most people are half-bloods according to canon and you need some base to get that mix).

Out of Britains 56 million inhabitants, you get 10000 wizards and witches after two/three wars. Therefore the 740 million europeans result in roughly 150000 magicals. That means 1500 children; 300 of these Muggleborn.

Tl;dr: 300 >> a few dozen.

***** Hey dude, I didn't say I /liked/ it. Its quite a let down frankly.

I mean, for the language barrier there is probably some variation of charm for learning languages more quickly, or even a potion. My guess is lots of schools use a standardized language, like French for Beauxbatons or Swahili/English for Uagadou.

Personally, my sense is that the schools are more of a regional cultural grouping. Wizards/witches from a lot of groups simply don't bother with any 'standard' of education, and teach with their own methods not in a boarding school style setting.

As for numbers, I would say it would probably be better if we ended up with 17 schools. It fits with the narrative of 17 being the coming of age for wizards and witches too.

** So out of 10,000 people in magical Britain, let's break down the main groups/occupational distribution.

*Students*

We've got (assuming the numbers for Harry's year are more or less in line with the other years) around ~12 students per house at every year level at Hogwarts. That gives us ~48 students per year, and ~336 students altogether. That actually seems low, of anything, compared to the overall population of magical Britain, if you assume that almost every British wizard goes to Hogwarts rather than another school. That's only 3% of the population, but that should be pretty much everyone between the ages of 10 and 18. Even with the assumption that wizards live longer then muggles and the age distributions would be a bit skewed, that seems low. Based off of current numbers in the UK, children between 10 and 17 make up about 9.5% of the population. I suppose the lifespan differences between wizards and muggles, along with the fact that Harry's generation was born in a time of crisis and war, that number would likely drop, but a 70% decrease seems unlikely.

Maybe we can assume that the number should be closer to 7% of the population, and those extra ~350 children are either being homeschooled or enrolled at another magical school, whether local or abroad. That's admittedly a pretty generous assumption, though.

So 7% of the population, roughly 700 people, are in school.

*Ministry employees*

With the remaining 9,300 citizens of magical Britain, I think a significant chunk would be minister employees. The Ministry might seem too big for the population, but when they've got to deal with the entirety of magical Britain, maintain the statute of secrecy, and oversee a large community that must blend in seamlessly in the background of the muggle world, there's a lot to cover.

Just out of the departments that are specifically mentioned, there's the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with several other offices underneath that including the Auror office, Improper Ise of Magic Office, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, etc. Then you've got the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, the Department for the Regulatikn and Control of Magical Creatures, the Department of International Magical Cooperation, he Department of Magical Transportation, the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and the Department of Mysteries. Not to mention the Wizengamot. Even if these departments don't each have huge payrolls, they'll have a handful of people in each one. Though I do think the Wizengamot would be made up of various officials from other departments, and not specifically employing its own people. Then there's also got to be plenty that aren't specifically mentioned. Custodial and maintenance staff, various other offices with very specific day-to-day purposes, you know. I don't think it would be a stretch to say ~20% of the magical population work for the ministry.

As a relatively small “nation,” magical Britain is largely dependent on its government to keep everything running. Magical Britain covers a small geographical space, not to mention the culture is rather archaic compared to muggle life, so aside from the Ministry, there really aren't any huge businesses that demand a large workforce.

So if we assume ~20% of the population (2,000 people) work in the Ministry in some capacity, that brings us to ~27% (2,700 people) accounted for between school and government work.

*Other work*

That leaves 73% of the population, 7,300 people, unaccounted for. I think that more or less makes sense spread out among private business owners and employees, stay-at-home-parents, rich pureblood families who don't have to work, a quidditch league of around ~150 people (10 teams, 7 players and 3 backups each, and various coaches, managers, and officials), magical hospitals, etc.

Again, Magical Britain is a relatively small community. Everything seems pretty clustered. We don't really see much of anyone spread out across he countryside. Of course we should assume that there is certainly more than just Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, but they do seem to be the main hubs for business and shopping. And even then, they aren't huge places; they're more like “downtown” strips than big cities. There aren't really any big urban centers in magical Britain. Everything, aside from the Ministry, has that “small town” structure. Hell, even Hogwarts only has a staff of, what, maybe 15 people?

** I've always tried to imagine magical britain sort of like that weird 2004 movie "the village", assuming the population being around ten thousand in this case. Not in the sense that people are creepy, culty and murdery but just isolated, ignorant and strange.

The isolation of magical britain is two fold. Firstly, most magicals don't even bother to interact with muggle society and are /amazingly/ ignorant about muggle technology and culture.

Secondly, magicals apparently live in scattered enclaves around the country instead of forming a proper city. This makes things like the Daily Prophet and the Wizengamot a little more necessary.

The ministry is overloaded because it's trying to turn (probably) several dozen scattered homesteads and hamlets into something that at least /resembles/ a productive society.

The Wizengamot is just a city council. Naturally, it's populated by a mix of rich and bored (often unemployed) but ambitious assholes, and exhausted officials from city hall being pushed around or worshipping bureaucracy. They even have an underfunded policed department :D

It's kind of silly, but gives some plausibility to the stranger or convenient parts of the story. Like Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley being /right/ next to each other, Dumbledore is always nightmarishly overworked, fucking /everyone/ goes to Hogwarts, Hogwarts housing is /really/ influential to your future life, Arthur Weasley is a comedy goldmine, Voldemort is an appropriate villain for a children's story.

TLDR: magical Britain is crazy and impossible, but a smaller makes for efficient writing. Expanding the population is almost necessary for expanding some kinds of world building in fanfiction.

I remember there were some old complaints that had to do with Weasleys' ages, and those I could certainly understand.
