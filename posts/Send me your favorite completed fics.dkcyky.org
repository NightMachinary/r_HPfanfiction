** Violent gritty war with romance - The Fallout

If you haven't read The Fallout, you NEED to read it. This is Dramoine, but it is just as much a dark and gritty story about war. I have never read a book, story, fanfic, whatever that deals with war the way this one does. People die, people kill, people betray their friends to keep them safe. I absolutely recommend it. Link says its incomplete but it isn't. Apparently, the site it was originally uploaded to was taken down, so some amazing stranger was kind enough to upload it to ao3.

Angsty self insert but not a mary sue - The Reader

Self-insert, but she is charmed against speaking or doing anything to change the timeline. Definitely not a Mary Sue! She is brave and outgoing, but she isn't the best witch. She's pretty much shit at battle. Mainly a romance, but not a smutty one. It takes place over both wizarding wars, so it isn't just a Mary Sue gallivanting around Hogwarts with the Marauders.
