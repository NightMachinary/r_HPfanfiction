Movie pansy is arguably hotter than Hermione. How is it that she's relatively ignored while Hermione's parents in fanon are literally named after the actors who played Hermione and Harry? Did the fandom just collectively decide that Pansy wasn't a good character and choose to ignore her? Look at how many people like _Professor_ Snape due to, IMO, Alan Rickman! Why isn't there any love for Pansy?

Where are my Pansy ships, what are the best ones you've read?

Flagged as `Discussion`, but could just as easily be `Request`


** Alan Rickman and the writing toned Snape down a lot. Tom Felton benefited from writing. Unfortunately for Pansy, she has little screentime and when we do see her she's trying to give up Harry.

Also, I don't imagine Pansy like this at all. In my head, she's pale with a black bob, dark eyes, and an unflattering, upturned nose.

***** Yes and no. Upon first glance, Harry thinks they all look unpleasant, but Harry does "suppose" Narcissa is "beautiful."

However, narration /also/ called Pansy's face "pug-like" which, as far as I'm aware, means she has an upturned nose on an unflattering face.

** I imagine it's a fame difference, these days. Most people know who Emma Watson, Tom Felton, and Alan Rickman are, and they pop easily to mind when you try think of them.

I admit, I'm not the biggest HP Nerd, so I'm not representative of the population here, but I had to google her to find out what she looked like and had no idea she was played by four different people.

Similarly, character-wise. Hermione is a main character, Pansy is not. She's probably in the movies for less than an hour, total, I'd say.

** Allan Rickman and Tom Felton had an important role in all the 8 movies, while Scarlett Byrnes only has one scene at the end of the last movie? As mentioned by Ash_Lestrange, the movies also showed Snape and Draco in a good light, or rather a better one than the books (Snape is way more petty in the books, and nowhere near as calm as Rickman), while Pansy is only showed in what is arguably her worst moment (trying to give Harry to Voldemort).

In my opinion, the fact that just is an ass also played a role in her lack of popularity, especially compared to Daphne Greengrass (the most popular Slytherin girl in fics). While other version of her exist, Daphne is mainly used either as a "Good Slytherin", or at least as a "Neutral one" that can show Harry that not all Slytherins are like Malfoy. During this time, Pansy is just a female Draco, basically all of her appearance are her mocking someone (Hermione for her blood Status, Ron for his lack of money, Angelina Johnson for her dreads . . .). Her relation with Draco also didn't really help (easier to create new relation than change pre existing one).

For all these reasons, Pansy Parkinson fit more the archetype of the "Queen Bee", rival of the Hero's Love Interest, rather than the Love Interest itself, and her supposed beauty doesn't change than (if anything it just make her more fitting for the role). I mean, outside of Blood Purity (which is already bad), Fanon tend to treat her as the Magical Version of "Mean Girls".

** The movies /did/, in fact boost Pansy ships, with us having a different representation of her than the books. It's just that she has so little presence in the movies that it didn't change very much. Really, the only difference the movies make is that movie!Pansy isn't unflattering in terms of looks, but it didn't show us a different view on her personality like it did for, say, Snape.

By the way, IIRC movie!Pansy is played by like 6 different people, almost a new one for each year. I'm sure this didn't help.

** While Scarlett Byrne is a total babe, she only appeared in the HBP & DH movies. And Pansy has only a couple of movie scenes.

But, if you're looking for a Pansy fic, I wrote a huge one that delves deep into her character.

** Maybe unpopular opinion, but although I find the actually actress undeniably attractive in the photo you linked, in the movies she was not attractive-- I feel like the hair and makeup was done purposefully to make her look a little frumpy? i.e [[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/8/81/Pansy_Parkinson_infobox.png/revision/latest?cb=20141024191624][this official photo]]-- not sure if that is a wig or just teasing her hair to look frizzy?

** It seems obvious enough to me - she has zero redeeming qualities in the books, and the movie actress you're referring to first appears in half-blood prince for like 5 seconds. It's not as though she was there since the first movie. Why would people latch onto her, no matter how attractive she is? By that token, you can wonder why attractive extra #3 didn't get more love.

**** I agree that Draco is a terrible person, but he's a much more important character - he's been there since day one and is a big presence in the movies, so it's natural that people would be more inclined to write about him than Pansy, who's barely there at all. And Daphne is popular in fanfic because she's a glorified OC - she's not characterized at all in canon, so people can run with that. Pansy is characterized (if only on a very surface level) so she can't be used in the same way.

** I'll answer your question with a question myself:

Was there even a Pansy in the movies?

It's the first time I heard about it. Was she even named in the movie? or just one of those characters you just know who they are thanks to the credits?

In any case, just like in the novels, besides being a named character, her screentime seems to be almost zero or uninportant in the movie, so obviously that didnt really boosted her popularity.

** The main reason's why are two fold I think. Firstly, she was only in the films for /maybe/ a few minutes total, and had less than ten lines of dialogue. Secondly, in the books she has some minor characterisation.

Both of these don't make for a good combination. The first on its own might be worked around. But with the second, making Pansy into a primary character becomes more difficult.

Because she has had some characterisation, anyone writing for her has to either ignore that, or work around it. The problem is that there are blank slate characters, like Daphne Greengrass, that can fill the position of female Slytherin love interest without doing either of those things.

The other characters you mentioned are so well represented, not just because of their on screen presence (though no doubt it contributed), but because they're fully realised characters. Pansy just happens to be one of those unfortunate characters stuck in the no mans land between that and no characterisation.

** It's not a Harry/Pansy ship (well, technically that's not ruled out, there's no ship for Harry as yet), but she's a major heroic character in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels.

It's a very different Harry, in quite a different world, where Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism. So, lots more families are alive and well; the Potters, the Blacks, the Longbottoms, the Lestranges, the Rosiers, and so forth. Hogwarts is now Pureblood-only, which would keep Harry out. But she was raised by Marauders, and so was her cousin; they won't keep her out that easily.

Pansy is quite different from canon; with only Pureblood students, there isn't the racial tension that there was in canon. Without that, she actually turns out to be a nice person.
