I've recently finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966?view_full_work=true][The Second String]] and absolutely loved it. Romance was only in the background, but I'm not against romance-centric fics either. No preference for characters or ships! Just looking for something exciting and magical. The Arithmancer is another similar fic I enjoyed a lot that fits my request.

Thanks in advance!


** Oh the second string is so damn good. Perhaps Flight. It has really cool worldbuilding in terms of dark magic as it's mostly from Voldemorts pov.

#+begin_quote
  A magical accident in the Time Room leaves Harry and Voldemort stranded in the past. Harry learns that nothing about the magical world in the 1940s is truly familiar, and Voldemort discovers there's much more to Harry than he ever suspected.
