#+begin_quote
  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.

  When Bella Potter meets Death, she takes him up on his offer to be placed in a parallel universe. She wakes up to find herself in Godric's Hollow on October 31st, 1981. Her mission now is to save & protect Harry, and give him the life that she never had. Simple, right? But with a certain doglike man annoying her, universe hopping doesn't seem all that easy anymore.
