It's vague but I want to find a story where hufflepuffs get a chance to shine/kick serious ass.


** I can think of plenty of fics that have great Hufflepuff moments, but not a ton where it's the main focus.

Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) has a very lazy Harry. Who, uh, doesn't exactly shine, so much as hack together something that someone else will shine with so he doesn't need to bother.

Linkffn(Thinking in Little Green Boxes) features Harry raised by comic Deadpool, and at one point he gives Cedric a copy of the Communist Manifesto, converting the entire house to the glorious revolution. It doesn't go much of anywhere, it's a side joke on one chapter.

Linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy), the second story of the Mischief's Heir series, had a Hufflepuff Fight Club among other secrets of Hogwarts.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** There are two weird Hufflepuff-centric stories (or series) I really like:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351]] Holly at Hogwarts. Holly Wycliff (daughter of Dudley Dursley; yeah, because of conspiracy during the war, all Dursleys changed their names and they go now under Wycliff) is a proud Hufflepuff and so that house is very lovingly described. These stories are one of the best fanfiction stories I have read.
- [[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter]] and [[https://www.wattpad.com/192985075-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter-1][Dursley's Dilemma]] are two stories about Dudley's daughter in Hufflepuff, but this is very low-on-drama more high-school-teen-novel, but nicely done (and the sequel is still unfinished). However, a lot of the story is centred about overcoming stereotypes and low self-esteem of the Hugglepuff house.

** I really enjoyed the dynamics of Hufflepuff in the Tinkerer. They can be crafty, resourceful and intimidating when they need to be.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12461030/1/The-Tinkerer]])

This is a Tom Riddle in Hufflepuff one-shot.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
