This fic tickles all my fancy, I'm looking for Harry just doing his own thing, or discovering his magic at a young age, or anything similar to this fic and please no romance.

*** What kind of fairies? Are they canon-style, Tinker-Bell-sized fairies, or the Tolkien-Elves-like Fae who clearly don't exist in canon but come up sometimes in fanfiction?

**** I don't know why you've italicized slash but it doesn't distract from the charm of the story. It's a really fun fic.

***** Italics are often used for emphasis, so in this case, it appears [[/u/the_long_way_round25]] was emphasizing the word "slash." I hope that helps.
