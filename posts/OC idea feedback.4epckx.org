So I have an inkling of an idea for a 6th year AU. One of the main side characters is supposed to be the DADA teacher. He is a spy from the Magical Branch of the CIA, cover story to be determined (Like why he applied for the job). He spent the last 10 years in hotspots for dark wizards and threats to US interests (Somalia, Bosnia, ect.) dealing with the problems they posed. When news of Voldemort's return reached US officials they wanted more information and it's his job to get that. My headcanon about the magical US is that from 1939 to 1941 FRD tried increasingly hard to get the US magical population to support the mundane US government and they refused. On Monday December 8th 1941 FDR drafted all of age magicals into the Army and used the threat of exposing them to the world at large and branding them traitors to get the magical population to fall in line. FDR basically told the magicals they are US citizens and to get behind his government or get out of the country. Relations where rocky for the first few years until mixed magical and mundane units saw combat. They came back and cooperation between the two in covert operations helped in the Cold War.

How do I avoid major OC pitfalls? How do I avoid muggle and American overpowering and glorification? He needs to be competent but I don't want him overpowered.

Thank you for any advice you can leave.


** What I'd recommend is make sure there are sufficiently powerful antagonists (and I mean plural because one antagonist and a bunch of pushovers means the rest of your story will probably be uninteresting) who can counter your OC. Then it honestly doesn't matter if America's more powerful or your OC uses muggle tools that can sometimes be overpowered compared to magic, because there's interesting, powerful obstacles in the way of your protaganist.

Also, if you avoid creating too much new magical theory (for example, bullets passing straight through magical shields always struck me as ridiculous), then you'll probably avoid most of they tropey American power-wank.

*** I agree with the bullet thing. Now a bullet that there isn't a sheild to stop before firing is still dangerous.

** My biggest advice is always this: every character must have a flaw. For instance, your character sounds like he will be incredibly intelligent and able to strategize on the fly (in battle). This means his reflexes are probably amazing, but what if his magical "level" is low? As in he has trouble casting strong/complicated spells and has to rely on his creativity with simple, "normal" spells and the like. That would make for a very interesting teaching style too.

*** It would. I picture him as more caring about results than textbook following (much to Hermione's consternation) I also imagine for the 6th year final being a MIT style hack where each house has to pull one off. 5,7 get a pass on that because of tests and younger don't know enough to succeed. I never pictured him as a duelist. More of a stealth and misdirection guy as well

** For every strength, you need to add a weakness. You must also consider why he should be introduced to the story. Could it work without him? If so, he shouldn't be there.

Make sure he has secrets, regrets, joys, hobbies. They don't need to be thrown in there explicitly, but you should know of them and have them in mind.

** That sounds like a really interesting story. I would love to read it.

In addition to what others said, I'd say make him have some sort of moral failing so he conflicts with the canon characters. Maybe he's really ruthless and infamous for killing people when he doesn't have to. Maybe he occasionally uses dark magic.

Other than that, it always annoys me when an OC is universally liked. The "OMFG so hawt," good at everything, wise yet dashing characters aren't well-developed in my opinion, so if someone has a flaw, I like to see someone hate them for it. Bonus points if it's a respected character.

** FDR's mind would be changed--or spread across the wall--very quickly.
