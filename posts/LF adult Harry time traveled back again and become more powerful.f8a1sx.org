(And i first use this, reddit, so hmm am i doing well now? )

Anyway, i want some fics that about

Harry won the battle, grew up, became more powerful, time traveled, but knew everything, so not as a Dumbledore's player(?), fight independently(?), more smartly, and easily.

Im sorry that im not good at english,,


** Your English is fine. Welcome.

There are different kinds of time travel. In this, he goes back as a powerful adult, to before he was born. It's a fun one, with ridiculously overpowered battles.

There's also a different type of time travel, where an adult mind goes back to inhabit their younger body. This is called the “Peggy Sue trope” after a movie that used this trope. I can't think of a good Harry Peggy Sue at the moment, but I'm sure people here can recommend some.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
