I always read fics where Harry and the people close to him are rude, wary, or dislike Dumbledore. I really don't understand why. Dumbledore in the books cares about every single student so much he'd attack Aurors over Marrietta Edgcombe and really isn't as biased as you'd think. He gave a shit ton of house point to Harry, Ron, and Hermoine for doing brave chivalrous acts that literally stopped Voldemort like wtf do you expect. Also if you count how many unfair points snape takes of the other houses and rewards his own he basically cheats his way to victory every year because he's petty enough to do what other teachers don't yet Snape is usually held in such high regard but Dumbledore who's canon self cares for everyone and who would sacarfice his favourite student and one of his closest friends so that everyone in the wizarding world can have peace but umm nah he's a controlling prick who thinks everyone's a chess piece.

I'm not saying Dumbledore's actions are good but you're kidding me if 2 lives > thousands of lives simply because you like and know the characters. It's like foot's trolley and clearly, Dumbledores's believes in utiltaiarnism since he wants the 'greatest good for the greatest number' or he wants to 'minimise suffering'


** To give the benefit of the doubt to most authors, Dumbledore presents a difficult problem as the most powerful wizard in the world, leaving him as the good guy who would happily solve Harry's problems can kinda kill the dramatic pacing of the story. JK herself had to jump trough hoops to not have Dumbledore solve everything for Harry, there's a reason the wise old mentor needs to die every story. Of course there are plenty of people that assert that Dumbledore as evil based on canon, as if Rowling secretly was intending it the whole time. Partially Kissed Hero anyone?

** I think a lot of Dumbledore-hate is actually displaced worldbuilding-hate.

Which is to say:

- Within the books, Dumbledore explains his actions as being justified as being necessary to keep Harry alive.

- The reader knows basically nothing about magic, the limits of what it can do, and the ways it can be used to subvert other pieces of protective magic. Therefore the reader has to take Dumbledore at his word that any other form of protection would have resulted in Harry's death, because Dumbledore is an authority on magic and the reader is not. Any objection the reader might come up with - for example, the Fidelius - we have to assume Dumbledore has considered and, in his superior knowledge, discarded as a possibility.

- Similarly, the reader knows basically nothing about the political situation post-1981. So again, the reader has to simply take Dumbledore at his word that the political situation was such that an unprotected Harry was vulnerable, because we have no basis on which we can disagree.

- However, many readers /want/ to disagree with Dumbledore, because they don't like the idea that it might be necessary to accept the abuse of a child as the lesser of two evils (the alternative being a dead child). They want to write fix-it fics where everything can be sunshine and daisies if only characters make the right choices.

- Many fanfic authors therefore make Dumbledore stupid and/or evil as a way to avoid having to face the dilemma that Dumbledore canonically faced. Once Dumbledore's evil and/or stupidity is identified, the correct choices can be made and everyone can be happy.

- However, probably the better response would be to change the worldbuilding to create an AU where alternatives were, in fact, possible, and then have your Dumbledore act appropriately within this AU, in accordance with his intended characterisation as a man attempting to make the best of a bad situation.

*** I find it very dishonest to try to blame fanfic writers for Rowling's shitty writing. As someone else, you're just handwaving issues with Dumbledore characterization and make it look like people didn't get it with Dumbledore.

Saying that Dumbledore is an intelligent and competent character in Canon is just plain right dishonest. It's like considering that Riddle was a genius in canon after his plan in GOF.

It's not that many readers want to disagree with Dumbledore, it's simply that many readers are not totally stupid. Not everyone chose to "kinda forget" about stupidity because they like a story.

You're conflating "flawed character" with "character holding the idiot ball for plot convenience and/or another author fiat". It's totally disingenuous to do that especially since you're calling out fanfic writers who do that too.

Rowling made mistakes and people try to cope with it. Some people obviously are fine with it and don't mind at all seeing so-called geniuses never doing anything remotely smart during the whole story, other people have a lower suspension of disbelief and start calling shitty writing out.

****** Voldemort's defeat has to do with the fact that unlike you, Dumbledore understands that the Harry Potter universe works on fairy tale logic and that fate will ensure a poetic victory for the righteous, provided they do not falter on the path of righteousness. Harry Potter is a Narnia-esque fable where victory comes through deep, ancient magic - which is to say, plot armour built into the universe which favours good over evil. The deus ex machina was not luck, it was the power of a whole soul against a tattered one, the power of the righteous against the evil, the power of sacrifice against greed. Moral decisions are not magically neutral in the HP world, and Dumbledore understood this.

You may well dislike this fictional universe. Certainly I do not write the HP universe that way when I write fanfic. But we must realise that when we write the HP universe as a cold, mechanistic, morally neutral universe (i.e. as a universe which behaves like the real world), we are writing an AU, not the canonical world.

And when we write AUs, it is normal to adjust character actions to take account of the fact that they are now occupying a different universe to the one in which their original actions occurred in. It's like a translation exercise - you look at a character in canon, see what their intended interpretation was, within that universe, and translate their actions into your new, AU universe in order to achieve the same interpretation. Dumbledore's canon actions make sense within the universe they occurred in. Similarly, when you write an AU universe, you should write a Dumbledore whose actions make sense within that universe.

The Deus Ex Machina was a plot armor. You're basically saying that Dumbledore knew that Harry would win because the plot says so. You're not making your case here.

I globally agree with what you're saying here, though.

I called you out because I found that not fair at all to blame fanfic writers instead of saying where the problem truly lies.

As I say to someone else, I personally don't mind at all the kind of tropes that come with children's books and fairy tales. It comes with the genre after all and it's not inherently bad per se.

The thing is, HP suffers from a changing of tone throughout the series. The first 3 books have a fairy tale logic true and true, the following ones are more YA than fairy tales.

You add the fact that Rowling subordinated character consistency and world consistency to plot convenience and you end up with authors who have to do a mental gymnastic to give Dumbledore some consistency.

Not everyone is a good translator. However, to be fair, it's hard to translate such a mess.

** Dumbledore is the character most impacted by the tonal shifts in the books. The first 3-4 books are very much roald dahl inspired, with adults being incompetent, children solving things, a wacky world, etc. That all works wonderfully for childrens books, and in those we don't have to worry about how Dumbledore put Harry out on a doorstep, had defenses for the Philosopher's Stone that a first year could breach, couldn't figure out that it was a Basilisk, etc.

However, the books take a turn after Voldemort returns, and as Harry (and presumably the main audience) grew up. They become more adult, more 'realistic' in a way - and that presents a major issue with Dumbledore, given his earlier actions. We also start to see more of his manipulative side in the later books.

Much of the dislike for Dumbledore comes from taking that later aspect of him, and then looking at the earlier books in the same light - which makes him look /very/ bad, as the primary authority figure that has to be incompetent for the children heroes to solve things.

On the whole, Dumbledore in canon is manipulative & can be seen to have engineered a situation for Harry to die to save the world. (Or, depending on one's interpretation, he tried to set up a situation such that Harry would /survive/ that death). But that plan doesn't necessarily strike everyone as being the only possibility, and relies a lot on the reader accepting that Dumbledore is so smart/competent that the other possibilities he dismissed weren't feasible. Which, if one doesn't subscribe to that notion, can make Dumbledore seem even more deluded/self-aggrandizing/manipulative.

*** Your forgetting the prophecy, Dumbledore knowing about Voldemort having hocruxes leading him figure out that Harry literally needed to die on principle for them to even defeat Voldemort he also wanted to make sure Harry actually had an childhood with some good memories and of Dumbledore is smart enough to be able to stall time for a future Harry and Hermoine I can't imagine he's stupid enough to not know how weak the defence was or that Sirius would never kill Harry. Dumbledore is manipulative but it's not like the people he controls are saints even Harry becomes a power seeking monster for a little bit before realising that if he does that like Dumbledore or Voldemort he'll become like them and as much as Harry likes Dumbledore he doesn't want to be him but he respects him enough to name his son after him.

**** That's part of what I mean - for you, the prophecy and your opinion of Dumbledore is enough that you accept his view that his actions were not just correct, but the only/best way to do it. That is why you seem to find it difficult why others would heavily disagree.

In my case, I don't like prophecies being super deterministic, and I don't accept that the only possibility for removing the Horcrux in Harry is for Voldemort to personally kill him. That's more on JKR/worldbuilding than anything else, obviously, but others can easily put it in-universe on Dumbledore since he's the author mouthpiece for that part of the plot.

Anyways, Dumbledore's decision making is quite suspect during the series, and that leads some people to dislike him.. and the manipulative tendencies he has for what he thinks is the correct path. In a series that was all children's books, or all YA books, perhaps he could have been written in a way that was consistent enough that no one would have that big of a negative opinion of him. But as is, that's not the case.

** I'm simply going to post a great answer to this question made by someone else:

#+begin_quote
  */Because JK Rowling subordinated character consistency and world consistency to plot convenience. This, out of universe, leads to a series of books with some clear flaws. In-universe, however, without the ability to cite JK Rowling or plot reasons, the only logical explanation is that Dumbledore is either not as intelligent as he's said to be or not as moral as he's said to be./*

  Simple example: in Philosopher's Stone, the Trio must go after Quirrell themselves because Dumbledore flew to the Ministry instead of apparating, flooing, portkeying, phoenix travelling or using a house elf. Why? Out of universe, the answer is "JK hadn't invented apparition, floo, house elf travel or Phoenix travel yet". But you can't give that explanation in-universe. So instead we get "because Dumbledore is a moron who didn't think that leaving Hogwarts unprotected for hours was a silly idea when instant teleportation exists" or "because Dumbledore deliberately manipulated events so that Harry would face Quirrell".

  Another example that I see a lot: in Chamber of Secrets, Hermione figures out that the monster is a Basilisk in a few months of research, at age 12. Dumbledore, who's older, wiser, smarter, more magically knowledgeable, and has the extra clues of knowing Tom Riddle opened the Chamber, knowing Myrtle was the victim, being able to easily learn that the spiders were fleeing etc has no clue until Harry tells him. How did he not, in the 50+ years since Myrtle, speak to her and find out about the glowing yellow eyes? How did he not realise that the snake house's snake-speaking founder's monster, commanded by the snake-speaking Voldemort, which killed instantly but also could petrify, has glowing yellow eyes, and mysteriously is attacking around the same time all Hagrid's roosters are dead and the spiders are fleeing, was a Basilisk? Yet Hermione did, with less information? Again, out of universe the answer is "JK needed a plot to happen, and it would have been boring if Dumbledore closed and evacuated Hogwarts before killing the Basilisk easily with a rooster after the first petrifaction". But in-universe, without that excuse, you have to contrive a reason. So we get "Dumbledore is less intelligent than a 12 year old" or "Dumbledore could have figured out it was a Basilisk, but didn't bother" or "Dumbledore knew it was a Basilisk but didn't tell anyone or do anything for malicious/manipulative reasons".

  Simply put, for JK the most important thing is that the plot beats she's envisioned take place. If, to get there, she has to ignore things she's already said, or invent some new magic that retroactively makes plot holes, or just have characters act in ways that are strange or inconsistent, then she shrugs and does it anyway. But when writing fanfic, unlike literary analysis, you can't reference that and so you have to make it consistent and with Dumbles, that often means bashing.

If you're writing fanfic, if you want the fic to be self consistent and don't want to handwave the loopholes, you really have to tweak a few things if you want Dumbledore to be a good guy.

Looking at the story in a Doylist fashion, you can see that he's supposed to be "Flawed but Good". Looked at Watsonianly, the old quote about coincidence, happenstance, and enemy action applies. Dumbledore screwed up in major, major ways far more than three times.

And to call Dumbledore 'literally perfect' is baffling to me. He made so many mistakes throughout the series, particularly in OOTP. He even admitted to Harry how badly he had failed him.

After rereading the books several times it's my opinion that the trio succeeded in spite of Dumbledore, not because of him. That doesn't make him a bad person, but he failed multiple times and was manipulative throughout.

**** Welp, one must kind of see how book one doesn't really contain the fleshed out characters, it was a children's tale with 1 dimensional storytelling and barely if any plot, don't forget we barely have any indication of the blood purity debate even. So yeah I mostly waive this scene as completely out of the book, it is a great intro, much better than most it doesn't have to be logical.

OOTP I disagree with, Dumbledore at this time is commander in chief of the good guys, but the good guys don't like staying inside for their own protection even though there really is enough shit going around. And ofcourse Harry doesn't get information that could get to Voldemort and would compromise lives, he is 15 years old, and by all indications not the brightest bulb.

I guess you could blame Dumbledore for Harry's first 11 years, or you can blame the people who abuse their nephews but aren't as fleshed out in the story. Many people forget that the Dursleys could easily have kicked Harry out at any time, and then there is no protection for him, which was proven to hold against Voldemort.

Dumbledore other than that is just as involved with the trio as he has to be, he gives Harry all the information he has, but ensures Harry doesn't get the Hallows part all at once, since he suspected Harry would go insane (and he in fact nearly did at that time it was an important plot point), and that the protagonist doesn't hunt the horcruxes knowing he is a dead man, which is on the obvious side.

Therefore, I hate Dumbledore right from the start. This supposedly all powerful and wise person dumped the hope of his nation into abusive household and just hoped for the best, while he sat there and did nothing for ten years? What kind of fucking retard is that?

Plenty of readers saw through the charade of the in-book propaganda such as "the wisest wizard" and "the greatest headmaster", and they write Dumbledore accordingly in their fanfics.

Unfortunately, dumbing down a dumbed down plot device character further is not conducive of making the story better. Here I disagree vehemently with these authors. *I'd like to see a Dumbledore who's up to this game, who faces great odds against both Voldemort and a malicious Ministry, and who makes mistakes but agonized over them.*

By informing him of the prophecy, he would have the motivation to basically be as hard working in school like Tom Riddle was. He would have been better prepared. The Horcrux can wait so no need to inform him that basically he needs to make a little visit to the limbo between death and life. And technically Harry could eleminate the Horcrux in his scar by fracturing his own soul and push the fragment out, after that it is only a case of remorse.

****** But Harry didn't kill Voldemort. Voldemort killed himself when his killing curse was returned to him by an expelliarmus. On the parents part, the resurrection stone is myth and legend. It could have very well been, something summoned from Harry own view of his parents. And even if not, Harry parents are Gryffindors so they would prefer Harry to improvise along his adventures like a brainless Gryffindor. A good parent in this situation would have been someone from Slytherin.

** Canon Dumbledore is a pretty complex character and most fanfics authors seem to /hate/ complexity. Which means that every character they use must either be perfect or evil/ incompetent. :

- Hermione is not a good friend that can sometimes be an annoying know it all, she is the most perfect girl either that everyone should love, and also she is extremely hot.
- Ron is not a loyal friend who, despites having some low, was always there when it counted. He is a greedy idiot who was only friend with Harry for the money.
- Draco Malfoy is not the magical equivalent of the Hitler Youth, raised to Mugleborn but who had a change of heart when he finaly witnessed what purging the magical world truly meant (not without doing a faire share of damages himself). He is a very nice guy who would have been a way better friend to Harry than Ron despites representing everything he hates (being rich and/or hot are really the best character traits ever).
- Snape is not a spiteful man who made every bad decision imaginable, but who still somehow managed to do good in the end. He is a very hot guy (starting to see a patern there) who could have been an amazing mentor to Harry if he had just [insert impossible action there]. Also he was only a poor victim of James Potter who never tried to defend himself or retaliated, and Lily should have chosen him.

Anyways, Fanon characters tend to be a lot less complex than canon, and either perfect or terrible. And because of his role (the old sage with a lot of magical and political power, that had to take some difficult decision during the wars), it's pretty easy to make him some kind of secret antagonist. Also, he is very old and not hot, which means that he is (fortunaly) very rarely considered as a ship for Harry, which doesn't play in his favor to become a "good" character.

*** No. People bash Dumbledore because his actions during the whole series are dubious at best. Because Rowling switched from children's books to YA. In children's books, "adults are incompetent" is a trope that people don't mind since it comes with the genre.

The thing is once you start to switch to YA, and you see that the adults in HP just dropped the ball. Rowling wrote an inconsistent series that experiences serious growing pains as a result of adapting from children's fantasy to darker general audience fiction.

So fanfic writers have to do a mental gymnastic to try to give some consistency to Dumbledore.

You can't have the most supa dupa wizard to be at the same time a genius while being so incompetent the whole time. Making blunder even someone with average intelligence wouldn't make.

In fact, Dumbledore and Riddle suffer from the same problems.

**** I agree about the effects of the transition. However, that alone doesn't explain why so many authors continuously makes the decision to write Dumbledore in the worst possible light.

I believe one of the main reasons we see so much Dumbledore hate is because, people like to assume there were always better alternatives to his canon actions, and his canon inaction in some situations, were always due to progressing some sort of malicious grand plan, rather than a man that has been brought low by general melancholy, tiredness and regrets being depressed and idle.

Also, this is somewhat in the same vein as the end of my last paragraph, but still has to be said. Harry took a long time in 7th book to accept that Dumbledore, no matter how he viewed him, was a man. Some fans, it seems, never accepted that.

***** I think one consideration about canon->fanfic is that most fanfic try to give Harry more agency and make him more proactive as the fact that everything is solved by Deus Ex Machina is a common gripe with canon. To keep the stakes high, if Harry is doing more to win then everyone else needs to be doing less, therefore Dumbledore must be even more incompetent/malicious that in canon.

There is only so much room in a story for protagonists and Dumbledore usually draws the short straw.

***** Saying "Dumbledore was a man" is just handwaving the issue with his character. There is a difference between "flawed characters" and "holding the idiot ball" simply for plot convenience.

Average Joe is also a man yet he isn't considered as the most supa dupa wizard and he wouldn't make so many blunders as Dumbledore.

You can't have it both ways. Either Dumbledore is incompetent and not that smart at all or he isn't as moral as he's said to be. Saying that Dumbledore was depressed could be an explanation, however, I don't think depression makes people losing common sense, especially if they are supposed to be geniuses.

As I said just like Riddle, Dumbledore suffers from the same pitfall. Everyone says they are supa dupa genius while at the same time we never saw them do something remotely that smart, nevermind genius level. /Au contraire/ we saw them doing stupid things all the time or "meh".

Harry spent his time having his head so far up Dumbledore's ass, like every good guy in the series, while Dumbledore held the idiot ball so many times. He ended up naming his son Albus Severus...

What I'm saying is that even with all of that one could see him as Harry did, like a godly being who is the wisest, strongest and can do anything and everything with none of it being wrong, whose only worry in life is to help Harry. And when one realizes he wasn't all that one thought him as, one could either accept that he was a man, perhaps greater than most, but still a man or one could refuse and hate him.

Is not an answer (at least not a good one) to the question *Why do people get annoyed at Dumbledore and hate on him?*

For example: Harry's scar horcrux. In canon we're told that what happened was the sole possible circumstance Harry could have survived its destruction. In fanfics we invent other ways for its destruction that wouldn't harm Harry at all. Great news! Harry doesn't have to go thorough all that bs, but what is that? Is that Dumbledore still planning the same canon plan?

Well, maybe he doesn't know about the new way we invented? Oh! He does!

Then why is h... wait a minute did you just say he also expects Harry to permanently die?

Why is Dumbledore twirling his mustache and doing all of this? Oh he was somewhat inconsistent and didn't do as much as you expected/wished in canon. And that is relevant to the horrible decisions he's making in this major AU story in what way?

You want people to "kinda forgot" about Dumbledore inconsistency as a character because Harry is still Dumbledore boys.

That doesn't make any goddamn sense. You're trying to handwave things is because YOU don't mind at all Rowling fiat and shitty writing. You like the whole thing as it is, be my guess, just don't expect people to "kinda forgot" about it just because Harry and you are fine with it.

I already gave the answer to that question, you simply quoted the wrong thing:

/People bash Dumbledore because his actions during the whole series are dubious at best. Because Rowling switched from children's books to YA./

/The thing is once you start to switch to YA, and you see that the adults in HP just dropped the ball./

I don't really get what you're trying to prove with your example, which truth be told doesn't make much sense, however, you seem to believe that Dumbledore was "somewhat inconsistent" like we are making that whole thing up.

If you think people complain about Dumbledore because of wishful thinking or failed expectation, let me tell you that you maybe don't know what intelligence and competency actually mean and entail.

******** You keep coming at me as if I'm defending Dumbledore or Rowling for that matter. I'm not and don't understand why you keep assuming that.

Let's say, Dumbledore in canon, had the options A or B and for whatever reason let's say due to Rowling's 'shitty writing' or before tone change it wasn't as important so, there isn't a much better option C.

For many people there just can't not be option C, so they assume it was there, but then the question becomes "Why didn't Dumbledore chose it?"

1- Dumbledore even with his brilliance was not a god and can make mistakes.

2- Dumbledore was a malicious evil man with grand plans.

Now, what I'm saying is that, reason why so many people go with the option 2 at almost every opportunity can not be explained by Rowling's 'shitty writing' alone. Not if they can just as easily make other assumptions such as assuming Dumbledore would have chosen the imagined option C in the first place.

You keep forgetting that Dumbledore, just like Riddle, nearly never showed that he was the genius that everyone claimed he was. Once again you're conflating "flawed character" with "holding the idiot ball 24/7" while everyone says you're a genius.

I keep coming at you because of this. Your first option is basically an understatement of what happened in Canon. Once again Dumbledore never showed something remotely smart, nevermind genius-level during the whole series. /Au contraire/ he spent his time making blunders or just "meh" at best. He made mistakes that even average Joe wouldn't make because of basic common sense.

You can be a genius and be more stupid than the average Joe at the same time. Nobody is complaining because Dumbledore wasn't a God as you put it. People complain because Dumbledore's characterization is totally inconsistent.

People go for option 2 because either Dumbledore is incompetent and a fraud or he isn't as moral as people claim he is. People chose option 2 because it's easier to believe he is competent.

** As someone who is writing a version of Dumbledore that people seem to love to hate (I would call my Dumbledore more of a misguided, self-righteous, living with PTSD Dumbledore), I think a lot of it comes from taking a critical look at Dumbledore and realizing that a lot of what he did in the books was done to drive the plot and create an environment where the trio and others could operate without an all-powerful wizard constantly showing up and fighting their battles for them, and maintain the mystery elements of the story. However, this created a lot of issues that are now valid sources of complaints.

Like, why did Dumbledore leave Harry with an abusive family for years? Why did he KEEP sending him back there? The bond of blood isn't enough of a justification. Why did Dumbledore decide the best way to protect the philosopher's stone was to create a labyrinth of challenges that could be accessed by a bunch of 11 year olds and included a violent three-headed dog who could have mauled them to death? Again, these were things that were done to drive the plot and keep things interesting. This tactic continues up until DH, where Dumbledore decided not to share his plans for Voldemort's defeat with anyone, to just let it all play out, and send Harry off to potentially face his death alone. We all love Harry and there's a lot of anger surrounding the questionable decisions of a man who was supposed to have his best interests at heart, and left him struggling to understand what to do next.

In fan fiction, these complaints get amplified, and things get really twisted. Dumbledore goes from being a complex character to painfully one dimensional. I've seen a lot of evil, manipulative Dumbledores. I am not into the Dumbledores who are dumbed down, try to steal Harry's life/fortune, or that go Death Eater and kill people for no reason. Dumbledore is a lot of things, but his canon self is not dumb, or motivated by money or blood purity. He's a man who has seen the worst side of the magical world and tried so hard, so many times, to do what is right, even when he fails. I think the best Dumbledores are the ones that explore that side of him, the often secretive, misguided, and human Dumbledore who's worst fear is the rise of another Tom Riddle, who is working to prevent another all-out war in the only way he knows how, with his flaws along for the ride.
