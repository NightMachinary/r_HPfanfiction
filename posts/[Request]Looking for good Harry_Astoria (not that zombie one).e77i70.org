Title. I've done searches here and on ffn and haven't found anything good besides a single, short oneshot by ShayaLonnie (although I did enjoy it). Preferably very good writing and characterization with no bashing of anyone (any kind of bashing, even on characters I dislike, tends to ruin my immersion), but honestly I'll take what I can get considering how rare this pairing seems to be. Absolutely no bad indy harry "fuck dumbles and all my loyal friends because triwizard tournament" stuff though.

I beg for something good; and if you're an author and were considering writing something in this vein, please do.


** I suppose Heterochromatic fits, though it is a....unique version of that pairing

** It really does seem to be a rare pairing. I only found a single one shot in my favourites, but here it is:

  Not all scars are physical. Harry knows that particular truth very well and has long since stopped trying to piece together the shattered remnants of his life after the war. When Astoria Greengrass tips the balance of his house of cards Harry is forced to choose between continuing his spiral or...to start trying to heal. Mild AU, EWE.

** That one by ShayaLoonie is great. Hope it wasn't a one-shot though.
