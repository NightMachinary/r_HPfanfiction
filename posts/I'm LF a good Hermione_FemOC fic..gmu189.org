To start, even though I would prefer it to be an OC if what I ask for can't be found with an OC feel free to change some genders, involve an already existing character, or get some time travel shenanigans going on.

Basically what I'm looking for length wise is something similar to Bound With Silver Threads by Snakequeen-in-Norway but obviously set during the books and with a bit more action than that. It's a bit long but something going up through the years would give enough time to properly flesh out and develop characters and relationships.

Doesn't matter to me if they start in the same year or if one is a bit older, but having them the same age makes any Third/Fourth year puberty angst a bit more interesting and entertaining seeing as they'd both be going through changes.

Slight preference for bashing Ron would be nice but otherwise bashes don't matter to me as long as they aren't over the top or too ooc and background relationships are whatever as long as they remain /background/.

If possible I'd like it to be as non-bullshit as possible. I'd like it to acknowledge the social aspects and effects of the relationship. Whether it's OK to open about it, friends and relationships being lost, things like that. The OC being Pureblood would also add some interesting opportunities (arranged marriages and other things), especially if they have those Pureblood mentalities in the beginning.

Honestly whatever adds drama but keeps it real.

Or at least as real as it can get in a world of magic.

Smut is fine as long as it isn't too over the top and it doesn't devolve the characters into sex hungry fiends. Like I said before, keep it real.

A bit much and very specific. Obviously I'm not gonna get everything I want but whatever you guys find is sure to be really nice. I'll be looking as well but having multiple people doing it would help a lot.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/692052][This series]] has Kyuubi from Naruto born into the body of a female Harry who eventually ends up with Hermione. It's not complete but I really enjoyed it. (The romance doesn't start until the second fic.)

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]
