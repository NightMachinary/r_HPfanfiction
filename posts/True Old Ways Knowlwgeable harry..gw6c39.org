Instead of being raised by the dursleys, a pair of muggles find him on the doorstep and raise him. These muggles also practice wiccan. They raise him the old ways before he goes to hogwarts,

Bonus points if knowing wiccan help him in any classes, as well as cookies if the wiccan muggles aren't muggles and are instead magical characters from tv/films/games/books. Etc.


** Harry is picked up and brought to America by the OG Charmed Ones.

"But don't fret my dear boy, for you have the power he knows not."

"I don't about myself, Headmaster. But my mum and aunts Phoebe and Preu have the Power of Three. Plus I think Aunt Phoebe is dating a demon and my dad is a Whitelighter. Do you think they could help?"

"What? Don't you live with your Aunt Petunia?"

"Who?"

Dumbledore faints.

** Thelema took Golden Dawn Hermeticism from a upper-crusty occult dabbler club to a more hedonistic religious take, where the whole credo is “do whatever you want”. It was an excuse to do hard drugs and have orgies. Kabbalah was incorporated into Thelemic hermeticism.

** yo do know Wicca was almost entirely made up during the 1960's and is hardly accurate to anything we know about the practices of ancient pagans especially regarding Celts and Druids

*** There are better made-up religions that are older than Wicca. Thelema, created by the interesting turn of the previous century individual and heroin proponent Alastair Crowley, is much cooler. Wicca stole much of its stuff while cloth from it. Chaos Magic, created by assorted beatnicks and counterculture figures in the late 50's and early 60's, credited and inspired by to Crowley's contemporary Austin Osman Spare is much funnier. They are closely linked to Discordians, worshippers of Eris, Greek goddess of chaos. She created the golden apple that said “To the Fairest” and chucked it at the Greek pantheon, starting all kinds of well documented shit.
