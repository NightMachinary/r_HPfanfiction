Looking for any good fics where Harry is in an apprenticeship. Could be to the flamels, magical story. As long as its interresting. Prefer longer fics, and no slash for Harry. (Light slash surviveable for a straight guy is acceptable)

**** Two things have changed my opinion on ao3 recently.

1. It has epub and mobi for every story.
2. The bot's epub links are broken.

It's so much easier to go to ao3 and download the story vs manually running it through a separate downloader. Of course, this is probably more useful for me than others because I use the text to voice feature to listen while I'm driving or doing chores around the house.

***** Epub is nice with a good reader, so there is thst yes :P I personally use the fanfiction app, where its just as simple to download and read fics (and it autoupdates fics!) Never found a pleasant text to voice reader for fanfiction, can you recommend something?

** Draco664's /Apprentice Potter/ sounds like something you might be interested in. Just FYI this was written before HBP, so Blaise Zabini is a girl in this fic and Horcruxes don't figure at all in the work. Given when it was written, Harry has a bunch of cringe-worthy teenage rebelliousness and disdain for authority, but it mostly goes away after the fourth or fifth chapter.

** Linkffn(time to spare by emysabath) is super amazing! Harry here is an apprentice in spellcrafting. Apprenticeship is not the main part of the story, though I liked his master very much, but this fic is super great and interesting! And finished. Check it out!

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
