NOT ships. I want some good fics showing their friendship, preferably funny. If you've ever read "Gryffindors never die" that is exactly what I mean.


** Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84 isn't exactly funny but it's got a close-knit harry and Ron being dope-ass bounty hunters. Sadly, it seems abandoned. I dunno how to use the bot, so youll have to Google

**** This is one of the few times that that's actually funnier.

It went from "badass bounty hunters" to what'd /have/ to be a slashfic, just by one hyphen being moved.

***** That is a bot that displaces the hyphen in statements like <blank>-ass <blank> to read <blank> ass-<blank> - in speech, put the emphasis on the "ass" instead of on the surrounding words for the effect.

In this case, it turned it into "ass-bounty hunters" - which sounds like they're coming for that booty.

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
