Fics where he's an elemental or a necromancer or a telekenetic or whatever. Just not-magic, but also preferably not super OP or "you are the special one destined to save everything ever, you perfect one, you." Dark, light, grey, I don't care. Bashing and crossovers are okay, as are any non-harem/fem!male character/pottercest pairings. Thank you!

  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.
