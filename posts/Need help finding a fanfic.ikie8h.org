:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read ages ago about Harry travelling back in time.

He had dueled Voldemort at the start and went through a portal that took him to the marauders era where he was "adopted" by his grand parents, dueled someone for the Black sisters marriage contract and saved a young Narcissa from dementors in Diagon Alley.

May have two fits mixed up but anything close to the story would be appreciated.


** You are talking about Stepping Back. It's one of the better time travel fic.
