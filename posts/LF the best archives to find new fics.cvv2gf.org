** If you know authors who have clear interests judging by what she writes that align with your preferences, you can consult his/her favorites list to find fics you may like. The author doesn't even need to have written fics you find really good -- as long as interests align. For example, several months ago while exhausting FFN's list of fics with a certain pairing, I found a user whose fics I didn't really like but whose interests aligned -- and their favorite list was an excellent archive of major fics of the ship in the FFN archives.

In addition to this, there's various fic sites who targets specific pairings or characters. These work especially well when it's impossible to use FFN's own crappy search feature to find what you're looking for.
