Whether it be James, Lily, Sirius, Remus or a competent Peter.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Sorting things out?) has Lily and James becoming DEs (seperately), thanks mostly to Dumbledore being a prejudiced idiot. Oneshot.

  It's 1998, and Tom Marvolo Riddle has apparently won, so the Sorting Hat decides to travel back in time and *try* to do something about that. Alternate Universe results. Manipulative! Sorting Hat. One-off piece. Humour/Tragedy, rated 'M' for occasional swear-words or strong language. (Punctuation corrections, 9th March, 2014)

  She witnessed Magic bleed, cry and agonize. She beheld the beginning of the end. There were a lot of things Hermione Granger had never wanted. But they happened anyway. In another world, why would things be any different?AU. Dark!Sirius, HG/SB- one-sided at best.

*** Does Hermione become a loyal Death Eater as the fic progresses? I'm seven chapters in and she is hating on Riddle and the Death Eaters. I'm too invested now to not finish reading it regardless, but I'm just curious.

**** I haven't read the latest chapter (18 I think), but from where I'm caught up she's still staunchly against them, so I don't think we need to worry unless the author wants to throw a big wrench near the end. Glad you find it intriguing!

** You could try linkffn(4163446)

Pretty much everybody ends up as a Death Eater (more or less willing/loyal) at some point or other.

  First in Series. A return to the past fic. Manipulative Dumbles, Harry's got a BWL twin, Eventual Sort of Mentor Severus. Everything's going to change from the canon we know and love.

** I wouldn't exactly call him a loyal Marauder, but Peter is a very competent Death Eater in “Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin”.

To be honest I wasn't a big fan of chapter 1 of this fic, but I was instantly intrigued by chapter 2. That chapter is also when you first see Peter being much more cunning than in canon.
