Looking for lot's of good stories to read. I feel like I've read most of the popular ones, but there has to be some good stories in the other 775k fics out there.

**** Hmmm... okay.

Depends a little on what you want, I suppose. These are fic I really love, but all of them have less than a thousand reviews:

If you want something purely simple and quick and light-hearted, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7250485/1/A-Seemingly-Simple-Game][A Seemingly Simple Game]] is a quick, but funny, read. The plot is that Harry, Ron and Hermione play Muggle board games and Ron starts creating a "narrative" of the games which ends up completely ludicrous.

Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/554931/1/Harmless-and-Easily-Domesticated][Harmless and Easily Domesticated]] is a fun one; it's essentially about Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons after the Ministry have forbidden him to teach any dangerous beasts. It's a lighthearted and funny story with spot-on characterisation.

If you like Ron/Hermione, and would like to see the canon plots from their point of view instead of Harrys, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/To-Know-You-is-to-Love-You][To Know You Is To Love You]] is a really good one. Essentially it's Ron and Hermione having couple's councelling and experiencing their childhoods and Hogwarts years from each other's point of view. Really nice characterisations of Ron and Hermione here!

If you don't mind a crossover story that takes place in a different time, then we have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Ravenclaw-Codex][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]], which takes place during Phineas Nigellus Black's tenure as Headmaster in the 1800s, and where Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are called to Hogwarts to help solve a mystery. It's a pretty good story, which captures Watson's narrative voice well, and Holmes's ties to the wizarding world are really interesting once explored.

If you don't mind gender-bending stories, then there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][the Weasley Girl series]], where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and the various changes that comes about because of it. It starts out looking like it'll just be a retelling of canon, and then it goes totally off the rails... but it keeps very close to the whimsical tone and feel of the early books.

Same author also did [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4817126][Hemione Granger's Guide to Gender-Flip Fanfiction]] which is one of the most meta fanfic stories I've read. Hermione lectures Harry and Ron about fanfiction and gender-flipping of canon characters, and the fourth wall is completely demolished with the first paragraph.

Saving the best for last: If you like large-scale AU fics with a really epic feel, and canon characters in new contexts and roles, then look no further than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]. It's a brilliant story where the wizarding world is ruled by an immortal Salazar Slytherin, and society is split up into a strict caste system; the Serpent caste rules, while the lowly Mudbloods are stolen from their Muggle families and made to be casteless slaves or cannon fodder in the war against the Dark. However, when a particularly smart Mudblood named Hermione Granger is taken from her family, she sets out to try and rise in the ranks.... fic also contains Tom Riddle as the disgruntled Headmaster of Hogwarts, and Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix as wanted outlaws and rebels.

***** Alright, thanks for the recommendations again, have read them all now. Really enjoyed the Reign of the serpent, to bad it isn't complete.

The short stories were all fun reading but not enough content to really get into.

the ron/hermione love story was pretty good I suppose. Almost makes them a believable pair.

  Two people become the victims of a sordid prank that changes their lives forever. Haphne. Probably Ron, Molly, Ginny bashing.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

Threshold was my favorite of the 2 however. The awkward blushing and apologizing was funny. good recommendations, stanrick's works is pretty top notch

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Sirius has saved James from a lifetime of wedded misery to Sirius's cousin, but now they have to face the fact that what Sirius got James into instead is pretty, well. Serious.And that joke would be funny even if Sirius wasn't engaged to James, but he is, so it's extra funny.It starting to look like it might be the only thing that is, though.
