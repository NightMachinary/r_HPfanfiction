I enjoy marriage contract fics but I often have a hard time suspending my disbelief. The idea that people would sign multigenerational iron-clad marriage contracts is laughable. The idea that there is no divorce or annulments is also pretty ridiculous, the ancient romans and celts both had divorce. Trapping people in marriages possibly to totally strangers or known enemies is a great way to see your murder rate go up. Don't even get me started on Marriage Law fics.

I can look past that, like I said, I enjoy these fics and arranged marriages are a staple of romance books. My biggest problem is that 1/2 this trope seems to be missing. In 1/2 these stories the couple gets off to a rocky start but eventually falls in love and lives happily ever after. This is the category where HP marriage contracts fall. The other 1/2 the protagonist struggles to get out of it and eventually marries their true love, not the person they were arranged to marry. These stories seem to be almost non existent in HP fanfic. There are many Marriage Law fics where the protagonists either start a revolution or flee the country but I can't think of any where Harry gets out of a marriage contract.

I hope this was coherent, it's kinda a late night rant.

All that said, does anyone know of any Harry/Fleur marriage contract fics? I don't think I've ever encountered one.


** I've always wanted a story about only one of the two people involved in the contract being in love with the other.

I think it would make a fantastic tragedy. Let's say Harry has had this massive crush on a girl forever and then he learns about the marriage contract. He doesn't really like it obviously, he doesn't want to force her but it's not like either of them have a choice so it could have been worse, right?

Nope. The girl doesn't love him. She's kinda accepting of the situation, she knows it's not Harry's fault and she finds it sweet that he's trying so hard but she really just doesn't love him.

She doesn't know that Harry genuinely loves her and so she proposes that they marry but they might as well have a somewhat open relationship since the contract doesn't demand anything more than marriage and maybe a child or two and naturally Harry accepts because that's just the kind of person he is, he doesn't want to see her unhappy, even if it breaks his heart.

...so yeah. Needed to get that off my chest i think.

** ASOIF has lots of those situations where they had to marry for political reasons (basically arranged marriages), and results were often disastrous.

I'd like to see a fic in which Ginny was forced to marry someone she disliked and then pulled a Lannister. It could be a scenario where Voldemort was still defeated, but both Harry and Hermione died, and the new leader/ruler of magical Britain thought marrying a Weasley would create a durable alliance.

Both were actually not happy, and cheating on each other. Ginny and Ron were also not completely sane after losing Harry and Hermione, they first found comfort in each other and eventually got together.

19 years later, Ginny's husband was dying of Dragon Pox, different sides were preparing to seize the power. All Was NOT Well.

** A story where both parties honor the contract while simultaneously trying to break it together would be interesting to read. It would be a nice story if they fall in love in the process and after they manage to break it, they decide to enter into a relationship.

I haven't seen any H/F contract fics. Many bond fics, but no contracts, at least no pure ones. Usually they have some additional girls tacked along.

  A Harmony fic featuring a marriage law. One morning at breakfast the lives of a large chunk of Hogwarts students are changed forever. How will they cope? Will there be a happily ever after or will relationships fall apart? not canon, AU, no horcruxes, not so nice to Ron but seeking redemption for him. I apologize for a poor summary. Prologue offers more details about the story.
