So, not exactly fan fiction, but I do believe that people who write it are some of the most dedicated of the fanbase and that's why I am here. I dedicated my first ever video essay to this world I love so much, and I would love feedback on how I can improve in the future! I'm not sure I'm allowed to actually post the link, so if you reply or dm me I'll send it to you! I'm not trying to get subs here, I genuinely just want feedback on how I can improve my craft!
