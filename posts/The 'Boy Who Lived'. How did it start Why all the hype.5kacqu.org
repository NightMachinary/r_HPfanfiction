How did Harry achieve so much fame that he was instantly recognizable. It feels like someone deliberately spread out information on his appearance during his stay at the Dursleys (because who can tell how a baby would grow up like). Why was word about an easily identifiable curse mark spread when that would paint a target on his face of well known? About how Harry survived the killing curse when Voldemort's wand wasn't there to verify it having been cast? Why is it even known that there was a baby that survived that night in the first place.

The whole "He'll be famous --- a legend ... every child in our world will know his name!" and "Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember!", that prof. McG and Dumbledore were so gung-ho about seems a little presumptuous. Especially since it hadn't been a day after the accident. Why spread the description of the child? Why let people know Harry was even there in the first place when only Hagrid, Snape and Sirius were at the site? The fame could have been avoided altogether with a need to know restriction on the murder investigation, but it's growth deliberately wasn't put to an end in the beginning and was furthermore fueled by distributing what should have been private information in a closed investigation.

Harry was supposed to be living in the Dursleys in anonymity for his safety and yet he was approached by strangers in weird outfits that shook his hands at whatnot. At the time he was ignorant of any danger and yet everyone can identify Harry while he's out of the ward's protection and kill him without him even being aware of a threat.

This might seem like a conspiracy theory, but I really don't get how and why Harry Potter became a public figure in the first place, unless his name and face were deliberately disseminated among the wizarding population. It has always rubbed me the wrong way how easily everyone accepted the Boy-Who-Lived moniker.

I might be deliberating on this based on flawed logic, since hearsay had already spread around a small and closed off community, but it still feels strange considering the Potters were in hiding under a Fidelius that the news would spread so quickly without outside help.


** It's all Hagrid's fault. He spread it around immediately over drinks in a bar crawl (iirc) after the fact that little baby Harry survived the killing curse. People were already celebrating before McGonagall and Dumbledore could get a word in edgewise.

They couldn't heal the mark on Harry's forehead (again, iirc, because I read too much fanfiction), which is the symptom of a very dark curse. Voldemort killed James and Lily with a very dark curse, and I'm sure those who arrived on the scene after the fact were like, "oh yep there's no reason why Voldemort WOULDN'T NOT try to kill with his /signature move/ so he obviously done got did by his own do".

** well he has an easily identifiable scar that is visible (pretty sure there are numerous descriptions of Harry attempting to flatten his hair to hide his scar in canon) and he also looks exactly like james, who would have been fairly famous as a celebrity among those who went to Hogwarts with him and also the heir of a wealthy family

and also people don't know what Harry looks like at first (first things people say to him are that he looks like his father, but has his mother's eyes. Obviously if people already knew that they wouldn't mention it all the time)

which is also evidenced by Harry telling Stan shunpike in book 5 that he's Neville, and Stan believed him

** Like you said, Hagrid, Snape, and Sirius were at the site. Of those three Sirius immediately went on a manhunt for Peter before getting chucked in Azkaban and Snape is a secretive, anti-social bastard. That leaves us with Hagrid, who we all know is terrible at keeping secrets even when he knows they are actually secrets that need keeping. While muggle police would immediately instruct him to keep quiet, I don't think we can assume aurors would do the same especially under those circumstances. What I bet happened was that Hagrid ended up in a bar while he mourned the loss of his good friends (a bar crowded by people celebrating the end of the war) and shared his story. The notorious wizarding rumor-mill (likely thrown into overdrive by recent events) would then spread it about faster than light-speed, embellishing it every step of the way until you have the legend of the Boy-Who-Lived.

Where did the rest of the population of Godric's Hollow go? Bathilda Bagshot and the rest? Surely they would have noticed a house reduced half to rubble after James and Lily died and the fidelius broke. Hagrid couldn't have been there immediately.

Also, I don't remember Snape being there. Peter was, though. He stole away Voldemort's wand for safekeeping.

Their house was under the fidelius charm until their deaths, presumably Hagrid picks up Harry within a few hours of that. Now when the house becomes visible it would have been very late at night so potentially no one noticed until morning as the fighting would have been finished already.

I actually had to check that, during Snape's memory montage at the end of book 7 the movies inserted a few memories, one was [[https://i.imgur.com/2FaAnxB.jpg][Snape crying while hugging Lily's corpse]]. So depending on what you consider canon he may have been there. I personally consider the movies canon enough.

  "Nice costume, mister!"

  He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ...

  [..]

  They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ...

******* Huh, totally forgot that scene. Not too surprising considering it was in the middle of book seven.

You can still argue that the house the Potters resided in was charmed to repel muggles, although I do not believe there is any evidence for or against that. So that leaves the magicals to notice the chaos, so Bathilda Bagshot, an Abbott who died sometime before Christmas of 97', and a few other wizarding homes that may have been vacant at the time were the entire confirmed magical population of Godric's Hallow. It really wouldn't be too much of a jump to say the magicals simply didn't notice Voldemort's attack as it sounds as if the Potters lived in the middle of a neighborhood filled with muggles.

Godric's Hollow has been a well-known settlement for many wizarding families since Godric Gryffindor's time.

It seems that you're arguing for the sake of arguing.

** I think there is simple explanation - because Rowling wanted it to happen.

Lot of plot points in books happen just because author wants them to happen, regardless if there is some logical explanation/reason or isn't. Like for example, adults being completely useless (especially in PS and CoS) just so kids can be the heroes that save the school.

Thankfully we, readers, can make up our own reasons (or Rowling can pull something out on twitter lol)

** The Potters died at night on 31 October, and Harry arrived at Privet Drive late on 31 October or early on 1 November.

In point of fact, the Potters died at 4am, and Hagrid spent eighteen hours bringing Harry around to every village, every pub, and every streetcorner, loudly announcing what had happened and building up the image of the Boy Who Lived.

He needed a proxy in his personal vendetta against Tom Riddle, after all, and Dumbledore was past his prime. Plus Hagrid worried that Dumbledore was catching on to his manipulations.

** I think you're forgetting that the wizarding world in Britain is a small community of somewhere between 6000-16,000 people, all served by a single school which almost everyone attends. To a great extent you don't need to tell people about Harry - in a community that size, where everyone knows everyone else at least by reputation, word of mouth is enough.

#+end_quote

They didn't. They spread his name. You'll notice that in the first book, no one actually tecognizes Harry, unless his scar is visible (and we're told Harry has to uncover it to show people, so it won't be out in the open mos of the time). I can only assume the times he was recognized before his eleventh bithday was either by people who knew James, his scar was showing, or both.

It's my understanding that Snape was never actually there. That's a movie thing, or am I remembering wrong?

Harry is always under protection so long as he calls Privet Drive no4 his home. It doesn't matter if he's in london, france or the moon, that is the information we have been given.

*** Everyone knows about the scar left by the killing curse, which is the only easily identifiable mark. Why does everyone know there was a scar in the first place and the circumstances behind it? (So far Hagrid seems the prime suspect.)

Yep Snape's appearance was movie only. Peter might have been there to recover the wand behind the scenes.

Harry's protection didn't do shit against Bellatrix and the deatheaters in the Ministry, or against diary Riddle who is basically part of Voldemort. Unless it relies on convoluted reality bending events based on luck like Felix, it's a garbage protection that's bound to a specific place. So far it seemed to only work through direct skin contact, so sorry if I'm not convinced that the vague protection was worth all the importance it was given in the series when it was so limited.

Oh yeah, it was totally Hagrid. That's not even in question if you ask me.

Diary Riddle never actually hurt Harry directly, if you think about it. He had the Basilisk doing it for him. I guess you could argue the protection should have protected him from the basilisk? I dunno.

** You make a large number of assumptions about the wizarding world. Harry is slandered by name in the newspapers at 15. Good luck doing that with a real newspaper. Chances are the entire story was leaked the day after and identified Harry by name and mentioned how he was left with only a scar.

On the anonymity/recognizability part, Harry was actually recognized by Dedalus Diggle once before.

#+begin_quote
  "Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle."

  "I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."
#+end_quote

The best answer for that I can make is Harry's scar was probably visible. Now that would be a threat as you said.

#+begin_quote
  At the time he was ignorant of any danger and yet everyone can identify Harry while he's out of the ward's protection and kill him without him even being aware of a threat.
#+end_quote

But you're forgetting something and also you use a phrase that makes me believe your thinking from the fanon point of view and not the canon one.

The term ward is never used in canon the way it is used in fanfiction, rather Rowling preferred protection, hell she doesn't even use the term ward for the most part. Now, wards give me a feeling of an unmoveable protection of sorts that lack versatility, kind of like a brick wall. Protection is far less assuming and allows for more versatility, we don't really ever get an explanation of how any protection in the book works, be it the ones on Hogwarts or Lily's protections. So Harry could have never left the protections he was under for all we know.

Now you also discard the worth of the protections Harry was under, sure he could be identified, but what if someone tried to harm him? Presumably, Dumbledore knew that they would defend Harry against any typical attack and that's why he felt Harry was safe. I mean in book one Harry kills Quirrelmort with his hands aided by his mom's protections, how far does that go against normal magic? We don't really know.
