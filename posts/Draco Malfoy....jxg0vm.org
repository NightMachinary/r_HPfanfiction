So I love stories where Draco and Harry become friends/lovers. And I've been in the mood for stories where Harry isn't on Dumbledore's side. Don't care if he is one his own or joins Voldemort. But I want stories where Draco before friends him and teaches him things he doesn't know (Magic, Etiquette , politics). I just want him showing harry there is more to life than his two friends, bad relatives, and Dumbledore's plans for him.

The only thing I ask is noo whiny bratty Draco. I hate stories where the whole time all he says is my father is going to hear about this, and then suddenly him and Harry are friends and your like WFT just happened.

*** Its like the drarry fanfic order site. Just look for the friends category and you should find a bunch of recs or just a ao3 tag link without you doing all the work for it.
