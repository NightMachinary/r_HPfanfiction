:END:
I forget the year, but during one of the summer breaks Harry time travels back to Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts and befriends him and his followers. The fic starts with Harry going back to Hogwarts during his own time after having gone back in time, and Tom and followers/friends appear in the great hall. Harry actually going back in time is written later as a prequel. I'm pretty sure it's on either AO3 or FF.net

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
