It was just recently deleted when I started reading it.


** Its still on AO3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6880984/chapters/15698149]]

I had the same issue. I was on chapter 14 and suddenly the fic was gone.

** If it is the same fic as the other guy linked there's probably a copy in the g archive at [[https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack]]. (I have the hp archive downloaded but crossover fics go in the first fandom alphabetically)

** You guys should download the stories you like, just in case.

I don't know why you'd want to read them on a site, anyway.
