** linkffn(10914042) follows many characters in many places. Some of those deliver on your request.

I recommend the fic itself as a whole, but I /don't/ suggest trying to skip over everything else just to get to these parts. It is a deeply interconnected whole.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

*** Yeah, I definitely don't skip stuff. All or nothing. The first chapter is interesting too, so I'll likely be reading the lot. I'm just worried that at 600,000 words and following many characters, it'll be as slow as the entire Wheel of Time series. Either way, it has an interesting start, so thanks for the rec!

**** I'm not inclined toward picking and choosing, but there are some uploads where it's a reasonable idea. A collection of disconnected one-shots (with maybe the occasional sequel chapter). Or a story that's pulled in many directions, so the threads are all there, but they could be separate worlds for as much as they relate to each other. Or maybe there's a brief diversion where the main plot line is briefly related to the subject of your query.

If it makes you feel better, the current plot of the story /has/ gotten to Hogwarts by now.

***** That's fair. I've enjoyed marathon-ing too many one-shot collections to bother skipping now though. It's fun seeing how ideas progress and authors grow.

But cool. 600,000-ish words of pre-Hogwarts stuff, huh? I think knowing that in advance will help set my expectations and keep me reading longer. Why not, I'll add it to the list. Thanks for the rec.

** Harry Crow and Can't Have it Both Ways by RobSt on fanfiction.net and I have to recommend Knowledge is Power by the same author, even though the goblin involvement in that one is limited.

**** In most fics the limit of goblin involvement is when Harry visits his vault - unless the fic includes where the trio break into Gringotts for the cup. In this story they are secondary characters who are presented as businessman who are helping Harry because he impressed them by being respectful, honorable, and ruthless when dealing with his enemies.

***** Ah, okay. So, "You're not bad, by our cultural standards, so we'll give you a leg-up" rather than "You remembered my name, we love you Mr Great Lord Harry Potter Sir! Have our money, our lives, and my wife!" like so many fics are. Sounds good, I'll take a look. Thanks for the rec! :)

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.
