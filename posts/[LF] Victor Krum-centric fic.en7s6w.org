I would love to read a good, long, and complete fic where Victor Krum is the protagonist. No specific genre or pairings but I think I'd prefer something that relatively follows canon. Thank you in advance!


** One of the few fics where Hermione and Ron broke up without bashing :)

  "Never promise without knowing what you're promising," grandmother instructs, her voice sharp. "Promise me you'll never allow people to use you, Viktor. You'll never follow mad men who promise you power. You'll always do what is right."[Or: in which Viktor Krum gets a backstory, falls in love with a lioness and doesn't let her go.]

  Viktor had thought he might have loved her when he saw her by the Black Lake the first time, standing under a tree and trying, desperately, to make it look as if she wasn't waiting for him. But now? Now as she glanced up at him dwarfed by one of his old coats, snowflakes catching on her eyelashes... Now, he knew.
