Are there any decent "What if Harry Potter was a musical instead of a book" fics with well written original songs, and not the "Songfic" trash with just an Emo plot with usually a Linkin Park song in the background.

I want to see Voldemort's revival be as over the top Musical as Ursula's Revenge from KH2. Bordering on a cross between Gilbert and Sullivan and a Disney Film. Actually well written original songs, and not just copy-pasted real songs, but the author making their own to fit.


** Have you seen A Very Potter Musical by TeamStarkid? It's on YouTube and it's pretty great.
