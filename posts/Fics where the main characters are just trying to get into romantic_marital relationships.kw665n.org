Kinda like season 1 of /Downton Abbey/ or /Pride and Prejudice/. There could be the whole Voldemort thing going on in the background or not. Any ships, any length, should be well written/have a good storyline.

Thanks in advance! :)


** I don't know if you'd be interested, but I'm working on a love triangle story between Snape, Lupin, and an OC. It takes place during the hp timeline, but the focus is on the relationships.
