So not like linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) but like, canon Harry gets put in Hufflepuff? maybe he runs into one of the older Hufflepuffs on the train or something? It would be interesting to see how he would do in that sort of environment.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

The Tinkerer features Harry and Hermione in Hufflepuff, and I thought it was pretty brilliant. They aren't in there because they're lazy, and although the kids in the story are kind of overly smart, I guess, it does get explained a bit, and it's an interesting read anyways.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
