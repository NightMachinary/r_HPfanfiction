I have noticed that in a lot of fan-fiction I tend to love are when Harry becomes a badass usually around the time after Sirius goes through the veil. What are some things that you notice about your favorite fan-fics?


** -they don't have original characters

-"Mary Sues" are not present

-they are well written and characters don't have knowledge of things that only the readers or author should know.

** Most of my favorite fan fics have been betaed. (Hint to you aspiring writers out there.) :P

But seriously, I almost only read fics with Harry as the main character. Other then that, I am willing to try a lot of new things. I don't mind slash or het, but I think my favorite pairing is probably Harry/Draco.

I started really getting into reading fanfic after OotP came out, so I will always have a soft spot in my heart for fics that start after fifth year. So much delicious angst.

I also love AUs, especially creative ones that haven't been done before. And time travel.

As you can see, I like a lot of different things...

****** Well here are some nice long ones to keep you entertained for a long time:

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=10818][Secrets]] by Verbozia - Beginning with Draco's unexpected arrival at the Dursleys, Harry's summer becomes filled with activity and many secrets. He generates several unexpected allies as he finds himself actively becoming the leader of the Light side.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/jennavere/DT.html][Dragon Tamer]] - Desperate to avoid an arranged marriage, Draco convinces Harry to pretend to be his boyfriend. What follows is an epic romantic comedy involving scheming, snogging, silliness, shagging, snarky boys, superstars, singing, shagging, snuggling, secrets, sex gods, shagging, and a bunny named Draco Lucius Malfoy the Third. HD SLASH (and how!).

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12840][Gay Aurors]] - Harry/Draco, Episodic crackfic: Draco Malfoy mysteriously returns to London a badass and is partnered up with a very grumpy and very gay Harry Potter. COMPLETE!

[[http://dayspring.skeeter63.org/sdm.htm][Saving Draco Malfoy]] - While the Wizarding world waits for Harry Potter to save them, Draco Malfoy decides to save himself.

[[http://www.skyehawke.com/archive/story.php?no=261][Seeker to Seeker]] - What begins as a slashy bet on the Quidditch field soon develops into something much more significant.

[[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=9934][Tempus]] - Students at Hogwarts have always been warned about corridors that disappear. But did you every wonder where, or when, they go? Harry thinks he is going to be late for his seventh year potions class. But he turns out to be more than 70 years early. And the first person he meets is... Draco Malfoy?

This is a wide verity of different styles so there should be something you like. Should keep you busy for a while. Enjoy! :)

**** Lightning on the Wave has a brilliantly written septology (perhaps the only complete HP fanfic septology to have ever been completed?) called the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning_on_the_Wave][Sacrifices Arc.]]

The first two books are relatively short and focus on developing atmosphere and HP/Draco, but the series really takes off IMO with the third book. It's not completely dominated by HP/Draco since it features a pretty much ensemble cast, but Lightning does a fantastic job developing and justifying the perspectives of the myriad characters.

I think one of its major strengths is that it fleshes out one of the most delicately thought-out environments I've ever had the pleasure to read. It really is one of the most well-written series out there. I highly highly recommend checking it out.

** I can appreciate a fic that starts midway through like you reference, but I'm a fan of the epics... I like it when the author starts with year one. Naturally, it has to be well done and not a parrot of the books, which can be difficult to find.

I also really like various pairings. I'm a sucker for a good love story, but I'm not really partial to any specific ship. I do tend to read most Hermione pairings, though.

** Personally, I like a softer Harry if he's paired in a slash. I don't know why, I just find powerful but a bit spacey Harry adorable. But I'm a sucker for Punk!Harry. Although, I prefer Sirius to be alive.

** I like short stories, stories that delve into moments of a character. I'm a big fan of minor characters (and also Draco) in the Post-Hogwarts setting, and seeing how they've been affected by the war.

I've never been too interested in the main trio just because I've already read their story and it's enough for me. I'd rather explore the other parts of JKR's world, and play with the peculiar rules and culture she's given us, because that's really what draws me in, in reading and writing fic. Some of the best original fiction-esque stories I've read are from this fandom, and people can do some crazy creative stuff with it.

** OP, that's because many fics are post-OoTP. The long two years between the release of OoTP and HBP was when fanfiction really took off. Sirius's death and Harry's subsequent mental breakdown serves as a perfect launchpoint for putting your own darker spin on Harry.

** Quite a number of the fics I find interesting tend to feature Harry as a girl at some stage.

A fair number of them also feature Harry with a stranger background and/or doing something completely different.

My biggest 'goddamnit man' thing is the pairings. Specifically, they happen in almost every damn fic I come across and are taken awfully seriously for no good reason. Do you know how annoying that is? Okay, so I am guilty of this indulgence too, but I would dearly love to read a fic without any pairings. Which is why I am writing one now.

** My taste has evolved over the years and its getting further and further away from canon. My favorite will always be Azkaban fics. You know, Harry betrayed and sent to azkaban. Escapes or released, ignores or becomes powerful, makes up with friends or not. Or inherits the island. All good.

Then you have Dumbledore bashing which I've become fond of.

Ps. Sirius being alive is always +1
