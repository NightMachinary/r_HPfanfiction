Hi, Does anyone know some really good Harry/Astoria, Harry/Fleur or Harry/Multi which include either of them.

Thanks in advance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul]]

The Dementor attack on Harry during the summer after his fourth year leaves him on the verge of having his wand snapped. Unwilling to leave anything to chance, Sirius Black sets events into motion which will change Harry's life forever. HP/HG/FD

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885609/1/Finding-a-Place-to-Call-Home]]

"Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel]]

Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Old friendships broken, new ones formed. Sticks to canon at first but will tread to AU territory. M rating because I'm paranoid. Harry/Fleur.

*** Thanks for the recs.

Can you also share your own thoughts on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][#1]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][#3]], if you've read them?

**** I've read about half of both.

Both have gigantic issues with sentence structure, dialogue, characterization, and just writing in general. Heart and Soul gets better as it goes along (I think I got about 50 chapters in), but His Angel doesn't really improve in terms of writing quality. His Angel has quite a bit of character bashing (specifically the Weasleys), and in particular Molly might as well an OC.

Heart and Soul might be worth reading if that's your thing. His Angel is my go-to example of a terrible fic that somehow manages to accrue a huge audience.

**** I've read both of them. If you like fluff and romance, then they're pretty good. However, the romance really takes up almost all of the plot, so if that's not your cup of tea then they can really drag on.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries]]

A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.

Definitely one of my top three favourite fanfictions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation][The British Reformation by kb0]]: After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

**** Totally agree, it took me a couple of tries to get past the first chapter, but I think that was just because I was young, naive, and intolerant of not third person.

Again, sorry for all the incomplete stories. A couple of them are still being updated, though irregularly, and they were entertaining enough if you don't mind them being incomplete.
