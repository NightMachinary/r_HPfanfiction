So not epilogue compliant, not 5 years later drowning in sorrow and whiskey, and not "how to be a celebrity with Ginny who loves the fame "

Actually the closest I've seen to what I'd like to read are some of the prologue to those master of death overpowered Harry goes to a new cross over dimension to kick ass.

I mean he has to have some money, he got rid of the horcrux in his head and he doesn't have to worry about shitty guardians or psycho dark lords... you'd expect there to be some opportunities for fun times right?

*** I'm not saying he should PTSD the day after, but doing something better than vanishing into mediocrity or drinking himself to death isn't that odd of an idea..

I would definitely not mind a few chapters of overcoming the horrors of war before doing some travelling and cool magic stuff. I just think it's odd how everyone agrees the epilogue was horrid, but no one seems to have written an alternative that isn't at least as depressing

****** Heh, I always remember ViolentAcres' quote in these discussions.

#+begin_quote
  As Harry Potter stood by the train leaving for Hogwarts, it suddenly occurred to him that for all his childhood adventures, he ended up being just another worthless soccer Dad. As he waved goodbye to his children, he thought to himself, ‚ÄúI should have fucking killed myself when I had the chance.‚Äù

****** I don't even know where to start. 1. He is the head of aurors and remains a big influence in the magical world. What exactly did you expect? That he would become the Master of Death and be uber powerful? 2. That was the point of the books. He isn't special, he isn't The Chosen One, he is just a boy who other people made out to be super special and powerful and beyond human abilities. The incredibly powerful Voldemort was beaten by someone who simply did his best. 3. Saving the world isn't enough of a phenomenon? 4. Yes, how could someone whose life up to that point has been marked by death and loss and struggle wish for a life with a family, loved ones and maybe not having to fight the devil every year? Completely unimaginable...

******* Yeah where Harry ends up makes perfect sense (disregarding the horrible Cursed child plotline). But I will agree that its boring to read about.

If you want an interesting post-Hogwarts life you have to look to Luna who was traveling the world looking for out there creatures (and apparently sometimes finding them).

** It sounds like what you want is for post-war life to be a giant party. I can just see it now:

Scene:

Harry, Ron and Hermione come back from the Headmaster's office and enter the Great Hall.\\
Everyone begins to applaud them for their work.\\
Finally, Harry looks at the Ron and Hermione, and with a wide smile shouts for all to hear:

"Come on everyone! Let's party like its 1981!"

Years later, it remained unknown whether more damage had been done to Hogwarts in the battle or in the ensuing Rave of Hogwarts.

In all seriousness, most fics are dull because LIFE is dull, even in the wizarding world. Most people put in their hours 9 to 5 then go home to complain about their day or drink to a state of fugue.

And besides that, isn't that what Harry wanted? A normal life, a life with family? None of the main characters wanted to be party animals (with the possible exceptions of Sirius, and maybe Bill and Tonks based on their personalities and job choices). Hogwarts genuinely seems like the most exciting part of the majority of wizards/witches lives in Britain. Maybe thats why so many of them get married right after.

*** And I would like to recommend linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7). Its probably my favorite fic from TheEndless7 too, who is a fairly good writer with a good grasp of natural dialogue.

Its short, but gives a natural feeling evolution of Harry's story post-Hogwarts. Plus, it is genuinely one of the best Harry/Luna stories out there, even if there is a bit of depressing backstory for Luna post-war.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

*** Lol no I was mainly looking for cool magic stuff, maybe wizarding professions, getting a mastery or traveling and doing cool stuff.. there's a bunch of fics like for the love of magic or the one where he goes with Bill on a curse breaking expedition, I was wondering if there was anything like that but starting after the defeat of Voldemort.

Obviously party hard crack fics are also entertaining xD

  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** WHile a lot of those stories are interesting, I'm not sure I would say they exactly scream happy, particularly the Daphne-esque ones (its kind of a common theme actually).

**** Well, the one that is the least "happy" I'd say is "Good Days and Bad Days" while the rest is mostly a feels-good fic with various levels of fluff mixed with some PTSD and drama. Sure, it isn't "Protection from Nargles" level of happiness and fluffyness, but it isn't by any stretch of the imagination dull nor depressing. Which was the point of the post.

***** I'm not disagreeing with you, those fics are generally pretty tame (except maybe Unatoned).

I don't know, maybe I was interpreting the OP's request as something for more happy-go-lucky than slice-of-life.

** linkffn(That Old House) is fluffy, but might be what you consider dull?

In [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6773/1][Life N.E.W.T.s]], Harry owns a pub, which is not something I've seen done elsewhere.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7668][Finding Jane]] is a sweet post-Hogwarts story that comes to mind. A must-read for any Austenite.
