Where in the wisarding world would make sense to have industry. I decided on Crete because of the whole story of Ðaiðalos (Δαίδαλος), but where else? Where else has myths of magical stuff made by mortals?


** When you say industrialised, what exactly do you mean in this context? Because for the most part the wizarding world seems to get by on cottage industry and artisan workshops more than actual factories.

**** Magic is only part of it. Large scale industry is only necessary to quickly meet the needs of an enormous population.

Stop thinking about millions or billions of people and start thinking about a population so miniscule that one small secondary school is sufficient for everyone in the UK. My secondary school was twice the size of Hogwarts, and it was one of 3 roughly equal schools in my area.

** Industrialization makes sense when you need a lot of something. With normal consumables that isn't really the case because of the small wizard population. I guess the newspaper uses somewhat modern printing methods with magical improvements because they need a few thousand units each day. Brooms have different models by different manufacturers, so those are probably somewhat mass produced by the hundreds but that'd still be mostly by hand, like 1700s era workshops.

One scenario where wizards need industry could be where they decide to stop climate change. The Earth is really really huge, so if they develop some magical artefact that could control the climate it's still likely that they'd need hundreds of millions of them, so they'd have to learn some lessons from muggle industry. Another scenario could be one where somehow magical goods are traded to muggles, maybe potions disguised as super advanced nano dna cures.

*** Yeah, but Nimbus seems to be a big business.
