** Denial, and then blaming them for his feelings, claiming they used love potions on him in order to fool him etc.

Lucius of course capitalises on the idea, and uses it to initiate a smear campaign against Muggleborn 'They're stealing our children'. In particular if Draco's love interest is, shall we say, unconventional. (More ammo for Lucius).

** Depends is it love love or just a crush. I imagine if it's someone he truly loves prob denial at first at but if she/he is that important to him he might try and fight for it.

Draco isn't very brave but he cares a lot about the people he loves (his parents for one)
