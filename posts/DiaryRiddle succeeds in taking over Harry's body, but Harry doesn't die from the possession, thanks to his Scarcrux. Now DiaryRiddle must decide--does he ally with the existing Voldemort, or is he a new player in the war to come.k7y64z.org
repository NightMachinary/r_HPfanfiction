Ideas:

Diary! Riddle gets control of Harry's body, can access Harry's memories and feel Harry's emotions as Harry watches Riddle's actions. These secondhand emotions begin to teach him empathy? He'll never be a good person but maybe he reconsiders his approach and goals.

Diary! Riddle is younger and more sane than current, bodyless Voldemort, and finds he doesn't approve of how irrational and brute force-based bodyless Voldemort has become. Doesn't necessarily want to join him.

Canon!Voldemort clearly couldn't sense where his Horcruxes were/when they were destroyed, so he doesn't necessarily realize Diary!Riddle is not Harry.

Diary!Riddle has to fool Dumbledore, everyone else into thinking Harry is still himself/normal.

Could spend the whole story of being in possession of Harry, or could eventually get his own body. Possible Harry/Tom relationship or alliance.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
