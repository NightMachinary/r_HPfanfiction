Basically what the title says in that I want to read a Fanfic with a Harry x Bellatrix pairing without Harry going back to the 70's. Preferably finished, but if not it's no big deal. I don't care about the genre or tags or a Noble house system, just good grammar, good plot (unless it's a pure smut-fic/erotica), and a good characterization of Bellatrix.

Thanks in advance.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
