Does someone know of a, preferably longer, multi chapter story featuring someone working as a call girl? (I blame Roxanne by The Police)


** I've had a few (side)characters working as courtesans, or posing as such to spy on people, in "Patron".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry was a slut, everyone knew it. Since he defeated the dark lord in his 5th year he'd lost all his honest principles and lost himself darkly inside whatever male or female he felt like devouring." Porn-WITH-Plot. So yeah.. Lots of smut plot!

  A strange tale about Harry and an addiction. Implied HHR? It will get 'very' explicit in later installments, thus the M rating. Good or bad, comments are always welcome! Last chapter posted!
