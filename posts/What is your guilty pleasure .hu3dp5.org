Dear readers/writers, what is your guilty pleasures that makes you keep reading even on a mediocre fanfiction ? Something you know that doesn't contribute objectively to the quality of the fic but still gives you some satisfaction, like a specific bashing in a very specific context or a pairing clearly unusual ?

For my part, I like it when the adults (like McGonagall or Snape) act indignantly only to have their faults rubbed in their face. Most of the time, it escalades in big bashing but sometimes it is well written and so satisfying.

*** My favorite of that was one where Harry went back in time, I think Ron and Ginny did too. The other Weasley's didn't trust him or treat him like family this time and it hurt him emotionally because he thought of them as his family. He snaps at one point and make them watch his memories in order to hurt them/make them understand. It was a very satisfying build up and confrontation.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** I mostly see it in cross-overs, but I'm actually a big fan of having Harry and Co called out on their snooping. Particularly when Harry acts all dramatic about it because "he deserves to know." Example Full Metal Alchemist crossover where Ed is teaching alchemy:

Ron: Professor Elric is so suspicious. Did you see the way he was looking at his arm?

Harry: Yeah, and no one seems to know where he comes from. What if he's a death eater, we should break into his office and find out.

Hermione: I don't know about this...

/trio break into his office and discover he's missing an arm before getting caught/

Harry: how did you lose that arm?

Ed: Why should I tell you my traumatic life story?

Harry: I have a right to know!

Ed: Uhh no you don't

Just a bit of amusement. Honestly, it's not even that OOC for Harry in OotP and HBP what with him assuming Umbridge is a death eater and his stalking of Malfoy. Not that he doesn't have reasons, but it's a little funny when you know he's so wrong.

*** I love both of these ships! The first one is hard for me to find good romance with out shitty porn. Or worse, I'm looking for porn and only find the shit stuff. The second pair is just rare, which is a shame. Millicent is the only girl in the HP verse on the thicc side. She has muscle and cushioning. Perfect girlfriend to me. Walks up to my enemies like “Bro! Do you even lift?”. Just picks up Voldemort and benches him until he dies from awe of her muscles. And when you want to jump her after that, she's got junk for you to hold on to.

Yes I'm insane about Millicent but she's the only one who isn't lean/skinny. The girls are all gorgeous but not my type. Millicent represents plus size girls and muscular girls. Whenever a fic talks about “muscles” on a girl it's always about sweat sliding down her toned thighs. Like no! I want to see Harry struggling to focus on the snitch because of her guns flexing so much when she hits a bludger.
