Think about how so many things wouldn't have happened at all. Quirrel was the breaking point!


** Extremely rare, almost every fic that covers Year 1 has Quirrell possessed by Voldemort. But I found one:

*Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853), is pretty much the only fic that still has Harry becoming the BWL, covers the Year 1, and is NOT a time travel. [[/spoiler][Quirrell was not possessed because Voldemort himself was attending the school in a new body]]

*** Whelp, I wasn't expecting this for when Quirrel didn't go to Albania but hey it's a really interesting concept of itself! Am reading the 12th chapter currently haha, thanks for the recommendation! :)

** I remember reading one where it was Pettigrew that went to Albania and another with Barty Crouch Jr. I don't remember the fics unfortunately.

**** I meant that Pettigrew found Voldemort in Albania prior to SS, instead of Quirrel. Not talking about post-PoA events.
