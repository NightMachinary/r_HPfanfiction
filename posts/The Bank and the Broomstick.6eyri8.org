** Mm, gewd.

There doesn't seem to be much happening in the chapter; just a bank visit, some plotting, some characters getting to know each other and a car trip. But, I liked it anyway.

I'm not familiar with the rest of the fic at all, but I still appreciated Watson and his first-person viewpoint on things. This chapter was a nice and relaxing read.
