Do you have any headcanons on what they do after Hogwarts? Or anything similar?

Daphne and Astoria Greengrass

Blaise Zabini

Theodore Nott

Alicia Spinnet

Angelina Johnson

Susan Bones

Hannah Abbott

Justin Finch-Fletchley

Lee Jordan

Dean Thomas

Tracey Davis

etc, etc, etc. Any minor character you can think of.

For instance: I know that Daphne is often seen as blonde hair, but I really like the idea of brunette Daphne and Astoria. I also see Daphne as rather sarcastic, while Astoria is rather shy and quiet.


** Daphne Greengrass is a power hungry sociopath like the rest of her family. They all thrist for power and high standing and will do anything to achieve it, no matter what or how immoral it may be. Astoria is desperate to escape her toxic family.

Blaise Zabini is an extremely entitled spoiled brat. He envisions himself as the most popular boy in Hogwarts and has several intense (and completely and utterly one-sided on his end) rivalries with boys he sees as competition.

Theodore Nott is an extreme Pureblood bigot but is too cowardly and weak-willed to be open about it. When Crabbe and Goyle are bullying a Muggleborn first year, he's watching from a nearby staircase with a grin on his face.

Tracey Davis despises being a Slytherin and spends almost all of her time with her Ravenclaw classmates, even sleeping in their dorm most nights.

Susan Bones is a honourable and kind girl, secretly cracking under the pressure of having to continue the Bones family legacy.

Michael Corner is the result of a one night between a wizard and a Muggle woman. He is friendly and social but has pretty bad issues in regards to trust and attachment. He also has a thick Sheffield accent.

Terry Boot is the dad friend. That is all.

Justin Finch-Fletchley savours every bit of the freedom Hogwarts offers him, since outside of school, he is in a suffocating environment as the son of a major politician and a building tycoon.

Padma Patil is snarky with a heart of gold. She is a closet theatre fanatic. She and her sister have London accents with slight Indian undertone.

Hannah Abbott is actually one of the best students in the year when not being in an exam. She can't cope with pressure at all.

Cormac McLaggen and Zacharias Smith exist solely to be the butt of jokes. Sorry guys.

Alicia Smith is every bit as fanatical about Quidditch as Oliver is, she's just more quiet about it. She even arranged to have her wedding held on the Hogwarts pitch.

** I'm tired of the rich, neutral faction “Ice Queen” Daphne Greengrass characterization, so I'm changing it up in in the fic that I'm planning now. I'm making the Greengrass family poor because over the years, the various generations have been spent their wealth trying to find a way to break the blood curse that plagues their family. Daphne's going to be a quiet, unassuming brunette with average looks whose greatest ambition is to find a cure to the blood malediction her sister suffers from. Draco and Pansy look down on her for her lack of wealth and secondhand robes, and she mostly keeps to herself.

** Theo Nott: Like someone else said in this thread, I see him as very quiet and serious seeming until you get to know him. Good sense of humor, also intelligent; I can see him as being very curious, a little eccentric, like a more grounded Luna. Sometimes I see him and Daphne as the nerds in Slytherin. I picture him with black hair and green eyes. I can see him as being an Unspeakable or curse-breaker or gentleman inventor if I'm not writing him as wanting a specific job.

Blaise Zabini: Massive trust issues due to his mother being a prolific serial-killer. (Mrs. Zabini depending on the tone of the fic, I would either write more like Mrs. White from Clue (if going more for comedy) or inspired by Mads Mikklesen's Hannibal Lector if it's a serious fic.) Fluent in English and Italian. Unlike some of the others, I see him as living off his money rather than having a job; if he does anything, maybe a vineyard owner or something like that.

Angelina Johnson: I picture her as becoming a quidditch player like Oliver and Ginny, or doing something related to quidditch. She, Lee, and George stuck together after Fred's death; she and Lee were the first people George let in.

Lee Jordan: Professional quidditch commenter and still close to George and Angelina. Probably a godfather to one of their children.

Astoria and Daphne Greengrass: I also see both of them as brunettes, as well as having blue eyes. I also see Daphne as sarcastic, but Astoria I actually picture as the more extroverted or at least the one who's more of a people person. They can drive each other mad/pick on each other (Astoria probably liked annoying Daphne as the younger sister), but are genuinely close siblings. I see Daphne as being very protective of Astoria (and others she cares about) from a young age as some people probably learned the hard way; however, Astoria can also be protective of Daphne, which probably shocked more people the first time it happened. I can see Daphne as being a good aunt to Scorpious (or other kids Astoria has if not with Draco) and vise versa if Daphne has kids.

If I'm giving them jobs, I tend to think of Astoria as either a potioneer who eventually gets a mastery in it or a healer. Daphne I tend to see as either an Unspeakable or curse-breaker, though recently I've gotten into the idea of her being good with magical creatures and doing something with that such as a dragonologist or magizoologist.

** I imagine that Theo Nott is a very silent person, but when you get to know him, you realize that he has a very dry and sarcastic (and sometimes dark) sense of humour. He witnessed his mother's death at the wand of his father when he was only a child, and as he is the only heir to the Nott family, he's spent most of his childhood studying to take over the household when he becomes of age. He found solace from his father's abuse in tinkering with magical objects and spells he found in an old workshop in his family's manor, and it was sometimes the only thing holding his head over water when his father forced him to get the Dark Mark. After the war, he's looked down upon as a Death Eater and the job he wanted to get as an Unspeakable suddenly became unreachable. Time-turners were confiscated from the Ministry, most of them were destroyed, so he delved into the depths of his family's library and created his own time-turner.

I imagine Theo to be wiry with dark brown hair and silver-blue eyes.

This all my own headcanon and more or less the basis I've created for the Theo Nott in my own story.

For Blaise Zabini, I imagine him to be a very outgoing person with a good sense of humour. He's kind of a joker and a massive flirt. He can charm the pants off any girl he sees --- and sometimes even the boys. He's collected a wide variety of skills from the numerous step-fathers he's had over the years but the best skills he learned from his mother --- the infamous Black Widow. He's well-versed in appearing unassuming but he knows numerous ways to incapacitate a person --- over half of them without the use of a wand.

Blaise is described to be a tall black boy with "haughty" features, and I imagine him to have green or dark brown eyes. I kind of imagine him to be mixed-race with a white (ish) Italian mother, though I have no problem with him being not mixed race. My depiction of him often changes depending on what suits my needs.

I personally see Astoria Greengrass as a joker, witty, and with a somewhat childish sense of wonder. Physically, she changes, though I typically imagine her to be dirty blonde with blue or dark brown eyes. Intellectually, I imagine her to be very intelligent and gifted with Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. I also imagine that she took Muggle Studies due to her curiosity, though that's just a personal opinion. In a fic that I may or may not write in the future, she's an Unspeakable who works with spells and deconstructs ancient ones.

Daphne, I imagine to be physically similar to Astoria, and I imagine her be a relatively quiet person. She was raised by her father, Lord Greengrass and law wizard, to be the new head of the family because her mother died when she was a child and she has no brothers. She knows how to wheedle information from unsuspecting individuals and she has a calculating side to her where she deems a person's use. She was still old enough to watch as her mother's health deteriorated physically while Astoria was not, which I imagine is why she's more of a joker than Daphne. Her best friend is Tracey Davis, a half-blood.

Tracey Davis, I imagine having dark brown hair and dark brown or grey/hazel eyes. Her mother is the half-blood or Muggleborn while her father is the pureblood. I imagine Tracey to be relatively average in most pursuits, though she's certainly intelligent, and her passion is (creative) writing and history. I imagine that she took Ancient Studies at Hogwarts, which offered a historical point-of-view for ancient wizarding practices, focusing especially on Egyptian and Roman/Greek societies.

Dean Thomas, in my mind, is not a Muggleborn but a half-blood. His father, the heir to the Shafiq family, had an affair with his Muggle mother during the first war and he was killed by Death Eaters or Death Eater sympathizers for favouring Muggles and-or refusing to join the "dark side." He's talented in art and I imagine that he might have an interest in creating a wizarding version of comic books in the future. He favours charcoal above all else, though his second favourite mediums are oil paint and clay.

I could do some others if you want, this is just what I came up with on the top of my head.

** Theodore Nott is a bit of a crackhead in my fic. He's more of a central character, with brown curly hair that he insists on leaving long (because the girls will think it's cool!) that nicely complements his hazel-brown eyes. He's quite tall during his first few years, but his height tops out at around 5'9 (much to his disappointment). He's heavily inspired by the best friend that is fading from my life, giving the MC the same energy that my friend gave me.

He's very smart, and very bold. He could have passed for a Gryffindor. This abundance of energy combined with the sarcastic energy of being in Slytherin makes him one of the funniest in the year. He tends to drift from social group to social group, managing to find home in all of them.

His attention has been captured by Luna Lovegood since the moment he laid eyes on her. She was whimsical, calm, pretty much everything that he was not. He's like James chasing after his Lily, and once she accepts him, he's shamelessly whipped. Sometimes he camps out in the Ravenclaw common room, but he would never admit that he isn't nearly as fond of Slytherin as the rest of his family.

After the war, when the time turners are destroyed, he spends nearly a year making another one with Draco to go back to September first , 1991, in hopes that pulling a few strings would save infinitely many people (like focing the hat to make Draco a Hufflepuff, and leaving the MC in slytherin so that they wouldn't remain friends and cause a lot of the problems that they caused. The sorting hat can't be swayed. It says that he was placed in Slytherin not because of the person he is, but the person they would help him become.

Further post-hogwarts, he marries Luna and lives off his extensive fortune (his death-eater father died in the second wizarding war).

** I think out of the Creevey brothers, Dennis would be more of a realist/down-to-earth (based entirely on one line where he points out the Beauxbatons carriage is being flown by horses while the rest of his year is freaking out). Very excitable still, but more pessimistic than Colin, though it's still considered decently positive by normal standards. Also slightly more reckless and willing to break/bend the rules, though this also comes from being younger too.

Colin I feel like is similar to Luna in some aspects, in a bit of a "they're weirder than most people" way. He matures as he gets older, but he's still pretty optimistic and sometimes speaks without thinking, especially with things he's passionate about. I'd say creative as well and likes looking at things from different angles, and I think he'd bond with Luna about off-the-wall theories and such. Has a little bit of a big brother streak, but Dennis and him have their separate friend groups while still spending a lot of time together. I'd like to say he's close with Ginny, but probably not in canon at least in later years, though they definitely bond over defending Harry against Umbridge in OOtP.

** Daphne Greengrass- quite a cold and composed young woman, secretly loving romantic books and sweets. She is very ambitious and would like to achieve a very high rank in the Ministry in the future, she would do it even by walking over the corpses, she is willing to do anything for it. In the future, she would become the Cabinet of the Law Compliance Department, and later the Minister's Undersecretary.

Astoria Greengrass- Contrary to her sister, she does not guard her feelings deeply and often expresses them, she likes to surround herself with a group of her friends who mainly include Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and a few Gryffindors. Her greatest ambition is to become a Spell Mistress and then become a teacher at Hogwarts or Beauxbatons.

Blaise Zabini - He's quite a dangerous man. Raised mainly by his mother and a few stepfathers who, as soon as his mother was upset, were mysteriously killed, he learned caution and suspicion from an early age. At Hogwarts, he tried to stay hidden, however, he was on good terms with Draco Malfoy and supported blood purism, but at the same time he had no intention of joining the Dark Lord and his dislike for Muggle-borns was not as evident as in his House mates. He later became a Potions Master after breaking free from the toxic relationship with his family. He has taught at Hogwarts since 2010.

Theodore Nott- He was taught from an early age that the Dark Lord's propaganda was right. It is hard to imagine that he would not support her at school because of this upbringing. He saw that Muggle-borns are also people like him only before the Battle of Hogwarts, where he decided to fight. He was forced to kill his own cousin and severely mutilate his grandfather, but nevertheless found happiness shortly thereafter in the form of a relationship with Alicia Spinnet, where nine years after their relationship began, they were married. They never had children because Theodore was sterile, and instead adopted a girl from a magical orphanage. He was a Hit-Wizard.

Susan Bones- After her aunt died, she became very distant and cold, and the news that her death was the result of a Death Eater attack fueled the fire of her hatred for the Death Eaters and Voldemort. During the war, she organized a small group of people who, under her leadership, attacked various important places for the Death Eaters. She had never hesitated to torture or kill the Knights of the Dark Lord. After the war, she never returned for an eighth year and instead accepted an offer to become an Auror. She never had a long-term relationship with anyone, but the result of her one night with Blaise Zabini was the birth of Daniel Bones, whom she loved very much. She never informed Blaise that it was his son.

Hannah Abott- She was a very friendly and kind soul. With the news that Voldemort was taking over the Ministry, she fled with her family to the States, where she began her training and career as the Master of Ancient Runes. When she turned twenty-nine, she began teaching the Ancient Runes at Ilvermony. She never returned to England, and in the United States she started a family consisting of her Muggle husband and three children.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
