** I'm not sure about “decent”, but “Magical Metamorphosis” (linkffn(12507814)) has a trans Harry and while they do have potions that mimic a hormone therapy that would be about it so there's no magical gender bender MacGuffin whatever.

Then there's “To Reach Without”, but one, it's “on indefinite hiatus”, two, it has a magical gender bender MacGuffin blood ritual (whatever), and three, it's a specific kind of story because it focuses on making magic combat more hax and while that can be enjoyable it's certainly not the kind of thing everyone will like, just some. Hence, I'm not linking it.

That's about it with stuff that I can find in my bookmarks right now that isn't already linked. I know I have a few more there where it's implied that Harry is trans but not too heavily and they basically all start with a magical gender bender MacGuffin something so they're a no-go.

***** You're right. I'm sorry. I got too upset over it. It still shouldn't be being downvoted. The homophobia on this subreddit is way too prominent. Is that better?
