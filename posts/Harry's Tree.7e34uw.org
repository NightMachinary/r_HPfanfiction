Hello All,

I have been busy making a [[http://www.familyecho.com/?p=JQRNC&c=ncoysmsqov&f=441838998666911254][family tree]] based on the pottermore trees and It is finally done all is canon other than Charlus Potter and Dorea Black both are on the Black family tree as married but Charlus didn't appear on the Potter Family Tree so I place him with the only person who fitted the time frame and had siblings Hardwin Potter. Please let me know if you spot a problem, please ask permission to use this tree. Hope this helps in writing Fan Fiction.

Regards DragonTamer


** Linfred wasnt a potter. he was called potterer by the locals.The potter family has their name from him.

#+begin_quote
  The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer', became corrupted in time to ‘Potter'

and Charlus definitely isn't Linfreds son. Linfred lived in the 12th century, Charlus lived in the 20th century. Charlus and Dorea also had a son
