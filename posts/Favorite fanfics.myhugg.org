Just wondering what your favorites are that you would recommend.


** There's a lot of stuff out there. If you give some information about what you like I can probably do better.

I think my overall favorite that I think most people would like is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes). It's a goofy retelling of canon that had me laughing constantly.

My favorite canon-compliant worthy sequel to canon is the Theia Higglesworth trilogy. If HBO or whoever wanted to make a sequel I want them to hire this person. Fwiw I have a fairly large Harry/Hermione pairing bias, this is canon pairings, and I liked it anyway.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1344421]]

My favorite canon divergence is linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) It diverges at the beginning of HBP and changes most of the things that annoyed me in canon to things I like better.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** My favorite is probably The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie it's extremely long but it's very well written and I love it. She has some other really great stories as well, such as Storm of Yesterday. She's also on FFN under the same name.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

I'll probably end up coming back to edit my comment for more, FFN really screwed me when they completely redid their app and I lost just about everything. Still tracking down stories I really liked.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Some of my favorites:

The Like None Other series has been a favorite of mine for years. I really enjoy the developing relationships between characters who once hated each other and how they grow to be a family. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

The Pureblood Pretense. I didn't expect to like this one going in but I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the fear of discovery kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past. My favorite time travel story and the one that set the genre for me. I wish it was finished, but I reread it about every two years regardless. [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305]]

Leo Inter Serpentes is my favorite Harry/Draco, and has some of my favorite representation of Slytherin House. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

The Perils of Innocence is my favorite pre-Hogwarts fic, but it's also not finished. I really enjoy what is there though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/495672/chapters/86771]]

The Changeling is my favorite Ginny focused fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Getting the Hang of Thursdays is my favorite Snape focused fic, also includes Hermione. Time loop. [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/]]

  As the looming shadow of Voldemort's threat grows, Harry prepares for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as choices and challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is a Flintwood soulmate fic. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045][Bound]] is a great Wolfstar series. An AU in which Sirius emerges from the veil, when Remus is already married to Tonks. Brilliant characterizations, a lot of hurt and raw emotions with a hopeful ending. *Summary of the first work:* “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120][Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil]] Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521][Step back in Time]] This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][The Second String]] Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Great plot and characterizations. Canon and OC characters alike Highly rec

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] My favorite Death Eater!Harry fic (eventual Harrymort). In this one, Harry is the product of an affair between Lily and Regulus, Lily having seduced him to get intel on Death Eaters Harry grows up in an orphanage. His name in this fic is Izar, which takes a bit to get used to but don't let that stop you. Features cool world-building, especially in terms of spell creation, Death Eater raids and clashes with Aurors, manipulative and intelligent Voldemort, intelligent Harry --> good character arch/developement, Unspeakable!Harry, alive!Lily and James Potter, interesting plot and plot-twists.

** I've posted this elsewhere on the subreddit but my recent goto fic for a reread is linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help. Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching. Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

Second I'd recommend is Linkffn(Stages of Hope) which is a brilliant dimension travel story. It shows the other side of my first recommendation; how horrific child soldiers/martyrs truly are. With the war against Voldemort entirely on their shoulders thanks to canon!useless adults and actually competent villains, four such child soldiers are accidentally thrown into a different world; one where the adults on their side aren't useless or callous. This is the first story to make me choke back tears, with its themes of tragedy, healing and most importantly, /hope/.

On the fluffier side, linkffn(Home is where the Heart lies by SweetShireen; Imagination by Potato19; Baby, It's Cold outside) are all relatively short and sweet romance stories. Harry/Hermione. And linkffn(Twelve Days by TheEndless7) which is a post war Harry/Gabrielle.

For a longer romance, my favourite is Linkffn(Vox Corporis) which also has a unique take on the animagus transformation.

Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker) is about Lily surviving Halloween 1981 along with Harry. A good story about grieving and family.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) is also a recently favourite canon divergence story mid-way through 6th year. Same for Linkffn(Live Forever by Petrificus Somewhatus) for summer before fifth year.

Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat; The many deaths of Harry Potter) are two of my favourite overpowered Harry stories.

For action and friendly banter, my go-to is Linkffn(Wind Shear) and if you like James/Lily, I'll suggest linkffn(Where the Air Is Rarefied)

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)
