Hey guys! I'd like to discuss the use of OCs in HP fanfiction.

What makes a good OC? What are some common failings that most OC writers suffer? How can one avoid the dreaded Mary Sue? How do you handle an OC's interactions with the cast?


** First off I think its important to note that an OC in this context does not equal a character made from scratch, which means that not all character development guidelines apply. An OC is supposed to fit into an already finished universe.

Basically what makes a good character. Agenda, Passions, Values, Quirks, Dreams. If most of these are relateable and interesting, people are going to enjoy the character. It sounds simple, but it is a lot of work to make a character that isn't an archetype, but who feels human to a degree.

First and foremost, of course, the Mary Sue. But to that later. I think what most writers fail to do when they create a character is to make logical connections - cause and effect reasons - for the behavior of the character. Probably the best example here: Harry's childhood was loveless to a degree where people, rightfully, call emotional abuse and neglect. He has not known kindness from 1 year old onward until Hogwarts, yet he is kind and compassionate, even if he is a bit awkward about it sometimes. He needs to be in order to be the hero, but in light of his background it makes not much sense. If that is good or bad is an argument for another time, but in general a character should have a coherent development ending in his present personality.

The much more scarring failings I often encounter is the RPG character. I feel like a lot of writers in fanfiction write characters as if they're creating a new character for a D&D campaign, with stats and modifiers and the like. The result is a character with close to no personality, just like a fresh D&D character that hasn't been roleplayed yet.

Then at last you have the caricatures. Characters that are so emphasized on one trait that they are more the avatar of that trait than an actual character. Voldemort is such a caricature to some degree. He is an avatar of evil, literally incapable of love and he surrounds himself with more caricatures, such as Bellatrix who may be described as a representation of insanity. Bash-characters also fall under this category. A bashed Ron is stripped of any trait that isn't enforcing the notion that he is worthy of being ridiculed, humiliated and hated in general.

#+end_quote

Ever heard of "Kill your darlings"? Many Mary Sues are born because authors do either of two things. 1 - They self-insert (which is an absolute no-go. If you catch yourself self-inserting stop, erase and redo.) 2 - They love their character too much. Writers tend to make connections with their characters. Most of the time they'll like the protagonist and his sidekicks, hence they can't bring themselves to write any misfortune they succumb to, or bad they have inherently in themselves - they Mary Sue. There isn't really a method to prevent this. My tip to that is only: Give them a trait, or several at best, that harbor the potential for people to truly hate them for it. Give them weaknesses that may truly cripple them in some situations - that will take all of their willpower to overcome. Of course, standard "Keep your cool" applies, so no white hair and black eyes, no superfancy tattoos, no outfits straight from Hot Topic,... you know the drill. As long as it isn't plot relevant, don't make it an eyecatcher.

#+end_quote

Logically. I really don't know what else to tell you. If I make a pure-blooded character who has grown up reading and hearing about Harry, some awe-isnpired reaction will follow. If I make a character who is polite and values politeness, he may get in trouble with Ron. If I write a character that is bubbly and "hands-on", that personality will probably clash with Hermione's views on books, studies and learning.

If that sometimes is too abstract to figure out, a good method is to imagine both characters as friends of yours and then try and imagine what they would talk about (or if they would talk at all).

One of the most popular and frequently recommended stories on this sub is, IMO (and I've seen other people say the same thing), a blatant self-insert. I think fanfiction readers positively like SIs /as long as they can see themselves as the character./

**** True. I probably lost the focus on fanfiction there for a moment. Self-Inserts in general are bad character development, and the more detached you are from the world and culture you're writing yourself into, the more jarring this will be.

But in fanfiction there is of course the case that people have daydreamed about being part of a world after reading the original material. Self-insert fics are offering this.

The point stands, however, that self-inserts have a tendency to be Mary Sues, as the author (and therefore the character) have an outside, omnipotent and all-knowing perspective on the story.

** Are you talking about OCs in Hogwarts or in HP fanfiction generally? I like OCs (I write them, so obviously I do), I think it's a step towards originality and I detest making canon characters OoC. But equally, I am not a fan of shoehorning an OC into canon events -- I don't think it's necessary. There are plenty of spaces and missing moments in canon where OCs can fit in seamlessly.

Mary-Sues? Well, there are so many definitions and interpretations of what really consititutes a Mary-Sue that I'm inclined to believe that they exist purely in the mind of the reader and that's out of your control. All you can do in your writing is persuade the reader to like your character -- and you won't always succeed anyway. Write the character who's living in your head and don't worry about anybody else.

*** Totally agree with your 1st paragraph.

To me a Mary Sue is like the Buffy episode where a minor character uses a spell to suddenly be awesome at everything and the focus of attention in all circumstances.

** OCs have a strange roll in HP fanfiction. Within the Harry Potter world we have so many potential blank slate characters. Someone like Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones are for all intents an purposes OCs that have cannon endorsement and some background. True OCs are therefore prone to stick out if they are inserted into the same age bracket as Harry and co. You can get away with it for other years as so few people are given explicit names.

What makes a good OC? Well in my opinion purpose. What purpose, well as a character they should have goals, something that they build to as a person not simply to solve plot holes you've found in cannon. They should also have purpose for the writer. A poor OC is one who is either Mary Sue and or an irrelevant character named after a friend because they wanted to feel involved. Never write in a character without being able to justify it. Why do they need to be there, what do they add? Re-read the Santi's Harry Potter and the boy who lived. The majority of people in that story are OCs or at least blank slates and its considered by many, myself included one of the best.

Interactions with the real characters, well that depends. What purpose do they have? Are you adding a mentor, a friend, a rival or what? Whatever it is the interaction should be fitting, or at least fitting for where they stand when they are introduced. People tend not to become instant friends if they have existing friends. Harry, Ron and Hermione are their own cliche, tight enough its probably intimidating, nobody should be able to simply waltz up and join. Friendships that appear overnight would feel false.

*** In my stories I focus on the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs because frankly Rowling barely mentions them at all, even the ones in Harry's year. Also I focus on the Hufflepuffs because I wanted to make them something more than just a joke house.

** Ok, the basics.

Use a 'blank slate' character if at all possible. Hannah Abbott, Theo Nott and even Dean Thomas have very little said about them in canon. It shouldn't be hard to find a character that suits your needs. Failing that, find a Morag MacDougal or Oliver Rivers off Pottermore. Just none of this Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way bullshit.

Make the reader care about them / hate them. Easier said than done of course. Ideally, give them tangible goals that are inextricably linked/opposed to the protagonist's. Maybe give them a PoV scene. Give them flaws. Have them act out, show real emotion.

The three unforgivable OCs

- The Mary Sue dominates every scene. Like a black hole, they distort the fabric of plot and character around them.

- The Walking Infodump. Reading paragraphs of author headcanon is painful enough. It's even worse when it's coming from an author mouth piece with no relevance to the rest of the story.

- The Mysterious Old Man. Nothing more irritating than that smug idiot heckling the protagonist from the sidelines, with no characterisation, contributing nothing to the plot. Just don't do it.

*** Oh Ebony, that fic is still one I read every so often. It gets so ridiculous it's almost good. Vampires everywhere and Voldemort using archaic english. I can't believe it, a classic of he HP fandom.

On another note, if you want an example of what NOT to do with OCs, then that's it linkff!(My Immortal)
