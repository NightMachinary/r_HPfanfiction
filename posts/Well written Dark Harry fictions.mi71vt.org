I like slash and canon divergent fics but lately I felt like I need something different. I never read any Dark! Harry fics so I am excited! Note: I don't want to read anything that includes Snape/Harry, hermione/harry or Voldemort/Harry otherwise I am fine with anything. Thanks!

There you go. The entire downward spiral saga for you. There is a one shot I didn't link though. It starts of as Harry/Pansy but Haphne is endgame. Just don't eat while reading it. Okay? You might throw up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] This is an amazing Dark Lord Harry fic. My favorite actually. Keeps Harry in character with the no bashing. The ministry and DE are the only ones to get bashed

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** Just finished this one, I like it and it's got no pairings in it. Gonna be hard to find many dark fics with no voldy, draco or snape ones though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630]]

*** It can be anything I really don't have a preference aside from the ones I write. Harry could be the new Dark Lord or he could be good but doesn't mind using dark magic... What is dark for you? I am good with every possibility.
