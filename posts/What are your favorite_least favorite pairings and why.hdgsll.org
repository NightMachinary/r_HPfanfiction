For me, my favorite is kinda... basic? I have been addicted to Harry/Daphne. I have no idea why, but I just usually like how their backstory is written. Basically, I love the character of Daphne.

As for least favorite pairing, it would have to be Harry/Ginny. Blasphemous, I know. But let me explain. In half the fics, it feels extremely forced, or just downright cringe. I just feel its too vanilla, and boring.


** I like Harry/Ron/Hermione. Don't like any pairing involving Harry/Ron/Hermione with Death Eaters or people who are way to old for them. To me LV is asexual and Cursed Child is bullshit.

**** Albus Potter is and angstsy teen (with Harry as an apparently terrible father and a lot of other issues stemming from being in Slytherin) that decides to go back in time (with a time turner that somehow goes back years in the past) with Scorpius to save Cedric Diggory but just ends up totally screwing everything up. Oh, and Voldemort apparently has a daughter with Bellatrix.

** Favorite: Harry/Fleur. She's confident, intelligent, and knows what it feels like to get an enormous amount of attention for things she can't control. JKR shows us Fleur isn't at all so snobbish and superficial by accepting a very scarred Bill. I feel like the same could have been achieved with GoF/OotP Harry.

Least favorite: Harry/Hermione. Boring, cliché, and ff authors allow it to take over the story. Hermione being close to Harry in canon works against her for me, too. They're quiet together.

** I'll never read any Drarry, Snarry, Voldemort/Harry, but my Least favorite is definitely Romione. I just can't stomach it. "GNGNG opposites attract" People aren't magnets. They literally have nothing in common besides being Harry's friends. What would they even talk about? They'd just be miserable. And don't even get me started on the "old married couple" argument. Those who use it must have never seen any interactions between an old married couple in their life. I'll just stop there because I'm going to go on a rant otherwise. lmao

I don't have favourites but I like Harry/Luna and Harry/Fleur

** The amount of Harry/Fleur in here warms my heart.

That's my fav, with a close second being Harry/Daphne.

I like H/F I think primarily because Fleur is so passionate. I'm a huge fan when she stands with Harry, especially considering when they meet is when he really needs someone like that. I also admit to really enjoying when being Veela is addressed. I know in canon she's just 1/4, but damn do I like when you either are or arent a Veela. So much to explore.

And I'm just an absolute sucker for the ice queen.

** I've always hated Harry with Draco/Snape/Voldemort but used to like Harry/Tom. This changed when I grew to understand that there is little romantic about shipping a good person with a toxic one. This marked an change in the type of pairings I like. I like it when the ships are wholesome, the drama can come from the plot so that the ship can be one of the good things in his stress filled life. No politics, no trying to change eachother, no trying to redeem a magical nazi. Just two wholesome people that love eachother. I prefer the golden trio as a trio, not as a duo and a third wheel.

So I like Cedric/Harry. Harry already spends a lot of time describing how good looking Cedric is in his mind because J.K. Rowling is a woman. So him having his bi awakening for a genuinely kind person is always fun to read.

I have a soft spot for Harry/Luna. I don't actively search for it, because Luna often gets flanderized, but I do think they could work together. She doesn't care about how the wizarding world perceives Harry and likes him for him. The Dursleys installed him with the desire to be normal, he bemoans everything that stands out about him. Luna could help him realise that there is nothing wrong with being a little abnormal and loving yourself for who you are.

I would have liked Hermione/Krum had Krum been 17 during GoF. She was 15 making the gap tolerable. Krum is one of the few charachters to appreciate Hermione for who she is. I found him being to shy to ask her out cute. He is a triwizard champion, so there is no doubt that he could keep up with her intellectually. The point of the pairing is that there's always someone out there that loves you for who you are, so I'd prefer it without the Yule Ball 'she's actually really pretty on top of being smart' moment.

I like Ron/Lavender together. Ron ddeserves someone that doesn't demean him and who he doesn't argue with all the time. Never seen this pairing, but I would also like Ron/Tracy Davis. Him falling in love with a Slytherin would be a proper Romeo/Juliet with how much fanon makes him hate Slytherin. She's a blank slate so give her some ikes that match up with his.

Ginny ending up with someone she was obsessed with as a kid doesn't work for me, it could have had had Rowling not off screened her development from fangirl to independent badass chick, since I do like that she understands how it feels to have walked with Voldemort's soul in her body.

** i'm particularly fond of harry/cedric, harry/blaise, and harry/theodore if they are done right. Sadly these are all somewhat less common so there isn't as much well written stuff about them, but there are still some good ones.

I don't really like any het pairings (though obviously if the story is good then i'll still read it, i just prefer slash), and i definitely dislike harry with anyone who is much older (snape, remus, sirius, bellatrix, etc) not to mentions a lot of those are just weird to me (not that i judge those who like them, it's just not my cup of tea).

Most the other pairings are iffy for me but if it's well written i can enjoy them.

** I have to go with Harry/Fleur. I used to be Harry/Hermione then I discovered the gem that was Heart and Soul and Fleur became number 1. I'll check out any fic that has this pairing. Think one of the reasons I like her is because how passionate and loyal she is to those she cares about(which outside her family aren't many). She's confident, skilled and magically powerful.

Her being a Veela is also something that draws me. They are beings who have magic that are based off of love/lust. Harry of all people deserves every bit of love he can get due to his upbringing and Fleur to me is someone who can provide that in abundance. Her being a bit older also plays a part. With that age comes knowledge, maturity and experience that can benefit Harry.

My least favorite has to be Ginny. I've never liked her as a character all that much.

** Favorite: Either Harry/Daphne, Harry/Draco, Harry/Fleur....and Harry/Tom Riddle(don't downvote me). Fics like linkao3(full circle) and any of duplicity's works on ao3 got me into H/TR, but of course I don't ship them in their canon forms, only when there's some time travel/canon changes going on. For the other three, maybe I just have a thing for blond people, but I especially love Fleur because she's such a badass.

Least Favorite: Harry/Luna, or Harry/Older Female(AKA Narcissa, Bellatrix, or Andromeda). For H/L, I just love their friendship so much, and I think that it loses a certain something when you add romance to the equation. For H/FDE, they're all like, at least 20 years older than him, and it's just....ew.

** Some of my favorites are Remus/Sirius, Harry/Tom Riddle (only time travel, or Diary!Tom and he has a moral compass), Harry/Theodore Nott (pairing with Slytherin yay!), Harry/Daphne, and Hermione/Viktor (adorable but only if they're a bit older). Least favorites are Harry/Hermione, I don't think they have the chemistry, and Remus/Tonks, it feels like he's forced into it somehow and the age difference was pretty big when they got together, but I've got nothing against anyone who likes these ships.

** I freaking love Harry/Ginny. All you haters can say it's boring but it's the classic ‘Knight slays the beast and gets the princess' trope. Harry is the winner and he gets to eff the prom queen. Whenever I'm writing this pairing, even if I throw in a witch to threesome with them, I always make it clear that the Harry/Ginny pairing is solid. You don't go through what Harry went through just to blow your chance with the cute, sporty redhead.

As much as I respect Harry/Ginny, My One True Pairing is Ron/Pansy. I know, it's awful. Ronsy is a shameful, ridiculous, unsupportable pairing and I think that's why I love it so much. As ridiculous as Ron/Pansy is, it isn't any more ridiculous than Harry/Pansy, and there's plenty of that.

I can't read any boyslash. Like, at all. I embrace the Het/FFM. I can handle the occasional femmeslash (Pansmione plox). There has to be a vagina in there somewhere or I lose interest. I am also turned off by anything with a student and a teacher, even if it's Het.

I also don't like anything Marauder era, even if it's in my wheelhouse pairings wise. I just can't get into those characters for some reason. I also can't read anything with characters from that +fanfiction+ stage play.

I also pretty much hate Draco/Hermione or Draco/any-other-person-that's-not-Harry.

** I like different pairings at different times, depending on my mood. At the moment I'm into Harry-centric rare pairs: Harry with one of the older Weasley's (Bill, Charlie, Fred and/or George), Harry/Blaise, Harry/ Fleur, Harry/other minor female, Harry/other minor male character (including Death Eaters).

I'm weirdly into Harry/Barty Crouch Jr but cant really find much for it.

I think it's my natural cycle of fic reading. I read fanfic one fandom at a time and can be away from a particular fandom for years. When I come back to it, I'm usually into the classic pairings (Harry/Hermione, Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco, Harry/VoldieTom) but then I get bored and swing the other way, desperately seeking something different and interesting.

I never really took to Harry/Ron, Harry/Ginny or Harry/Neville. There are exceptions that I like but overall I don't search those ones out.
