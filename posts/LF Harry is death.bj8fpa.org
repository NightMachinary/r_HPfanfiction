If you have ever read the HP and Avengers crossover "The road less taken" I'm wanting more of that. That style of harry, it can be any crossover or not as long as he is literally that kind of death. If you haven't read it, check it out its like 5k words. No slash or fem!harry please. Any help would be great.


** Linkffn(Blindness) he becomes the master of death but even before he can kill people by looking at them.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Death is annoyed at an Asgardian for all the dead that he had been sending to Death's realm before their time. And Death lets his annoyance show. Master of Death Harry! Powerful Harry! Dark-ish Harry! And now a two-shot on popular demand!

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus)

It's fem!harry and isn't as direct as many harry is death fanfics, but in this(and most other fanfics by the same author) Lily(fem!harry) is the unwitting, or not so unwitting manifestation of death.

The authors fanfics in general tend to be rather fascinating.
