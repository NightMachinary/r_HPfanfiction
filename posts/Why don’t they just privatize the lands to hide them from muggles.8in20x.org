I was thinking about what I read in many fan works about how they hide magical locations such as Hogwarts and I was wondering why they do not buy the land or just show proof of ownership or the like and just not allow anyone to trespass? I'm sure special locations in the muggle world, like military bases or things of the sort, people aren't allowed to see through via satellite and with the magical resources I think it's possible to apply that to easily compromised magical areas. I just want to know why muggle technology would be such a big deal if you can also use muggle technology.

Let me know what you think about muggles being the next big villain after Voldemort and how to circumvent them.


** With rare exceptions, British law enshrines the "right to roam". Someone claiming ownership of a piece of land may not be enough to prevent people walking over it. If you were a farmer, you could not prevent someone from crossing your fields - they wouldn't be allowed to /stay/ there, they couldn't set up camp on your land without your consent, but they could cross it.

Scotland in particular (which includes Hogwarts) has fairly open access to land.

********** Well, my personal headcanon is that they cover other scripts too, possibly at NEWT level. Learning Old Norse and the magical overtones of the script would be a reasonable OWL course (assuming they're something like the old O Levels, which I'm /just/ old enough to remember). At NEWT level, they have options of old coptic/hieroglyphics, Archaic Greek/Linear A (which they refer to as Atlantean, naturally) and whatever the Voynich Manuscript is written in.

As to the magical content, the words 'alu' and 'tyr' seem to have escaped the Statute of Secrecy censors in our universe as being important to writing runic enchantments; the letters having meaning independent of their function in words probably helps. Packing sufficient meaning into your inscription would, one assumes, express sufficient magical intent to make the writing magical if the writer had the necessary spark.

And, of course, the pre-literacy pottery marks represent the earliest gropings of magicals toward written magic: the first enchantments would be things like "this pot won't break easily", "butter in this pot won't spoil", and "weevils can't get at your flour in this pot."

Latin alphabet indeed supplanted Futhorc runes. As we can see from the fact that nowadays wizards used Latin alphabet to write. You seem to be mistaking letters/runes for language tho. Learning to read/write runes doesen't mean the students could verbally converse with anglo-saxons,vikings etc anymore than i could speak with a Roman, even tho I write this using Latin letters.

From the fact that Runes are taught i'm assuming that the Latin alphabet wasn't accepted as quickly among wizards as it was among muggles. Not too suprising since those latin speaking Catholics were rather fond of some good old witch burning.

EDIT: I was exaggerating about the witch burning. But i think it safe to assume that Christian priests/monks who were spreading the Latin language/alphabet wouldn't get along too well with magicals and vice versa.

Witch-burning did not really become a thing until the very, VERY end of the medieval period - burning for /heresy/ was a thing, but not so much witchcraft. It wouldn't have been relevant at all for the transition from Futhorc to Latin script. Saxon jurisprudence wasn't completely sure witchcraft existed for a long time; the laws that eventually came into play around it under Athelstan (Alfred the Great's grandson) were secular more than canon law, and mandated four months in prison and a sum of weregild to the family of the victim rather than execution.

************* Futhorc was used in Christian inscriptions too. Several of the surviving Saxon Futhorc inscriptions are explicitly Christian - one of them is the names of the gospel writers on the coffin of a saint.

At the relevant date, the church seems not to *care* about magic very much. They put penalties in place for devil worship, but not magic, and usually argued that magic wasn't real.

One tenth century canon law text effectively says that witchcraft isn't real, it's not a problem for normal people, everyone could calm down now thanks. Trying to argue that your neighbour was a witch was in itself something that no good Christian should do, and if *they* thought they were a witch then they were clearly a bit mad. By canon law logic of the time, any magical thing you thought had happened was a hallucination sent to try you, so *believing* in the power of that hallucination was failing the test that either God or the Devil had put in front of you. /It's not real. Just don't believe in it, no matter what someone tells you they can do or whatever weird thing you see./

Others explicitly ban witch hunting, because “witches aren't real, the magic they claim they can do doesn't do anything and the witch-hunters just make a mess!” One pope (I want to say it was one of the Gregorys) wrote to a king to /forbid/ him from putting witches on trial in any way - blaming crop failures or storms on witchcraft was taking power that should have been God's alone and assigning it to crazy but completely innocent old women, and hurting or killing the innocent would naturally piss God off.

Secular authorities may or may not care about magic. We know what Athelstan's feelings on the subject were - someone who admitted trying to cast a spell to harm another person copped jail and a fine, and he would have been a few decades pre Hogwarts.

Church authorities were too busy telling people “For God's sake calm down before you hurt someone, it's not real!”

************** I am actually aware of the churches standing on it in England. The thing i was trying to say(rather poorly i admit), is that Latin was taught by priests, monks and the like mostly. I'm pretty sure, since the clergy were the main educators during these times in Europe.

But why would a Wizard go to learn from clergymen? If the priest in question were to find out that the person hes teaching can do magic, well the Churches stance on the existence of magic wouldn't matter to him. Either the Wizard in question is blessed by god, or more likely(if the wizard is forthcoming) hes a witch, the response to that can vary, but it probably wouldn't assist in learning.

Assuming that Wizards at the time were literate and used runes and probably had some sort of a magical society(doesen't even have to be tight knit society), why would they go out of their way to learn a new language? Especially if they had to hide their nature from the people teaching it? I'm not sure exactly how literate the average dude in the isles was back then, but probably not very.

In such circumstances wizards are unlikely to learn a language from muggles. Antother vector for the Latin alphabet to spread to wizards would be muggleborn, atleast after Hogwarts was built. But if the literate folks are a minority, then literate 11 year olds muggleborns are going to be a minority also. They would likely adopt the runic writings of Wizards.

While i do wonder why Hogwarts would not offer Latin courses, considering their spells tend to be kind of latin-ish, I am not suprised they would put more weight on Runes.

*************** The most likely way for a wizarding society in England to become literate...to my mind, that doesn't consistently happen until Alfred, who we know founded schools and strongly encouraged the idea of a literate, historically aware Saxon elite. If he could make them believe they had one coherent history and culture, then they could /fight/ as one.

However, by Alfred's time, the Latin alphabet was already dominant over the Futhorc for almost all uses. Texts like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles were written in Old English (only one source text, the Canterbury Bilingual, uses any other) but using Latin letters. Wizards don't have to speak Latin as a language to use Latin as an alphabet. They'd have spoken Old English like anyone else, and almost certainly used Latin letters over runes.

Alfred was the 870s. Hogwarts seems to have been founded in the late 900s. Futhorc runes were officially buried by Cnut in 1016 or so, and they were well and truly gone by 1066.

And wizards didn't HAVE to hide for centuries yet. The Statute of Secrecy that hides them now doesn't exist yet. Malfoy Manor exists because Armand Malfoy was William the Conquerer's pet wizard and good mate.

**************** I didn't say wizards had to hide... I said that while catholic church denied the existence of wizards, if a clergyman saw a actual wizards he would no doubt not be too willing to teach the wizard. The Fat Friar (Huffelpuff ghost) was born in 982 and joined a monastic order. He was executed when senior churcmen found his ability to cure pox by poking the ill with his wand to be suspicious.

Why would wizarding society become literate with the rise of Alfred schools? You are saying that Wizards would not learn Futhark runes before that time? Why the heck wouldnt wizards be literate before that? They would be the respected, don't have to work from dawn to dusk because they can do magic people. In a world where wizards exist they would be the shamans,druids and the like that wrote down things and were more educated than the standard. In Rowlings world if wizards didn't know how to write before writing became more common, than why would anyone else have know a written language? And yet obviously Futhark existed and it was used in writing. And obviously according to Rowling ancient runes were the ones used by wizards and witches for a long time.

All your argument are about the real world. While i was merely saying why it's plausible for Rowlings fictional worlds wizards to write in runes for far longer than muggles would. Because it's a canon fact that wizards wrote in runes far longer than muggles did.

***************** CFuthorc declines in England /well/ before Alfred's time. He's late ninth century, and none of our surviving examples of futhorc inscriptions are later than the very early ninth. It was declining decades before he was born. If the wizards are relatively integrated in the society (which they should be at this date) use of the futhorc runes as primary script should become less and less common for them at the same time. They might survive as a secondary script for specialised purposes, but not ordinary usage.

As for why I don't think wizards were commonly literate before Alfred...it's because people weren't in general. Blame the Norse.

Wizards would be unlikely to be literate without Alfred because Viking raiding in the early to mid 800s effectively *destroyed* literacy in Britain. Whatever level of literacy existed in England before the late ninth century, the Norse trashed it. It's unlikely ANYONE would be very literate at the time, wizard or not.

Let me explain?

Anglo Saxon society does its thing. Then the Vikings turn up and start breaking shit.

Manuscript production was healthy enough before the raiders came, if confined to specific parts of society, but it *plummets* in this thirty to forty year period; many existing texts were destroyed when the buildings that held them were sacked, the scribes were killed or abducted and the manuscripts that were made to replace the losses were exceptionally poor - looking at them now, they're full of errors, messy and honestly looking as though they were penned by scribes who couldn't read what they wrote well enough to recognise the mistakes. They'd been taught so poorly and understood so little, with no one really good left to help them, that they were copying without comprehending. It all looks wrong.

Here's Alfred himself on the subject of what he remembers from his own youth, when the raids were in full swing.

#+begin_quote
  "Learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand...I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either"
#+end_quote

He himself could read, though he didn't do it especially well for a long time. He was well into his twenties before he could both read and write his mother tongue, and past thirty when he learned Latin as well so he could translate things. Even a king had to grow into a man before he got it right.

My point is, when the Norse came most of the books were destroyed. Most of the scholars who would create books were dead. We can assume that wizarding texts probably fared a bit better than Muggle ones, but that's splitting hairs. That's arguing the distinction between "every text destroyed" and "ALMOST every text destroyed". Even if wizards fared a bit better than Muggles, that's still a hell of a lot of destruction and loss. Loss of both books and living knowledge = loss of literacy, right? No books to read, and no one to teach you how even if you find one in a fit state.

Alfred's schools, the gathering in of surviving scholars from everywhere he could find them and the requirement that freeborn Saxons attend so they could be literate...these were all a conscious attempt to reconstruct what had been lost and keep the knowledge alive. Recreating destroyed manuscripts. Commissioning new ones. Translating books from elsewhere - not solely religious books, but also philosophy and history - into Old English (the vast majority of instruction in Alfred's court schools was in Old English) because they were "needful to all men to know".

A percentage of English wizards might have known how to read and write before the Norse came, just as a percentage of the Muggles did. But that knowledge almost certainly took some very real damage after the raiding began...and it's Alfred who makes it a common expectation and preserves it for England as a whole. Magical and Muggle both.

There's a reason he's called "the Great".
