Just an idea I'm playing around with for a merged universe crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I probably won't write it out in full any time soon, I'm too busy, but I'm just putting the idea out there to see what people think or if it prompts any discussion.

Short version: SHIELD notices some weird shit is going on in England during the first Wizarding War. A young Agent Coulson, still training with Fury, ends up in Godric's Hollow on Halloween 1981, and SHIELD ends up taking custody of Harry under the guise of Coulson adopting him. Coulson being the good man that he is, would of course come to see Harry as his son, and put his interests over SHIELD's when possible. Would probably end up as a May/Coulson ship as well, but not right away.

Harry probably wouldn't go to a Wizarding boarding school- it would be too hard to keep him under observation, too big a security risk for SHIELD (and yeah, him not being there for stuff like the Chamber of Secrets would have ramifications). Instead I'm thinking they'd negotiate an alternative with Dumbledore, who would recommend Remus Lupin as a tutor for Harry (under SHIELD supervision).

Would eventually end up with (adult) Harry as a liason between SHIELD and the magical world, and as a superhero during the events of the Marvel films, ultimately taking part in the Infinity War. I'm toying with the idea of it being a Harry/Black Widow ship too.

Oh, and the events of the MCU would undermine and ultimately destroy the Statute of Secrecy.


** I would totally dig this fic.

*** Thanks.

I think there's a lot of potential in crossing over these two universes, but it seems like a lot of the Harry Potter/Marvel stuff I've found is him turning out to be the son of Thor or Loki, and its just the usual Ultra-Awesome Harry power fantasy. And hey, I've got a soft spot for the Son of Coul, and think he'd make a good dad (at least in so far as his responsibilities with SHIELD allowed him to be).

** I'm /pretty/ sure there's a crossover fic with a similar title and a premise, fwiw. Linkffn(Harry Potter Agent of Shield)

*edit: that's . . . not even the one I was thinking of.

  Life is complicated for Harry Potter. He had been a model student, a genius, and had graduated with multiple masteries in subjects. He spent years butchering countless evil people and ended up SHIELDs radar, and now Harry joined SHIELD after time as vigilante and was resigned to a life of boredom and lack of challenges. After all, how exciting could being a SHIELD agent be? ON HOLD

*** Wouldn't surprise me. Pretty much everything's been done in Harry Potter fanfic, I guess.
