My apologies if I've used the wrong flair or anything.

I'm working on a series of 'snapshot' sort of stories, looking at moments in the life of a first year student after the Battle of Hogwarts and the Second Wizarding War.

I've posted them [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ysenia/][here]] on my self-named subReddit if anyone would be so kind as to have a look. It's set shortly after the books, after Hogwarts has been rebuilt but before any of the next generation are old enough to attend.

EDIT: Oh hey, I'm on Fanfiction.net now :D [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7227135/][Find me here!]]


** Why didn't you posted it in some site like fanfiction.net?

*** I've had the subreddit set up for a while and it was easiest. I'm looking into an account on fanfiction.net right now though. I just wasn't sure how many reads I'd get there, just considering the sheer volume of fics on that site.

EDIT: I've got an account now but there's a 12 hour cooldown before I can actually post

**** Just as a note, you're going to get way, waaaay more reads on FFnet than you'll ever get on your own subreddit.

***** FWIW I've gotten more reviews on Reddit but I only have like a day of data to compare. I'll just have to see how future posts go.
