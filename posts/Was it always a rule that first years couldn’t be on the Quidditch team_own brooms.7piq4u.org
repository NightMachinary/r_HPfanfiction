I always assumed that the rule that first years can't try out for the Quidditch team or own a broom. Is that fanon?


** There's a line in the acceptance letter that mentions the no broom thing. Right at the bottom of it.

#+begin_quote
  PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS

  ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICK
#+end_quote

I don't think the whole First Years can't try out for the Quidditch team thing is a rule that's stated in the books, but I think that's just an extension of the No Brooms thing, if it is Fanon. :)

*** I remember seeing that line in the acceptance letters. So, it's believable that Charlie Weasley could try out for the Quidditch team in his first year?

**** Yes. If he'd get a spot would be another question. First years joining the team is probably so rare - Harry was the youngest player in a century - because most kids aren't naturals on a broom. They need flying lessons and time before they are good enough to join a team. If in your story Charlie is a natural or include that he's been flying at home before coming to Hogwarts, I think you could even have him join the team. I also think that Seeker is the most realistic position for a first year. It's enough that he is fast and a good flyer. But e.g. a Beater also needs strength, and an 11-year-old playing against a 16-year-old... well...

***** I know I have Charlie practicing but I haven't decided if I want him to be on the team. Though, I have Aidan Lynch (he's only mentioned once in GOF) as a second year trying out for seeker. Then next year Charlie's second year, he'll be on the team and Aidan will be the reserve seeker.

****** Did a quick search who this Aiden Lynch character is and found that he plays for the Irish during the Quidditch World Cup in GoF. I have no idea what your story is about, but if you put Lynch in a different house he might be an interesting opponent for Charlie. Someone who is exceptionally good and also a Seeker. If Quidditch is important in the story. If it doesn't fit, just disregard my comment ;) What's your story about?

******* It's about the older cousin of Oliver Wood who is in Charlie's year. I made Aidan a Gryffindor and he'll be Seeker for a year and then Charlie will take his place and they're rivalry of sorts steams from there.

**** Don't forget about Katie Bell. JKR is really bad with numbers and her year wasn't revealed in book one, and when it finally was said, it turns out that she would have had to have tried out in her first year. So that in turn means that the statement "you must be the first house player in about a century" could maybe just be applied to the first seeker in a century. Either way, it's one of those throw-away lines that seems whimsical and magical on first glance but as soon as you delve into it it creates a whole mess of literary problems. -edit- unless of course Katie's first year on the team is also Harry's, but it's pretty heavily implied that it's not (though that's not a definitive answer)

********** Hm.. there's this passage in PoS:

#+begin_quote
  „Seeker?' he [Ron] said. ‘But first-years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about --' ‘-- a century,' said Harry, shovelling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ‘Wood told me.“
#+end_quote

and then later:

#+begin_quote
  „Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.“
#+end_quote

So from the book, I get the impression he is actually the youngest player in a century (which of course makes him the youngest seeker too).

** I think it's okay for first years to try out. From HBP on that tryout Harry held:

#+begin_quote
  Half of Gryffindor house seemed to have turned up, from *first years* who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating.
#+end_quote

So no, not a rule. I think the "no first year tryouts" thing came about from the "youngest seeker in a century" thing. Maybe first years are really just generally outclassed by older students.
