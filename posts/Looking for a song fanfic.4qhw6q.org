Hi, I'm looking for a postwar fanfic at Hogwarts where Hermione goes home every weekend and is being abused. Snape accidentally discovered it in her memories because Hermione got in the way when Snape tried to use legilimency on Harry. Snape heals her and eventually saves her. Ring a bell? Please help! I've been searching for months! I meant SSHG STUPID AUTOCORRECT
