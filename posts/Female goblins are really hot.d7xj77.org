The reason we don't see any female goblins working the counters at Gringotts is that the males keep them under guard. [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OlV46][They're all lookers]] and the males don't want wizards propositioning to them. Wizards after all have a reputation of being debauched and will get it on with any species up to and including giants.


** This could actually be canonical, as a matter of fact, if it weren't completely tonally off. The one female Goblin we've ever canonically met, in the /FB/ movies, is way more attractive than any male Goblins we've seen.

That being said, I've also considered the idea that Goblin society is matriarchal, for which reason all the Goblin wives get to just enjoy a life of luxury living off the riches produced by their husbands, while /they/ are stuck doing all the work, which is the reason the Gringotts workers are all males and grouchy.

Of course, there is always the possibility that there /are/ female Goblins among the Gringotts workers and they're just never pointed out in particular. Maybe because Goblin females are indistinguishable from males for humans who don't know any better, or maybe you just disregard the movies' depictions altogether and imagine there were female tellers as well.

Conversely, I'd find it more interesting if Goblin society is about more than just banking, and the truly important work is mainly done by the women out of sight of wizard-kind. In that case the male goblins at Gringots would be grumpy because they have to do the less exciting flunkie labor to maintain the front.

*** Oooh, maybe it's like the dwarfs in the Discworld series: Since they are underground dwellers, the big-shots, the most important movers and shakers, live in the deepest caves and never go up to the surface because the surface is all rubbish and doesn't have a solid roof. The ones you do meet on the surface are generally nobodies or poor people who can't afford living in the deep, or emmissaries who make the surface contacts and take care of necessary above-ground deals so that the big kahunas don't have to.

If the HP goblins are the same, then Gringotts banking would be seen as an important but unpleasant job; you need to be up on the surface to deal with the humans, because we need all the trade and also they don't start killing us if they see us as allies... but it's a chore rather than an honour; the rich and important goblins don't have to sully their hands with it.

Combine this with the matriarchal idea, and there's why we only see male goblins: The girls are in the deep down and do the Big Important Stuff.

It's an unpleasant job, all right. "Here, go and deliver customer service to racists who hate you 10,000 feet above the altitude you're comfortable at."

Hence my headcanon that Gringotts is Goblin Siberia. Hardship posting for the guards, prison colony for the bank staff. They're all surly and grouchy because they're criminals and political prisoners and dissidents.

**** Nah, Xanth started out as pretty typical 70s fantasy - including the latent misogyny (Chameleon can be hot and stupid, bland and unnoticeable, or smart and ugly - depending on the time of the month) - with a heavy dose of whimsy. Later, as its charm and humour devolved into endless series of puns, Anthony's distressing tendencies towards hebephilia started coming out and it got creepy.

I /think/ the bit about goblin girls came up in either /Question Quest/ or /The Color of Her Panties/, but I haven't read them since I was a teenager and frankly can't be arsed to look it up. This was a sort of second Renaissance "high point" for the series, before the story quality started downhill again.

But so it goes.

******** Standalone, a horror novel called "Firefly." I highly /dis/recommend it.

His Xanth novels tend to be more innocent, but have some uncomfortable subtext. Lots of mostly-naked pubescent teenagers running around with older men. Come to think, the Mode series has that too... And the Battle-Circle Trilogy... And Bio of a Space Tyrant...

Teenage me had utterly no grasp of subtext, unfortunately.

****** Hardly his worst, either, though... which similarly says a lot. I'm honestly a little surprised there isn't a fanservice-filled anime out there based on the Xanth series, given the focus on panties in the later novels. It would be the perfect setting for an isekai series, seeing how many Mundanes end up in the magical world...

That said, I recall the merwoman (Mela?) being an adult, so... older than 16? I can't recall what the threshold was for joining the Adult Conspiracy, though, and most of the characters around her were tweens and young teens, so she might not have been that much older than them to be perceived as an 'adult.'

** Oooh! Veela are the females, Goblins are the males, and humans are too dense and racist to realize they're the same species. Each trait is only dominant in the same gender. Only female veela will have veela daughters, boys will take after the father, whether it's goblin(in which case, normal goblin son), human, or giant. Likewise, a goblin only has a veela daughter if he marries a veela - Flitwick has a normal human sister.
