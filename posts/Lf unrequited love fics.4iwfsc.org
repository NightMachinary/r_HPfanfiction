In a weird mood, so I'm looking for a fic that's preferably non-slash and Harry centric, where one of the characters has unrequited love for the other. It could be for either the whole fic or most of the fic. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) is the best romance fic in the fandom IMO. It fulfills this request better than any fic I've ever read.

  For years Ginny Weasley has tried to stop her feelings for Harry Potter. She's even uprooted her life. But what happens when it's time to come face to face with him again?
