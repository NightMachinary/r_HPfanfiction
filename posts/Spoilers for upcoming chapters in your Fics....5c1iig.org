When writing a fic, do you release spoilers for an upcoming chapter on that fic every now and again whilst updating it or not?

If you do, how do you release them? Is it via Social Media or on the fic you're already working on?

I occasionally place hints about events in upcoming chapters on Facebook now and again, with a generic Facebook page for most of my stories, and a Facebook page just dedicated to a certain fic.


** I don't. I might answer a question in a PM with "That reaction will be shown in the next few chapters" or such, but that's as far as I go.

** I don't spoil for the next chapter since I'm not popular enough for that to have any effect -I only write the name of the chapter. However, I do pauses between the multiple parts of the story, genreally during several weeks. To keep the reader's interest I post sort of a "Next on..." with sentences from the upcoming part. I also post smaller chapters during the hiatus.

*** I used to post the chapter titles in advance. However, when your MC is a vampire in BTVS and your next title is 'scooby snacks' it apparently causes some concern.

*** Did you write the Slytherin Harry fic from Ginny's POV, where he has Sirius as a dog and he and Ginny had a marriage contract?

**** Not at all, I don't know that fic. I usually write about Hufflepuffs, OCs, and I rarely ship Ginny/Harry. Aaaaand I almost always write in French ;)

***** That is probably a deciding factor then, as I can't speak French to save my life so I'd probably have remembered if it was in French :p

** I leave 'em hangin' till the next update.

I post scenes from the incomplete chapter in advance on DLP, but that's mostly to scratch the posting itch when I'm not done with the full update yet.

** I would consider teasers -- something opaque and spoiler-free that will pique interest.

** Spoilers are not always bad, because they indicate the story is not abandoned and the author has planned ahead.

** Jewels5, author of "The Life and Times" used to do non-spoilers for upcoming chapters

eg "Lily wears a coat. James receives an owl. Gunhilda of Gorsemoore makes an appearance."

I always enjoyed reading them.
