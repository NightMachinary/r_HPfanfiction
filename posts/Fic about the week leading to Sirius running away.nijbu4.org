Hey everyone, reading fanfic has been my saving grace during lockdown, so I started writing one.

I've already posted 4 chapters. It explores how Sirius's relationship with his family finally breaks down.

Feel free to check it out and chat to me about it ( I usually update weekly).

**** I would suggest not having the dialogue be in italics as that's a turn off for a lot of people
