I forgot the name of the oc but basically she's pansy parkinson's sister and she gets abused by her father (her father favours pansy). In the 1st-2nd chapter, Oc sees that her sister has a ring on and she asks where she got it. Pansy said she got it from her dad and she felt a bit jealous. Pansy notices so she gives the ring to her out of pity and they go down to attend the ball (that their parents arranged i think) Once theyre at the ball, her father notices that pansy has lost the ring so he gets mad at her in front of everyone but then pansy blames her sister for 'stealing' it from her and point at her finger as proof. (i dont remeber if their dad slaps pansy or the oc)

i also dont have enough analysis to help but ill edit this once i hopefully remeber

ps i also dont think anyone that read that book coincidentally has reddit and comes across this but i would literally cry if that happens
