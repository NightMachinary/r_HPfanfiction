Based on copyright law that protects parodies, could a crack / parody / comedy fic be sold without being prosecuted?

I've seen some parodies for sale on Amazon, like Barry Trotter: And the Unauthorized Parody and Hairy Pothead: The Stoned Sorcerer, and even theatre plays like Voldemort and the Teenage Hogwarts, where says in the site: Voldemort and the Teenage Hogwarts is not authorized, sanctioned, licensed or endorsed by J.K. Rowling, Warner Bros. or any person or company associated with the Harry Potter books, films or play.

But others like Tanya Grotter were banned in most Western countries, being restricted to Russia.

Could i write a crack fic, or a parody and sell on amazon? how is the law in this case? both copyright and British specific? could i do this using the same characters? or original characters and setting? if so, is there anything that would prevent me from publishing a plagiarism as a parody? To be clear, I don't intend to do this, but the idea came to mind after a discussion with a friend about copyright and fanfics

** [[/r/legaladviceofftopic][r/legaladviceofftopic]] would probably be able to do a better job of answering this.

But from my limited and quite possibly flawed understanding of copyright and IP law, I'm pretty sure the worst that could happen would be you receiving a Cease and Desist letter, followed by a lawsuit if you don't comply.

Short answer is no to crack, yes to parody. Specifically if you wanted to write about Larry Spotter and the Glowing Red rock, that'd be fine. But everything it it must be original. So names, ideas, objects, etc. You can't use "The Sorcers Stone" but you can use "Glowing Red Rock" for example.

Basically you can write a book that calls to mind Harry Potter but isn't actually about Harry Potter, just folks will see the similarities.

That being said, if your book starts picking up steam, you could probably expect a cease and desist letter from WB and JK anyway, and then a lawsuit if you refuse. You might win, but it'll cost a lot if you go that route.

Not a lawyer and this isn't true legal advice obviously lol.

***** Nah. Flamel and Philosopher's Stones predate Rowling by centuries. The lawyers can't go after you for using them anymore than they could for using Merlin, phoenixes, and wands.

Best overview of the law, but if you can wait until Saturday, I might be able to find some relevant case law in my old textbooks.

** Your legal position is kinda irrelevant. If you make enough money to draw the attention of Warner Brothers, you won't survive the expense of defending yourself from their lawsuit regardless of the merits.
