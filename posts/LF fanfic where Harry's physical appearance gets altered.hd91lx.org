I wasn't really sure how to title this, since its a very specific type of story that I'm looking for.

I'm basically looking for a story where James or/and Lily adopt Harry when he was a baby, and use some kind of magic/potion to change his appearance to look like a Potter. Then years later the magic/potion wears off, and Harry suddenly looks like a completely different person.

~~~~~~~~~~

I've found two stories with premises like this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11594215/1/The-Curious-Case-of-Romulus-Lestrange][The Curious Case of Romulus Lestrange]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645943/1/The-Black-Secret][The Black Secret]]

~~~~~~~~~~

I'm not expecting there to be an abundance of these types of fanfics out there, but I would appreciate any you could recommend.

Thank you. =)


** It also happens slightly in blood adoptions.

In a reverse of most stories, in order to protect Sirius, Harry blood adopts him in Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao.

Sirius just happened to have the materials necessary for a blood adoption. He'd been planning on adopting Harry and making him the Black heir, but this was better. After the ceremony Sirius conjured a mirror and looked at his new self for the first time. "Holy smackeroly! I look like you!" The green eyes were the most significant change, but the shape of Sirius's face showed that he was clearly Harry's child. Except for his face being twenty years older than Harry's face, of course.

  Unbreakably bound to someone you can't stand? How unfortunate.

  Harry has learned that speaking in Parseltongue makes some people hate him and others fear him. He had not learned that it would make Draco go straight to his parents and tell them that he has reason to suspect “Harry Potter” is actually his missing twin brother. As far as Harry is concerned, life would be a lot better if he was the Heir of Slytherin.
