** I have two in my calibre library that seem to have the 3rd premise you mentioned.

linkffn(Bound to Him by georgesgurl117) which I have not read, so I can't say if it's what you're looking for. Not likely since it was first published in 2011. 540k+ and apparently updated recently.

For Someone Special by LadyoftheMasque which was posted on Restricted Section. [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/2014/10/13/for-someone-special-by-ladyofthemasque/][This review]] has a link to the story in two PDFs. 580k+ words and there is a plot but also a lot of sex.

  At the behest of Lord Voldemort, Snape is forced to commit an act he finds most undesirable. While working to thwart the dark plot, he must find a way to live with himself and also atone for his actions to the one he hurt. WARNING - dark content!
