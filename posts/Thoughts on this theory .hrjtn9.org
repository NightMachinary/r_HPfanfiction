** I think it is absolutely lovely theory. Of course, we with zero support in the canonical evidence, but still lovely. And I really like what it makes of Ron's character. Thank you.

Evidence? This is fanfiction here we don't need evidence. if anything we see evidence and do the exact opposite just to spite the evidence!

*** It kinda makes sense, with Boggarts being entities associated with fear, it would only be natural for their creation/spawning being tied to moments of absolute dread being experienced.

**** Poltergeists being created from mischief is interesting too. The two places we hear about a poltergeist are Hogwarts and the Weasley home (probably spawned by Fred and George).

***** There is no poltergeist in the Weasley home? There's a ghoul, but that's an actual creature they study at school.

**** I had always felt that boggarts were more about dark, enclosed spaces - reminiscent of that childlike dread of under-the-bed, the back of the cupboard, etc.

**** Do you remember the one at Grimmauld Place?

It was the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix at the time. The members completely trusted Harry/Dumbledore and firmly believed that Voldemort was back. They were undeniably brave, but they must have felt scared, especially since some of them lived through and fought during the last war.

What if all of those fears accumulated into and formed that Boggart?

** That sounds like a good theory! And as well as that, we could tie it up with a new ribbon - that boggarts, when no-one's there, take the form of their creator's worst fear.

** Not very solid in terms of evidence, but I feel it fits HP magic - having boggarts be created from a build-up of fear that becomes sentient is delightfully macabre.

** It's a solid theory, and very plausible. My only gripe with it though is when people stretch it to mean things it doesn't, such as Ron being a very powerful wizard and that's why it happened when the powerful thing is his fear here, not his magic. I think it's consistent with other themes like the patronus charm. If you're not really strong of character then you cannot cast it, Harry is powerful magically sure but he also has immense strength of character and indomitable will to cast the patronus.
