** Fixing Past Mistakes (on FF.net) did a pretty good job of portraying Hogwarts (and Wizarding Britain as a whole) as backwards and racist and nowhere near as good as the Professors think it is. It features Snape time traveling to save a three year old Harry and taking him to St. Lucia to grow up in a school that integrates magical and non-magical students and has kids learning magic as early as four years old. When Harry learns about Hogwarts, he doesn't even want to go there because the House system sounds like it would interfere with friendships and first years can't even play quidditch. It takes a while to get to the good stuff with the schooling, but worth the read IMO.

*** I'll check it out thanks. I love the idea of a school that mixes magical and non magical kids. Great for families that have one magical sibling and one non magical one so they don't have to separate them

** It certainly isn't great, with its fair share of problems and is definitely far from perfect. That entire world is unsafe, to me, because if another person breaks into my house right now, I still have a pretty good chance at winning if I fight back. But a more skilled witch or wizard? Goodbye, World.

But I'd still take it over this one.

** Petrification Proliferation. This is an often recommended fic, but definitely worth the read. It's set in Book 2 after they discover the basilisk, and Amelia Bones comes to investigate Hogwarts and basically loses her shit. Sort of a “what would happen if actual adults were in charge of the magical world” fic.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

A ton of hogwarts fixes not driven by MC. Truly one of my favorite fanfics. Not completely fixed and everything, but fixes are realistic. (Nothing changes completely overnight)

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
