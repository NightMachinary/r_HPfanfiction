I have yet to come across about a convincing in-universe argument that Dumbledore was taking good care of Harry and deserved the "kind-grandfather" depiction he gets when he is not bashed to hell and back. Obviously, the logical argument is "he was a book character", but /"sorry Harry, but I did nothing because the series is about you"/ breaks the fourth wall and can therefore not be used in a story.

So the biggest roadblocks for selling me on "good guy Dumbledore" are:

- The Dursleys. The protection did stop Quirrel from harming Harry, but not Pettigrew. In the 7th book, the Tonks' home repelled Voldemort's assault and that could exist without an abusive environment, so there were alternatives. And given that Voldemort was waiting just outside of the wards in DH, Harry was not protected in Elementary school either. And that is not even considering that he never made sure that Harry was treated decently, especially as he knew that it would be "ten dark years".

- Harry, Sirius and Hagrid. We know that Sirius gave Harry to Hagrid with his bike and Hagrid was travelling for an entire day (maybe with a stop). Yet McG is already the Dursleys on the morning of Nov 1st (why is she there?) The "official story" only became a thing when Sirius confronted Pettigrew, so why was he not the first choice of guardian at that time? He gave Harry to Hagrid peacefully and, before he was accused of any wrongdoing, Dumbledore had bypassed him already in favour of an estranged aunt with a massive dislike for magic. And to quote Wikipedia: /"In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child's upbringing and personal development, to offer mentorship or claim legal guardianship of the child if anything should happen to the parents"/, so there should be some legal basis for his guardianship.

- Harry, Hermione and Sirius in 1994. How much Dumbledore is to blame for Sirius unlawful incarceration is a different debate based entirely on fanon. But how could a "good" Dumbledore stand by while the Minister was about to summarily execute an innocent man? And advising a pair of teenagers to break countless laws is not an adequate action, especially since Dumbledore still had political influence and was the most powerful wizard around. Even if a political solution was impossible, he still should have come along with the time turner.

So are there any in-universe counter-arguments in favour of Dumbledore? I am not advocating bashing here, but there are many shades between "good" and "evil-manipulative Dumbledore".


** To number two: Dumbledore thought Sirius was the secret keeper and he knew there was a spy, so naturally he assumed that their death meant Sirius was either dead or the traitor. So I don't think that argument works against him. With the godfather gone, giving Harry to his only living relatives is not a terrible idea, but rather logical. The ministry would have probably given Harry to them as well. Although I agree that he should have checked in on Harry later on.

I don't think Dumbledore was evil, but neither was he perfect. And I think he never really took people's feelings into account, focusing on what's logical instead (a bit like Voldemort, actually). It'd be logical for Lily's sister to take in her nephew and take good care of him, but she just hated her too much. It would have been logical for Snape to be nice to Harry and work with Sirius, and for Sirius to stay in Grimmauld Place, but both men weren't rational in this. Dumbledore failed in appropriately judging how people's feelings would guide their actions.

(Emphasis mine). Why didn't he bother visiting Sirius in Azkaban and asking him about his betrayal? You know, an Order member betraying his best friend? Surely Dumbledore could spare a few hours in a decade. Dumbledore had enough clout that he could get the Ministry to absolve Snape by just testifying that he'd turned spy so why didn't he speak to Sirius and try to get him freed?

I mean, especially in that first chapter she just comes across as a total bigot. She doesn't object to the Dursleys as PEOPLE, she objects to them because they're Muggles. Just comes across as the standard anti-Muggle bigotry that you see everywhere in the wizarding world. I don't blame Dumbledore for not taking that into account.

I don't disagree that he shouldn't have ignored Harry for a decade, but he would still have to suffer them for say 3 weeks to a month every year as, again, it protected him against Voldemort and later teetered him to life so long as Voldemort lived.

The reason Harry survives at the end is because Voldemort took his blood. "Harry thought he saw triumph in Dumbledore's eyes, but a moment later it was gone." I'm paraphrasing, but Harry says something like this after telling Dumbledore about Voldemort taking his blood.

In fewer words, Dumbledore worked to ensure Harry would live. Happiness be damned.

No, James had told Dumbledore Sirius was their Secret Keeper long before Pettigrew killed 12 muggles. So, if Voldemort was able to enter the house Sirius had to tell him. As Flitwick tells us in PoA, the secret is in the soul and it must be given freely.

"Talk or I will cut off your balls" is generally a good way to get information. It is impossible to magically force the secret out of someone, but old-fashioned coercion is not covered by that.

Dumbledore believing Sirius was innocent is not the same as Fudge believing it. In the very next book we see Dumbledore use veritaserum on BCJ and Fudge still had him kissed despite Snape and McGonagall explaining things. Also, Veritaserum isn't used in legal trials because of occlumency.

Raise Hogwarts defences and point out the incompetence of the Minister. It would be difficult to explain the whole mess for Fudge when all Dumbledore asks for is a fair trial for a man who is unquestionably guilty, so it would be just a formal thing to go through. So why is the Minister so set against a reasonable request by the guy infamous for defeating Grindelwald in single combat? Dumbledore is not proposing someone coming back from the dead but merely fears a filing error since there are no trial records.

Edit: Also bring up that Fudge threw Hagrid into Azkaban as a PR stunt.

******* 1. He attempted to hunt down a terrorist hiding between muggles. Not the best idea, but endangering the SoS at worst

2. Which just proves how dangerous Pettigrew was and that killing him would have been acting in self-defense of others (eg a bystander shooting an armed robber to protect an old lady). And in 94, he tried to protect Harry from Pettigrew, the same logic applies. And yes, in a perfect world, he should have contacted the authorities, but that was clearly not an option. So he was acting given a clear and present danger. At least that's how a good lawyer could spin this.

3. He was unlawfully incarcerated. He was fleeing from his captors. That is not against the law.

4. Harry, Ron and Hermione attack Snape, not Sirius

5. Clear and present danger, he was trying to protect them from the mass murderer Pettigrew

6. Trespassing is punishable with ten years of inhumane torture? I don't know where you're from, but if I were to go to a random school, the police couldn't even arrest me for that.

7. And that's punishable by over a decade of torture?

8. So he is being punished for the illegal shit the Ministry did to him?

I can see 8 as a point against custody in 94, but not more. Any law student could get him out of anything you just mentioned after a year at university.

And stop claiming that Sirius is the one responsible for the people Pettigrew killed. Even if you apply "the intent follows the bullet", it was still solely on Pettigrew.

\6. You are allowed to kick a door in to save someone. And given how dangerous Pettigrew is proven to be, the clear and present danger to any Gryffindor would allow Sirius to break in as he was the only one aware of it and the official way had proven its inability to resolve the matter.

If they're honest with Dumbledore from the beginning he isn't going to Azkaban for being an animagus in 1981 and he'd served his time many times over in canon. He's not going to Azkaban for a Death Eater killing more muggles. And if attempted murder includes the 1981 Pettigrew stuff that's not happening either.

Edit: they told Dumbledore he was the secret keeper, Barty Crouch was ambitious and needed a spectacular W after his son was outed as a DE, Fudge is pretty much the same minus the son, and I'm 10% certain Sirius' guilt made him confess in a way. The other stuff doesn't/wouldn't matter.

Without mentioning all the potential way to lie with Veritaserum, this potion only make people say that /they think/ is the truth.

So by the same logic, Dumbledore could have come with them, caught Pettigrew and then presented the rat to the Minister, unquestionably clearing the whole situation up. Only the trio thought that Pettigrew got away, there would be no timeline violations if Pettigrew was in fact caught.

The dementors only care about humans, Lupin and Sirius will distract each other as well as Snape and the trio.

Or even easier, apply the permanent sticking charm in a ring outside of the escape point so that Pettigrew runs into it, is stuck and can be picked up before the charm is cancelled. Or use that AoE stunner Dumbledore used in OotP, get Pettigrew and do a little bit of memory modification so that Harry and Hermione do not remember.

In all seriousness, the upper limit of transfiguration in one go seems to be around dragon size, which gives you more than 100 tons of steel in one go (wood to steel is the first one they learn).

And the thing with Dumbledore is that you either take his canon actions as proof that he couldn't do better, which makes him rather incompetent, or as malicious since he had alternatives but deliberately chose the canon path.

** The in-universe answers are simple. Petunia's blood was the only absolute protection there was. Dumbledore was unwilling to defy Ministry rules because he refuses to use his magical power to dominate.

The real answer to all the inconsistencies, of course, is Rowling's errors. Early installment weirdness. Dumbledore in-universe is /good/, and trying to apply rigorous logic to his actions is pointless, if enjoyble.

*** For your second point, it's also important to realize how the genre switched over time. The first novel abides by children's fiction convention - namely, that the adults (while well meaning) are fairly incompetent, and that the challenges are right at the level the protagonists can beat.

Like, out of universe it's easy to see why each of the challenges was placed, they're there to showcase each of our heroes. Ron gets the chess match, Harry gets the flying, Hermione the logic puzzle. There's the narrative setup from what they'd learned earlier in the year - the devil's snare, the troll, the mirror... It's all /conveniently/ right at the level of our main characters, and not at all up to the task of, you know, stopping one of the deadliest dark wizards ever.

That's not something we can really reconcile in canon without jumping through a lot of hoops. It can be fun to do so - after all, there's no need to rehash canon in fanfiction, and exploring more realistic forms of those is always interesting. But you're not going to find something that fits all of the characters' later displayed abilities and motivations perfectly into a novel with completely different plot/conventions.

The books also have a heavy case of self contained magic system, which is /great/ from a narrative point of view... and terrible for consistency. Rowling coming up and including new magic earlier in each book to solve problems is a lot of fun - eg, the time turner setup for the climax of PoA. But, of course, it then introduces a lot of problems - like why time turners were never used again. Which we can again jump through hoops to justify in canon, but at a certain point we have to realize the /real/ reason for it.
