** Sounds like something I'd like to read. Honestly, did Harry ever have a positive interaction with a muggle in his childhood? The Dursleys were awful to him, and everyone seems to buy into their bullshit about Harry. The kid went around in cast-offs at least two sizes too big for him and his cousin bullied him relentlessly yet none of his schoolteachers showed any concern for his welfare.

*** I personally think it should actually make him want to separate /completely/ the words (eg. stealing the muggleborn children from their parents for their own protection; removing any right muggles may have on the magical world to the point that if a wizard invaded the muggle's house, kill his family, tortures the sod and then the muggle swears at him the wizard will be within his rights to have the DMLE send the muggle to Azkaban without any form of trial or even showing proof beyond his word; and creating towns away from any kind of muggle settlement).

As someone who was bullied throughout my school years, trust me, this is the default attitude for teachers to take.

**** A few:

1. Magic could save a great many innocent lives (cures for diseases, increased production of resources, etc).
2. The Statute of Secrecy is enforced by a draconian set of laws which are upheld by mass mind control of non-magicals and forced segregation. This denies non-magicals their rights to freedom of choice, freedom of information, and self-determination, while encouraging magicals to view them as lesser.
3. Therefore, the Statute of Secrecy requires magical society to be increasingly authoritarian, while treating non-magicals as subordinates, who cannot be trusted. It also denies non-magicals the right to make informed choices about matters that will affect their safety (something in which their leaders are complicit), essentially rendering democracy and self-government a sham in every single nation on Earth.
4. It is probably inevitable that the Statute of Secrecy will fail as population rises and science and technology develops- and while there's really no good way to end it (a lot of people will react very badly to the revelation of a secret magical society that has been manipulating their minds with the knowledge of their leaders for centuries), arguably a controlled, planned exposure of the magical world is preferable to an uncontrolled one (say, a Death Eater attack in which the first exposure to wizards is one that inclines people to see wizards as terrifying monsters).

***** 1. Agreed. Even if we stick solely to what's shown in canon, that's some really useful stuff that could benefit humanity as a whole. Fuck: Skelegrow /alone/ would be amazing!
2. Even ignoring the rights issues you lay out, I feel I have to point out that any form of law (in this case the Statute of Secrecy) that includes "Mind control/mind wipe the unsuspecting populace" as one of the core tenants, is probably flawed in its premise.
3. Wow. Did not think that like, every government everywhere is a total farce. Yeah, that's a good one.
4. Satellites, thermal imaging, sonar, there's a lot of tech that would help reveal wizards. It wouldn't even be that hard to do a planned exposure. A handful of carefully selected wizards come out and show off a few of the simpler things that they can do, and you reveal the wider wizarding world over a period of a few years.

Also, on the topic of technology: Hogwarts is, by my estimate, about to see a massive decrease in people attending their school/people staying at their school. See, the thing is... Hogwarts has no WiFi or cell reception. Yeah, try getting a twelve year old to give up the internet and cell phones after like, 2010 in order to learn magic.

****** Yup.

The SoS's role in the magical world reminds me of the role slavery plays in the history of the United States- Something utterly morally bankrupt, done for the profit of a small powerful minority and excused by prejudice and fear, which will inevitably fail, but is so central to the system and such a contentious issue that it cannot fail without immense conflict and bloodshed, and which has reprecussions which will doubtless haunt the world for centuries even after its gone.

Gradual reveal is probably the best approach in theory, from the perspective of preventing total war, though an instant reveal is better from the point of view of stopping the mass violation of Muggles. But any attempt would likely be sabotaged by Dark Wizards on the magical side and religious fundamentalists who still think magic is demonic on the non-magical side.

I wonder if some of the smarter wizarding leaders, like Dumbledore or Moody or Kingsley, are kept awake at night thinking about the inevitable day the Statue fails. Knowing that their whole world is basically sitting on a massive time bomb, but there's no way they can disarm it without setting it off- the most they can do is choose when and how it goes off.

******* Yeah, wizards are only "better" in that they don't have muggle slaves. Nah, they have an entire slave /race/ for that instead!

Well, the wizards could work with the local governments (and some specialists that are sworn into the Secret) to bring the Wizarding World up to speed a bit behind the scenes regarding laws, rights, recent muggle developments, etc while the muggles are eased into things.

Any attempt /at all/ would be sabotaged by someone, so you just try to account for it and roll with the punches. Not really a better option if you're doing the reveal.

I don't think they would. Even the "smart" wizards are kind of... arrogant, concerning muggles, and I can honestly see them either thinking A) they would never be discovered, or B) that even if they are it's just /muggles,/ what are they really going to do?

******** I think Dumbledore and Kingsley would probably think of it at least- Dumbledore is very experienced, no doubt debated these issues during Grindlewald's day, and is open to the Muggle world and to seeing value in things most wizards don't. But he'd also have too much baggage related to Grindlewald to contemplate the idea of undoing the SoS I think- he'd see it as going down the same path, even if it was done in a different way and for different reasons. And Kingsely, though smart enough about Muggles to flawlessly fit into the Prime Minister's staff, and certainly someone who recognizes that Muggles have value as people, can't really do much on his own.

Also, if you take Cursed Child as canon, its implied that Voldemort, while having no concern whatsoever for the lives of Muggles, knew enough at least to regard them as a threat- because his regime paid off the British government to cover up his followers' crimes, rather than trying to openly rule the Muggles. Makes sense really, because Riddle spent his summers as a kid in WWII London, and probably has a better idea than most wizards of what Muggle weapons can do.
