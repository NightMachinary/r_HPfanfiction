Harry is immune to Obliviate and Avada Kedavra due to them both being magics that target the soul? Obliviate causes the sould to be 'unaligned' with the mind and that's why things aren't remembered. AK severs the sould connection to the body. Eventually all magic Harry is immune to become new unforgivables?

Don't remember much. It was also likely an OP Harry fic, obviously.


** Was it a time-travel fic? Where Dumbledore tries to erase Harry's mind?

*** As time-travel is one of my guilty pleasures, quite likely. If I recall correctly, it was Dumbledore who attempted to obliviate Harry.

**** Anything else you can remember would be helpful.

For instance, do you remember anything unique in the fic that you haven't seen anywhere else? Characterization, setting, plot e.t.c.

***** If this is the fic that I'm thinking of (but can't remember the name) they (mostly Hermione?) realized that Harry had abnormal reactions to certain spells which included the unforgivables and this led to them expanding the list of unforgivables. Also, Harry only recovered his memories after sleeping for a few hours.

  "You see," he began as his smirk widened into a grin, "I'm immune to any and all mind-controlling magic; including the Killing Curse, the Confundus Charm, other Compulsion Charms and... the Obliviation Charm."

It probably isn't the one you're thinking of but it's the only one I know of / have read with that theme.

  Unfortunately for Dumbledore's plans, Harry had never been a normal wizard. At the time that Harry returned from to the past there had been not three, but seven, unforgivables. The ministry had based them all off Harry.
