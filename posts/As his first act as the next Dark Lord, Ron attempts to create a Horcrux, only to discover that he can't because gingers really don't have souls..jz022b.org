"There must be a mistake..." Voldemort looked at his wand as if it failed him for the first time in almost fifty years. "Let us try again. Avada Kedavra!"

Nothing happened.

"What the..." muttered Voldemort. He inspected his wand closely, trying to find what was wrong with it. "So... Any last words?"

"Diffindo!"

Thus, Voldemort fell to the power he knew not.

**** The only stupid thing about Quidditch is the seeker. The rest is great.

The way to make it better is to either:

- Remove the snitch and play on a clock to 90 min

- Keep the snitch and lower the points it gives to 50

- Keep the snitch and play three 30 minute periods with the possibility of catching the snitch in each period with it being worth 20, 30, and 50 points in each respective period.

***** One fic author had an amazing quidditch fix: no seeker, instead of 3 chasers you have 4 “slashers”. At 5 goals, a slasher can try to catch the snitch for 50 points (catching the snitch doesn't end the game). Each time they score after that, they can try to catch the snitch again, and each time it's worth an extra 50 points (100 for the second catch, 150 third, etc).

It was super interesting, cause it meant the tactics of a game could really shift based on who was playing - Harry is amazing at catching the snitch, so keeping him under 5 goals is a priority; if a player isn't great at catching the snitch but amazing at scoring goals, it might be better to keep them on goal scoring even if they qualify for a Seek.

Game ended after an hour I think

******* It was a Slytherin Harry one, Hinny with them both in Slytherin and both in the same year; lemme see if I can find it rq. It's also a “Lily lives” story, and be warned - Molly gets bashed pretty hard, though there's an “explanation” for it in one of the later books.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter) it's pretty damn long, since each year (and this one, the prehogwarts stuff) is its own fic. Currently on year six, though I'm not caught up atm.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.
