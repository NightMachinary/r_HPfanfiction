I read a rather interesting Buffy The Vampire Slayer crossover called [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-394/Fyre+The+Eighth+Weasley.htm][The Eighth Weasley]], where an in-universe JK Rowling published the books. (Harry sighed, shaking his head. "I just want to know how that Rawlings woman found out so much about me.")

Anyone got any other fics that do this? (Or failing this, any other good Whedonverse crossovers? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] was a fave of mine for a while. Not generally a fan of crossovers, but something about Joss' work seems to mesh well)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1098763/1/When-Harry-Met-Buffy][When Harry Met Buffy]] is a funny post-DH crossover that portrays the Scoobies pretty well, and Harry is decently done too. It's worth a read.

** In The Words Of Ginevra Molly Potter is a very good one. The books and movies are mentioned early on, then later on in the story too. Also JK Rowling is a character in the story. The story is basically Ginny's POV of the seven books, and a teensy bit afterward, with a very good ending.

There was also another one I read recently, but can't remember the title at all. It is about an OC character grew up in the muggle world not knowing she's a witch, however familiar with the world of Harry Potter as seen in the books. However the real wizarding world is a bit different from the one Rowling writes. The person is discovered by Harry and the characters who are trying to stop a threat in the Muggle world, I think.

Wish I could remember the title, it was a pretty good story.

** This isn't /quite/ the same thing, but your post made me think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/Strawberry-Fields][Strawberry Fields by Minstrel Knight]]. "A hypothetical AU in which a most unlikely person removes a baby Harry from Privet Drive and leaves him with the Grangers, along with seven popular children's books. HarryGinny."

The books aren't published in universe, but they exist alongside the characters. The books were actually published in an alternate universe where they were pure fiction, then were brought to the universe of Harry Potter by The Doctor. The crossover-ness with Doctor Who is minimal to barely existent, though. (I've never seen Doctor Who and there was nothing off-putting or confusing.)
