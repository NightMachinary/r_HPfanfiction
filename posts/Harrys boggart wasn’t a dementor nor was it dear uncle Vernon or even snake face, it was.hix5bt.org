** Honestly, the best boggart I've ever read involved Vernon. It was a oneshot crackfic about Harry suffering extreme mental trauma before his third year, with the image etched into his mind permanently, and when he stepped up to the boggart, Hogwarts spent the next week in mourning because Harry's entire year and one professor ended up in St. Mungo's mental ward after witnessing Vernon and Petunia having sex.

** Professor Lupin, along with most of the class, looked on in confusion at the handsome young man that had stepped out of the cupboard. Harry, on the other hand, paled dramatically. "Harry? Who is this person?" Lupin asked, taking in Harry's pale face. His canine sense for the evil and untrustworthy, one of the helpful effects of lycanthropy, was sending shivers down his spine; whoever this person was, they couldn't be good news. The boy smiled at the question, causing half of the class to back up in fear.

"Aren't you going to introduce me, Harry? No? That's all right." turning to Lupin, "Tom Marvolo Riddle, at your service, Professor. But of course, none of you has heard that name before." Tom smirked, drawing his wand with a flourish. Just as the real one had done in the Chamber, he wrote in the air in a fiery script.

TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE I AM LORD VOLDEMORT

The class screamed in terror, some of them fleeing entirely. "Of course, Harry knew that. Did you not tell them, dear Harry? Tsk, tsk, tsk, keeping secrets already. I didn't start doing that until OWL year, at least! But of course, it's like Professor Dumbledore said. We are very much alike.". That prompted Harry to speak for the first time during the confrontation. "We are nothing alike, you monster!" Harry shouted, striding forth angrily. Tom grinned condescendingly.

"That's quite amusing Harry. I think you know just as well as I do how untrue that is. What is it the Headmaster said? Ah, yes, that we both have "qualities that would have made Salazar Slytherin proud.". Something about a quick mind and a "certain disregard for the rules"." Tom laughed. Harry looked furious at this, as Tom noted with glee. "Oh-ho-ho, does that make you angry, Harry? Does it make you want to do something to shut me up? Do you want to HURT me, Harry? Make me scream and beg for mercy for daring to insult you. I KNOW you do. I. KNOW." Tom said, his grin and voice taking on an edge of mania. "N-n-no, that's your job, isn't it? Hurting people over imagined slights, because your ego is so fragile you can't handle being called a crazy, horrid, freak of nature!" Harry inquired; if anyone noticed his slight hesitation, they did not mention it. Tom scowled briefly, but recovered quickly. "Such LIES, Harry. You should be ashamed of yourself. Nice attempt at riling me up, though."

The class stood stock still, dumbstruck, as the wizard and boggart began to circle each other, wands out. "You do want to hurt me. I can see it in your eyes. I can teach you the most wonderful spell for that. The incantation is..." Tom began, but whatever the incantation might have been, they never found out. Several things happened at once. Ron pulled Harry back; Hermione took his place in front of the Boggart, which shifted into the stern form of Professor McGonagall; and Lupin fired a spell that shoved the demon back into the cupboard.

Hermione and Ron hugged a shaking and pale Harry as the rest of the class stood in shocked horror. The 'snick' of the lock shutting sounded like gunfire in the silent room. Lupin looked around at his students. The Golden Trio were locked in a fierce embrace; Patil, Brown, and Li were crying openly; Longbottom was quaking; the rest that had remained were too shell-shocked to move. "Class dismissed. We're going to the Hospital Wing. Calming Potions all around, I think." Lupin ordered. As a group, they all left the classroom, Harry being supported by Ron and Hermione, taking with them new emotional baggage that would send ripple effects throughout their lives.

** Harry was only thirteen, of course.

And like most thirteen-year-olds he didn't quite know what he believed in or what he was willing to fight for, or even what he wanted.

He knew he loved Ron and Hermione, of course. He would die for them. Without question.

But beyond that, things were kind of a muddle.

He did his best to stay focused on classes, if for no other reason than to avoid Hermione's wrath. And he /loved/ flying and Quidditch and he loved the fizzing-happy-sparks that shot down his whole body when he was playing Quidditch or thinking about Quidditch or talking about Quidditch with Ron or when he was practicing Quidditch with the twins and the team and with... Oliver.

Oliver was so smart and so focused and so fit. His shoulders were broad and strong and his legs were firm and clutched the broom with such surety and when he laughed or barked out commands or laughed his eyes shone and his teeth flashed bright white in the rare Scottish sun and the wind blew through his hair and Oliver was just Oliver and Harry loved Oliv... Quidditch. Harry loved Quidditch.

And one day Harry saw how Dean and Seamus sniggered and laughed over some muggle magazines and tried to hide them. But then they showed Harry and even offered to let him borrow them "just for the night" in exchange for some chocolate frogs. And Harry never knew people did stuff like that. Oh sure, he'd heard the jokes and heard Dudley's rude comments and heard all sorts of things. But he'd never seen it and these muggle magazines were shocking. Almost more like anatomical textbooks than anything romantic, so explicit were they.

So Harry pulled the curtains around his bed and it took six or seven tries for him to properly set up the silencing charms and then he looked. And he looked and looked and his eyes devoured images that were exciting and scary and confusing and exciting. They were all men and women and some of them were women with women but again and again Harry felt his eyes tracing exciting lines across the men.

Harry's body responded and he had vague notions about what to do with those feelings, but he didn't, he couldn't, he wasn't sure what to do with his reactions and so he did nothing but look. And look and look at the pictures of joining, writhing bodies and smooth skin and strong muscles and sharp jaw lines and dark eyes under heavy brows, promising danger and surrender to an electric power that was so much more than anything, more even than battle against a basilisk and possessed professor.

The next morning Harry awoke early, having had dreams that he thought maybe he shouldn't have had - after all wizards dated witches and Dudley and his mates joked about that and so Harry knew his dreams were wrong. They were /wrong/. And all morning, Harry felt doubt and self-hatred and confusion. He ate breakfast in slow, careful movements, worried that even eating too fast would dislodge the bad thoughts from his head and his traitorous body would... react... again.

He made his distracted way to Defense class. Hermione never stopped her chattering, reassuring background noise that it was. Ron offered the occasional joke or observation or condemnation of slimy Slytherins, and the sounds just rolled off Harry.

They sat in class and Lupin talked about something called "boggarts" and Hermione said something about "non-beings" and the lecture continued on in its measured rhythm. And eventually, finally, they got to the practical portion. Harry was to face his greatest fear and repel it with a simple charm.

Harry felt calm. Confident.

He knew his greatest fear would be the Dementor from the train or some hideous deformation of Quirrel's skull with Voldemort's misshapen face screaming out mother's dying screams. The macabre thoughts danced along the periphery of Harry's awareness. For all that his palms sweated and his heart raced at the thought of facing down his "greatest fear," his mind was still comfortably abstracted by last night's distractions. By Dean's magazine.

And then it was his turn. Everyone else had gone and Professor Lupin was going to skip him, but he spoke up and now it was his turn.

He took a measured step towards the rattling cupboard. The rattling increased in frequency and volume. The rest of the room was silent - the students all recovering from their own tiny traumas and Lupin in a state of watchful alertness.

Another step. The cupboard rattled furiously, louder than it had for any other student.

Harry's mind flashed back to the Hogwart's Express. Flashed to Quirrel. To the basilisk.

For a single, traitorous moment, his mind even put him back in the cupboard under the stairs.

And with an unflinching resolve, he took the final step forward.

The cupboard ceased its rattling. The doors flew open so quickly they were instantly thrown off their hinges and flung to the floor, shattering in a flash. A thin, green miasma shot out of the cupboard, formed a glistening pool on the ground for just a moment.

And a heartbeat later resolved itself into the image of a seventh year student in Slytherin robes, Head Boy badge shining prominently on his chest. Pale shining eyes and prominent cheekbones and dark tousled hair greeted Harry. An arrogant smile, barely pulled into a not-quite-smirk pushed the shining perfection of his face into unbearable beauty.

Harry's breath stopped in his throat.

Tom Riddle, of course.

Beautiful, brilliant, perfect Tom Riddle.

Tom as he appeared from the diary. But not with the edge of malice and insanity that reveled in Ginny's death. There was in Harry's vision none of the petulance and arrogance that would craft a pseudonym from a cheap anagram, only the utter perfection of Tom's features and his flashing eyes and brilliant grin and Harry moaned low in the back of his throat.

His body betrayed him and his heart pounded and his vision narrowed, all the world reduced to a featureless grey, all nothing, all meaningless, all that was and all that could be was Tom's perfect face and beautiful smile and Harry's mind was captured and Harry's heart loved and Harry's body lusted and somewhere, somewhere deep in the recesses of Harry's soul he screamed in horror at his greatest fear.

His greatest fear.

His first true love.

Tom Riddle.

** This happened in linkffn(Travel Secrets: Third) which is third installment of my favorite time travel fic series. In third year when the DADA class is shown a bogart Harry's is a sane Tom Riddle who became minister of Magic through political intrigue instead of war. Here's an excerpt from chapter 22 of Travel Secrets: Third.

“/CRACK!/

/Harry's jaw dropped./ /Smooth hair and polished boots, a sleek black suit with a billowing robe; finely embroidered and emerald green on the underside, his shoes clicked neatly in time with the cane he carried, one even more ostentatious than Lucius Malfoy's, headed by a moving silver snake. The man smiled in a lazy sort of grin; showing perfect teeth, but reflecting more arrogance than joy./ /'Well I don't expect you voted for me.' He smirked down at Harry, his red eyes looking out of place on the smooth skin./ /.:But someone must have:./

/Fortunately, the whole class (Remus included) reeled back in shock at who the Parseltongue implied it was, so no one could guess Harry had actually understood. Harry however, was reeling at the meaning./ /'Finally actually a Lord, I presume?' Harry snarked back, once he found his voice (taking longer than he'd like to admit). The room was completely silent around them./ /Tom Riddle brushed a long thin (and chillingly similar) finger over the gold name badge. 'Minister Voldemort, actually.'/ /Harry's blood ran cold, and he felt his body twitch against his own will, but he otherwise maintained his mask. He tilted his head to one side, he forced his brain to think this through./ /No. Minister Riddle maybe, but as Voldemort-/ /'Riddikulus.' He drawled./ /Behind him several people screamed again./ /Harry didn't blame them really, but to him, Voldemort was much funnier in his serpentine form. It was a parody of how dangerous Tom Riddle could have become. His solitary 'Ha!' carried over the hushed whispers of the room, and was so heartfelt that the boggart paused, confused (A look that would never have been seen on Voldemort's face)./”

** It's not exactly a spoiler to say this, although initially it is something else, Harry's boggart becomes Tom Riddle in Antithesis, linkao3(7322935).

If you haven't read this story and want to just read Chapter 28: Boggart, it helps to know that this is a WBWL fic, Harry is kidnapped/adopted by Bellatrix, then blood-adopted by Tom Riddle, so their appearance is very similar. He is called Adrian at this point in the story. Honestly, I think his initial boggart is more chilling, and am surprised that more of the Hogwarts children do not have a parent or relative as a boggart.

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** And the Ridikkulus spell (or however you spell it) turns him into an overblown caricature of a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Complete with a high backed leather seat, a mustache to twirl menacingly, and a stark white snake in his lap for him to pet.

But he's stuck to the chair and gets bit by the snake, causing him to tear off the mustache he was just twirling.

  Revisiting the concept of boggarts in Snape's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Harry was wholly prepared to face the faux dementor. But what stepped out of that darkened space was something else entirely. A handsome boy with a gleaming prefect's badge and a cruel smile.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.
