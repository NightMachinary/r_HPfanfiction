I have ADHD and I have never been able to finish a chapter fic (I've probably gotten to over 40,000 in 30 different fics and never finished them) because I get distracted, I get writers block, alternatively I have too many ideas, I hate what I write, I get bored of what I'm writing. Basically I just need someone to let me bounce ideas off of them and help me pick what to do sometimes because I have a three part series that I love but I dont think any of them will ever get done. The series is\\
1. Remus Lupin x OC 2. Charlie Weasley x male OC 3. George Weasley x OC

Please someone let me throw ideas at you
