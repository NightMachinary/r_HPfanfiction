I recently finished this (well finished whats been written so far as its still being updated). By 1/3 of the way in it had quickly become one of my favorite stories and to be honest, I was not expecting that going in. It sounded fairly tame, its description was minimal, and was rated T. I almost always prefer M rated content as it often feels like a T rating means the author holding back to appeal to a broader audience. To be blunt this story could be M due to cuss words and death/violence.

Ok that out of the way... I loved the story. It felt true to cannon but with a unique path and choices and in my opinion, more realistically represented "Harry Potter" as a whole. Not just the idea behind who Harry is, was, and could be.... but also representations of everyone around him. A better representation of Hermione, Ron, Snape, Tonks, Dumbledore, school mates, all others he is around, and so much more.

Even the path taken seems more true to what I "feel" it would be.

I can honestly say, despite reading many many HP FF stories over the years and loving many of them, this one was the FIRST I have ever felt was more styled towards what in my mind I wanted Harry Potter to be. It was one of but a couple Fan Fictions where I felt like I was reading a stand alone story and not just another HP fan fiction.

--------------

So while I wait for the next chapter, I am asking for recommendations from those who have read it or know it, on additional stories like it. Preferably leaning more Mature of course. I realize its a big ask and a vague request but there it is.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

*** Don't know why you're being downvoted since it is a valid reason for not completely reading it.

From what I can understand, the premise is if soul scar is gone and given hormones, how would Potter's interaction with the cast and himself change?
