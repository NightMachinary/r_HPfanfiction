By humanized, I don't mean that life was even more unfair to him than presented in the original series (as if it was not already enough) but I would like to see some introspection into his character and what makes him so evil.


** I have a...story that sort of (?) fits this. It isnt necessarily the historical timeline of Tom-Riddle's-Rise-To-Power, but it is an elaborate examination of Tom Riddle and his possible perspective on evil etc. It's a time travel story where Tom comes to the future due to a botched ritual, and shit ensues. The story is pretty dark, there's no ships.

** there is no canon stories about him, anything that would be written by fans is fanfiction not canon

*** OP probably meant 'canon compliant', i.e. filling in the blanks in ways that don't contradict canon.

**** which wouldn't fit, cause there is ALOT unknown about his early years. names of teachers (besides headmaster, transfiguration, and potions) attitudes of people around him, how houses treat eachother and so on
