:END:
It's after the wizarding war I believe, Harry is planning to move to the elemental countries, but runs into Draco Malfoy who decides to come with him, especially when hearing that there are no muggles. Anyway they arrive there, and go to Suna first where they meet and befriend Gaara who they give a communication mirror. They then on to Konoha and lie on the entry forms when it asks how many people they have killed. This is later found out by Kakashi and Might Guy, when it is revealed that they have killed hundreds. Anyway they find and buy a large house and place up wards, I think against ill intent. Some stuff happens but I don't remember what, but Harry or maybe Draco runs into Itachi sitting in the street injured from a recent mission or training (can't remember which) and brings him back to the house where he is healed. They both help him by giving him bracelets or seals to bring those he loves to the manor when they are targeted in the massacre. The kids and Naruto (who has appeared I think due to the wards and Harry, but can't remember why/how) ask Draco who lives in the room with the blue door, but is told that its a secret?. Anyway when Yashamaru attacks Gaara, Gaara calls Harry on the mirror, and Harry goes to Gaara through the mirror and rescues him, taking him back to Konoha through the mirror. He is introduced to the rest of the occupants as the blue door boy. Can't remember what happens next.

I can't remember if the fanfic is complete or not? But someone please help me find it.
