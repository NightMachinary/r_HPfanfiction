:END:
I remember reading this fic a few years ago. It was post-war but they were still young adults. All I recall is that Draco was hanging out with Harry, Ron, & Hermione and they went swimming in a lake. Draco was nervous because he had scars on his back but they convinced him they wouldn't judge. I think Astoria might have been there, but I can't remember. This is driving me up the wall so if anyone has ideas, please share. Thanks!
