I've only got into fan fiction recently and have been reading a lot of fics that are well written and have a good premise but Harry is just such a weak character that it's hard to finish. I'd like fics where Harry wether male/female is a strong character that has confidence and is decisive. Would rather it be complete.


** I would definitely give this a try. There hasn't really been many action scenes yet, but the buildup in Harry's powers and his understanding of his place in the world is amazing to read! It is a harem fic involving Harry, Daphne, fleur and an OC. But the OC is extremely well made and just adds more drama and interest to the story overall.[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13140418/1/][International Triwizard Tournament]]

** You mean in the fanfics you've read Harry was too weak?

So you haven't come across LORD SLYTHERIN GRYFINDOR BLACK PEVERELL RAVENCLAW POTTER harem wank fests yet, have you?

*** Just got into fanfics and I've seen a few and tbh they aren't generally that good. Was more looking at it as strength of character rather than magical or political strength.

**** Oh, I understand. It's so hard to find good fanfics!

It's like digging for gems in dirt. Most of it is bad but once you find a good one, it's AWESOME and you obsess over it for weeks, or even months.

I'll make a gem list for you, if you want. Just ask. You can skip the ones that aren't your preference but I can guarantee that they are average & above quality.

Also, lowering your standards is a good idea. You'll have to get over the fact that fanfics are not written by professionals. Some are, but not most. But the benefit is you'll see so much more creativity!

***** Cheers, wouldn't mind a few suggestions for some good fics. Ya I get what you mean about lowering your standards. I found quite a few fics that are really good ideas and end up being poorly written or a little stiff in places. Although some can still be enjoyable.

****** Yes, it'll take a few days for me to make it.

There are a variety of ways to find good fics in the meantime

Making/reading old request reddit threads

Finding a good fic you already LOVE, then clicking the authors, and then looking at their own fave authors and stories (and then you'll find things with the same sort of taste as yours, and hopefully quality)

Checking your favourite author's favourite stories.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
