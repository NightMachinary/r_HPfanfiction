I don't know if I just haven't been looking hard enough or what. So so much could be done with the time period. Grindalwalds reign how ww2 and the blitz effects the wizarding world how has this not been done yet? Tell about hagrids childhood. Expand tom riddles story show the beginning of the death eaters . Moody's auror career Dumbledore aprenticing under flamel.

Go into the 50s and 60s. Voldamort learning obscure magic Dumbledores early years as headmaster the cold war the 60s and the hippie movement. The Korean and Vietnam wars but from the wizards side

Their is so much of the wizards past era's we get hints of in the books but the only one expands by fans is the marauder school days

Come on guys their is about 30 or so years of wizarding history with both potential new characters and of course one's we know of. Dumbledore Hagrid Tom riddle just waiting to be written.

My person fic I want to see the wizards world durring ww2

What Story do you want to see written from the years 1930-1970?


** The reason why I personally am not interested in writing that era is that Harry doesn't exist to be the protagonist. However, I imagine the more general reason is that it would require originality and creativity rather than just rehashing canon with your favourite pairing and bashing your hated characters.

***** Well, not doing research has never stopped other authors from writing fanfiction completely inaccurate. Read this story once where Harry got arrested and put into juvie at the age of 4, whereas in Britain you cannot be sentenced when you are under 10 he also somehow was in school at the time, receiving better grades than Dudley. This idk about, I know pre school exists, but at 4 receiving grades? I am kinda skeptical about that.

Where Japanese wizard's fanatically loyal to the emperor as the muggles where?

How did wizards effect major events of the war such as

Pearl harbor

Operation valkaryie

Hiding Jews during the haulocost

The battle of the bulge

How was grindlewald different from Voldamort?

Where there more students due to refugees of the war?

  Why are there not a lot of fics taking place in the 1930s and 40s? Heck even the 50s and 60s
#+end_quote

I've encountered a few, but I do understand what you're talking about when you say there aren't a /lot/ of them. I presume the reason is mostly because of the lack of information. That period in HP history is kind of a blank canvas, and not every writer wants to go into the trouble of filling in every single detail and making a plan that would be more complex than /any/ fic set in the 90s would need to have. A lot of us writers, including myself, are amateurs, which is why that reason seems understandable to me.

It might also be because of the simple fact that readers over on FFN are much less likely to click on fics about these eras than they are about Hermione, Harry or someone from 90s. As a writer, I can attest to the fact that there is nothing more devastating than working hard on something, uploading it, and then getting only crickets as a response. It cripples the motivation to write further. That's why a lot of writers hesitate to write in such periods, and even if they do, they rarely continue it.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if I just haven't been looking hard enough or what.
#+end_quote

You could go digging into all the sites other FFN, like AO3, Hpfanficarchive, Ficwad, Wattpad, etc. I don't know if you've looked there already, so if you haven't, I'd recommend doing so. After the *Purge* on FFN, a lot of stories migrated to other sites, and you might find some gems there.

- P.S. I remember back in January, I stumbled upon a community which had Harry time travelling back to the Marauder and Grindelwald eras and living there. If those stories interest you, you might wanna look for that community. I'll keep an eye out for it as well, and if I find it, I'll send you the link.

- P.P.S. Can I just say that I wish every 'Story Request' was more like your post? Your post makes good points, incites discussion, and if a writer stumbles upon it, its /much/ more likely to inspire them to write.

*** Haha thanks I love studying history and love harry potter and the fact it's inside but separate to an extent from the normal /muggle world so it brings up the question how did wizards effect major events in history and how did major historical events effect the wizarding world.

Also its pretty obvious grindalwald has some connection with Nazi Germany he had a fortress similar in name to Nuremburg he was defeated in 1945 he had a philosophy that wizards should rule muggle for their own good. Similar that Germany Italy and Japan should rule for the betterment of Europe and Asia

And his portrait shows blond hair and blue eyes

Other historical periods that could be interesting if done from a wizard perspective

The American revolution

The black plague

The Roman empire

The renaissance

The industrial revolution

Greek vs Persia

The Salman witch trials

The American civil war

The African slave trade

The golden age of piracy

Heck even some modern day stuff could be interesting as long as the wizarding world dosnt have muggle tech everywhere Such as

Modern north Korea

The wars of the middle east

The split of Britain from Europe

Idk their is just so much that can be done people just need to think outside the established timeline of the 90s

I don't know about a full fic, but I think I could cobble up a one shot about the historical ramifications of the Grindelwald war on the Wizarding World. Something like a lot of short war anecdotes cobbled together, maybe with a dash of Dumbledore. I think I'll have to write this someday.

**** This even doesn't account for the purely Scottish/British ones like (in chronological order):

-St Brice's day massacre (or Aethelred attempts to wipe the Scandanavians out of England. Might cause tensions if Hogwarts has both an English/Danish/Norse intake)

-Early 11th cent. Danish conquests of England (Swaine, Canute)

-Norman Conquest (does Hogwarts' intake change? Does everyone under William's rule (ie. England and Normandy) go to Hogwarts or to a French school or is there a split with the English going to Hogwarts and the Anglo-Norman nobility going elsewhere?)

-The Anarchy

-David I's conquest of the Mormaerdom of Morab, which may have been where Hogwarts was situated (we have little idea what it was really or what it's western/northern boundaries were, but if it stretched up to Caithness/Sutherland then Hogwarts could have been within it)

-The Jacobite Rebellion and it's implications (the attempted cultural extinction of Highland culture.)

-The Highland clearances (or the actual destruction of Highland Culture in Scotland when their English-based landlords decide that replacing them with sheep would be more profitable)

Or a primer on what one shots I have on my list to write... (I'm a 1/4 of the way through the Battle of Hogwarts, maybe a 1/12 of the way through the Founding of Hogwarts)

** People write and read fanfiction rather than original fiction for the connection to canon. By moving things 40 to 70 years back in time, you weaken the connection in the setting. You also have to get rid of canon characters and alter the characterization of shared characters, which reduces the connection even further.

I have a fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104928/1/The-Diary-of-Thomas-Riddle-the-Sensible][The Diary of Thomas Riddle the Sensible]], set in 1945 (it gets going a bit after V-E Day).

In 1945, for instance, you'd have Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore -- but with seven decades of difference. You'd have Tom Riddle, newly graduated. Maybe Minerva McGonagall, maybe Alastor Moody -- both students, which means they'll have little in common with their canon versions.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

I was attempting to write a fic that dived into Tom's early years, but couldn't finish it because I butchered everything. I got the war right, because that's something that I can do well as I absolutely love war, but everything else was shambles. :(
