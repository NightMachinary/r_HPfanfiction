Title: Lily's Next Great Adventure

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10787301/1/]]

Summary: When Lily Potter dies, she meets Death in the afterlife. He tells her she has a choice: move on with James, or help Harry with his prophecized destiny. She takes the second choice, however, even that choice comes with a twist. Now Lily, known now as Holly Evans, will help Harry on his path to his destiny. However, unexpected complications and a Manipulative Old Man she once thought as a mentor try to interfere with her plans.

Rating: M Warnings: Incest, Harem, Manipulative!Evil!Dumbledore, Ancient and Noble Houses, Lords and Ladies, Severe Character Bashing -- Dumbledore and some Weasleys.

Ships: Harry/Lily, Harry/Harem (Eventually: Holly, Hermione, Susan, Luna, Ginny, Daphne, Gabrielle), Sirius/Amelia, Neville/Hannah

I hope to update once a week! Hope you like the first chapter! Already getting reviewers saying the idea is very good!

** I'm not going to be all douchy and just bash it, because it is well written and I like the main theme here... I just can't deal with incest, man. Harem, bashing (though how anyone can bash Molly and still sleep at night is beyond me), all acceptable if well written, but Harry/Lily just won't fly for me.

Personal preference though, good work from an objective standpoint.

** Harry/Lily ship? That's just wrong. How does Lily justify that? Because he looks like her husband so it's okay? Actually, I don't want to know, but good luck with your fic anyway. God knows there's weirder fics out there.

** Well, I think it had an interesting opening idea. But I can't get past incest. Add to that

  Harem, Manipulative!Evil!Dumbledore, Ancient and Noble Houses, Lords and Ladies, Severe Character Bashing -- Dumbledore and some Weasleys

and I just can't do it. It has too many elements I really don't like and they all sort of pile up into an overwhelming "no." However, you've already got a bunch of reviews so people seem to really like it! Good luck!

*** good for you. Meanwhile my story already has 29 reviews, all of which are positive and many tell me it is a good, unique idea, 84 Favorites, and 119 followers in the 5 hours since it has been posted. So while you choose to not read it, there are plenty who will read it, and many more to come probably.
