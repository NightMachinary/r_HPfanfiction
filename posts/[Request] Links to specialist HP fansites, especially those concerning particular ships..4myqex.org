Hey, guys, I was just wondering if people could link me to their favourite fanfiction websites that aren't Ao3, FFnet or harrypotterfanfiction?

I'm aware of Potions and Snitches, the Harry&Snape site, but I'm especially looking for fanfic sites that look at particular pairings, and especially those that are otherwise centred on Snape.

All pairings are fine, straight or gay.


** H/G dedicated site: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/]]

It's still going strong, and I see at least one new story upload per day.

** On the sidebar for this Subreddit, there is a link titled [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][Fanfiction archives, forums and sites]]. Click that link and scroll down to *Specialized Databases* and you will see a big list of sites by pairings.

A couple extra that don't appear on that list are:

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php][Ashwinder]] - Snape/Hermione

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/][Occulumency]] - Snape-centric

** The archive for the Snarry (Harry/Snape) slash ship is [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive][www.walkingtheplank.org/archive]]. All of the classics are there, including a number of fics not available on AO3 or FF.net.

** If you like Hermione-centered fics, Granger Enchanted is a good resource for romance.

** The Tomione Convention Forum, obviously, is a website dedicated to the Tom/Hermione pairing. However, you might need to navigate it somewhat to find the section with recc'd fanfictions.
