I can't remember much past that, other than it being H/G, and he possibly trains her? Can't remember what year it's in. I think he was a member of some organization (possibly ICW?). May have had Rage in the title, might not though. Really bothering me, don't think it was complete when I read it, which was years ago.

*** Looks good, but I don't think that's the one. IIRC the war was still ongoing in this one. I'll check this one out though.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

*** It's not, but I have found the story I'm looking for. The author hasn't updated or posted anything since 2009 though, so it's well and truly dead. Thanks everyone, I appreciate the help. If anyone is interested Linkffn(3322666)

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
