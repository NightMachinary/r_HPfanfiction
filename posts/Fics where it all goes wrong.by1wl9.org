While it is pretty common to have one of the plots from the book go the other way and deal with the fallout of that, how about all of them?

(This doesn't necessarily have to be the plot of the fic, it could be the background of 'Harry from a Bad Dimension' or the setup for a time travel plot or whatever).

ie:\\
Voldemorte gets away with the stone at the end of the first year AND\\
Ginny is taken over and Ginnymorte gets away OR Harry is Memory-wiped and Lockheart takes all the credit AND\\
The escape fails and Sirius is kissed in front of the Heroes AND\\
Voldemorte is revived at the end of the Tournament and manages to get away (.....) AND\\
Most of the students die in the Ministry Raid....

You get the idea. Again, doesn't have to be the direct plot, could be the background for a character or something.


** 1981: Voldemort stunned Lily, killed Harry, and took over Wizarding Britain a few months later. Snape was ecstatic and remained loyal.

Year 1: Hermione was killed by the Troll. Without her distracting Quirrellmort, Harry was thrown off his broom and killed. Later, Voldemort got the Stone and came back much earlier.

Year 7: Death Eaters raided the Wedding, dosed every Weasley with Veritaserum, and found out their complicity with Harry. Voldemort proceeded to torture Ginny publicly. Harry surrendered. GAME OVER.

Year 7: After the Trio was captured, Death Eaters strip searched them and dosed them with Veritaserum after a little Cruciatus. Voldemort was soon called, Ron and Hermione were killed immediately (Horcrux secret must not be leaked!), and Harry was locked behind the most secure vault under the Draught of Living Death.

Year 7: After Harry surrendered himself, Voldemort strip searched and thoroughly interrogated him. Upon identifying Harry as a Horcrux, Voldemort locked him behind the most secure vault under the Draught of Living Death. Voldemort then marches onto Hogwarts, crushed the last bit of resistance, and killed Ron/Hermione on the spot.

*** I tried to avoid "Harry gets killed", because that would be a massive enough change that you couldn't really have multiple canon events happening and all going wrong. Not that it isn't fun, but you are basically at a divergence fic at that point.

Depending on the POV character, you could reasonably have it happen in the 5th year plus and still have things pan out mostly the same, but in years 1-4 a Harry death would pretty much preempt later events.

** There was a one shot where Voldemort found out about Harry's Horcrux, and captures him. Everything goes to Hell after that, and when Harry manages to escape, a huge amount of time has already passed.
