I ask because it seems like in most fanfics, the innermost details of the how's and why's of the spell are known to just about everyone and their pet dog; and I'm left wondering whether it's accurate, or just a fanon thing.


** Arthur and Bill Weasley got two Fidelius Charms running within a few minutes in DH.

James Potter has to be the one who casted the Fidelius Charm by himself, because if it was done by Dumbledore, he would know who the Secret Keeper was. But unlike the Weasleys, the Potters couldn't become their own secret keeper.

Now the question became why Voldemort didn't use Fidelius Charms to hide his Horcruxes, with him as the Secret Keeper. But of course, if that had happened, the canon Horcrux Hunt would have never worked.

Fidelius Charm is IMHO another example of the Series's plot railroading and inconsistent world building.

*** To hide his horcruxes with the Fidelius, he would've had to entrust their secrets to someone else. It's a spell characterized by trust, requiring two separate parties (the secret 'giver' and the keeper), which is why he never used it, in my opinion.

I still think explanations from [[/u/MTheLoud][u/MTheLoud]] and [[/u/Autumnsouls][u/Autumnsouls]] are the best:

1. Voldemort had to be the Secret Keeper, but his incomplete soul couldn't hide the secret.
2. Fidelius Charm only worked on the locations that were owned, and that would cut down on numbers of places he could hide.

***** He told neither of them the nature of the items they were given. Being that he had several backups, I suppose he thought the diary was an acceptable risk. Bellatrix is as safe a bet as he'll get, too, if he wants a horcrux inside a high-security vault.

ETA: There's a large gap between giving your follower a thing and telling them 'protect this, it's precious to me', and giving them intimate knowledge of the nature of your immortality, with all the information to find and undo the horcruxes.

1.) I may be wrong, but I don't believe that's how the Fidelius operates. One can't keep their own secret---it defeats the entire point of the 'fidelity' spell. There must be a bond of trust involved, the way I see it.

2.) I'll put my earlier comment here:

#+begin_quote
  In the case of his utilizing the spell, I think the secret hidden wouldn't be 'there's a coastal cave over there' (which may not be a secret, thus the spell fails), but 'my locket horcrux is hidden inside this cave'. The cave may be found, but one would never find the object of the spell.

'Location ownership' is a nonfactor, I think. But it's all academic, seeing as Voldemort would/could never utilize the spell.

Presumably you have to be the owner of the Secret to cast the Fidelius Charm on it. Riddle wasn't the owner of any of the locations he placed his Horcruxes in. And possibly the Fidelius Charm before the time of the books hadn't been able to allow the owner of the Secret to be his or her own Secret Keeper.

** The magic system in HP canon gives me a headache because on the one hand it is just so powerful but on the other is severely under-utilized by the average wizard.

For it to make sense I relate it to how easy it is to learn things like computer programming now-a-days and how it's not that much more expensive to build your own personalized computer from parts bought separately. Same goes for making your own clothing or building a solar panel. But realistically, how many people are taking advantage of those possibilities? Similarly, just because the opportunity to learn all this powerful magic is there, most people just don't want to put in the time/effort. So you end up with overachievers like Riddle and Dumbledore who get bored with regular school work and go looking for something more 'interesting'.

There is also room for natural ability - there are born legilimens (spelling?) and people who are better suited to learning occlumency (my head canon is that you need to tick some of the psychopathy boxes).

Harry mastering the Patronus Charm was supposed to be a rare feat for a teenage wizard, as very few adult wizards were supposedly capable of a true corporeal Patronus, but he has no problem having a bunch of teens in the DA figure it out too?

Time-Turners have the ability to drive the user insane if used incorrectly but McGonagall and Dumbledore decided it was okay for Hermione to use it to attend a couple of extra classes?

There's a lot of interesting ideas in the magic system but it's clear Rowling was more plot focused than world building focused in her fantasy series. Most of the interesting magic was used as plot devices and deployed as needed.

** That's always been one of my pet peeves about HP fanfic. Since the Fidelius, the mind arts, etc. are all incredibly cool, very powerful, and plot-relevant, fanfic authors insert them every damn place and have everyone and their brother aware of the details. Every pureblood and their squib cousin seems to know what occlumency is, since no pureblood scion would /dare/ be sent off to Hogwarts without knowing how to protect their mind.

But things like that are supposed to be really obscure magic. Dumbledore and Snape are powerful and rare wizards for having mastered stuff like that.

If a fic has someone casually firing off a patronus messenger spell in the first paragraph just to order a pizza, that's an immediate drop for me.

If there're people who can read the mind of yours or your children, the first thing a reasonable man/woman with power will do is trying everything to protect from such invasion.

Also after the First War Snape lived in Hogwarts constantly (may be except summers) -- where did he found resources and time to find and learn such "really obscure magic"?

​

The same with Horcruxes: Riddle found enough information about them to recreate the ritual in the /school library/! It's reasonable to suppose that every old dark family has similar books in their possession.

**** This isnt quite right. Hardly any wizard can read minds, because it's difficult, taboo, weird and therefore obscure. Occlumency for the same reasons. Even knowing about it doesn't mean one can do it, as it also requires an uncommon level of maturity, emotional control and discipline (this is why Harry was no good at it). Children couldn't come to school knowing it, and anyone writing that is being incredibly silly. That's all not even mentioning the fact that learning Occlumency, besides the daily discipline it requires, also seems to required having ones mind attacked and violated repeatedly.
