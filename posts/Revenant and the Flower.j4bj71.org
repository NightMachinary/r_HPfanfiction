I'll freely admit that this was inspired by Widowmaker's backstory from Overwatch, as well as the Winter Soldier.

The War ended, and Harry is tired... so very, very tired.

Instead of jumping headfirst into being an auror or even a hit-wizard, he happily sets into a quiet, semi-isolated life, with his friends, surviving DA members, and the Weasleys occasionally stopping by to visit or to drag him to family events, as he helps to raise his godson Teddy with Andromeda.

Conversely, Fleur Delacour, outraged and infuriated by the atrocities committed she saw in the War, takes the route of joining an ICW task-force dedicated to rooting out and destroying dark wizard groups and wannabe Death-Eater successors across Europe.

Never again.

By some coincidence, she and Harry become frequently more in contact, being courting, fall in love, and eventually marry. Harry settles into domestic life as his wife crusades off -- though it causes many arguments and grey hairs for Harry, he knows that trying to persuade her to give up would be a fool's errand.

However, Fleur's success against one of the strongest, darkest groups spurs them into action, but their many attempts at killing the talented witch fail.

A new, creative solution was devised.

The assault on their home was a costly one -- Harry had not slouched in his years of being a "househusband", but eventually he was overcome due to sheer numbers.

Fleur arrived home to a burning house and a missing husband.

Grief-stricken, vows to find him and make those who took him pay.

Months later, the Group has become more active: a new, hooded assassin of theirs is utterly ruthless, having killed dozens of ICW task-force members -- friends and co-workers are being systematically hunted down one-by-one.

Codename: Revenant.

Fleur finds herself his new target, and barely escapes being killed multiple times by the skin of her teeth.

One encounter finally reveals the horrifying truth.

Her husband -- tortured, brainwashed, and instilled a loyalty to the Group, is trying to kill her... and has killed their friends.

It's now a game of cat and mouse as she tries to fend off her husband while seeking a way to restore the man she loves... and to bring down the bastards who did this to him/them.

Meanwhile, Revenant begins having flashes of memory and feelings that begin to cause him to hesitate and stay his hand... little signs that give Fleur hope that her love is still in there, somewhere.

His internal conflict versus his programming grows...

....Yeah, this was a bit long-winded. Sorry.


** Wow. It was a short brilliant read. Do you plan to make this a real story, cause I will love to read it.

*** Unfortunately not. :( Work, my own ill-health, and the ill-health of family members mean I have barely any time to read fanfiction myself, these days. :(
