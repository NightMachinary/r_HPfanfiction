I read this probably 5-7 years ago so I have no idea what site it was on.

I can remember that Lucius has men from all over kidnapped. They have gladiator style fights the last one standing becomes Draco's bodyguard. I think Draco was a bit femme. Maybe.

I remember that at the end Draco returns with Harry to his hometown and there are fireworks (?) or a big party of some kind.
