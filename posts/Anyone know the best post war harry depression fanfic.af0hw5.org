** I don't think I'd call Harry clinically depressed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] linkffn(12787674), but it does focus on him recovering from the war with the help of his friends. It also has a sequel.

**** It has a happy ending, if that's what you mean, and I enjoyed it.
