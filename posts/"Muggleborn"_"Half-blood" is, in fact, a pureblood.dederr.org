The quotation marks are around "muggleborn" and "half-blood" in place of any character name.

Maybe Lily was technically a pureblood as she was descended from two lines of squibs even if she didn't know about it which means Harry ends up being secretly a pureblood which is a fact that even Dumbledore didn't know about.

Maybe Sirius blood adopts Harry and this somehow shifts the balance of his blood technically making him a pureblood even if his mother was a muggleborn.

He discovers this and likes to throw it back in Malfoy's face or uses it to taunt Voldemort and his followers because while Harry is a pureblood Voldemort is only a half-blood bastard.

Maybe Hermione is the magical child from two lines of squibs and when she discovers this she likes to taunt Malfoy when he goes to call her a 'mudblood'.

Basically anyone that people "KNOW" are muggleborns/half-bloods being revealed as secretly pureblooded to the annoyance of some of the more bigoted characters.


** The Issue I have always had with this kind of thing applied to Lily or Hermione, is that it makes the bigots RIGHT.

Hermione, a muggleborn, being one of the smartest of the generation proves the bigots wrong. Hermione as a pureblood allows them to go "See, I told you that a Mudblood couldn't be that smart."

It perverts one of the positive messages in canon about how discrimination is wrong.

On a separate note, making pure bloods stupid makes for bad writing.

Welp. There goes my prompt... Where due to a old agreement between some of the pureblood families' witches, the more high functioning "purebloods" are actually halfbloods. (so Draco? halfblood, crabbe and goyle? pureblood.)

(Basically me trying to flip the muggleborn turns out to be pureblood thing on its head, with some Purebloods being actually half muggle.)

I have no idea how the Blacks could fit into this, Sirius's mother doesn't seem the type to go along with something like that, but he seems to have turned out fine. (Oh great, I'm debunking my own ideas...)

***** I mean you could argue the truly narratively important characters in canon are all half-bloods. Harry, Snape, Voldemort, and Dumbledore.

You seem to be phrasing that prompt as a humorous one, so I don't see the issue.

It's when it's a serious fic that it really becomes a problem. When canon Draco appears to by all accounts be a great student in canon starts getting D's and T's in fanon... Well you know the story is going to be unsatisfying.

TBF, the extended information from JKR does the same (the whole 'every muggleborn is descended from squibs' aspect of things). Not a big fan of that one myself, as it undermines that positive message you mention

***** Hardly, squibs and muggles are practically the exact same thing, plus a muggleborn is still a mudblood since most of their ancestry is still purely non magical. What it does is destroy the supremacist movement since it leaves them with no arguments against muggleborns and half bloods.

What does mess everything up is telling everyone of Voldemort's heritage, as that gives them the excuse to go on the full offensive against muggleborns. Remember Riddle is technically (by JKR new standards) a muggleborn as the son of a muggle and a squib, and so he /clearly/ stole magic from proper purebloods and enslaved them to kill other purebloods.. It's a mess, and something that the 97-98 ministry would most certainly use.

****** Just to be clear Merope wasn't a squib, her father just called her one, because she attempted to clean with her hands instead of using magic.

Thats just a meaner version of Ron reminding Hermione to use magic in Philospher's stone by asking if shes a witch or not, when she didn't know how to light a fire without wood.

******* She was never seen using magic, and was called a filthy squib by her family... Why must I believe she wasn't one? JKR can come out now and say she wasn't, but everything in the actual books contradicts her.

Your comparison also doesn't make sense since Hermione was a first year muggleborn and in a dangerous situation, magic simply wasn't something that she was used to, so it's normal for her mind not to jump to it straight away. If Merope was a witch, she wouldn't need any reminder, as she was older and grew up in that world. Like with Ron, for a magical raised magic is always the first thing that comes to mind.

  "Well, Mr. Gaunt," said Ogden, "to get straight to the point, we have

  reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a

  Muggle late last night."

  There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.

  "Pick it up!" Gaunt bellowed at her. "That's it, grub on the floor like some

  filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?"

  "Mr. Gaunt, please!" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had

  already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot

  again, *drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and*

  *muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor*

  *away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.*

  Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, "Mend it, you

  pointless lump, mend it!"
#+end_quote

Not to mention that we explicitly know that she used magic to rape Tom Riddle Sr.

The reason why she didn't use magic on her own initiative, seems to be quite obvious in that she just sucks at it.

*** The way to avoid that is to go the "there are no muggleborns, only squib-borns" route - this makes bigotry against muggleborns even stupider, as they don't even actually have a substantively different blood status than purebloods.

It's like a white person racially abusing another white person for being the wrong race - it's not just evil, it's also retarded.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
