This fic made me realize I was missing something from HP fanfiction: the mystery of the original series. That feeling of wanting to know more. My inability to put aside the story until I finally reached the resolution. That was what drew me in as much as the allure of magic, reading through Harry Potter. Yet I dived into fanfiction more for character wish fulfillment initially, not for hearing genuinely enthralling original stories. Not that it's the first delightful fanfic I've come across, but I didn't expect those exact felings of suspense to return the way I felt them reading through canon, so many years later...

So if you want to rediscover that feeling within the HP universe, I could not recommend this story more.

While I have you, for those of you who read this fic and were pulled into it like me, are there any other high quality stories that strive for the same tone of mystery unravelling like this one? I sure hope so. This fic has awoken a new hunger in me. Oh, by the way, this is absolutely my new headcanon for who SallyAnne Perkins was, even if the mystery solving of it obviously didn't happen in canon.

I should warn you that there are some light Ron-bashing and H/Hr elements; Ron is excluded from the main adventure, sort of inexplicably losing his sense of curiosity. But ultimately he remains their friend and H/Hr is not explicit, so I hope Ron-lovers (I'm fond of the character myself) can enjoy this fic for the excellent mystery core.

For future reference, the linkbot didn't work because you added a space before the opening parenthesis. It will work if you do it like this: linkffn()

They also are basically canon compliant which is a plus. If you don't want something that happens at the same time then I highly recommend her Thea higglesworth series which are all very enthralling murder mysteries set in the world of Harry Potter.
