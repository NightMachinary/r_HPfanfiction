** No offense, but how many fanfics have you read, because based on the summary and first paragraph, which I'll freely admit is all I bothered to read, it seemed, /extremely/ mediocre. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally down for ace representation (especially when it doesn't use "ace" as a shorthand for "aro/ace, but that's its own can of worms), but it's not enough to grab my attention on its own.
