** Uh oh it might be impossible to pick just one.

Funny & Accessible to non-SSHG-shippers: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2533891/1/Big-Name-Death-Eater][Big Name Death Eater]]

Personal favorite from the original 2003 WIKTT Time-Loop Challenge: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13576386/1/Getting-the-Hang-of-Thursdays][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]]

Some fluffy post-war romance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788107/1/Another-Dream][Another Dream]]

Old Classics only available on the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110064158/http://www.witchfics.org/][Wayback Machine's archive of witchfics.org]]:

- Riley's "Pawn to Queen" which is one of the earliest make-her-my-sex-slave-to-save-her fics (and its parody fic: "PtQ In A Nutshell")
- Anna's "Roman Holiday" trilogy (a great combination of action and sex, adventuring around the world and within hogwarts, also a good pick if you want to recommend some SSHG to a Dramione fan)
- Abby's & Domina's "The Fire and the Rose" which is the OG potions-accident body-swapping fic
- Really just comb the whole archive. It's pretty much all pre-2006 GOLD

Canon-Compliant following HBP and DH: The Phoenix Series by [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=75698][grangerous]]

Then when you're ready to trawl for more, strong recommend for [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2560][southern_witch_69 at Ashwinder]], who has a bunch of good fics and REALLY great favorites lists.

*** Quit another dream when tea with cream and lemon was mentioned. You do not drink tea with cream. Tea is drunk with milk and (optionally) sugar. You do not drink black tea with lemon either. It just isn't done.

It's painfully American.

Gee that's snobby af. I hope you left a polite, constructive review recommending a Brit picker.

Also, honey and lemon in my PG Tips is great. Fight me.

***** When someone makes such egregious mistakes, I assume they're not interested in learning. There are lots of good brit picking guides out there.

In Britain, typically we drink tea with milk. I have never heard of someone drinking English Breakfast (the standard unless you request otherwise) with honey and lemon.

I'm interested in reading good stories. I'm not interested in reading shite.

****** Using reddit's downvote for a difference of opinion instead of unconstructive discussion is an egregious mistake.

An american who writes about creamer in hot drinks just needs a britpick.

This conversation reminded me of [[https://youtu.be/eob7V_WtAVg][epic tea time]] so thanks for that ;)

******* When Brits say cream tea, we don't mean putting cream in tea. We mean a scone with jam and clotted cream eaten as a light meal with a pot of tea. It's an afternoon, relatively formal thing.

As I've grown older, I've become more discerning in what I will and won't read. If something hasn't been Britpicked, I will leave the story. Americanisms take me out of the story and make it unreadable.

The idea of asking if someone has a coffee maker doesn't work either. Most people don't have one. Kettles are ubiquitous. Coffee makers are more unusual.

******** lol you don't have to tell me. I know.

You're sticking around this conversation a lot longer than I'd expect for someone who bails on a story for a want of a britpick.

Next time please consider leaving that polite, constructive review.
