I'm having trouble looking for fics with this type of Harry currently I only found two the first one I don't remember (though I'm pretty sure its Saviour of Magic) is the one where Harry was hiking a mountain and then he saved an ancient dragon, then he met the Counsel of Ancients, and he follows them. I don't remember the exact wording but one of the ancients said "If he was given an order from his people and ours, he will follow ours over his people" which led me on a search for more fanfics with this.

The second one is Harry the Hexblade were he was drowning and an entity who calls themselves Leviathan gave Harry a second life and he serves the Leviathan ever since.

I just want fanfics with Harry is in servitude with magic or entities that keep the balance of magic.


** !linkffn(Knowledge Comes at a Price) is a Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls crossover in which Harry survived the killing curse because Lily made a pact with Hermaeus Mora. Harry continues this pact, giving him the knowledge he needs to survive fighting Voldemort in exchange for his service to the Daedric Prince of Knowlegde

  Lily Potter never actually saved her son's life. No, Hermaeus Mora did it for her, at a price. The witch ended up in Apocrypha and Harry became a new dimensional anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge now standing on his shoulder. Poor, poor Wizardry World.

** The denarian series (dresden files x-over) has Harry bind himself to a fallen angel. Which is of course, a very very bad thing. But Harry doesnt care at all.

linkffn(3473224) is the first one.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  What if left to die at the depths of the ocean Harry was given a 2nd chance by a creature of eldritch power below the seas, so years later now armed with newfound powers and driven by a want to experience things for all they're worth. He finds himself unknowingly caught in a war between the light and the dark. For how will this all end well you'll have to read and find out.
