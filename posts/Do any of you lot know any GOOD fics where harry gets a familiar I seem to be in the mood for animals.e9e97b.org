edit: another good one was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]], although the familiar aspect isn't as prominent.

** Linkffn(Children Of The Sun)

every witch and wizard has a familiar of different colours that muggles cant see. Wizarding society cast those with gold and silver familiars as better then those with tin or bronze. Harry has a Golden Python

I enjoy this one a lot, but it's SI and not actual familiar stuff.

but, it contains MC that has a knack for befriending/taking care of animals. Visits Fluffy often.

** All I've seen are phoenix, snake, basilisk, basilisks, owl, and a nest of dragon hatchlings.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3230439/1/Thank-You-Ms-Bones]] - Phoenix
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]] - Dragons
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9474009/1/Paid-In-Blood]] - Basilisk
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1/Ah-Screw-It]] - Owl/Phoenix?/Basilisk

I can't remember the one with the multiple basilisks. I think it was a one-shot where Harry breeds them to take care of voldie. He even bullies the government to give him blanket immunity for it.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** In linkao3(13521369) he gets a Phoenix named Nova as a familiar. In linkffn(13140418) he has a (size changing) dragon named Cuddles as a familiar. I like both stories a lot but they are not for everyone.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.
