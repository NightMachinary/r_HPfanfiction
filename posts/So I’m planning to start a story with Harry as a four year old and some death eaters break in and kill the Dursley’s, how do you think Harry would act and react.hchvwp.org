My main question is how a four year old Harry would act in general, like do you think he would be super quiet and submissive or cheerful and bouncy? Also I would appreciate it if you could maybe give me some advice for how to start the story in the first place. Should I jump right into the action or should I start lazy so I can explain the situation a bit?

** If you want to do yourself a favour, don't write a four year old. It's either unrealistic, or a pain to read. Have you been around children that age?

***** Hell duddly might not be bad to harry yet as well

he might actually get on with 4 year old duddly.

but even if they where horrifcally abusive, you forget most things from that age, unless its truely horrific

so young harry might actually think the dursleys where nicer then they where before they where murdered

There is no canon evidence to support this. It's only stated he has protections. Based on LOVE and FAMILY. Which he receives none of at the Dursleys.

I'm of the opinion that the only reason the Dursleys worked is because nobody bothered. Hell, Death Eaters only showed up in Book7 when they knew he was being moved, and that was in the air.

So, either the "protections" worked or they never bothered.

** I rather have to wonder how they'd react to an infant locked in a cupboard, though I'm not sure it would affect them that much, since they plan on /killing/ him apparently.

Though it could be a major political coup if Lucius took Harry from the Dursleys to the the Wizengamot to show Dumbledore is fallible.

--------------

"Do you know what Albus Dumbledore's decisions lead to? It lead to me /rescuing/ The-Boy-Who-Lived from muggles who clearly beat and starved him. I found him locked in a /cupboard/." Lucius spat.

--------------

Whether or not Lucius actually cares about Harry, or just cares about the political leverage to be gained against Dumbledore, who can say?

** He would almost certainly be terrified. Whether they've trained him not to cry depends on how abusive you're going to write the Dursleys.

I'd say show an afternoon before the break in happens, that way you can show how they act towards him on a normal day.

You could also use this afternoon to show how the wards failed to let the Death Eaters get in. Maybe by having little Harry tell them that he's going to run away, they tell him "this is your home", he says no it's not and petunia agrees.

It's fanfic so you can fudge how the wards work a little (especially since JK never really clarifies) but for DE's to find the house the wards gotta come down first.

** I don't think Harry is either overly submissive or cheerful. Canon Harry seems resigned to the fact that his family members are abusive assholes, but is still pretty deviant for a kid in his position. He doesn't go out of his way to disobey them, but isn't afraid to snark them or even hang from Vernons neck trying to get his letter. He mentions he isnt allowed to ask questions, but goes ahead an does it anyway. Four year old Harry would be less aware of how abusive his family is and still hopeful that they hold some love for him. This would be a traumatic experience, seeing someone get killed is traumatic no matter how close you are.

You could have Harry locked up in his cupboard as punishment for accidental magic and miss the whole thing. There are no signs that he lives in the house according to the books, so they would see that there are no pictures of the BWL and that he doesn't have a room and just assume that they got wrong intel andleave.

** Probably stay quiet the whole time. He was most definitely stuffed in the Cupboard. They murder the Dursleys, set the Dark Mark, and leave. Dumbledore shows up days later because he was ignoring the reports from Fig, and it took her sending a letter to McGonagall to get the news to him.

** What immediately got into my mind is a scene from American Horror Story.

If you want to watch it, but it's moderately gory:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpJ-QRdBerI]]

Basically a young witch who's trapped in hell being rescued by this guy, who cuts open her torturer with a blade to get to her. After seeing the brutal act, she just looks at him with wet eyes saying, "Are you here to save me?" Maybe something like this. I know it's nothing as serious, but it might seem from a four year old's perspective.
