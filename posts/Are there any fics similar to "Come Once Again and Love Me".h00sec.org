I finished the fic by *laventadorn* earlier today and it's absolutely STUNNING. Are there any other fics out there which have Severus travel back from 1998 and Lily from 1981?

If not, are there any other REALISTIC Snily fics which don't delve into the romance so EARLY? (Becoming more than friends right after the "Mudblood incident" is */not/* realistic. Neither is having Severus pine after her immediately after he gets a grasp on his surroundings.)


** Now I really want a fic where Snape goes back to fix everything and becomes even more depressed because he's forty-ish and this Lily is a child... He loved the Lily he grew up with, the one who fought Death Eaters and who was as (if not more) mature than he was. Now she acts like a child and grumpy old man Snape can't stand it.

It could also be a good crackfic.

** I don't, but I will say that she's my favourite fanfic writer. You can tell that she has a literary background with her rich language, use of imagery and well thought out prose. What I wouldn't give for that standard to be more common in fanfic.

If you are interested, she has The Never Ending Road linkao3(536450) which is supposed to be Snarriet but there's still no pairing after 700k words (it's basically wonderful genfic). I initially balked at the Snarriet tag but its there for future pairing apparently. I can't emphasise how well written it is in terms of technical literary ability.

Also she updated this series recently after many months of hiatus and it made my day.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)

*** I started it, but seeing them both swear like sailors and sneak away to smoke stolen cigarettes just didn't sit right with me. Also, Severus was staying remarkably level-headed for the situation he was just dropped into.

I'd probably continue it, but I don't have a profanity filter on my phone, and I really don't like swearing. I think I'll stick with The Peace Not Promised.

** Does it count if the point where Severus traveled back to was six months after their estrangement, and he has to prove himself reformed before she gives their friendship another chance (but she does want her friend back)? I came across linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) recently and really liked the characterisation of Severus and Lily.

Edit: Ok, I've finished reading Come Once Again and Love Me. There are definitely a lot of parallels in the two stories, with Severus traveling back from his own death and reuniting with Lily. However, The Peace Not Promised just sends Severus back, not Lily, and he knows he's being given a second chance, so he's a bit more purposeful about it. He also has much more of a "hopelessly devoted to you" vibe; he doesn't keep her at arm's length once she accepts that he's reformed, he can't stand to stay away from her. Plus, it's around four times as long, with the majority of the story taking place after their wedding.

Come Once Again does a great job of showing how those decades of angst and spying produced a harsh and bitter man who was nonetheless devoted to Lily's memory. Peace Not Promised does a great job of showing how those decades of doing everything for Lily's sake produced a man who prioritised her safety and well-being above all else, while still being generally harsh and bitter.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
