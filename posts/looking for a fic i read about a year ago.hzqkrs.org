:END:
so im just gonna write everything i can remember about it here

it did have dumbledore bashing i think

-there was a battle with dumbledore where harry ak'd him in the great hall (i think) -they had to obliviate the students afterwards -harry was a dada teacher (i think) -harry created a curse that made everyone in the area see their worst fears in a hell-like state harry trained students to be resiliant to the curse so that when he used it in the battle against voldemort, they wouldn't be affected as badly -i think harry was glamored to look different than himself when going to ottery st catchpole with luna -harry and luna met with luna's dad in a building disguised as something else ( i can't remember this one clearly it might not be true) anyway i looked at ao3 and ffn and couldn't find it so wondering if it was deleted or something
