Harry ends up marrying/engaged/dating an older woman and Mrs Weasley (or even Lily) is furious. Thus the woman intentionally tries to wind her up every chance they get:

/"Oh Arthur, Harry said I'm the mother he never had." The Weasley matriarch sniffled into her husbands shoulder,/

/"Aww, that's sweet. Harry calls me mum too!" She giggled./

*Mrs Weasley had to be restrained.*

Any fics where something like this occurs?


** Someone PLEASE and i mean PLEASE write a Harry/Tonks where no one knows who Tonks is (make it an AU i guess) and she shows up looking like 10 years older to fuck with the weasleys and Harry, Fred and George are all having a field day with the families reactions

Edit: Currently writing this as a one shot

**** Chibi beam... And I don't think it's possible....the metamorphmagus ability has mass and density relation...I think she tells that in the book...

Maybe we should try 27y Harry(after war and returning from self imposed exile/world trip...believe me Molly would fret over him..it's her trigger) in relationship with 34y tonks Appear as 45y and then 18y..less upto 16 if ur into Loli..

Or

Two metamorphmagus who are older-younger pair (cousins you pervs) coming one day each with age variations...

#+end_quote

That would really surprise me, because generally Rowling tries to avoid this kind of hard magic, it doesn't fit into the magic system (other shape-shifters like Animagi and Boggartts don't have a mass restriction - and neithre does Polyjuice), and Metamorphagi are really not mentioned often. But just for you I'll take a look.

Edit:

  ‚ÄúI'm a Metamorphmagus,‚Äù she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. ‚ÄúIt means I can change my appearance at will,‚Äù she added, spotting Harry's puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. ‚ÄúI was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.‚Äù
#+end_quote

Nope

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúWell, you'll have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,‚Äù said Tonks. ‚ÄúMetamorphmagi are really rare, they're born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. ... But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,‚Äù
#+end_quote

Nah

#+begin_quote
  Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape's, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.
#+end_quote

Nope

(I'll spare you every other quote, I couldn't find a canonical source for it in any of the books, but I used the search and didn't re-read them, so I might have missed sth.)

*** Yeah, it does tend to be either smut or angst but I think (especially if it's to one of the Black sisters) Mrs Weasley would be the target of some light bullying with her "Think of the children!" attitude. I just think there is some laughs that can be dredged up from conflict between Mrs Weasley and "this harlot who's after my precious boy"

** Honestly good luck OP. Seriously I really do wish you good luck because I would be interested as well.

The older women I have seen Harry paired with have been:

- Harry/Narcissa or Andromeda or Belatrix (aka one or more Black Sister/s and the most common older woman pairing)
- Harry/Lily or Petunia (really hard to do without it being creepy or awkward for the reader)
- Harry/Molly (not a fan myself at all and one of the oddest pairings but also doesnt qualify for the OP request for obvious reasons)
- Harry/Alice Longbottom (very rare and mostly smut)
- Harry/Mrs. Granger (very rare and mostly smut... often with Hermione involved)

Note: I do not consider Tonks an "Older Woman" in the context of the OP's request or my personal feeling. She is too close in age to him, and often acts younger while Harry acts older.

However I have not run across any fics with those pairings that do what you ask, apart from some Black sister fics where Molly (and everyone else) Is pissed at Harry and the woman for their choices (usually A Weasly bash fic of some sort too).

I have tried for ages to find a quality (plot first) fic based around Harry paired with Aurora Sinistra, Septima Vector, or Charity Burbage (aka Harry/Teacher), but without basically any luck. And what I wouldnt give for more quality Harry/OC in general (so older woman included).

But yea I doubt there will be many that fit the request.
