I'm looking for any really good, preferably long, fics where Harry being the Master of Death is an important component of the fic. Mainly looking for slash and crossovers, but honestly any really good recs just within the fandom are welcome too!

Thanks in advance!


** I saw someone linked this already but that was a translation so lemme put the original here. I never even watched Sherlock but really enjoyed this.

** Boy, do I have the perfect fic for you (so perfect you probably already read it).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12778977/chapters/29159019][Harry Potter and the Winchester Brothers]] is a crossover (obviously) with Supernatural. Slow burn Dean/Harry but with a great sex scene to look forward to.

Ongoing, the last update was last year.

  Dumbledore said Harry had a choice. He could go back, go back to battle, end the war. He could go on, be with his loved ones in the afterlife. Somehow, he settled for in between and landed somewhere in America in the year 2010 with two guns pointed at him. Plucked from one war in one universe, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of another. (Betas acquired!)

Really anxious for an update, but the author sometimes drops three chapters on the same day, so I'm optimistic.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
