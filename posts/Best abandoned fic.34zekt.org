What's the best abandoned fic? Could be slash, het, smut...etc. anything. Just really well written or great plot. My favorite is growing up black.

** Man. This is really hard, because they're not... done? Alright, slight modification to your question: I'll give you the story that I wish had been completed the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5723954/1/Order-of-the-Phoenix-by-TIJK][Order of the Phoenix by TIJK]]: Harry gets expelled at the trial before fifth year, ends up moving in with and learning magic from Sirius. Good concept, but it ends before anything happens with the plot. It's basically 40k words of exposition for a story that never happens.

** I spent over 30 minutes going through my bookmarks and pulling my hair out, but I couldn't decide on the best one.

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.

This fic has the funniest Voldemort I've ever seen. The poor thing, so scared of muggles.

  In one world, the war against Lord Voldemort is raging. In another, a Hogwarts professor named Tom Riddle decides to put his theory on alternate worlds to test and embarks on a trip that quickly turns into a disaster. AU sixth year. DH compliant.

This is one of the few proper "good Tom Riddle" fic that isn't a "Voldemort is secretly a misunderstood good guy" fic. Not sure if it's really abandoned. Riddle vs Voldemort is the best thing that happened to the war.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.

Not sure if this one is really abandoned too. History makes me drool.

*** "How I..." was something else. Entertaining, although V's neurosis was starting to get irritating. Thanks for the rec.

** I'm not sure if it's been officially abandoned, but I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] by The Crimson Lord.

** I would have to say [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128372][Free Life]] is by far one of the ones that annoyed me the most, probably because i finished reading it like yesterday. It is the sequel to [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11709][Taking control]] and does not look like being finished ever, it was last updated in 2011, and while the author said he was going to continue it as recently as last year, i doubt anything will happen
