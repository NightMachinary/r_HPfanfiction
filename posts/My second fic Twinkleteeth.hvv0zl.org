Prompted by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/h8podl/lily_was_an_animagus_too_when_voldemort_attacked/fuu49cg/][a comment]] by [[/u/Razeus1]] here a few weeks ago, I present my second completed fanfic "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13650398/1/Twinkleteeth][Twinkleteeth]]", in which Harry (with a little help) comes up with a novel way of destroying horcruxes and gains a friend.


** That... veered significantly from my expectations somewhere in chapter two.

Lovely, though. Thanks for sharing it.

** Hello there. I will just drop a comment to help you. You know, always aim for 60k+ words because people use that filter the most however 100k+ won't hurt. Try limiting the chapter to 30. Aim for 50 to 60 chapters or more if you have some 300k+ words. Also show struggle for main character. But don't over do. For example dumbledore is good but only makes a few overly wrong decision. And harry is not super powerful taking Wizarding Britain on its own. Also dumbledore ain't fool that he can be tricked. And the enemies can retaliate. Not everything is good. Also the plot is set in 1991. Write accordingly. All the best for your journey!!!
