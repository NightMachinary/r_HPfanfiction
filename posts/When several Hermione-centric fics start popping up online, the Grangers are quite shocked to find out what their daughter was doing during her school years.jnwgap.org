However they are most disturbed when they discover the more adult-oriented fics that go into way too much detail about her adventures with house elves, giants, dark lords and even teachers. Thinking that they are real accounts of Hermione's life in school, they are really disappointed that she lied to them about focusing on studies only. Furthermore when she and a very much in love Ron visit for dinner, they feel sympathy for the 'poor idiot' who probably has no clue what his fiance was doing behind his back. Also they are even more outraged that Hermione was so embarrassed of them that she only introduced them as Dan and Emma.
