I'm deciding to give that crossover a try, and I began to just go and sort by favorites, and realised it's probably better to try here.

So, I like essentially all fanfics (though slash only if a very good story.) so yeah.

Thanks for the suggestions!

I'd suggest starting with one of these or doing a search.

*** Thanks. I don't think I had ever noticed the search bar before... Also, quite sadly it seems that 2 of those links are purple... which means I read them and have no memory of it.

Thanks for the help though!

** Well to answer the completely rhetorical question in your title, besides reading them you may reasonably also want to use them for reference in your own writing of such a story... And it's also possible for you to print them and use them as a collage, although the motivation for such a thing seems minimal...

Has anyone recommended [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024304/1/In-Places-Deep-Where-Dark-Things-Sleep][In Places Deep]]? Is slash, but I'm voting it as really good slash, because I love Aisling so so much....

*** I'm happy that I had an answer to the rhetorical question :) It's always a nice feeling. </no sarcasm> Though referencing them would still require reading them. It could make decorations, I admit. I'll check it out. Thanks for the rec.

**** That's true. I think DeviantArt would give you better decoration material than ffn, but that's just my personal style of decor. After all, people sell a whole bunch of news-print patterned stuff, it could concievably make good decoration.

I hope you like it :D

** the sad truth is there aren't any really good ones. a couple decent (you'll find them in the linked threads above), but none much worth reading in my opinion
