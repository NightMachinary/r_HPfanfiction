Story's where the MC actually exploites the RoR whether it be a Time Traveling Harry or a Self insert that has read all the books the best 2 examples (that i can find are) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614626/4/Half-Blood-Emperor][Half-Blood Emperor]] though in this one it would be nice if he recalled that the RoR could open an exit anywhere inside and even outside the castle(no idea if its just hogsmede or can lead all the way to the ocean was never stated in canon) instead of having to sneak back to his dormitory every night [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]


** Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw is an ongoing fic on Sufficient Velocity which has the protagonist use the RoR as a place to practise his magic.
