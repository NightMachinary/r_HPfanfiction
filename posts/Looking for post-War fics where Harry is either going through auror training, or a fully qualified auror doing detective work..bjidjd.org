I've read a couple fics with auror work in them like Innocent and the one mainly from the POV of Harry's trainee and I really like the crime mystery aspect.

Gen or pairings are fine either way! Thanks!


** Well, there's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) where Harry becomes an auror in the second half after finishing Hogwarts. Although the mystery of the Lady Thief aka the Night Nargle (as Luna calls her) isn't that mysterious for the reader since half the scenes are from her perspective and she's living in the same house as him.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.
