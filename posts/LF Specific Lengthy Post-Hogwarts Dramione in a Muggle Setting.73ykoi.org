Hey all, I'm trying to find a fic I read a while back. Hermione goes to live with her father and step-mother, there's a lot of tension, it's a rural setting and the mother hates magic. In her wanderings she encounters Draco in his summer home. He paints. They fall in love, Harry and Ron think Draco is drugging her. I think it starts with Draco seeing Hermione in a sea of golden grass and wanting to paint her? I'm pretty sure that it's Hermione-centric, with minimal Harry or Ron involvement. However, I can't remember if it switches between her POV and Draco's. It was definitely on FanFiction.net, and probably over five years old, if not eight...

Any help would be appreciated. I have not been able to find it using the FF.net filters of English, Hermione, Draco, and >100 words.

*** From reading the first chapter, I believe the fic is linkffn(A Regret to Belong by AnneM.Oliver).

I didn't recognize it in my first search because I was mis-remembering some things, but I do remember quite enjoying it the first time around.
