I love this trope, which means I've read so so many of them, but I'm sure that there's a bunch of older or newer fics that fly under the radar. By longer, I just mean over 50k, so no one-shots.

** Ok, I was about to plug my fic, but I have just realised that you have read it. :)

Try linkffn(13209163) which is a sequel to linkffn(12773864) you'd like this fic too, (personally, I like this better) even though it's not what you are looking for.

  Sequel to The Will of All Others. Harry is trapped in every way under the rule of Lord Voldemort. Now he has been summoned to an Alternate Universe where everything is at once so much better and so much worse. As the events of his world threaten to repeat themselves, how can Harry save this universe, when he couldn't even save his own?

  One conversation changes the course of the Wizarding World. Lord Voldemort decides he no longer wants to kill Harry Potter. No, Voldemort has other plans for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is a story where Harry must fight Voldemort from within, as a Dark Soldier. This is an Alternate Universe starting in Harry's Fourth Year.
