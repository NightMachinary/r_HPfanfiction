Bearings. He doesn't give them the finger but he just leaves and goes to the uni in America. It's a H/Hr pairing and very well written.

  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7573003/1/Harry-s-had-Enough][Harry's had Enough]] by sprinter 1988 and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782623/1/Damn-Wizards][Damn Wizards]] is a good example of this.

Basically, Harry leaves the rewarding world some time around his 5th year and eventually becomes the muggle prime minister trying to bring down the statute of secrecy.

** Why the fuck would he do that? He was friendless and powerless before he became a wizard -- why would he want to return to a place that holds only bad memories for him?

*** Because Magical Britain doesn't hold a monopoly on friend-offering capabilities. He can as easily move to somewhere else, where the Ministry doesn't go out of its way trying to create its own villains.

*** Because outside of the Weasley's (sans Percy), Neville, Hermione, and Luna. He was treated like crap. The entire government, press, and population were out to get him. The world was almost unfixably bigoted and either did not want to be saved, or wanted someone else to save them. And it went the same for many of his friends and loved ones. Hermione before the war would never have been able to be gainfully employed, just because she was muggle born. Sirius was thrown into prison without a trial Remus, the kindest man alive was basically homeless.

Why on earth would he want to stay in a world like that, that was unwilling to change?

This is something that bugs me every time I read it. Where do you or people in general draw this conclusion from? I've seen it in a lot of fanfiction but I don't really see any indication of it in the books before Voldemort took over.

***** I don't recall it stated outright, but it is implied with Mr. Weasley -who is a 'Muggle-lover' and has one of the least paid jobs in the Ministry. (Setting aside the fact that Arthur Weasley /likes/ his job and never has had the ambition to 'do better', as his colleagues would probably say.

****** Okay, I see how Arthur's paygrade might imply about the Ministry's view on muggles. That doesn't necessarily say anything about it's view on muggleborns, though. One group being part of their society, the other group being a threat to it, no matter how much the don't want to admit it. That being said, I've been trying to remember about characters blood- and social status and I'm drawing a blank at finding any adult muggleborns (that we know of) who are employed. Then again, we don't know about all the characters' blood status. There might very well have been muggleborn Unspeakables or Healers. Also, it's not like the Ministry is the only possible employer one could find in the wizarding world. Not eveyone works for the government.

******* It does kind of imply that the Wizarding World looks down on Muggles/Muggleborns, through the mocking of Arthur's job. I mean, his own children (namely Ron & Percy) are somewhat ashamed of his lowly job. Though it doesn't say explicitly that the Ministry definitely bans Muggleborns from +certain+ positions, it does paint a (slightly?) distorted picture.

******** I think Ron was more ashamed of Arthur's (unreasonable) enthusiasm towards his job rather then the job itself. I mean, Ron collects a comicbook series with a Muggle main character: /The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle/. I think it's save to say that he has no problems at all with muggles appart from not understanding much of their culture.

Anyway, my point is that I find it a bit far fetched to extrapolate the whole wizarding world's view on employing muggleborns by how Arthur Weasley (not a muggleborn) is treated in his job. I'm not saying that I think the argument unreasonable. I readily believe that there is discrimination agains muggles and muggleborns in the wizarding world. Otherwise it would have been a lot harder for Voldemort to gain followers the first time around. I also see how it might be harder for muggleborns and squibs to find jobs (see Filch). I just don't think it's impossible. Especially for Hermione how was repeatedly called the 'brightest witch of her generation'.

**** It was also the place where he made the two best friends any person could wish for, gained a surrogate family and found love. In the muggle world, he had absolutely nothing. It was magical world which saved him from the hands of his abusive relatives and gave him his first friends, Harry would /never/ give that up.

There was danger and unpleasantness in the magical world, yes, but if you think canon Harry would ever abandon his friends/family and leave them to face their problems alone, then you /really/ should read the books again.
