I'm not writing, just morbidly curious as to what people would choose, so: If you could choose a song for Lily and James' funeral, what would it be?

I like ‘I will follow you into the dark' by Death Cab for Cutie, something about it feels fitting for their relationship and death.


** Not sure about funeral, but I have a song I've been holding on to that I think would play as James dies.

​

*/"Cry and cry and cry/*\\
*/Over the love of you/* (he's giving up his life for lily)\\
*/(I can see the green light/*\\
*/I can see it in your eyes)/* (the killing curse is a green light and i like to think his last thought was of lily, and subsequently, her green eyes)\\
*/Cry and cry and cry/*\\
*/Over the love of you/*\\
*/I can see the green light/*\\
*/I can see it in your eyes"/*
