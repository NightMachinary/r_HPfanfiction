Hi everyone to the second bookclub event :D

Last week was Angst Week and we read together [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/][The substitute]] by BajaB.

To join the thread please read up to or beyond chapter 4, and of course Spoilers for everyone who hasn't read the story.

Like last week I'm posing a few general questions to get the ball rolling:

- What do you think of the story so far?
- did you drop? if so why?
- Portrayal of characters? The 'Real' OC Potter family? and Golem Harry.
- The concept of magic used? Golems? other worlds?
- Readability? (would you suggest it to others, style, grammar, dialog etc)
- What did you like and why?
- What didnt you like and why?
- Did you drop it, and if you did why did you?
- What could have been better?
- And for those who read it all: The ending?

Also of note: Next week is Crime Week, I will open a separate thread called Crime Week so feel free to post your crime stories there so that we can vote for which fic we well read for next week :D

Edit: For all those who are interested. The voting thread for next week can be found here [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1pps2p/crime_week/][Crime Week]], and last week's thread can be found here [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1oq650/bookclub_discussion_thread/][Bookclub Discussion Week 1]]


** I've read it, plus the alternate endings, a while ago so my memory of it is a bit hazy.

It was definitely a well-written story, and I think it showed the despair and hopelessness that Harry was feeling really well. I wanted to see Harry carve a place out for himself in the world, so the ending was a bit disappointing. But at least he went out on his own terms, and will be remembered fondly by (some) of the people that were closest to him.

Also, I wanted to see some Harry/Chloris because +I'm a dirty pevert+ it would have been awesome.

** The worst thing with this story in my opinion was its ending.

I wouldn't mind the main character dying if it was done well enough. But here, it seemed like the author was just throwing everything towards it only for the sake of making one of his Awesome Ending Twists that he seemed to be rather proud of.

Aside from that, the story was quite good. Especially so because the notion of inherent potential conflict between one's true self and the perceived identity by others is interesting to me.

OP, can you link this thread to previous ones and also to the next voting thread when you create it?

** I read the whole story over a few days. I had to stop every now and then because it was so very, very, depressing. But so well written I needed to have closure.

I loved golem Harry and his characterization. I felt bad for him, having such a crappy life, only to realize you're not even human after all. What's the point. The other characters' reaction to him being a golem felt right too. It's not surprising that Hermione, Ginny and Dumbledore would support him. Just as it's not surprising that Ron would ditch him once more.

I didn't care for the Potter family though, they were all a bit too perfect. Living as they did in Avalon, I expected them to be a bit crazy.

And the ending... omg, that ending. I think I died a little inside, so I pretend it never happened and invent myself a happy life for Garry and his true friends.

Great story, I'm glad it was picked, and I'd totally recommend it, with a warning to bring tissues.
