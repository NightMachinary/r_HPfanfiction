I've been trying to find it for ages and it's driving me insane. It's a Snape adopts Harry/Malfoy fic. Stuff I remember:

-When Snape adopts Harry, he's like 14/15 (I think).

-Harry lives with him for ages before any adoption papers are signed.

-Malfoy is adopted after Harry

-Malfoy falls in love with a muggle- he sees her sing opera and believe she must be a witch because no muggle could possibly have that level of talent. Harry insists she is a muggle, and many arguments ensue, but eventually it's proved she is a muggle and after much angst Malfoy still loves her anyway

-It was a pretty long fic (at least over 100k words, more likely over 200k)

-It had a sequel

-Harry and Malfoy bicker loads, but ultimately Harry and Malfoy call each other brother and end up loving each other.

-The muggle Malfoy falls in love with works at a swimming pool (or at least spends a lot of time there) and I'm like 80% sure she had red hair

If anyone can tell me what this fic is I will be eternally thankful! :D


** 90% sure it's this:
