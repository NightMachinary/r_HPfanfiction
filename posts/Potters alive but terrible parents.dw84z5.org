I search ffn in which the Potters are alive but are not a good parents. They ignore/abuse Harry or care only about how much money they can make out of being his parents and him. There can be siblings for Harry but not the WBHL. Paring for Harry can be virtually anyone the rarer the better. thanks.


** There's Strange Reflection by Lequin (linkffn(12307886)) which is frequently recommended here. Negligent with one child, almost Dursley-level indulgent with the other. Add to that a second Harry...

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

Rest in Peace

The rest of the fic is just going to be plot summaries of each year.

** Linkffn(Negligentia) is a "brother of the BWL" rather than WBWL and features Potter parents who are about as negligent as it's possible for a parent to be.

Incidentally, the flair you want for this is "request;" "recommendation" it's for when you're giving recommendations.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.
