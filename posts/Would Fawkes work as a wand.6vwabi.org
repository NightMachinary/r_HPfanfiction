Like if Harry just beat him over a table could he wave him around like a rubber chicken to cast spells? A single feather makes up the wand core so using a whole phoenix must be better right?


** A phoenix feather still attached to the phoenix is a phoenix feather still attached to the phoenix's magic. If a canon wizard has any type of personal resistance to magic cast upon one's person, then I don't see this working.

I mean, following this logic, dragon reserves would be locked down tighter than Buckingham palace, because if a phoenix is better than a phoenix feather, god help the enemies of the guy who got a dragon heartstring.

****** Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Ron slowly made their way towards the dragon reserve. Ron tossed a key forward and Harry caught it easily, sliding it into the gate quickly. It belonged to Charlie and the youngest male Weasley had borrowed it while having lunch with his brother earlier in the day All four, wearing black clothing, slipped through the reserve's staff housing, only slowing long enough for Harry to hide the key outside one of Charlie's coworker's huts.

With the key issue dealt with, the four made their way as stealthily as possible to their target, a Hebridean Black's cage. It was to be moved back to Scotland in the morning. Harry and his allies aimed to disrupt that plan.

As they approached, Hermione began whispering instructions.

Harry nodded and began casting. He was removing his scent, lightening his body, and disillusioning himself along with a handful of other spells to help protect himself.

Neville finished assembling a kite shield and held it and the sword of Gryffindor for Harry as Ron closed his eye and beseeched every deity he could think of for this to work.

The plan was insane. Foolhardy. Most likely unworkable. But it was all they had.

An accident in Dumbledore's office in third year had Harry realize something. While holding a baby Fawkes, he had answered a question the headmaster had directed at him. Baby Fawkes had opened his mouth and the spell Harry had said hit him in the face, turning his skin completely transparent. The Headmaster had been stupefied by the event and horrified. A week later, he told Harry that he had tried the same thing with Fawkes and found he could also use the bird to cast spells. "If you want an adult phoenix to try to scratch your eyes out, I suggest you try casting a transfiguration spell while holding one. I transfigured his beak into a banana."

That had set Harry to laughing once he was assured that Fawkes was not injured.

And he had forgotten about it until Hermione was reading the Bard's tales and mentioned a story that had an event like Harry and Dumbledore's. A snake held by wizard had worked as a wand.

He had related the story and Hermione came up with the plan: harry's 'new' wand, taken from a Snatcher and worked surprisingly well for him, had a heartstring from a Hebridean Black. Since Fawkes was unavailable and Ollivander no longer able to craft wands, it was time to attempt something that might be considered a war crime.

Hermione removed the control collar from her jacket and handed it over. Harry wore it like an oversized bangle on his shield arm as Ron opened the cage.

"Don't die," he whispered.

"Same to you."

They bumped fists then Harry made his way slowly into the cage, the kite shield expanding to help protect him should the dragon awaken too early. ~â€¢~

Yeah, i'll probably finish it tomorrow.

******* ~stamps with stamp of approval~

I wonder, though; if phoenixes can be used to conduct magic, and dragons can be used to conduct magic, and wandless magic is considered using one's self to conduct magic...

Could you use another wizard as a wand, perhaps? [[https://mlpforums.com/uploads/post_images/img-866825-1-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-fire-the-twilight-gun1.gif][This comes to mind.]]

********** There was on fic where Hermione wondered if witch/wizard hair could be used as a wand core. The answer was yes, but it was useless for what she was doing, namely trying to create wands that don't have the trace. Plant cores are weaker and burn out easily, but don't have the trace, while any animal part will set it off.

*********** I'd expect most things with magical DNA might work but they'll all have different levels of effectiveness. I guess it'd depend from wandmaker to wandmaker. I'm pretty sure the famous three cores aren't fixed but they're only the preferences of olivander (he thinks they are the most effective and I suppose he would be right because he's the bed wand maker in UK and his family has been studying wandlore for thousands of years)

********* Now, funny that you should mention that... Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link, which is /really good/ on the character-building and world-building, has a plot point in the later chapters that [[/s][Japanese witches/wizards can use their strong feelings of community to combine their spells into powerful blasts; Harry later manages to use this with Ron, Hermione, and Neville to create Dementor-killing Patroni.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/18/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link]] It starts a bit before chapter 18, but this is the first one where Harry manages to perform a combined spell with other students.

** Possibly! This is a very interesting idea. The wand properties also come from the wood, bendiness, and length, but I suppose if you gave fawkes some holly and Harry held him Harry might be able to focus magic through him!

Also, Fawkes might not like being beaten over a table, lol. He also might not like the "taste" of Harry's magic flowing through him.

Could be an interesting part of a Dumbledore mentor fic.
