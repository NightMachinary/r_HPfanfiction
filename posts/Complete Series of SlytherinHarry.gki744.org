So many authors undertake a full rewrite of the HP series from PS, but I've honestly never seen one completed all the way to DH; I think the furthest was abandoned after they finished a HBP rewrite. Are there any complete book series going all the way up to DH? Or perhaps one somewhere around OoTP/HBP but regularly updated?

I'm a massive stickler for grammar and formatting so if the author doesn't know how to use speech marks or paragraphs I can't read it.

Thanks folks!


** linkffn(Saving Connor) is the first in a 7-book series (plus a one-shot!) following Slytherin!Harry. James/Lily live, Harry is sorted in Slytherin, but his twin Connor goes into Gryffindor. Eventual Drarry in the later books.

Note: It was published almost 15 years ago. Thus, many aspects of the series are seen as "tropey" now, but they were unique back then. I'll list the tropes under a series of spoiler tags as some of them are "spoiler-ish".

WBWL, magical cores, Pureblood Culture, grey!Harry, and Severitus (not bio-dad but adopted dad) make up the main tropes Characters bashed: nearly all traditional "Light" characters in the series, mainly James, Lily, Dumbledore Deeper tropes: magical characters, goblin relations, dark/grey/light/wild magic, blocked magical cores, vows, to name a few.

I know that seems like /a lot/, but it truly is a good series imo. I reread it about once a year and enjoy it every time.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
