Hermione and Narcissa are in a courtroom but all are ambushed. Hermione wakes up to find herself and Narcissa in a house on an island. They try to escape on a boat only to find that they can't get pass a certain point.Their relationship slowly develops but one day Hermione wakes up to find herself in the hospital and realizes that both her and Narcissa were hit by the same spell that ricocheted. Meaning that the island they were on was merely fabricated in their minds. Hermione woke up while Narcissa didn't, meaning she is still on the lonely island.

I read this such a long time ago but now would love to read it again. I don't remember if it was completed at that time or much other then the summery above. Hoping that someone can lead me to it. Thank you!

  "There is this game muggle kids play," She says with a bitter chuckle. "Who would you take to a desert island? You are supposed to choose one of your mates, or maybe your little crush, or your favorite celebrity. You are supposed to pick one person in the whole world. I am not saying you are the last person I would choose... But you are close."
