:END:
A couple of months back I read a really good fic but I've lost the link of it in my browser, I remember the story starts from Hermione wearing a really nice green or red dress to a masquerade ball to look for potential men to father a child with her but without the commitment. While there, no one really recognises her, but she caught Draco's eye. They did ‚Äúit‚Äù with the mask on and he had no idea that she used him as a sperm donor. Years later, he's still mooning over ‚Äúthe girl in the __ dress‚Äù and did not marry. Pansy and Blaise are dating (?) and the three of them saw Hermione's kid but Blaise made the connection first and hinted at Draco continuously that Granger might be his mystery girl. Blaise also confronted Hermione to tell Draco the truth. I think this was a multi-chapter fic.

Would appreciate if someone can help me, or have read it and know the title as well as the author of this fic. üò≠üò≠üò≠

Is it this one? Not sure but the summary kind of reminded me of this story.

There are some difference in what you mentioned and this story but it's the closest I can recall reading something like that.
