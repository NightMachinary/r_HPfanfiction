What is it about a FF that makes you stop reading?

For me it's two. 1- ridiculously long paragraphs 2- characters that are far too OOC


** When characters are given the intelligence of 4 year olds. I'm not exaggerating, I mean when Harry explains something and then Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny/whoever they're bashing literally cannot comprehend the simple shit Harry is telling them. It baffles me to the point of anger.

You see this type of idiocy with the vast majority of Harry in Azkaban fics.

** I really dislike long descriptions. I find myself getting bored when authors take whole paragraphs to simply describe one object for example.

I also don't like when certain fics are identical to canon, to the point when a scene is /exactly/ the same as in canon, just with different characters involved or whatever. I read fanfiction to see something different happening, otherwise I would stick to the original books.

I don't really mind OOC characters as long as the fic is clearly AU. I actually find Harry to be very OOC in /most/ fics anyway, even in fics that try to stay true to his character.

That's definitely true, but there's a fine line between character development and outright "OOC-ness", isn't there? I feel like some people require characters to remain completely static in order to not call them OOC.

Is it OOC for Harry to form a friendship with Dudley for example? Not really, I guess it could happen depending on the narrative. Is it OOC for Harry to participate in the equivalent of Harry hunting? Yeah...

Sure. Because Snape is a gigantic corrupt asshole. Even the most lawful and compliant of D&D paladins would defy Snape.

I really don't understand where people get the notion that Harry is some kind of rebel. He's completely well behaved and rarely questions the established order of things: Go to school, try to fit in, don't try to cast magic outside of school, follow the orders of your teachers even if they are assholes (torturing yourself while doing it), respect your elders, the Ministry is important and not just a bunch of corrupt asshole politicians, etc. He'd almost be a poster boy for compliance, if it weren't for the call to adventure constantly stopping him from being the most milquetoast and integrated person ever.

I mean, his main shtick is maintaining or returning to the status quo and fulfilling his prophesied purpose. That's like the most compliant thing ever. "All is well", when everything is as it is supposed to be, pre-Voldemort.

To be fair you brought up snape I was just following along using the same example. There are plenty of other ways in which he has blatantly disregarded the rules and yes it turned out for the best but that saying the ends justify the means.

For example: Dragon in first year Using the prefects bathroom in forth year Sneaking into Hogsmeade in third year Flying a car in second year

I could go on and on but his non compliance is all throughout the books.

Doesn't he convince Hagrid to get rid of the dragon because it's dangerous and illegal?! Sounds pretty compliant to me. It would be non-compliant if he ratted out his friend (ignoring social convention) or help him illegally raise it in a cave (ignoring authority and law). He's choosing the most non-disruptive actions constantly!

#+begin_quote
  Using the prefects bathroom
#+end_quote

Compliance. He's trying to solve the egg riddle, which is his given task at the time, by an authority. Would he even get in trouble for using the bathroom?! Champions get a lot of leeway. Not giving a shit about the egg riddle while having a lark in the bathroom would be non-compliance.

Okay, lets try it another way: If the way Harry handled the dragon situation was an example of non-compliance, can you come up with an example of how he could have acted that would have been more compliant than what he ended up doing?

************* Someone who is complaint would have gone to a teacher. I happen to agree with the way that Harry did it however he did go the route that broke the rules. Yes he did it so Hagrid didn't get in trouble but again that is saying the ends justify the means.

I don't like Snape as a character (For many reasons that I wont go into) but he had a good point when he says that Harry had a blatant disregard for the rules. From very early on he would break simple rules such as curfew.

I guess my whole point comes down to like with so much in the series it's not black and white. You can't say he's compliant and I cant say he's non-compliant, it's not that simple.

When I say that I don't like when Harry is portrayed as compliant what I mean is when they follow the complete definition to the word. When they have Harry blindly following orders and never questioning why something is the way it is. That's not Harry.

************** Ah I see the problem now, you only see the "authority" angle in compliant.

Going back to the definition you posted:

#+begin_quote
  *disposed to agree with others* or obey rules
#+end_quote

and the synonyms:

#+begin_quote
  synonyms:acquiescent, *amenable*, biddable, tractable, *complaisant*, *accommodating*, *cooperative*, adaptable
#+end_quote

Here's how Meriam Webster's dictionary defines it:

#+begin_quote
  to conform, submit, or *adapt* (as to a regulation or to another's wishes) *as required* or requested
#+end_quote

Ratting out your first friend, resulting in him possibly losing his job and going to Azkaban is neither amenable, accommodating or cooperative.

Lets pick a more extreme example: If your grandma is about to be hit by a truck, she's deaf but you can easily reach her and pull her away in time, but there's a red light, then you're still a generally compliant person if you decide to run across the street and pull her away, because the implicit request of her and of society is that she doesn't want to die and you're complying with that. Sure, if you don't do anything you are complying with traffic codes, but you are non-compliant with most of everything else.

Coming back to HP: Hagrid, his friend, is in need of help. Harry finds a solution that basically agrees with everyone (the dragon doesn't have to die, Hagrid is happy, Dumbledore is happy, the law is happy).

Sure, because that makes no sense for a /generally/ (instead of just authority-) compliant person as Harry. (sorry ;)

We actually have a perfect example for someone who's /generally/ less compliant than Harry, but somewhat more authority-compliant: Hermione. See, nagging and annoying her friends, Polyjuice, Firebolt, goading Harry into teaching the DA, applying disfiguring jinx to contract, "no, don't go to the ministry, it's a trap[[https://i.imgur.com/AnemLI4.gif][!]]", not believing Harry about Draco, Memory charming her own parents, not believing Harry about a Horcrux in Hogwarts, etc etc...

Harry on the other hand is much more amenable, he doesn't want to fight his friends (i.e. comply) if he can avoid it, so it makes no sense for him to pray at the altars of authority.

** Lazy characterization is a big one for me. The most common issues are relying on trope-y fanon stereotypes or one-note shortcuts. Even with development and growth, characters should remain consistent and recognizable. SexGod!Anyone, for example, outside of maybe Sirus, is basically a backspace unto itself. Same with a Harry written as unobservant and humorless, or abusive!Ron. The list goes on.

I enjoy enemies-to-friends-to-lovers stories but they're a minefield of pet peeves and hates. Whitewashing a character's flaws and harmful actions or excusing them away via a contrived abusive backstory is a no go. In the same genre, anything non-consensual---or dubiously so---is a dealbreaker.

Outside of that, Americanisms, unnecessary pop culture references, and anachronisms are all slightly lower on the hate scale. They won't ruin a great story but they can certainly put a damper on one.

When you claim a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][/For Want of a Nail/]] change and give actual AU, you're just lying to your audience.

Another is repeated misspellings of canon names---Delores instead of Dolores, for example.

Things that make me just stop, however? When the protagonist/PoV character(s) are [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/toodumbtolive][/Too Dumb To Live/]] and the story still plays it seriously. That sort of tonal/cognitive dissonance is too jarring to continue reading.

Also, when writers have polls for pairings or whatever, that's a huge flag for the "Has no idea what they're doing" team. If you want to write a serious story where you could have swapped out love interests like a fucking pokémon battle, then your story is probably shit. If who gets together at the end doesn't make sense with a retrospective of the story, you did something wrong.

Finally, "opposites" pairings. Draco would /never/ get with Hermione at any point in canon, ignoring the whole lack of attraction the other way round. Likewise, I don't see Voldemort/Harry happening ever, or Snape/Harry, or whatever horrifying pairings people come up with. They /hate/ each other, and /no/, that is /not/ U.S.T. If you want a story where them getting together is /any amount of feasible/, you'll need to write a fic so AU that you might as well write your own book instead of fanfiction.

5. Harry who acts like an adult at age 11, including seducing Tonks and Fleur, and browbeating all the other adults into submission with his "This is why you suck" lectures.

*** Totally agree with 2, 4 and 5.

Having Harry, who barely has any world experience with anything, suddenly being more worldly and sophisticated than adults that have 50-80 years on him is stupid.

​

Sex scenes that start with "Harry took off his pants and out popped his redwood sized dick that made the Troll he defeated in first year look like a grain of rice" is equally ludicrous. The boy is is often described as scrawny and malnourished. Somehow I doubt he is malnourished because he body put half his body mass into his dick.

​

I can live with abusive Dursleys as long as it is over the top and it is like .... one scene that leads to Harry leaving for good or happening before they are given their comeuppance by someone rescuing Harry. But I will half agree by saying that the situation for the abuse needs to be handled well and not too egregious.

​

As for character bashing, it really again depends on how it is handled, for me. Showing a character is deeply flawed and has caused harm or acted irresponsibly, such as with Dumbledore, or using a plot point of characters being angry because they were betrayed, such as a plot line involving, for instance, Molly and Ginny slipping Harry love potions to get him with Ginny, I can tolerate. Random, over the top, unjustified bashing that comes out of nowhere without any sort of plot reason is stupid. Having Harry fed up with and getting into a screaming match with Ron about how Ron constantly abandons Harry whenever Ron feels inadequate or jealous and calling him a bad friend or whatever is fine. Having Harry randomly disrespect someone for no real reason is bad.

She was guilty-tripped by Snape to say that they were best friends and in the books there are no indications that she had any interst in him beyond friendship (she never touched him at all for example).

He was as much bully as the victim.

He supported and joined an active genocide. He was manipulative and a bigot. He used dark magic and quite frankly because of that he had the more dangerous weapon than the Marauders with their public humiliation. It was four guys with fist against one with a combat knife. Less unfair than the numbers suggest,

I just can't see him as innocent in any of it. He had enough examples that that ideolgy is bullshit, but still was ok with the killing of innocents and literally stepping over their bones to get some power to feel superior.

I can never forgive that at one point he was an active part in planning to kill at least one baby and he was ok with it to further his own position of power until he realized that the baby's mother could be at risk as well. Snape chose his ambitions over the life of a baby. Nothing can ever make up for it in my eyes.

** Read my flair.

But to be more specific: I'm not against calling the magic inside somebody a "magical core". What I am against, and what makes me just nope out of any story immediately, is when this magical core represents some sort of mana pool, or powerlevels. I abhor it if you can, and I quote, "train it like a muscle".

Why do I hate it so much? Because it tends to be accompanied by lazy writing to its left and shit imagination to the right. Magic duels become gunfights where the guy with the bigger calibre wins. No creativity is put into the fights and the magic. Its always just "Harry can overpower a spell to make bigger boom".

And I just know where it comes from: videogames and anime. Shonen anime seems to be especially guilty of inspiring this. But the thing is, even in Shonen Anime, the fights in which the protagonist has to use his head; his wits to overcome the enemy are the ones that are worth watching. If a protagonist can just steamroll his opponents with little to no effort, you either have a comedy (like One Punch Man), or way more likely, you end up having a shit story.

I totally agree. I also agree that there's probably a correlation between "magical cores" and the shit writing you describe here, but I don't think one necessitates the other. As you write:

** I don't need perfect grammar or spelling in my fics, I realise not everyone is equally good at it or has a good beta. Mistakes are expected, but if there are too many consistent mistakes in bad spelling and grammar mistakes (i.e. misspelling a lot of names, would of instead of would have, etc.) I find that it breaks the immersion and I feel as if the author isn't really trying that hard.

Another pet peeve of mine is authors who make poor use of names. For instance, you can refer to Draco Malfoy as Draco, Malfoy, Malfoy Jr, Ferret, blond ponce, Draco Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy, etc. All of those can be appropriate depending on the situation and person using the name. Using the correct name for the correct situations is something that a lot of authors don't do. Many times I see Harry or Hermione randomly referring to Malfoy (who in the story is an antagonist) as "Draco" which supposes a certain familiarity that has not been established in the story at all. And then they turn around and call people who are closer to them than Malfoy by their last names (i.e. Ms. Bones, Ms. Abbot). There's a break in continuity there and it makes the characters unrealistic.

I've also become a little more allergic to the 11-year-old lord and lady stuff. Or basically any fic that heavily goes into political manoeuvring while the cast is still in Hogwarts. I don't mind a little of it, but a lot of those fics quickly become very dry.

Hermione bashing.

Things that don't cause me to abandon a fic, but I don't like either are stuff like: name changes for the sake of a name change (I'm fine with a different name for a disguise, but going by Hadrian just cause annoys me), the healthy diet and exercise regimen trope, dragging out canon situations that everyone has read a hundred times already unnecessarily long, inserting drama in a romance by using the overused and tired misunderstanding of a certain situation which causes a lot of angst on both sides until the teary reunion where they realised it was all a mistake.

Besides that, poor text structure (typos, bad grammar...) makes me avoid the fic. Also, (very) rarely, a fic manages to set up backstory in such a way to completely lose my will to continue reading it -- I think the worst case of this for me was a fic where a soulmate bond killed off an active relationship which there was nothing wrong with in first place. This is why I've never liked soulmate fics -- their tendency to kill off free will, and (in especially bad cases) lead to hopeless unrequited love.
