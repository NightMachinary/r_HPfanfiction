  Dumbledore arrives on Harry's parents' doorstep on the evening of his seventeenth birthday and reveals to him that Voldemort is not really dead. There is a Prophecy, and he believes Harry is the subject. But there is more to the Prophecy than even Dumbledore knows, and the Girl Who Lived, Iana Malfoy, will prove to be central to everything.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
