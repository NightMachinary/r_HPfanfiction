I'm not sure why I've been thinking about this one in particular, I don't think it was very well known. It was definitely on Portkey before it shut down and I'm going through archive-portkey now. But I don't remember the title...or when it was posted. Hopefully before the snapshot on archive. It had, Harry coming back to London, meeting a little girl in the bookstore, Hermione comes around the corner and it goes from there. I remember the girls name is something like Dot, or Dotty, short for Dorothy. Any help is awesome! It's driving me nuts
