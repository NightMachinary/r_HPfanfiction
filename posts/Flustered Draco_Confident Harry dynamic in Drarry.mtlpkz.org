Honestly, I'm sick of Drarry ffs where Draco is "on top". That's one of the reasons why I used to hate Drarry so much. Because, really, if Drarry was canon, I just can't imagine Harry being obedient/flustered. Like, the sassy-Harry we know from books? Nah, totally not. On the other hand, Draco, the Draco that blushes so easily and calls on his Father every five minutes is supposed to be "a bad boy"? Just because he's a bully? C'mon.

So does someone know any good fanfics where Draco's all flustered and confused, not-knowing-how-to-flirt et cetera, and Harry's the confident one?

  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.

** I don't read much of this pairing so don't have many recs, but Harry is the confident one here: linkao3(16223264)

(Not liking a 'submissive' Harry is probably a factor in that, tbh)

  Fleeing the aftermath of his recent divorce, Draco Malfoy takes up a post as the new Potions Master at Hogwarts. At first he believes his hopes for a fresh start are dashed when he sees that a certain boyhood rival is on staff there as well. But Harry Potter is being weirdly nice to him, leaving Draco no choice but to play along. As Draco reckons with his ex-wife's infidelity and questions about his own sexuality, he finds himself going to an openly gay Potter for guidance. As their friendship deepens, Draco realizes that there is quite a lot that Potter can teach him. And that he is surprisingly ready to learn.
