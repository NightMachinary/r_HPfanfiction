All I can remember is that there were 3-4 full length books. They took place in America, the Magical Congress of the US was mentioned, there was something about tents and magic cars. I could be confused, but I think at one point the protagonist meets HP. It's several years old at this point. I want to say it took place in Boston or Philly. I know it's not much to go on, but if anyone knows what I'm talking about I'd really like to read them again.


** Sounds like the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity. linkffn(3964606)

*** Wait...The AQ stories took place in Chicago. And I don't recall her ever meeting HP. It's been a few years since I've read it, but that's not what I remember.
