:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much of it to be honest. I DO know that Harry and Snape had a relationship thing, but Snape ended it. Harry ended up in a marriage contract with Lucius Malfoy and I think Draco ended up trying to help split it up. There's a snake room in the Malfoy Manor. Lucius makes a plot to impregnate Harry but it goes wrong and there's a miscarriage. I can't remember much else.

HELP


** I believe this is the "To Have" series by MontanaDan: To Have and to Hold, To Have Not, and To Have and to Keep. Your description only seems to cover the first two stories. There was a several-year break before the third story was published, so you may have missed it.

All three stories can be found on his [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=769][Skyehawke]] and [[http://members.adult-fanfiction.org/profile.php?no=23843&view=story&zone=hp][adult fanfiction]] pages.

All three stories are also on his LiveJournal, if you feel up to searching for all the chapters. First story starts [[https://montana-dan.livejournal.com/780.html][here]]. Second story starts [[https://montana-dan.livejournal.com/9814.html][here]]. Third story starts [[https://montana-dan.livejournal.com/16826][here]].

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=254][Walking the Plank]] only has the first two stories. His [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/680772/MontanaDaniels][FFN]] page doesn't have any of them.
