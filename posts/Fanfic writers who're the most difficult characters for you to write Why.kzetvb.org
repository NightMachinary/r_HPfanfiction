I'm not a fanfic writer (yet) but if I had to take a guess Dumbledore or Snape and also I saw another post on here that the twins are difficult to write and I agree. I'd think it would be hard to write them as funny enough, although of course they're not just comic relief.

I've been reading a lot of Sirius fanfics and would think he wouldn't be that difficult to write. Impulsive, quick-tempered, daredevil castoff from a wealthy family, and always the most handsome in every fic. Molly Weasley also seems the same in most fanfics I've read, stuffing food down people's throats and fussing/scolding.


** Luna.

You really can't handle her character easily. It's very very difficult and delicate. She's just very out there as a character and there isn't enough about her to know her personality.

The trend with her character is that writer often make her character OP, can see the future and is always right, or a very frustrating person who knows the answers but insists on acting like a complete buffoon and not sharing them or she's a weird version of a pothead from the sixties.

This isn't counting the ones where she's a nymphomaniac or an exhibitionist.

When Luna as a character was introduced, I really liked her. But getting the tone just correct for her, the balance, it is very difficult.

Tonks

Tonks is equally difficult. She's a fun and likeable character but you can't spin a main plot around her, or atleast have her as a love interest and keep the story going in an addictive manner. It's been very difficult to do, and as far as I've read, it hasn't ever been done.

I believe the challenges of her age, the lack of depth in her personality in the books, and not enough information on her as a whole makes it difficult to set the tone for her.

The other characters you can generally set the tone for but yeah, tonks and Luna are very difficult to write.

*** For Luna, I feel like a lot of authors gloss over a rather substantial event in her life, one that I believe had a fundamental impact on who she is: the death of her mother, and the fact that Luna was there to witness it.

*** I read a lot of Remus/Tonks. The most successful Tonks characterization I've read has been Kerichi's Once in a Blue Moon series. The author gave Tonks more of a life than any other fic I've read. There's five big fics in this series, spanning GoF to HBP, plus an AU DH ending and one-shots. Funnily enough, I think the best in the series are the three that take place during GoF, because the author couldn't rely on canon to figure out what was happening in Tonks' life. As a result, the first ones are fun, lighthearted mysteries that give Tonks an extended family, friends, and a side job. I was sad when I finished the series because her characterization made me feel like I was saying goodbye to a friend. Anyway, when I write Tonks I try to write in that spirit. Since we don't know very much, I can make it up. The first fic in the Once in a Blue Moon Series linked: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2530576/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon]])

So when people are mean to her, its the Nargles. Someone is acting stupid, head full of Wrackspurt. They probably don't exist but that just might be the Wrackspurt in my head.

***** It's not the trope I have a problem with. But the way most authors write it is horrible and just makes me click off the fic. I mean sure, you can gain more confidence if you're surrounded by people that will put you up instead of putting you down, but that doesn't make him some self-assured, confident guy in two months that isn't terribly awkward socially and who can talk to girls he isn't familiar with already which he can't . Another thing I see is Neville become super-duper powerful when he gets a new wand despite us as readers being given no inclination of his power beforehand and his family literally thinking he was a squib until he was eight.

*** Personal opinion here but I actually think blank slate characters that you can project whatever you want onto are easier than characters we know a bit about but not much e.g Ernie Macmillian, Seamus Finnegan the Patil twins etc. Because you can just imagine an oc and give them the name Is Harry a ravenclaw in your fic and you need a ravenclaw friend? Write the characterisation and call them Terry Boot or Anthony Goldstein or Michael Corner. Characters we have a little info for but not much are harder.

** My personal struggle is with Tom Riddle. I know he's characterized as a charming handsome guy who ruled his gang of bullies with an iron fist but I often find his characterizations quite unrealistic in fics. He is always depicted as this tyrant over his gang in front of whom the entire Slytherin gang cowers. I frankly doubt that an orphan of dubious origins would bring all those snobbish purebloods to his heel by being a piece of shit right from the start.

In fact we learn from the books that even fanatical blood purists from his generation, such as the Blacks (Walburga should have been in the same year as him according to the family tree), got scared of him once he revealed his true nature and we mostly see his followers being a generation younger than him. My thought is that he gained his Death Eaters through similar circumstances that Harry did gain the support of the DA (maybe he was a bit more confident)... assuming that he started his rise to power around the same time Nobby Leech was Minister for Magic, I like to think that he was the catalyst.

Anyways... my thoughts are that Tom Riddle was more of a charming sociopath and since I like to believe that most people are not like him, it's hard for most of us to get inside his head before he became the Voldemort we see in the series. Even Dumbledore is only able to make just some scarce assumptions about the way he was operating prior to that. On that note, I remember once reading a fic (can't remember the name) where he was exactly that. He was pleasant, loved and respected by everyone, purebloods, half-bloods and muggle-borns alike. He also seduces one of his teacher who is the wife of the first Muggle-born head of DMLE. Eventually he rapes her, plays the victim and blackmails her husband to reveal her 'indiscretion' if he doesn't resign. Now that's how I'd imagine Tom Riddle before he was Voldemort.

Yeah I also have wondered how Riddle got these early followers at school and I still don't 100% get Tom Riddle and his desire for muggle killing despite him being half blood, other than his father, hating what you hate about yourself, and thinking muggles are inferior for not being magical.

He is definitely a charming sociopath even in canon. The storyline you describes does sound like Tom...although if the story was in the late 90s, i wonder how sensational a story of a male student accusing a female teacher of rape would be. Interesting, although I usually avoid rape stories.

** Draco.

I've gotten so many comments about how I've done him wrong or some other shit like that. Remember, the books are told from Harry's perspective. We see what he thinks(ie. Hagrid's a brilliant teacher, Draco's evil, Dumbledore is an angle, etc.) and so anytime I try to write Draco differently...well, apparently I'm a blind bitch who sees everything through rose colored glasses and am an idiot for not wanting to hate a 16 year old kid. Direct quote there. Well, mostly.

I don't even pull a 'he was good all along'. I give him legit reasons; his mum is an alcoholic which leads him to do some other shit which moves the plot and his arc, the only person who was nice to him was a muggle born and they died gruesomely, he sees everything from Harry's perspective, etc. Even then I seldom give him full 'redemption'. After all, he does have some legit reasons to not like muggles and muggle borns.

** For me, Hermione. I love her to pieces, flaws and all, but it's so easy to get her tone wrong, and then suddenly she becomes too strident, or too adult, or too 'fanon'.

I think much of this stems from our general tendency as readers to fall into stereotyping more quickly with female characters. What is 'stern' with males easily reads as 'shrill' with females and so on, so I feel I have to take far more care to avoid mischaracterization with female characters, especially Hermione.

*** I was going to say Hermione. I like her as a character but she's hard to write and balance out her different traits.

** Snape. I just don't mesh with his irrational hatred of Harry and his bullying of children. I love reading about him, but fuck I have no idea how to write him.

*** He's a tough character. I guess it's a 'hurt people hurt people' thing. He may expect to be disliked so he lashes out before others can go on the offense.
