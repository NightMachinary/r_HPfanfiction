So the other day I posted asking if anyone knew any fics where Harry travel back in time, joined Voldemort and turned his family dark. Like teaching James, Siri, Remus dark magic/Traditions and unfortunately there don't seem to be many fics like that. So today I thought what about ones where Harry joins Voldemort during his school years or whatever and Sirius and Remus go with him. Like Sirius being like well your my Godson so I'm with you no matter what and Poor Remus is like someone has to keep these two idiots from killing themselves. Would Also be done for Twins and Neville following him as well haha.


** this sounds a really cool and interesting idea, if only i could write

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][The Rise of A Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda]]

“Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.”

Harry turns into a dark lord, is partners with Voldemort, has his own mark and uniform, has followers (16 of them, in all houses - and schools), is a Slytherin, Sirius and Remus are shocked but supportive.

WIP, 239k+ words, 22 chapters

THIS IS SLASH AND TOMARRY/HARRYMORT WHICH IS HARRY/TOM OR HARRY/VOLDEMORT, SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE SLASH OR ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PAIRING DON'T READ AS IT IS A BIG PART OF THE STORY

I would recommend one that is gen, or het, as this isn't the slash subreddit, and Tomarry isn't a very well liked ship, but it's the only one I could think of.

THIS IS PROBABLY ABANDONED AS IT WAS LAST UPDATED 2015

** I have been OBSESSED with exactly this premise ever since I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]]

Honestly, the way this writer comes up with shizzz to build her worlds is truly friggin amazing. A WIP unfortunately---this is just part 1 (part 2 is called Vindico Atrum)---but you will spend daaaaays and weeks probably working through it. I have to add: it's Harry/Voldemort and I do believe there's some underage in it. I had a really hard time believing Harry's age with the way he is written as a character, and I say this in view of how mature and adult like he is and the slash relationships, so I wasn't too eeked out about reading it.

The world is amazing and Harry is super charged as heck. Which I highly enjoy. Remus and Sirius are supportive as Harry discovers what Dark Magic is and what this means for magic in general (and politics) and convinces them, even though they don't morally support what he and Voldemort do at times, but they still listen and understand. Harry is extremely powerful and wants to fight to bring the Dark back into the light. Amazing magic and theories. And it becomes so GD plotty, I legit blasted through both parts in days (871k and 722k words).
