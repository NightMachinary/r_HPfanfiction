Hi Everyone! :)

I'm looking for a HP fanfic I read a long time ago. It was about Harry Potter who was abused (I think) and somehow his magic involved becoming one with the desert. He covers the UK with a storm and turns it into a giant Desert/post apocalyptic wasteland. I think it included a duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.

I recall reading it on FFN, but the Title or author escapes me. And after searching through both of my accounts, I never favorited the story and would like to read it again. Any help would be awesome! =D

*** Yeah - just updated, too. The author had pulled the story for a month or so [could have been a year; my sense of time is not to be trusted] and reposted it with edits in January.

**** You may have favorited it too. The author deleted everything at one point for some reason.

Edit: it could even be that the current story is posted by a new author who is continuing it since the last one was a total deletion (author page was a good bye profile and everything).

***** Good point, thanks for letting me know. I'm at the point where I don't care if a new author is taking the story on.
