** I have an HP/Great British Bake Off mashup that I've been working on. It's been fun to write so far and I've discovered that I'm way too invested in both!

** I'm working on a fic in my spare time that is a Harry Potter/ Eternal Darkness (gamecube game from the early 2000's) crossover that has become the darkest story I have ever written to date. Im only 13k or so into it, but it has been a blast to write so far!

** I've started writing a fic with Harry being basically the plant-whisperer, and he and Neville become friends and bond over their love of plants, and have plant adventures, and don't really have time for any three headed dogs or dark lords.
