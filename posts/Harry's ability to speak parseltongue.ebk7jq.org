Is there any possibility that Harry is still able to speak/understand parseltongue?

My reasoning is that even though he spoke pareeltongue he was never possessed during that time. Ginny said that the effects of possession are memory loss yet Harry never had any memory loss when he spoke parseltongue. So is it possible that ability to parseltongue is a side effect of (for the lack of a better word) hosting a horcrux? That is he learnt it from the horcrux sometime before Dudley's 11th birthday?

Also I don't consider it canon but in The Cursed Child Harry can speak parseltongue.


** Technically it's never mentioned in the books that Harry lost the ability to speak parseltongue in the books- it was an interview with J.K. Rowling afterwards that confirm it. I would put forward that the Main Series books are the primary canon with interviews and movies as optional canon. I like incorporating details where I can but the loss of parseltongue was dumb so I discount it in headcanon.

*** I hated that she said that. It would have been far more impactful and really illustrate the fact that it's our choices that matter, if it had turned out that Harry had been born with the ability to speak Parseltongue.

*** What confuses me the most is that it is claimed that Dumbledore could speak it. Ron, too, used it. So, why did he just lose the ability when it seems like it can be learned?

**** I liked the Seventh Horcrux explanation where parseltongue was just 4 syllables so eventually anybody could open the Chamber if they hissed at it long enough. That seems like the best explanation for how Ron could have opened the Chamber using memories from five years prior.

***** It was a few weeks/months prior - he imitated Harry from when he told the locket to open

****** You're right! I forgot about that. :) My point still stands, though. It wasn't like Harry opened that locket the day before and plenty of things happened between the locket and Ron and Hermione getting to the chamber entrance.

******* I don't think it's nearly as strong, yes, alot happened but that was also super memorable - Ron had gotten back minutes ago and suddenly they are able to destroy the locket that made him leave in the first place and Ron knew he was going to be the one to face it so he would have been paying attention to every little detail as a chessmaster would

**** I don't think Albus could speak it, though he could recognize it. Ron didn't understand it, though he could pronounce a word or two after much practice and fumbling about.

As for Harry, it may have been the soul piece in him that was translating for him at first, but it seems like that's the sort of shared talent that shouldn't go away. Harry may want to deny retaining the ability, however.

** There's certainly no suggestion that he had to be /possessed/ to any extent to use the Scar Horcrux's knowledge of Parseltongue --- rather, the way it's phrased is that due to the unpredictable magical effects of a bit of a soul being forced into the same body as another full soul, Harry's whole soul ended up absorbing some of the magical abilities inherent to Lord Voldemort's soul fragment.

So obviously it's quite possible (and, indeed, what /Cursed Child/ forces us to assume if one takes it to be canonical, but it's a reasonable assumption to make either way) that once the power has been transferred to Harry it doesn't just disappear just because the original source is removed --- in much the same way that picking up the toasted bread will not get the butter stain off the carpet.

Besides which, there is the matter of how "being a Parselmouth" works. Is it a permanent translation spell, or do you gain magical knowledge of the actual language? If the former, the magic disappearing would mean even a long-time Parselmouth who used Parseltongue every day would stop understanding it if they lost the gift; but if the latter (which has always made more sense to me), you wouldn't just /forget/ the magically-learned language just because the thing that "taught" it to you is gone.

** I personally have two theories : 1. Parseltongue is an hereditary magical trait of the slytherin family and is a consequence of magic signatures or some form of magical ADN that determine access to this sort of magic. Now Hosting a Horcrux has forced Harry magical signatures or magical ADN to change to match Tom Riddle magical ADN as is demonstrated by the brother-wand ( wand choose their wizard by matching the magical ADN) . Destroy the Horcrux would not restore Harry original magical ADN. 2. Parseltongue is an hereditary magical trait of the slytherin family. Just as blood of a father determine an heritage be it magical, monetary or others entitlements, a piece of magic that is donated to a child determine magically a magical heritage ( Tom Riddle is considered to be a secondary father to Harry). Destroying the Horcrux would yet again don't change this fact

*** Don't. You ever read time travel fanfiction. How about a child of Voldemorts trying to undo his death. What about experimental time-travel devices, and Back To The Future like effects. That's all in one place with that story.
