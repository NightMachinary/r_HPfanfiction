I just happened to think about this a few minutes ago. I know there are elements of Fanon that are controversial. Greater good Dumbledore, helpful goblins, just fanfiction tropes.

But what I'm talking about is before I ever read any fanfiction, I never thought Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were a four man group that called themselves The Marauders. I just thought they invented the Marauder's Map. As in, a map to aid explorers, plunderers and troublemakers. Not a map made by marauders. I think my case is helped by the fact that it's a Marauder's Map, not a Marauders' Map.

Did anyone else get that or another similar impression that the whole hivemind of people that read the books other than you got something wrong?

*** This discussion was had relatively recently, but I'm not sure if you were part of that discussion or not. Anyway, banishing doesn't necessarily mean that the object flies through the air to its destination. You can also banish things by making them disappear and reappear elsewhere:

#+begin_quote
  “We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak... just in case.”

  Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished.
#+end_quote

This makes sense as we know you can also summon things by either having them fly through the air towards you or by making them disappear from where they were and appear where you are. Two examples of the latter are McGonagall's summoning of sandwiches in CoS and Dumbledore's summoning of Rosmerta's mead in HBP.

I'm 90% sure he's being sarcastic there, since the ability to destroy horcruxes is one of the most commonly given to goblins abilities when people write fan fiction, regardless of the fact that we only know that certain highly-destructive things managed to destroy those and a house elf (with all the tricks that house elves have available to them) couldn't manage to do that.

But then again, I'm also pretty sure that the causality arrow goes the wrong way in those cases: rather than those people writing the goblins as having those abilities because it makes sense for them, many of them start with “Dumbledore is a bad bad boy because [insert nonsense]” and then use goblins for an easy justification because they seem like something one could attack magicky stuff to.

** The thing that always gets me is when people refer to wizarding society as "stuck in the past" or "Victorian" etc. The wizarding world's social mores are not based on the Muggle past. They're simply different. In some ways more progressive, in other ways more conservative, and in other ways still completely unsuitable for Muggle comparison.

For example, when it comes to gender issues, wizards are significantly more progressive than the Muggle world: wizards had a female head of government centuries before Muggle Britain did (Artemisia Lufkin, 1798 to 1811).

Another example is that the wizarding world is apparently significantly less prudish than Muggle Britain: the changing rooms at the Quidditch stadium are unisex, with Harry changing in the same room as Angelina, Alicia and Katie:

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

  Wood cleared his throat for silence.

  "Okay, men," he said.

  "And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

  "And women," Wood agreed. "This is it."
#+end_quote

The same changing rooms which have showers:

#+begin_quote
  "Diggory got the Snitch," said George. "Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it."

  "Where is Wood?" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.

  "Still in the showers," said Fred. "We think he's trying to drown himself."
#+end_quote

Again, more progressive than Muggle Britain, being more in line with Muggle Scandinavian values. (The prevalence of Runes well into the 15th century - Beedle the Bard wrote in them - also suggests wizarding Britain has been influenced more by Scandinavia than Muggle Britain was).

Wizarding Britain also has what appears to be a dating culture equivalent to modern Muggle practice.

But in other respects wizards are far from progressive. This is most evident in their clothing (though again, there was never really any period in Muggle history where robes were common everyday wear) but also extends to more fundamental issues such as their governmental institutions (lack of separation of powers, checks and balances, etc).

And then you have the issues that are neither progressive or conservative, such as blood prejudice. It's not exactly conservative because it's a form of radicalism, but it's not progressive either. It's the equivalent of Nazism: a recent, radical ideology, but one that is socially regressive.

Another example of the "neither progressive nor conservative, just different" is the wizarding approach to health and safety. It would be easy to jump to the conclusion that wizards' lack of regard for establishing safety procedures means that they are conservative/stuck in the past, but of course magic changes everything. Between accidental magic, the additional physical resilience of wizards (kids can be hit in the head by large iron balls flying at hundreds of miles an hour and shake it off) and advanced healing powers, wizards genuinely have a lot less to be concerned about with regards to physical safety. Of course that leads to different practices.

So yeah. You can't get to wizarding society by looking into Muggle past. It's a parallel culture, not a temporally displaced one.

But to answer your question, yes, I believe Elizabeth I was less of a ruler than the Minister of Magic. She will have been significantly less involved in the active day to day management of the country than the MoM. That's guaranteed by time alone if not gender - the modern state and all the bureaucratic apparatus which allow effective administration did not yet exist in her time. Government in Elizabeth's day was pretty much limited to war, taxes, trade policy and law and order.

In some modern states, the bureaucracy even dictates or dictated policy, no matter who was the minister, thanks to the inertia in the system, and their information advantage.

But no matter what you say, we still have a discrepancy in powerful females as compared to powerful males in the canon series. Pottermore can try to patch that up, but it's far more telling that we don't see as many important witches as wizards in the series, and one of the most prominent witches is a house wife, and the next most prominent a teacher. The vast majority of the Death Eaters are wizards as well.

The leader of a dark army would be considered the Dark Lord or Dark Lady, as such, there can be more than one Dark Lord at any given time.

****** I've always taken it as indicative of Voldemort being a different /kind/ of threat to previous dark wizards. Why is it, for example, that Dumbledore describes Voldemort as the most dangerous dark wizard of all time, when one would imagine that Grindelwald caused more damage?

(We don't know what Grindelwald did exactly, but if the wizarding conflict he generated was a magical equivalent of WWII it would have been huge).

The answer presumably lies in the idea that Voldemort is something new. Grindelwald was essentially a politician who also happened to be a dark wizard. He didn't seek to renounce his humanity or identify himself as some kind of embodiment of dark magic. For him dark magic was merely a tool to reach his political ends and personal desires, and maybe this has been true of all the other dark wizards in history.

Then Voldemort comes along with an ambition that no dark wizard has contemplated before: to transcend their humanity, becoming some kind of eternal godlike figure who not only uses dark magic but somehow is its avatar. Essentially it's the difference between human evil and the kind of supernatural evil you find in stuff like The Lord of the Rings. Voldemort wants to become something like Sauron. That's why he's the most dangerous dark wizard of all time.

Meanwhile, because Grindewald had no such a grandiose title and there was no taboo (presumably), there was no reason for any epithet like that to happen.

Correction: A family being extinct in the male line does not mean the financial system (Gringotts in this case) gets to do whatever with their holdings. As long as Harry or Tom Riddle can establish a paper trail (or magical equivalent - the Gringotts key is one) of inheritance, they should be able to access said inheritance barring time-based expiration laws. They can't access the vaults because they can't provide the paperwork, not because the families are extinct.

No, it wouldn't. Because they too would have established /inheritance/, i.e. proof that the property in question was bequeathed to them or to a direct ancestor.

If my father died tomorrow, I could step forward and claim his assets in the absence of a will (and my mother not contending). If neither of us claimed his assets, one of my children (likely my firstborn) could make a solid case for them, which would be stronger if I make a will bequeathing all of my assets to him, which arguably includes those I was to inherit from my father. And so on and so forth, with each claimant's case weakening down the line since they have to do more and more work to prove that they should inherit (as well as contend with more and more claimants with equally strong cases). Eventually it devolves into an elaborate system of percentages whose size depends on the strength of your claim and the tenacity of your lawyer.

I see no reason why wizarding inheritance should be any different.

******* I like your reasoning behind Alice, but I'm going to add a bit on Marlene because it's a trope that recently started bothering me.

I think Lily and Marlene were friendly, yes, but not very close friends - more of a close acquaintanceship through the Order perhaps. We know Lily 'cried all night' when she heard the McKinnon's were killed, but Lily's super emotional and prone to crying anyways (literally every other scene involves her being teary eyed). Plus, the first time she spoke of Marlene's death to Sirius (in her letter), it was wedged in between idle gossip about Harry, Wormtail's visit, and Bathilda Bagshot, which to me suggests that neither Sirius nor Lily were very close to Marlene.

As a comparison, I can't imagine Hermione mentioning Ginny or Neville or even Luna's death so offhandedly to Harry, though perhaps she would if it were, say, Terry Boot, or Padma Patil. Someone they both knew and were friendly with, but not really /friends/ with.

Plus, like you said about Alice being a well-respected Auror, Marlene (or at least her family - which could include spouse and child(ren) or her parents and siblings) was also well-respected. Somewhere in the books it mentioned Voldemort killing some of the most powerful/best wizards and witches: 'the Bones', the Prewetts, the McKinnons.' Anyways, I've gone off on a tangent now.

Tl;dr: Marlene probably wasn't one of Lily's close friends, and definitely not Sirius' girlfriend because of how offhandedly her death was mentioned by Lily.

No mention of the Bones family. And even if there was a mention of the Bones family, the default assumption would surely be that it was referring to the death of Edgar Bones (Susan's uncle), his wife and children i.e. the same Bones family that is referred to in the OotP passage quoted above.

For completeness sake, here's where we get Edgar's name:

#+begin_quote
  “That's Edgar Bones... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard... Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young...

Elphias Doge, you've met him, I'd forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat... Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes... budge along, budge along...”
#+end_quote

People seem to have made the assumption that there were just two Bones siblings: Amelia and Edgar. But we know from the OotP passage above that Edgar was Susan's uncle, which means there had to have been at least three: Edgar, Amelia, and Susan's father.

JKR admits this was a case of her being influenced by fandom.

Rule 1: Add 's to indicate possession. E.g. "Harry's wand."

Rule 2: If the word already ends with an s, just add '. E.g. "James' wand."

It doesn't have anything to do with singular and plural per se. It just so happens that almost all plurals end in "s" so follow rule 2 (because in English you generally add an s to create a plural).

This isn't always the case, however. "People" is plural but doesn't end with an s, so we follow rule 1, e.g. "the people's choice".

In the case of the map, there are two choices:

A. The Marauder's Map (canon version)

B. The Marauders' Map

In A, we have a singular marauder and have added 's under rule 1. In B, we have plural marauders and have added an ' under rule 2. So in A, the map is a map that belongs to a single marauder, whereas in B, it is a map that belongs to a group of marauders.

********** Does it really?

We don't know how exactly it would differ because an animal is not the same as a chair, but there's enough stuff that is “almost animagus transformation but not quite” (just in the fourth book, we have the thing with Draco as a ferret and we have Krum's half-shark ... thing) in the series to make it clear that no, changing your body into a different form via transfiguration is not unique to the animagi.

And there are also instances of animagi changing forms without the use of a wand (because that's the only way they can change back since they can't use wands as animals), and it's canon that Sirius changed into his dog form in Azkaban which he did without access to a wand; since being an animagus is not a talent one is born with, clearly it is something one has to learn, for Peter had to use a wand to change into a rat so we know it's not an innately wandless ability.

Not to mention that we don't know what exactly are the problems with being an animagus. We do know that the process involves keeping a mandrake leaf in one's mouth for a month, and ... something else, with some or much learning included. It is different from self-transfiguration, but we do not know how exactly it differs, and it is not an impossibility that the process of changing back would be similar enough to the process of reversing a self-transfiguration that leaves one too different from the normal state to be able to use a wand; it might be similar, or it might not be, and we don't really know as of yet.

So what I am claiming is “we don't know much but what we know points to it not being an impossibility that he could be capable of wandlessly reversing a human-to-inanimate transfiguration on himself, /that one/ specific human-to-inanimate transfiguration” but it may also simply be a possibility that the spell he cast on himself was one specifically cast so that he could dispel it as he wished even without getting a hold on his wand. Do remember that reversing or dispelling a spell that you yourself cast might actually count as “simple magic”, even if the spell you are doing it to doesn't.

Yes, which is clearly within the limits of standard transfiguration. What we do know about the animagus transformation tells us that these are two very different processes.

Really, all I' saying is that, in Slughorn's case, either he's performing a difficult and probably obscure form of magic sans wand to reverse a transfiguration, or he did something much simpler, that is, gave himself merely the appearance of an armchair, rather than its form. I'm not saying it's impossible to do as you've suggested, just unlikely and not necessary to explain what we know.

***** Petunia swings a frying pan at him, but to be honest it's such a throw away sentence and Harry dodges it so easily I've always interpreted it as more of a threat than a genuine attempt to hit him.

The only times where it points to actual physical abuse is from Vernon. He threatens Harry by telling him he'll "get the stuffing knocked out of him", but, again, Harry doesn't seem intimidated at all, he doesn't take it seriously. Harry also mentions that you have to have a good sense of when to duck around Uncle Vernon, and he's known to throw things. Also, in OOTP, Vernon grabs Harry by the neck, but Harry seems quite startled by this, so I don't think it was a common thing.

Don't get me wrong, there are definite examples of Harry being treated terribly. He definitely was abused, but you see fics describing child Harry as covered in bruises and welts, or him talking about getting beaten with a belt and so on. There's little to no evidence this happened in canon.

Also, I don't buy into the "they starved him" thing either. Yes, he was small and skinny and wasn't able to eat as much as Dudley, but this is more likely to be "you can't have pudding" than "you can't have any food". In PS, he serves himself bacon, and they don't seem to care how much he serves himself, and there are several examples of him sneaking food from the fridge. When they do take food from his a punishment, they enforce it very poorly. There is also a line in the books where it says "The Dursley's had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been able to eat as much as he liked."

*** About arithmancy as a method of spell creation, I can see it being used in the process of creating spells, as it is described as a more precise method of telling the future.

I see it as a way to sort through all the "bad" ways to do a spell. You do arithmancy on a spell concept you want and if the result isn't favorable you move on to another one.

But I see that as only one application of arithmancy. I like how The fic Do Unto Others linkffn(8625440) does arithmancy.

***** James is described as tall in Voldemort's thought, when he has a flashback after the Bathilda Bagshot episode. And Harry was at his father's height in the Ressurection Stone scene.

**** Genetics. He's the same size as James and grows up to be as tall as him; plus at fifteen (after his first growth spurt) Harry is 'within an inch or two' of sixteen year old James' height.

Also, canonically, the Dursleys did /not/ starve him, they just didn't let him eat 'as much as he wanted.' I suppose it may depend on your interpretation, but to me that means he was not malnourished, yet was also not allowed to stuff himself (another case of Dudley getting more than Harry). Even in CoS Harry was given three meals a day. Plus several years of an all you can eat buffet at Hogwarts would counter any effect his childhood feeding had.

*** Is there any canon evidence to suggest that smaller people make better Seekers? I understand that in horse-jockeying and stuff, you want a smaller person because of weight distribution, but I don't recall any evidence suggesting that brooms work by the same logic. Case in point: all the Weasleys, who are naturally tall, are either implied or explicitly stated to be great flyers, no different than Harry.

In fact, I'd think you would likely want a tall person for being a Seeker because they have an easier time of catching a snitch when in a duel with another seeker, simply by having greater wingspan.

**** Oliver Wood calls Harry the right build for a seeker, which is what he's referencing here I believe.

**** /Skinnier/ people make for better seekers, as that gives you the same reach for less weight. Additionally, people who are skinny even though they eat and train generally tend to be more agile and nimbler, as their muscles often get strength to match what is required not by increasing in size but rather by increasing in speed at which they work (and by working in bursts in the moment when they need all that power), which means that someone who is naturally slim may have that split second advantage over a stockier person.

That probably was what Wood was talking about. But no, /shorter/ people don't have much advantage there; limb reach also matters and that increases with height.
