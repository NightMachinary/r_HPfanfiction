Looking for any believable well written dark or morally grey Harry with Harry/Ginny as a pairing.

Please no Harems, don't like them.

Any rating is fine, would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am also fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.

Would rather not have character bashing, it would be interesting finding a story that has very little to no character bashing with this concept.
