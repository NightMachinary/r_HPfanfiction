We all talk about how books that include cliches such as lordships, Potter wealth, nice goblins, indy!Harry etc. are badly written and all, but surely there must be at least some decent ones that address these tropes in a way that is done well...

But why don't we like them? Is it just because most of them aren't well written? Because they're overused (as the title says)? Because some of them use bashing as an excuse to exclude or demonize a character that they don't want to be a huge part of the plot?

Despite the flack these tropes get, I would have thought that some of them would be more popular than they are - I mean, they give excuses to being new characters into the storyline, allow for characters to unlock potential that wasnt explored, create interesting plots, allow for more thorough world building.

For example, the lordships and wealth that Harry usually discovers (commonly followed by Dumbledore/Weasleys/Hermione stealing from his vaults) give the opportunity to explore more about the social hierarchy of the wizarding world and politics, something that - other than bribery - isn't really touched upon in canon.

These tropes are huge opportunities for exploring different aspects of the wizarding world that could be really interesting when done well.

So, have you ever read a fic that uses those cliche tropes that seem like they might be terrible, but writes them well?

I don't think the Greater Good Dumbledore is done very well, but the story is still excellent despite it so... yeah.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** OK, I will suggest a very weird book for reading. [[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140909][The Mind of the Maker by Dorothy L. Sayers]] (yes, the author of detective stories with Lord Peter Wimsey) is one of the best books on the art of writing stories I have ever read. Yes, it is on its face a theological pamphlet on the Trinity, and given that, it will probably unpalatable for some, but underneath the theological is also an absolute gem of the literary theory by somebody who actually knows a thing or two about writing. Highly recommended.

Coming from this book, I would suggest that there is some kind of spirit or atmosphere of HP universe, and book or story violating this spirit will feel wrong. For example, I am firmly persuaded that any crossover between HP books, which are in my opinion rather pedestrian, egalitarian, realist, modernist and quite rationalist, and semi-mystical/super-natural universe (e.g., Marvel-type superheroes, or vampires) is by its substance doomed to fail, because these two universes have too different spirits to mesh together. Similarly, the very idea of the feudal (or even earlier) highly unequal society in the twentieth century HP universe is in my opinion doomed to fail. The same goes for Harry Potter being ultra-rich (meaning, owning ridiculously large part of the Great Britain).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Each has a mix of all three tropes, but those're probably the main ones they subvert or use well.

*** Novocaine wasn't really inheritance per se. It was more of a "They pledged themselves to Voldemort, and since I killed him- right of conquest." To the victor go the spoils?

It also subverts the whole "We killed Voldemort, now everything is fine!" endings. Novocaine goes heavily into the economic rebuilding, some of the political fallout, and other things after the fall of Voldemort.

**** Yeah, you have a point. I've always associated it with the Inheritance Trope genre due to the immense amount of random crap he gets. It's got that kind of "I own half the Wizarding World... now what?" sort of vibe to it that I see as wholly entwined with the Inheritance genre.

You're right about the Perfect Epilogue subversion too. It's interesting to see a post-war thing like that going on. What does the 'Happy Ever After' look like and all that.
