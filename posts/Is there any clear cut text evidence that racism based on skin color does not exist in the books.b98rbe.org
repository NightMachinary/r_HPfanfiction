I somewhat find it hard to believe that wizards are racist towards blood status but aren't racist towards actual race.

Also, this book is written from Harrys POV. How much racism is a white male in the 1990s going to notice?

I can maybe see wizards being more accepting of Asians and black people but as more of a hierarchical nature. Like purebloods would prefer a marriage of their child to another white pureblood but a black pureblood > a white halfblood or muggleborn.


** I'm sure it exist but probably not to muggle extent. Wizards are to busy being prejudice towards beings that aren't actually human. Elves, goblins, centaurs, giants.

Off the top of my head I'm thinking of the non-white male characters...

Kingsley Shacklebolt - respected Auror, becomes Minister of Magic

Cho - pretty popular, dated Cedric, crushed on by Harry

Angelina - popular, marries George

Lee Jordan - popular, part of the twin's group of friends

Patil twins - ?? maybe not all that popular? they were still available for Harry/Ron at the Ball

Outside the books. Was Blaise ever written as black or was that a movie thing? MACUSA President is a black woman.

*** Blaise was also described as black in the books too. Paraphrasing HBP, he was described as a "tall, black boy". He was also reasonably intelligent, as he had his copy of Advanced-Potion Making for Slughorn's NEWT Potions class, showing he got an Outstanding on his Potions O.W.L. He also wasn't a dumb follower like Crabbe and Goyle, or to a lesser extent, like Pansy.

Dean Thomas was also a black boy too. He was also decently popular as he dated Ginny in HBP, and played a notable part in DH while the Trio were on the run.

As for the Patil twins, the interesting thing is that Dean described them as the two best-looking girls in their year during the Yule Ball. Now, beauty is subjective but even if it was merely Dean's opinion, the implication is that both of the Patil sisters are better-looking than most of the girls in Harry's year. What Dean was saying is that he was surprised that Harry and Ron actually managed to get the two best-looking girls in their year, and that he's surprised they were even available at all.

Also, one interesting thing I didn't consider until recently is Leta Lestrange. Granted, the Fantastic Beasts movies aren't technicallyt canon to the books (especially given the contradiction of McGonagall's age), but I think some would say that the non-contradictory aspects of the Fantastic Beast films (i.e. anything involving Newt, Dumbledore, and Grindelwald) are canonical to the books. As long as something was written by Rowling and doesn't directly contradict something from the books, then it could be considered canonical (e.g. Lupin's backstory on Pottermore, like how Dumbledore first met Lupin as a child). I don't remember whether Leta's mother or father was black, but depending on how her family lines go, its possible that Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange could have been either black or mixed-race.

That would, of course, depend on their exact genetic relationship to Leta, and on who exactly the Lestrange brothers' parents and grandparents were. Because if Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange are either black or mixed-race (based on Leta Lestrange being mixed-race), then it would mean Bellatrix married a non-white man. Granted, she obviously is love with Voldemort more than her own husband, but then why marry Rodolphus out of all people? Perhaps she once loved him but then gradually lost interest in him as their relationship continued. Perhaps she only married him because it was an arranged marriage, thus never loving him in the first place (unlike the genuine loving relationship between Lucius and Narcissa, or that of Ted and Andromeda).

Now if Bellatrix married a non-white man, and none of the Death Eaters actually cared about Rodolphus and Rabastan's race (assuming the two were black or mixed-race), then nobody in the wizarding world would care. Personally, I think that the only witches and wizards who would be racist based on skin colour would be the muggleborns.

Even then, most of that would be muggle-born children being influenced by their muggle parents and the muggle world. If a muggle-born child had a racist background, they might be influenced by some of their parents' racism and emulate it. As Ted Tonks and Hermione prove, muggle-borns would be assimilated into the wizarding world by the time they are in their later Hogwarts years, and would certainly have fully assimilated by the time they are an adult. Case in point: Hermione and Ted both married pure-bloods, and Hermione went to work in the Ministry of Magic. So every muggle-born would have got jobs in the wizarding worlds, most would end up marrying a witch or wizard, and some of them would work for the Ministry of Magic.

So I'd expect the only witches and wizards being racist based on skin colour to be just the muggle-borns, and that would mainly be only during like their first Hogwarts year at most. I'd imagine most muggle-born with racist attitudes would drop that racism entirely within their first year or two, and certainly by the time they are adults.

*** So according to hp wiki, blaise doesn't seem to have been described as explicitly black

#+begin_quote
  The surname Zabini is Italian and Portuguese. Blaise may be of Italian or African descent, given that the East African country of Mozambique, whose official language remains Portuguese, was under Portuguese colonial rule from the fifteenth century until 1975.

**** Not having evidence of something is reason enough not to believe it for me. To state that something is possible, you must prove it. If there doesn't seem to be a possibility, then it is safe to say it that the negative claim doesn't work.

I can't prove that you don't have any undetectable pink unicorns, but if you can't show that there is a possibility of it, then I am completely justified in not accepting you do. Depending on the exact claims, I may even be justified in saying you do not.

***** That's fine, but it's not what I was getting at with the comment. I was talking about the logical nature of proofs. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

It is possible to show positive proof that something does in fact exist. For example, someone says, prove to me that cats exist. You then provide a physical cat as an example and proof. Boom - cat's exist and there's proof to show it.

But you can't show proof for a negative. If someone says, prove to me cats don't exist - you can't provide evidence of a non-existent cat. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't mean that you must hold that they do exist. Rather, it means that you can't /prove/ they don't. If you can never find even one cat to provide evidence for their existence, then you can say that it's likely or probable that they don't exist, however, that's not really proof. If only one cat is discovered at some point in time, that would definitively disprove the theory of their non-existence.

OP asked for /evidence/ that something doesn't exist. It's logically impossible for such evidence to exist. You can't have positive evidence to prove a negative theory. But that doesn't mean that their point is wrong and that racism isn't absent from magical society - only that you can't really show any proof for that fact. You can say something like, "There's no evidence in the HP books that there is any discrimination based upon race in magical society." But, if JKR decides to write another book at some point and she writes that Draco didn't like Dean because of his skin color, then that one example would throw the absence of racism theory out the window.

** Try this on for size. JK Rowling is not a racist (AFAIK), and in fact made the battle against prejudice one of the main themes in the book. Rowling didn't want to convey racial prejudice in her books and goes out of her way to avoid it. Instead, she uses blood purity superiority as a proxy for racial superiority. It would only muddy the waters and therefore defeat the purpose if she were to pile racial prejudice on top of that.

I agree that when looking at the books from the perspective of the world itself, it does seem strange that racial prejudice isn't a serious problem in the wizarding world. However, like practically every contentious HP canon issue, it always comes back to Rowling and how she strong armed canon into telling the story her way, even when logic gets in the way.

*** Yeah I guess that makes sense. I never liked her stand in of blood purity as a metaphor for racism. It completely ignores the complexities of real racism.

Other than voldemort murdering a ton of muggle borns in book 7, I never felt that being muggle born was that much of a hindrance as compared to being black or hispanic in the US. And honestly support for Voldemort is very low obviously and would have likely resulted in outright rebellion if he hadnt been using thicknesse as a puppet.

We mostly see hermione face racist BS from the slytherins who are terrible. I kind of wish we had seen more subtle forms of racism against her like micro aggressions by non slytherins and "good" characters. The only thing I can think of is when people sent her hate mail in book 4 after rita skeeters article. I think its implied it was more aggressive because of her blood status, though debatable. And also I think Horace slughorn when describing lily kind of does a micro agression when mentioning her being muggle born.

Except that blood purity and the Death Eaters/Umbridge are pretty much a carbon copy of the Nazis, something she manages to convey pretty well, if child friendly. And you can't really get more racist then them other than perhaps WWII Japan. I mean:

- Snatchers = Gestapo/SD

- Muggleborn laws = Nürnberg laws

- Deportations to Azkaban = Deportations to various concentration camps

- Death Eaters = Sturmabteilung/Schutzstaffel

- The Order Radio Station = BBC in occupied Europe

- The Order winning in the end after being soundly defeated = The Western allies

- Voldemort only being defeated after his entire army fell = Hitler only dying during the last days when all was lost

- The Malfoys avoiding prison = High ranking Nazis escaping justice

- Draco being treated as if his war crimes never happened = the polite ignorance of atrocities in postwar Germany as long as you were not to high up the chain of command

** The only instances of racism I can think of seems to be more based on nationality than race. With Rons aunt Muriel looking down on Fleur for being French(which is pretty interesting considering she is only part human)

#+begin_quote
  “. . . and your hair's much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin's beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?” she barked at Harry. “Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.” “Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn't Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?” “No --- he couldn't come ---” “Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. *I've just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,” she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She's a good-looking girl, but still --- French.* Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.”
#+end_quote

and the Death Eater Travers being barely willing to touch Ron whom he thought to be from Transylvania.

#+begin_quote
  Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. “Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.” “This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. *“He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.”* “Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?” “ 'Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand. *Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of dirtying himself.* “So what brings you and your --- ah --- sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers. “I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione. “Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.”

** The community is a small British community. I imagine that race isn't as big a deal when there may only be a few dozen people of a different race. If there was racism, then there are probably bigger issues than that.

Maybe even magical roots from Africa and Asia make it kinda silly to be racist given how they are basically the original witches and wizards. That's just my own bit of head-canon. It would be more against their bigotry to be racist against their tradition and ancestry?

**** A lot of white people don't worshipfully look at their magic and heritage. The thing is that these wizards would have a very direct and everyday connection. This is just my headcanon too as I imagine "dark magic" to be basically ancient magic. Given the worship for ancient magic in this case, it would be a bit daft to discriminate against those who have ancestry who were just like them. Their focus is less on race and more on magic.

I'm sure racism could still persist. Racism is usually caused by ignorance and ignorance would be an easy way to not know the above. As I've tried to make clear, this is my headcanon.

** There is no “actual race.” Race is a social construct. There's no inherent reason to sort people of various skin colors, hair textures, nose shapes etc into the particular racial categories we've sorted them into. Our divisions between racial categories are there for historical reasons, not biological ones.

I see no evidence that anyone other than muggleborns (or muggle-raised like Harry) even has the muggle concept of race. The Shacklebolts are listed in the Sacred 28 like any other pureblood family. (I assume they recently immigrated from elsewhere, or they would look more like the rest of the inbred British purebloods. I've said they're from the Kingdom of Aksum in my fic. They brought their privileged blood status with them when they moved.)
