Harry Potter and the Perils of the Unknown is a pre-HBP book 6 which was very popular at its time. Now going over it, it seems pretty poorly written but it works for angsty teenagers I suppose. However it does have a pretty awesome plot twist where Luna is revealed to have been faking her quirky persona and had been recruited by the Death Eaters. That was pretty heartbreaking.

  Warning OotP Spoilers. Harry starts his sixth year at Hogwarts, but he's in for some surprises. He's going to learn the true story of his parents and learn to deal with loss. There might be a little romance and adventure. Related to my JL fic. Complete!
