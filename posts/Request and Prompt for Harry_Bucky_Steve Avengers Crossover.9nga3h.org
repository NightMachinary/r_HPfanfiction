Beyond just wanting to know about any fics featuring this triad that are out there I've actually got them on the brain because of an idea that will not leave me alone and I have no time to actually write.

​

The idea is a mates AU either soulmates or A/B/O mates or what ever shape they come in people can see/interact with other people and form an instant bond. Steve and Bucky were mates. After Steve went down in the ice Hydra thought they wouldn't have to worry about anything being able to break through Bucky's conditioning. They didn't consider that Bucky and Steve might not have had a monogamous bond and there was a possibility of a another waiting to mess with their plans. While out on a mission The Winter is distracted by finding another mate. Imagine Hydra's frustration when their asset disappeared with this mate before they can bring him in. Over the coming years Harry and Bucky work to get Bucky healed so they can take hydra down. Imagine their surprise when the third member of their triad shows up on the news very much not dead and fighting off an alien invasion.

​

Any fic with the pairing would thrill me but if someone wants to adopt this idea I'd be ecstatic.
