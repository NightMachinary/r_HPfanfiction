So obviously Hermione doesn't play Quidditch but IF she were to, what position do you think she'd possible play?


** This topic is like asking, "So, obviously Umbridge hates werewolves, but if she didn't hate werewolves, which werewolf would she love the most?"

**** Thank you very much for those unbelievably horrifying images. I will now go and drown out my screams of terror in a vat of water while simultaneously bludgeoning myself with the nearest and heaviest object I can find. Hopefully the combined trauma and unconsciousness may remove this diabolical comment from memory.

** Coach/trainer.

She can learn all the theory from books, even subscribe to some sort of magazine or newsletter. Then she can boss people around while helping them be better at what they do! It's perfect for her!

But actually on the field...hmm, not enough daring for seeker, not really vicious enough for a beater, and tends to freeze under stressful situations (huh, like Ron) so not keeper. She's good at teamwork and planning, so chaser, I suppose.

** IIRC they actually did stick her at Keeper during that pickup four-a-side Quidditch at the Weasleys one summer, (book 5 or 6, I think?) and she was predictably terrible.

** I imagine Beaters need a lot of upper body strength, so probably /not/ that. Maybe a Keeper?

** Bookie. The magical world doesn't seem to have any laws against that sort of thing, so she could probably be talked into it. Most people seem to trust her enough to hold bets, and she seems like she'd be pretty good at calculating the odds.

Has her using math to predict Quidditch wins. Only a small part of the story though.

** I don't think she'd fit anywhere regardless. Hermione would have more success playing as centre half against Zinedine Zidane than playing any position in quidditch.

** If the girl's hockey team at my old school was anything to go by then she'd fit right in as a beater.
