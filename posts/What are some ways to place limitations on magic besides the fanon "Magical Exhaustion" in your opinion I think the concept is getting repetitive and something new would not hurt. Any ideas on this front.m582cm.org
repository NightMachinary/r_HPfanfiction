#+TITLE: What are some ways to place limitations on magic besides the fanon "Magical Exhaustion" in your opinion? I think the concept is getting repetitive and something new would not hurt. Any ideas on this front?

** When you cast a spell, you send a piece of your magic out into the world with goals and instructions to come home when it's done. But it remembers an echo of its goals after it comes home, and keeps trying to achieve them for a while. Cast enough of one class of spells and they'll begin to warp your magic to produce more effects like that. The worst are emotionally fueled spells. The killing curse remembers wanting to attack souls, and damages the caster's soul too. The patronus charm is impossible to cast right the first time, because it only works for people with their magic already warped by numerous unsuccessful castings (side effects may include choosing non-lethal spells when you really should be trying to kill some fucker). But even something simple like flame spells can cook you to death if you cast too many too fast and are unlucky.

** Competent Wizards are rare:

- Most Ministry employees can't put a decent Shield Charm
- Many don't want to or can't apparate, but rely instead on Broom, Floo, and Knight Bus
- Few can brew advanced potions such as Polyjuice, Amortentia, and Veritaserum
- Even fewer can cast the Patronus Charm

** That concept was never good to begin with.

Limitations: The same as how even a very skilled pianist can't play forever, despite only moving his fingers. Concentration, effort, focus, there isn't unlimited supply of those. It's natural-y limited.

** I like an idea I've seen around where human flesh is an imperfect conductor of magical energy. Overuse doesn't lead to exhaustion, it leads to getting a bit crispier than you might prefer. Casting gets hard when you get burns on your nervous system.

** The human mind can only handle so much... weirdness. Magic is, by definition and partly necessity, a dangerously weird thing. That's why it's often called unnatural, or evokes cries of "but that's impossible!". Physics, Conservation of Energy, all of those things we see magic making a mockery of, mean nothing. Use too much magic, and your mind starts to buckle under the strain of processing the impossible occurring, not just before your eyes, but by your command.

** Canon already has the the Trace, anti-apparition spells, spell difficulty, your wand type, how talented and experienced your opponent is compared to you, dementors, being wandless, house elf magic being more powerful, etc.

If anything, wizards don't seem powerful enough. They don't need more weaknesses.

** for things like more complex transfiguration and charms I could see that the constant focusing on multiple concepts, complex theory and hand eye/vocal coordination would give you an absolutely killer migraine after a few spells, or you start losing focus over time and your spells become sloppier and sloppier, (this can also work to explain why the big bad death eaters etc always seem to be yelling their spells in fights, while it may be useful for the first few surprise spells, trying to hold that kind of concentration in an actual duel would be like trying to recite shakespeare backwards while in a pub brawl)

** Make it so some things are undoable by common magic such as Gamps Law of Transfiguration or the impossibility of resurrecting dead.

Make Ä±t so most magical artefacts cannot be crafted by human hands no matter what or materials required in their creation are rarer than iridium or no longer exist. For example creation of a pensive requires it to be tempered in fiend-fire and then cooled down in the tears of a parselmouth or something and Dumbledore's pensive was an antique passed down from Salazar Slytherin to other headmasters.

Make it so messing up magic leads to gruesome and undesirable consequences. For example messing up a charm that summons rain causes person to inflate with water until they blow up.

Make it so many forms of magic is irreversible so people don't want to use it much. in fear of making life shattering mistakes. maybe Obliviation cannot be reversed so Hermione's parents are fucked or vanished things cease to exist and cannot be re acquired.

Make it so people can curse spells to make them unusable to other peoples. Maybe this is why old families always inbreed and there is fifthy different variations of the cutting charm.

Make it so except small acts of magic most magic take something from people. For example using a memory to fuel a patronus makes that memory less happy until it no longer makes you feel happy.

Just use your imagination and expand the list.

** Magic is limitless, the human body however is not

The body of a witch or wizard is used to channel the raw magic from the aether into the physical world in the form of spells and enchantments however much like a house electrics, forcing too much energy will either trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse

In this case the circuit breaker would be their body, essentially forcing them into a coma to recover from a surge of raw magic with physical damage inflicted such as nerve scarring and burns etc

As for those unlucky ones who blew the fuses, they now constantly hunger for the spark that once shone so brightly inside them but now only exists in others, though their actual names are long lost to history, we now simply know them as Dementors

** It depends how you choose to build the system of magic in your fic. Since there's not much cannon-wise, you could give your characters magical cores, which refill from ambient energy, or something else. (My crossover fic basically uses the idea of you have so much magic within you, when that's gone you're done casting till you recover, but how much magic you have can be increased in a number of ways, like hard work.)

**** Linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

I basically use the crossover's magic system to fill in the holes of HP's. For the most part they fit together really well, I'm basing it around the idea that the other world has a *lot* more ambient magic, so their 'brand' of magic is more wasteful/energy intensive, while HP's and wands in particular are much more precise and efficient. Lots of worldbuilding, and a unique origin of the Deathly Hallows in Chapter 19.

** Exercising magical power is like exercising muscles. You have to keep up the training, do reps of increasingly more demanding âweights.â Just like not everyone has the dedication, talent, and ambition to excel in sport not everyone has what it takes to be an incredible witch or wizard. People would tend to specialize, or get really good at the spells they do at work everyday while letting a lot of other stuff they learned in school atrophy. I think this would prevent the âmaster of the universeâ syndrome since to be an expert at one branch of magic you'd naturally have to let the other branches slide even if you're a generally talented magician. With a parallel to professional sports, most players at that level are amazing at one sport, maybe generally good athletes but not amazing at anything else.
