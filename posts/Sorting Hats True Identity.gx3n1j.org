It is common knowledge among those who read hogwarts a history, that the Sorting Hat once belonged to Gordic Griffindor. What most people dont know however, is that is not true.

Godric Griffindor was many thing in life. He was impulsive, carefree and was quite the pervert. But above all else, he was a master at the art of transfiguration. It is rumored that he even found a way to circumvent the gamps law and it is known that he did circumvent the law of equivalent exchange four hundred years before Nicholas Flamel.

Above all else, he was a master of self transfiguration. It was not an uncommon sight to see him take the shapes of various animals and get lost in the forest that surraunded the school, living months at a time as various denizens of the forest. He was so talented in self transfiguration, just like how parseltmouths of britain are thought to be descendants Salazar Slytherin, metamorphmagi of britain are tought to be descendents of Godric Griffindor. of course, being able to turn into small critters made spying on woman easier too. So much so, Helga Hufflepuff created a new species of magical domestic cats called kneazles, just so they can identify Godric in his animagus forms and chase him away from the vicinity of her personal dorm room.

So it should not suprise you dear readers, when during his research on animagi of the Africa, Godric Griffindor not only discovered how to be any animal he wanted, He also learned how to turn himself into inanimate objects. His favored form was that of a raggedy old hat.

As time passed and he aged, Old Godric started spending more and more of his time as a dusty old hat. When his lover Rowena killed herself after hearing the fate of her daughter, Godric Griffindor turned into a hat and stayed that way.

He eventually got discovered by house elves of the castle in the room of lost things and was brought before the headmaster of the time. In the headmasters office, he claimed to be a creation of the four founders, used to sort students to their respective houses. His exact motives are still unclear to us; perhaps he wanted to be closer to the school and its students than he initially was, or perhaps living as an immobile hat for centuries caused him to lose his mind and identity. Or perhaps he is still as much a pervert as he was back in his time and wanted to look at the thoughts of the students. What is certain is, he has sorted the students ever since, and picked those he deemed the best to his house.


** This fits right in with my own headcanon, right along with the dubious motives.

From a plot bunny I still have in draft form, in which Hermione spends year 6 learning many of her newfound survival skills from a background Slytherin...

Slytherin OC: "It's insane that we allow a dark artifact to choose a residential faction for 11 year olds to live with for seven years. It's worse than a blood feud /and somehow it's also a blood feud/! Bonkers."

Hermione: "Dark artifact, yes that makes sense. I always thought the Hat was more like the Map, but its purpose is completely different."

Slytherin OC, filing away the mysterious Map comment for later: "Hermione, I don't think we are supposed to know the real purpose of the Sorting Hat. Does /Hogwarts, A History/ say anything about the origin of the Hat, other than it belonged to Gryffindor himself?"

Hermione fell silent and then slowly shook her head.
