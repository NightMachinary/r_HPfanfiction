** I am thinking on writing a MC OC, and never done so before. So you have to make a complete and well defined character. Also avoid him/her being related to anyone. Are you looking for a character at the trios time or different point in time?

*** I was thinking of the story happening somewhere around their 4th year. I mean, different schools are visiting, and i feel like it would be a good time to bring in a new character

**** OC from different school or from Hogwarts? Having his/her own plot and story or interfering with the trio? In their year or younger? Staying in canon or AU or single point of divergence?

It is easier to focus on your character when he/she is not constrainted by outside forces

** For Ginny, the easiest way would be to simply make Ron her twin. Other than either him being a year younger or her a year older, you don't have to change much, if anything.

Draco's sister would likely be just as much of a cunt as he is, only that she would be less likely to seek out confrontations with Harry since he is a boy.

Harry's sister is the most difficult to judge because a lot of the abuse which flew under the radar with Harry would be noticed if she was a girl (eg Dudley and his gang beating him up). So you could either have this result in less abuse for Harry since the sister protects him or have resentment because she does not get treated as badly as he does. It could also lead to some unhealthy dependency. Potters against the World by TemporalKnight goes down that route really well by showing them in a twisted incestuous relationship which everyone, including themselves, sees as wrong, but they are too broken to care.

As for general rules, don't make them overpowered. In fact, the more ordinary they are, the better. OCs are hated because they are often overpowered Mary Sues who have the whole plot revolving around themselves rather than blending into canon seamlessly.

** The best advice I ever got on writing characters was just to write everything you know about down, work out what niche you want them to occupy (ie. what purpose/role do they play in your story), then sit back and ask yourself questions about it. Like:

Why are they like that?

What might someone like that want? Why would they want that? What happened to give them that motivation, or to heighten/specify it?

What would they think about situation X?

What would they think about action Y?

What would someone meeting them for the first time think about them?

What might they be hiding?

What do they value? What do they not?

Who do they care about? Who do they hate?

(If they're not your main character) How do they know the protagonist? What's their relationship?

What would they do if A happened? How would they feel about what they did?

Do they have any distinguishing marks or features (eg. cheesy movie villain scar under the eye)? How did they get that feature?

And so on and so forth. Just keep following those questions (not just the ones I provided, I mean, but any questions that occur to you, if there's something you want to know about your character) where they lead until you feel you have a good understanding of who that character is as a person. That's basically what you want you're trying to do with a character - introduce them to your reader, then help them get to know them.

Oh, and you should write down the answers to those questions. You'll probably never use, mention, or even really allude to three quarters of it, but it'll help the stuff that does come up feel more real and like its part of a person, rather than just a collection of traits and characteristics. I tend to end up taking eight bulletpoints of personality, demeanour, behaviour, and attitudes and using those as my 'main character profile' to keep at my side whenever I'm writing that character, but your mileage may vary.

One of the most important things to remember about people is that everything within them interacts with something. There's nothing separate or distinct within you, it's all just parts of a whole. Sometimes those interactions will be synergistic - they'll work well together and make things greater (in the sense of bigger and of higher magnitude, synergy doesn't only affect the good stuff!) - and sometimes they'll interfere with or distort each other, which could hide motivations behind each other ("I want to do this because I'm angry at the world! No, no I'm not. I'm angry at you!") or give people doubts about things, or give them a 'time to find your bravery' type storyline.

So, yeah. Questions, answers, more questions about the answers, keeping in mind why you want this character to exist and that you want them to be a complete person.

EDIT - Also I very much second everything Floreat said. Consider this a "PREACH!" to that. :)

** Think about why a new character is necessary, how they can authentically get close to the main characters, and why the reader should care given that they have probably come to read characters and places familiar to them. This sounds harsh and obviously there /are/ some readers who want someone completely new, but for the most part writers of OCs have a mountain to climb in that fanfic readers don't want to read new characters and can resent feeling like a self insert has randomly been shoved in as a sibling/exchange student. It can absolutely be done well, but that purpose of the OC should be thought about very carefully.

** Spitballing, as I'm solidly a pantser, but I'd say think about at least 3 central motivations for the character that may sometimes conflict and one or two central flaws. once you get the personality down, then work on the backstory. What happened to the character, how did it affect them, and how did they respond?

Next, think about how the character views themself and how other characters view them.
