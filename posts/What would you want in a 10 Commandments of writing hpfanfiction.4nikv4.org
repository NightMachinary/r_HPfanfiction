** Don't mark a story as complete if it is not complete. (I'm looking at you, drabble collections that spam the recently updated complete list)

Spell the names correctly, based on whatever language you're publishing your story in. Lily only has two Ls. Stay consistent.

Do not put authors notes in the beginning, middle, and end of a chapter.

Do not shit talk other stories or authors in your author notes.

Do not try to extort reviews from readers by withholding content until X number of reviews are given.

Use the bottled tears and broken hearts from your readers wisely.

******* Oh, you're talking about setting up for character development. I see too many people go out of their way to criticize the canon character for the sake of setting up some cheesy moral or to completely eliminate their canon characterization. Others do it in order to poke fun at the author.

I think those types of criticism are bad - you're writing /fanfiction/, not a review. If you can't handle characters that are canon, you probably shouldn't be writing. That being said, if the author sets up the character for character development then it's all good.

What I hate is when they take a trait that's non-canon (like Ron being an /aggressive/ idiot, at age eleven, or the Dursleys being unrealistically abusive) and then use it as a soapbox for how awful the character is. Then, they give the character fake "character development" that involves overwriting what little of their canon personality remains and making them a Harry-worshiping loser.

** Thou shalt put in all the "thou shalt (not)s" thyself. Verily, he said. Nuncle.

- Grammar, punctuation and spelling. When your native language skills are worse than secondary language skills of foreign readers/writers, it's time to reconsider your pet project. Or improve your edumacation. It would also be nice to get the homophones right. Their/there/they're, your/you're, to/too, and even then/than. And no, homophone is not the same as homophobic.

- Beta reader. A good beta reader will catch many of your mistakes, both spelling and continuity. Even a bad beta reader helps. Get one good or two bad ones. This is non-negotiable.

- Get the names of characters, spells, magics and places right. No Luscious Malfoy, no Macgonagle, no Alohamora, no Legimancy, no Petronas, no Hogsmead. And definitely no Stupify. Parseltongue is the language, Parselmouth is the speaker of that language.

- Don't name spells after the incantation. It's the /killing curse/, not the "Avada Kedavra", or infinitely worse, the "AK". "Voldemort AK'd my parents." No, he did not.

- Refrain from walls of author's notes. They artificially increase word count and detracts from the story. In particular refrain from answering all kinds of reader's silly questions.

- Beware cute intros in each chapter. As much as I enjoyed (and still enjoy) a well-known author's writing and sincerely regret his passing, the "funny" disclaimers soon lost their attraction.

- Beware the rails of canon. Don't retell the original story, you can't improve on the original work by JKR. But when you deviate from the canon story, don't force the story to visit all the stations of canon. The /only/ acceptable reason for Harry to end up with Hedwig is for Hagrid to buy her and Harry to name her from a history book. Not Hagrid? Not a snowy owl. And don't try to "soul-bond" her to Harry to force him to buy her and then receive her name telepathically.

- Be careful with ships, they can sink an otherwise good story. If you want to float difficult ships, your writing and story line need to be right up there with JKR herself. Ships like Draco/Hermione, Snape/Harry, and Draco/Ginny are difficult to believe, and the writing needs to be top-notch to pull that off.

- Be /very/ careful with gender changes. Any and all gender changes need to be integral to the story to work. Turning Harry into Harriet must be a central plot point or the story will come across as the self-insert of a pre-teen female author.

- No MPREG, please. MPREG narrows down the number of potential readers like nothing else. You want readers? Then skip the MPREG.

- Don't use plot devices from other fanfictions. Spinning portkeys, anyone? That worked /once/. Portkeys! Don't! Spin!

** Ill write them in ranking from most to least important

- 1: Thou shall not undertake writing a story unless thou plans to finish it. (You start it, you should commit till the end)

- 2: Thou shall at least have some grasp of language and spelling, and if not, shall retain a beta (Some spelling and language mistakes are not a big deal, but if your story is so full of them it's hard to read... well....)

- 3: Thou shall understand the canon of a story before writing the story (really not a good idea to write fan fiction when you do not understand your subject matter, even if you are altering it massively)

- 4: Thou shall understand that you are writing for both yourself and your readers, and listen to their feedback (You dont have to like it, or accept it, but at least be civil and read it, and understand that there will always be trolls you have to ignore)

- 5: Thou shall have a complete story. (Basically don't write a full story, and then leave tons of loose ends or question marks or confusion... UNLESS you are writing sequels and have told your readers)

The above 5 are true for ANY FF. The next 5 are my personal ones for FF and HPFF (still in order of importance)

- 6: Thou shall not be afraid of rating when writing a story. (If your story needs to be M or MA, or Explicit, then let it be. A story is better when it does not censor itself to appease some site or certain vocal people)

- 7: Thou shall include all aspects into a story and not tunnel on one. (Action, Adventure, Romance, mystery... and so on. Don't pigeon hole your story into one area if you can help it)

- 8: Thou shall not do pairings that are stupid and unrealistic. (Ok look.. if you want to write it, go ahead. But come on... Hermione/Hagrid? or Snape/Harry?... you get the picture. Ones that are just so beyond belief like those and others, are just silly to do)

- 9: Thou shall not go so AU that the story ceases to be HPFF. (It doesn't mean your story is bad, but if you go so far off the AU path, its tough to consider it HPFF. An example is Emperor. Amazing story. Questionable HP FF story. You could insert other names, do a short background on magic at its start, and you would NEVER know it was related to HP in any way and it would read mostly the same.)

- 10: Thou shall finish your story. (YES ITS ON HERE TWICE. Its here twice because its the BIGGEST issue in FF in general, and especially a major issue in HP FF. I get that life sometimes gets in the way, but for gods sake at least say something to your readers, or offer it up to someone else to finish. So many good stories just die because of authors starting something they dont finish, and as an author myself I would NEVER want to do that to my readers. It would cause me physical pain. DON'T DO IT!)
