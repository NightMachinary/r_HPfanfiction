  Voldemort won't kill his Horcrux and Harry can't die any other way. Enter twenty years later and explore the new world. Told from Neville's POV but still very much Harry's story.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

  Harry never killed or tortured anyone, yet they convicted him for the crimes and sentenced him to life in Azkaban. His friends believe him guilty, the Ministry is more corrupt than anyone realizes and Voldemort is closing in. When the Order comes across info that only Harry can help them with, they need to furlough the prisoner for his help. Can they trust him? Can he trust them?

*** Does the Azkaban story feature everyone turning their back on him, him eventually escaping and then not being nearly as upset about it as he should, or everybody thinking they did nothing wrong? Or unnecessary deaths? Or the "revenge" being completely unsatisfying?

**** Not really, actually. Author tries to set it up so that the case against Harry was air-tight (but he's innocent) and his friends got slowly convinced by adults with manipulative interrogation techniques. He doesn't escape either. As for the rest, hasn't gotten that far. I don't see revenge deaths happening. Honestly, it's kind of an upsetting story because of the amount of frustration it causes, but the author really does seem to be trying to avoid most of the Azkaban tropes. I'm not sure it's actually possible, but I really like reading the effort.

***** Eh. I've finished what's there so far and I can't say I feel any different about this story than any other Azkaban story. It's honestly quite bad. We spend 100k words in angst and injustice, then get a very weak scene with Dumbledore finding out Harry's innocent. It's terribly unsatisfying.

Them believing Harry would turn to Voldemort is also honestly absurd, and I can't see how the story could possibly end in a satisfying way with all the terrible things said and done to Harry, especially given that the author seems to be going down the "Harry will forgive all" route.

** One of my favorites already is completed, and I can't recommend it enough. It's possibly one of the best characterizations of Snape, linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi). Another great one is linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere). It unfortunately doesn't have a regular update schedule, but the writing is phenomenal. I'm also going to shameless recommendation my own series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop). I aim to update every other week; sometimes that falls through since I'm currently at university.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** linkffn(8233291)

Quite dark (as one can see from the multiple warnings before chapter 1 starts) 4-book fem!Harry fic. Amazing world building, fascinating take on the magics, rituals etc. and on the light/dark divide, well developed interesting characters and very regular quality updates (not like that will matter in a few weeks as the only chapter left now is the epilogue). I enjoyed the fic very very much and it's definitely one of my all time favourites. Give it a go.
