** I read a story where that thing did happen. the thing is no one really understood how lily did it. And the problem was that anyone who survived the KC was not stupid enough to let people know they had a way of surviving it. Pretty sure it was the same story where it was told that a muggle survived the Dementors kiss. Apparently Dementors don't suck your soul out. They just get so close that you become so depresses that you lose the will to live and commit mental and spiritual suicide. Then they just suck your soul once it leaves your body through the mouth. The muggle in question was a priest who found the idea of suicide so against his beliefs that he withstood the dementors aura long enough that they gave up and looked for other food.

**** Not really. Just an intense staring contest. They don't kiss they just hover their faces near yours. No one gets close enough to see that. The good they wear is preventing anyone from seeing the act in question. They just open their mouth and catch the soul like it was a lugey. And before you say anything about that. Remember these are evil monsters that don't care about hygiene

** Or! Harry had a crib mobile with little mirrors in it, and Voldemort hit that, because James got him with a bad eyesight jinx. It reflected back, breaking in the process, and the bits of glass made the scar.

Alternatively, Lily had made an elaborate mirror set-up, which Voldemort didn't notice, because red eyes make for shit eyesight. He fired at a mirror reflection of Harry.

There's a physics problem with that.

The curse rebounded, so I assume you're saying that the mirror reflected the curse, since it's green light. However, light travels in a straight line. If the mirrors were angled so that light came from Harry and reflected at the exact angle to show his reflection to Voldemort, then the killing curse would follow the exact same path, but in the opposite direction, and still end up hitting Harry

** That is my preferred version of what actually had happened, because I'm quite turned off by all the passive sacrifices (by good guys) JKR is pushing in this series.

As for fics that has Lily putting up some dark and powerful rituals, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]] is a good example. Dumbledore later even modified it to destroy Voldemort Prime's soul without hunting down his other Horcruxes.

*** If you don't mind slash, "The most powerful magic" by cjr2 is a take on this.

Except that there was no ritual or freak accident. Harry is simply the most recent and best-known example of surviving a dark curse through the self-less sacrifice of a loved one.

** This is sort of the case in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290][Mutatum]]. (Let's hope that link-in-spoiler works, I've never tried it before.) Lily used a particular bit of dark magic that fell out of favor because of the strict requirements of the protection. It wasn't completely obscure, but it also isn't exactly the sort of thing Dumbledore would know about.
