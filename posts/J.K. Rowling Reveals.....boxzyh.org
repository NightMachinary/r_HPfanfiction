In a recent interview, J.K. Rowling revealed that Blaise Zabini, a friend and fellow Slytherin of Draco Malfoy, was meant to have a larger role in /Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/ as Harry's romantic rival. In /Half-Blood Prince/, Ginny, Ron's sister and Harry's love interest, is dating Dean Thomas early in the book. However, in an early draft, it was Zabini who Ginny was dating and acted as a romantic rival and antagonist to Harry. J.K. Rowling decided against this as she'd grown to like Dean's character and wanted him in a larger role, didn't think Ginny would ever date someone like Zabini, and disliked the cliche of the love interest dating a jerk.

Note: All of this is completely fake, so don't take it at all seriously. I just did this for fun.

** The fact that this reads like something she would say, says more about Rowling than anything else.
