Does anyone have any copies of these sorts of fanfiction they're willing to share? I remember there used to be quite a few good ones, but it appears they've been scrubbed off the Internet.

I'm looking in particular for Point Given's version of the story, from fanfiction.net but I'd be interested in any copies that don't bash any of the main trio of characters.

Please let me know! Thanks.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Author bookhater has completed all seven, though you have to email for copies. Here's a link to an AO3 account that still seems to be active to get them.
