For all of you who are involved in the Game of Thrones fandom anywhere online (Tumblr, Twitter, etc.), the shipping wars are becoming increasingly savage.

It is really giving me some serious flashbacks to how all the Ron/Hermione, Ginny/Harry, and Harry/Hermione shippers used to fight around when the books came out (esp Half Blood Prince).

Not super HP fanfic related, but its fun to reflect on how far are fandom has come and reminisce a little bit.

Edit: When I get home, I'll link some GoT fics if there is some interest. If you head out to do some of your own searching, Ao3 seems to have the best collection of fics from what I have discovered so far

Edit 2: Here are a few I have enjoyed:

******* I'll start with some crossovers. You've probably already been suggested these but oh well.

linkffn(The Black Prince) This is an extremely well written fic that features a character in Westeros that shares Harry Potters memories and in someways his identity. It's focused mainly on Harry's development and his quest to regain his full magical ability. Not only the best GOT crossover fic but one of the best fics on the site.

linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make) This one is linked a lot as well but I don't think it's as good as people say it is. It's well written, interesting and very clearly has a plan, but the plot is a bit dry and dull. Harry doesn't resemble very much the Harry from the books and in my opinion it doesn't have very much room to grow, considering the idea behind a civilization building fic.

linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock) This fic is fine. Nothing special. I would only read it if you have nothing else to read. Some of it is silly, rushed and seemingly written for how cool the author thought it would be. Example, giving the Lannisters Lions as a copy of the Stark's direwolves.

Moving on to non crossovers.

linkffn(Dragonstone by danivat) In my opinion one of the best GOT fics there is. Supremely well written and great world building. AU where Stannis dies and Robert is not in good graces with Ned after the rebellion. In order to get his friend back he legitimizes Jon and makes him the lord of Dragonstone. An amazing coming of age story featuring Jon as he realizes his true parentage.

linkffn(To go Forward by YourDailyPrescription) Jon goes back in time after being murdered by the Night's Watch and resurrected by Melisandre. Well written, interesting, and recently updated.

linffn(A Bane of Blood) Jon leaves Winterfell and Westeros from shame at his bastard status and feeling like he doesn't belong. Well written and recently updated.

  AU: After the death of his brother, Robert Baratheon needs a loyalist Lord on Dragonstone. He also really wants back in Ned's good graces. Or, the Game goes on after the Rebellions. The Starks still won't play, but everyone is playing the Game all around them, and Jon Sand has somehow become an important piece. Robert Baratheon, unknowingly, is the Targaryens' greatest asset.

** The shipping in the GoT fandom is really, really bad. You pretty much have to step through a minefield to even find a readable story. Like, Arya/anyone is not something I'm interested in at all, but there are loads of fics that have Arya/Gendry or Arya/Jaqen, when she's her book canon age. No thanks. And then you have Sansa/Sandor, Sansa/Tyrion, Sansa/Jon, and not a single one of those is appealing. Yet they happen in way too many fics.

The problem is that the world is so large, and there's so many characters all over the planet. In HP, it's super easy to avoid all the Harry/Draco and Hermione/Snape fics. But, in GoT, you have have a story that is good for 95% of it, then randomly shoves in Arya/Gendry and completely ruining it. There is one massive fic that is extremely guilty of this, but there are plenty of others that also suffer.

It's not even a matter of just finding a story with a ship you like. I don't really have a favorite ship (since that's not what GoT is really about), but just finding a story that doesn't have san/san or arya/anyone is hard enough, but then to find a story and also have it be interesting really feels like I'm asking too much.

******* Plenty of medieval high fantasy settings use incest. It is used as a parallel of real life, since it happened all the time historically. There are even overtones of it in HP with the "pureblood" philosophy. For more information, google the Spanish Habsburgs.

******** *House of Habsburg*

The House of Habsburg (; German pronunciation: [ˈhaːpsbʊʁk]), also called House of Austria, was one of the most influential and outstanding royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the 16th century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches.
