** See, the problem with fics like these is that they're clearly written with the intent of being messed up, and that completely destroys the novelty of it. There's nothing shocking about a fic that exists only to be shocking. That's why the fic about Dobby using his sock in sexual ways doesn't repulse me at all, because that's clearly what it's meant to do.

*** I'm pretty sure you can with RES, just hover over their username. You can also hide posts from a subreddit's page.

*** Yes, but unfortunately you still get a message like:

#+begin_quote
  __pers is an ignored user.show anyway?
#+end_quote

Unless you Hard Ignore, which causes more problems than it fixes.

*** Yes, Jesus Fucking Christ.

Want to know why that fic didn't disturb me at all?

The spelling and grammar were SO bad that I couldn't understand what was even going on.
