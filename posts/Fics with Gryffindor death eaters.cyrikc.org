LF fics where some of Harry's peers become death eaters, doesn't have to be in his year just students who went to hogwarts at the same time. Preferably not Ron.


** The Cupboard Series had a number of Gryffindor Death Eaters complicate things when the Diricawl Academy students were trying to save the Hogwarts students from Voldemort's domination. Cormac McLaggen was one of them.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** I always thought a gryphindor death eater would be pretty damn deadly if you went by stereotypes.

No ulterior motives, no worries about image, just pure action. He believes in the cause so damn much that he can justify any action, any evil done in the name of his beliefs. One who believes himself a hero.

That or Hermione the Death Eater. That would be cool if done right.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
