** Hmmm what about linkffn(Far too many time travelers)

That's the only one I can think of off the top of my head, though. This is a great request! I'd be excited to see what else is out there

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but linkffn(11502532) is a pretty good story where multiple characters besides Harry have special powers and make good use of them.

*** I find the "No Yaoi" disclaimer odd. It's like a jar of jam at the supermarket advertising "No tuna". Uh, yeah, I didn't think it was gonna, but now I'm a little sussed that you've gone and mentioned it specifically.

**** Based on a little trek to the author's profile, it seems that they were fed tuna jam in the past and thus think the “No tuna” advertisement to not be out of place.

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
