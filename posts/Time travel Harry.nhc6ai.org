:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic where Harry is sent back to marauder era. I remember in it he tells the potters and he and James play a prank on Sirius using their near identicalness. They also let dumbledoor in on it and he is very sorry for what he did to Harry in the future. Thought it was wind shear but was wrong.


** That's definitely Stepping Back

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
