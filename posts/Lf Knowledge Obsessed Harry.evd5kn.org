As the title says, any fic that has Harry completely obsessed with learning what he can, no restrictions on it. "The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance" sort of thing.

Don't particularly mind any tropes like WBWL or whatnot, as long as it's well written and the longer the better.

Cheers


** For the love of magic by Noodlehammer fits. It takes a bit of a turn about 3/4 of the way through getting a bit anti-religious and some people don't like that and it has a LOT of smut but overall I think it's worth the read. The author does a great job going in depth with magic.

*** I'm currently rereading that actually! I'd read it before and the constant 40k references amused me but it's only during this reading that I realised I wanted to see a more Ahriman influenced Harry. Thanks though

** Knowledge comes at a price by slayst on ff.net is a decent one, its a crossover with the Elder Scrolls series based in the Harry Potter Universe

Lily invokes Hermaeus Mora to protect her son that fateful night & has her soul taken to Apocrypha meanwhile Harry is becomes the new dimension anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge

Very entertaining and a decently paced plot makes it worth a look at any rate

If you're patient this might fit. I'm trying for a realistic ish build, as in Harry not being OP in first or second year, but I would say it fits.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.
