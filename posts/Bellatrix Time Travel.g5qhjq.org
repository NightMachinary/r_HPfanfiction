I read a story recently that had a good concept but they made Bellatrix too silly. Bellatrix had time travelled from her childhood years to the future.

I'm looking for any type of time travel (forward, backwards) or AU where its Bellatrix that does the travelling.


** That's a tough request. Out of all the time travel fics I've read I don't think a single one had Bellatrix being the one who traveled. In terms of harry time travel where he gets with a young Non-deatheater Bellatrix I was going to recommend linkffn(Delenda Est) by Lord Silvere.

Good luck I hope someone can find some fics to recommend to you.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** I have only come across one story where Bellatrix travels to the future. I couldn't really get into the story even though Harry/Bellatrix is one of my favourite pairings, maybe you can give it a try. I don't remember why I was not interested in the story. Possibly this is the story that you read.

  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)

***** Yeah, I liked the concept very much too. I just couldn't accept / move past the way Bellatrix was acting. I couldn't go farther than a few chapters.

  When a teenage Bellatrix Black gets stuck in the distant future of 1998, she must navigate a world in which she is wanted for crimes she has yet to commit. Alone at first, the help of unexpected allies may save her from the point of no return.Or: Bellatrix Black finally gets some therapy, inherits a foul-mouthed Phoenix, and sets out to kill her alternate-timeline-future-self (but not necessarily in that order). Eventual Bellamione.
