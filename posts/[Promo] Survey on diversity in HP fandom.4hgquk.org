** Just my opinion, but I never understood the criticism about the Harry Potter series not having enough diversity. It has many layered and relatable characters and explores a lot of relevant high-concept ideas like racism, prejudice, class conflict, government corruption, etc-- in the context of its own world, obviously.

Despite being a WOC I related immensely to Harry while reading ... did I care if he was white or male? No. People are more complex than their race/gender/sexuality, and stories that are only out to fulfill some superficial diversity quota (every story needs 'X' number of this minority, 'X' number of that) are missing the point.

Not tryna to start a fight, and feel free to diagree with me. But I think, overall, my point is to say that you need better questions

*** There should never be a set diversity quota. It should all be based around the setting. I'm not going to write a story set in Asia with an all black or white cast. Forcing diversity breaks my suspension of disbelief.

Potterverse's main theme is basically anti-prejudice based around blood status. If you aren't seeing that theme, then the canonical series is flat and just pointless.

*** I just wanted for gay/lesbian/other sexualities people to be mentionned, because having "just" Dumbledore is kind of ... not enough for me. I'm not saying they don't exist (J.K. Rowling pretty much said the opposite) just that it's not enough mentionned in my opinion.

** The questions "Would you say that you see your race/gender/sexuality represented in the Harry Potter series?" and "Do you think there is enough diversity in the original seven Harry Potter books?" are a bit too general. I think HP does a much better job with race and gender than it does with sexuality.

*** With sexuality one of the most revered characters is gay, so that's still some diversity.

Also, no one ever mentions this, but interspecies relationships are a thing. Human/werewolf with Tonks and Remus; Fleur, Hagrid, and Flitwick are all either children of interspecies relationships or it's implied; even reverse necrophilia of a form is brought up with Myrtle and her infatuation with Harry as well as her interest in spying on boys in the prefects bath.

There are even discriminations against these relationships and the offspring of them brought up referring to them as half-breeds and such.

Overall I would say that there is a lot more diversity in the potterverse than it is given credit for.

***** That's a fair point. I've always been of the opinion that while it is a disease there are fundamental changes to biology that take place after infection that would cause reclassification from human to another species. The same with vampirism, they're no longer human, but that doesn't mean that they're lesser.

********** They must be different races of Homo-Sapien to fit the information we have. (Note that the term "Human" refers to a group of species, most of which are now extinct.)

JKR could have intended them to be different species as we know from her comment that magic is a dominant gene that she doesn't hold too much knowledge of biology but it is best to take the text as written rather than speculate on her intentions. Unless of course it is directly mentioned in canon that they are separate species in which case there is a contradiction.

** This is not a complaint on the subject matter, but on the execution.

The question of whether you view your ethnicity/gender/etc... as being adequately represented is leading because most english speakers are white and straight cissexuals are the majority so the majority will most likely say yes. This can lead to the results that show whites/cis/straights don't think there's anything wrong.

This could be fixed by asking if you think all races/genders/sexualities are adequately represented not just your own.

Also two of the questions seem completely pointed at the black Hermione controversy by asking about changes to the ethnicity and race in various adaptations by professionals and then the other question asking the same thing but instead by fan fiction authors. This could be reduced to one question.

The short answer for the above question on a survey like this is also hard to quantify and makes it hard to actually show decent results. This needs to be multiple choice like it's counterpart.

Then there's the scale asking if you feel there is adequate diversity. This needs multiple questions. What if I feel there is enough racial diversity, but not sexual. This should be broken up into 3 questions with a scale for each race, sexuality, and gender.

In general this survey does have several questions that seem to want to get a skewed result that can be shown as "evidence." Whether this would be for constructive use or accusatory statements to cause strife is unknown, but there are several problems with the way it is written to get accurate and unbiased results.
