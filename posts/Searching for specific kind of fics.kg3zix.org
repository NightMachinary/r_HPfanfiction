Hi I'm looking for ginny-pregnant-during-the-war-I-mean-The-Deathly-Hallows fics. I'm aware of the 8 rule (their ages on the timeline), so pls be careful using the links. thanks.


** “The Unexpected Heir by CaseyLove” linkffn(7183832) and just to make sure, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe][age of consent in Europe]] is different than in the States. There you have the lowest age of consent 16, in Europe it is highest. In UK it is also sixteen, but in my country, Czechia, it is 15, and in Germany it is even 14. So, yes, Ginny is probably on the wrong side of the law in this story, but Harry isn't (at least the Muggle law). And sex is there only implied, never described, so technically this story doesn't break rule 8.
