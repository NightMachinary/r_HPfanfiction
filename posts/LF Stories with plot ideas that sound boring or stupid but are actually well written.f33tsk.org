Looking for different plot lines out there, that might have had you originally thinking it would be stupid or boring, but it was a lot better than you previously thought.

Can be on any site.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be finished or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Can be as AU or as canon as possible.

Can be any era

Anyone can be the main character.

Can be Oneshots/Drabbles/Multichapter

No character bashing please. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is usually a no go.


** Oh ho... I have quite a few:

First off, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] Meaning Of One is a Hinny Soul-Bond, which tend to be really bad, and I say that despite the fact that I like the trope. But, I swear, that this is the best fanfiction I have read, period. (Abandoned/Hiatus)

Then we have the mother of crackfic concepts linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay! by Saphroneth). It is a riot and a great time. Gloriously derailed plots and the best characterisation of Dumbledore in existence. (Frequently Updated)

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack Of Lamb Sauce) Gordon Ramsey as the Year Six Potions Master. But it's treated seriously. Need I say more? (Completed)

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

#+begin_quote
  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

linkffn(11191235)

One of the worst summaries for possibly the best story of the fandom. A real shame.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
