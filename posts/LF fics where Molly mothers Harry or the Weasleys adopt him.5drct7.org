I read a really cute story where Molly took care of Harry after finding out he was abused. I would love to read more stories like that or of Harry being adopted by the Weasleys.


** Well, there's /Nightmares of Future Past,/ where Harry sends himself into the past. His relationship with the Weasleys is a very important subplot:

*** That's true. But that relationship is strained [[/spoiler][almost from the moment they arrive in the past and get's even worse around Christmas, after that it settles into a friendship of sorts, but it is never the same as they were used to back in their time.]].
