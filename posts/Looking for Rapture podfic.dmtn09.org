Hey guys, I know some of you have vast fanfiction collections, but does anybody have the podfic of Rapture? There are many links online, but all of them dead unfortunately :/ Thanks so much in advance!


** Have you tried [[https://archive.org/web][the wayback machine]]?

*** I have, but maybe I'm doing it wrong :/ There are download links [[http://audiofic.jinjurly.com/rapture][here]] and [[https://podficbigbang.dreamwidth.org/7113.html][here]] but I don't think Wayback Machine can do anything when the upload was removed or the upload site no longer exists.

**** Situation when the website is removed, is exactly the purpose of the Wayback Machine.

***** Wayback machine usually only captured sites, not downloads. So even if I can look at the old site, the download link is still invalid. And in the other case the site works fine, but the file was removed, so it's no use
