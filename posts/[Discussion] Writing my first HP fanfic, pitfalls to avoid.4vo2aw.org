For the most part I am going to stick with the story I have planned, because I am writing for fun :) That being said, I want to write something I can enjoy and others can as well. So, any advice? If it's any help, I am writing a next generation fic. EDIT: Thanks for all the advice!


** 1. Make sure you get all the names right. Stupefy, not Stupify. Lily has only those two L's, not three, and so on and so forth.

2. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Don't just post your first draft, because it will be filled with typos, sentences that just don't make sense and other monstrosities.

3. No. Magical. Cores. HP magic don't work that way, unless you are doing a massive AU à la linkffn(Wit of the Raven)

4. DO NOT HAVE REVIEW RESPONSES IN YOUR AUTHOR'S NOTES unless a review has a very good point that you want to /briefly/ address

5. Related to 2. Get a beta or two. We don't catch all of our own mistakes. A second might catch stuff the first didn't.

6. Plan it all out.

Lack of balance is just bad writing. OP Harry/Dumbledore/ etc. is fine if the opponent is heightened as well. It is also super annoying when Harry is so much better than everyone around him. It diminishes the other characters, which is just a lazy writing technique.

But then again, I am well aware that not everyone trying to write is good at it.

PS. I actually have a story in writing (not a fanfic) where there is something functioning /like/ magic cores. But instead of being stupid I'd decided that it affects how quickly one's magical energy regenerates, meaning that those with weaker “cores” (not actually called that way in the story) can't overpower those stronger in a direct clash (you know, Dragonball-style), but it doesn't actually limit one's ability to continue fighting. Although there's blood magic which does have a limit of that sort (unless you bring properly-prepared comatose people as batteries, which ... yeah, is not good). My point is, because of the above I find the fact that most people using that particular plot device failed to use it well to be quite sad, more than anything.

Agreed.

But (there's always a but) a kind of "tiredness" would not be unreasonable. Doing the same thing over and over makes us tired, be it physical exertions, mental exertions (as in prolonged studying), or casting magic.

The (magical) trick is to stay away from giving it a physical ELI5 likeness, often with containers and pipes. And light. There's always some kind of light.

It's not /too/ out of line. It's an easy way to explain why Hermione isn't the biggest badass of the crew. There are better ways of doing it without even getting into magic -- athleticism, an instinct for combat situations, Harry being especially motivated, ruthlessness and a willingness to be hurt to achieve his goals.

If you're looking at the magic system in general, you could say, for instance, that everyone has slightly different affinities for aspects of magic. Hermione might have an affinity for spell acquisition, letting her learn new spells with ease. Harry might have an affinity for combat magic, letting him cast spells with much more efficacy than you would expect. There are other ways to go.

In general, though, if someone invokes magical cores in a vague, tangential way, it doesn't bother me. If they go into depth and have something interesting to say about magical cores, it doesn't bother me. The "we read a book about how to unlock our full cores and now we're ten times stronger!" way of doing things is just...bad. The author cared about this aspect enough to write about it specifically and turn it into a plot point; they didn't care enough to do something original.

Honest questions in non-English translations is it spelled Lilly? It's really the only way I can explain this one. If the author spells it incorrectly once I assume it's a typo, but I've read fics where the author uses that spelling for the entire fic and doesn't seem to notice it's wrong at all. My only way to reconcile this is that some of the non-English translations spell it Lilly so non-English speakers don't even realize its wrong.

Don't use the phrase "So mote it be."  \\
Now you said next-gen so you've got a pretty open field for characterization, but I can not stress this enough. Don't carbon copy them. A lot of people make the junior potters into replicas of the original Marauders or the trio, and you start to wonder, why didn't they just use the existing characters who already have plot and backstory?  \\

**** It's a reference to the fanon ideas of magically binding oaths (similar to an Unbreakable Vow) which can be super varied in how it's worded etc. Somewhere along the line people got the idea that the vows must use archaic English (thee, thou, etc.), include all of the bloody titles in the name (Lord Potter-Black or whatever the fuck) and end it with "So mote it be."

Fics that use vows in this way usually have other terrible tropes in them, so the phrase is on most people's "This makes a Bad Fic, do not read" list.

** The goblins are dicks, full stop. If you turn your back on them, they will stab it and laugh. There were Goblin wars for a reason, you know.

Plausibility Is Good. If you have to do some story gymnastics to make your plot plausible, do some damn story gymnastics. If you run into a dead end plot-hole, don't deus ex yourself out of it. Find out what caused the plot-hole and rework it, even if it doesn't fit with what you were originally intending to do. I would rather think "that's unlikely, but still possible" than "that's straight up impossible" when reading a story.

If you are going to make some (or all) of your characters OOC, /do not tell us so/. Not in the summary, not in the author's notes, just don't say anything. Nothing turns me off a story faster than flat out telling me that I'll be reading about your own version of the cast. I'm not saying don't make them OOC, just don't tell us. Also, Don't go full OOC out of the gate. Make the change from Canon to OOC gradual (and plausible!) over the course of the story, and with any luck I'll be well invested into the characters by the time they hit full OOC.

** *Make the world dynamic.* Voldemort died twenty or thirty years ago; technology is advancing; the Muggle population is growing. This should have an impact on the setting. Maybe all of the wizarding world in Britain has gone to ground in a region similar to the area where Platform 9¾ resides -- a place with only weak connections to the rest of the universe, so a Muggle can't hike around the Highlands and stumble on Hogwarts.

*Don't duplicate the parents.* This is one thing that gives next-gen fics a bad reputation: you turn the kids into slightly improved versions of their parents, and it's transparent, and there's a new Dark Lady with a name that reads like bad French...

*Ensure that the parents maintain their character flaws.* Or if you solve some, either give them other problems or other flaws. The epilogue certainly shows that they aren't saints:

#+begin_quote
  Hugo tugged on his mother's sleeve. "Mum? Where are they taking him? Where are they taking Dad?"

  Hermione's jaw was set, her hand gripping her wand tight enough to turn her knuckles white. "Your /father/ just admitted to using a mind-control charm on a defenceless person."

  "/What/?"

  "For some /unfathomable/ reason," Hermione said, her rage palpable, "he decided that it would be /better/ if he /Confunded the examiner/ than if he had to retake a test! As if -- as if having to study with me is worse than six months in Azkaban. As if a Muggle's sanctity of mind isn't worth considering."

  "But didn't you --" At the last second, Hugo shut himself up. There was a reason he'd never met his maternal grandparents, a reason Hermione cried herself to sleep on the twelfth of May and twenty-third of October every year, why she always seemed so strained at Christmas and Thanksgiving.
#+end_quote

Those are the three huge things specific to next-gen fics.

For fics in general, *ensure that people act like real people*. They can make mistakes; people often do. They can not take a hint sometimes. They might not reach the right conclusions. They can prefer what is comforting to believe over what the evidence points to.

But, for instance, if you have as a cornerstone of your worldbuilding that birthrates have plummeted and the population is 70% female, actually treat men as rare; don't have them working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement or playing Quidditch. -- Unless people don't actually care about maintaining a steady population.

If you have a group of six characters urgently in need of getting from Hogwarts to London, maybe they should head over to Hogsmeade and take the Floo instead of riding flying horses. Either the horse can go Mach 4 or walking and taking the Floo is faster -- and I don't want to be on the back of a horse that's going Mach 4.

If you have a magic door that opens only at the last light on a particular day of the year, don't have your characters who have spent 80k words just getting there give up on it the moment the sun dips below the horizon. ("Maybe it's referring to moonlight? A Julian/Gregorian calendar distinction? Let's wait a bit just to be sure... I think I see a hint of light!")

That kind of thing. Places where, as a reader, you are screaming at a character: "No, you idiot! Don't do that!" Most likely, that character would have a voice in their head screaming the exact same thing. And sometimes I can have that voice and ignore it, or I feel powerless to obey, but I'm never unaffected.

******* Eh. Obliviating/confunding muggles is something wizards do casually without regard to the sanctity of their minds. Like at the Quidditch World Cup, where the muggles employed at the event are being obliviated seemingly constantly by the entrance of every magical guest.

******* People who use confundus charms are the worst I agree.

Especially when they do it for silly reasons.

Like helping the boy they have a crush on make the house Quidditch team. Which Hermione did in sixth year when she used a confundus on Cormac McLaggen. So maybe Hermione doesn't treat it as bad because that would make her a hypocrite.

Also it's a confusion charm meant to distract a person and make them think they saw or did something that hasn't happened. Not a mind control charm like the Imperious curse which removes all free will.

*** This. That said, if you decide to go for something that is not canon, simply accept that the story will definitely be an AU one rather than trying to show it as “more canon because my version is better” as there were people who did that and they all only pissed off people with it.

Also, if you include an element in your story, be it magical cores or anything else, make sure it's actually relevant; if you have a story with magical cores where their existence never actually matters then you might as well not mention that they are in it because the readers don't need to know and in a story rather than a world-building book it will only be useless clutter.

***** I'll give you a hint for that: if possible, make your first story a short one, possibly a one-shot; this way you will be able to write the whole thing /and then/ insert foreshadowing and info for the plot devices that are used.

Once you get that out of the way (to have /something/ released, as that makes a lot of difference for some people), or if you don't have problems of that sort anyway, then simply write the longer story a few chapters ahead before releasing so that you'd have the occasion to go back and insert those very same hints and information bits chapters before something comes into play.

By the way, this is why some people recommend writing a rough script (you know, a few sentences to sum up a chapter) a few chapters ahead, and using organic writing if you are not sure yet how you want to progress. Assuming no major and unexpected changes, that can make it much easier to see what major plot devices you will have that are actually used.

** The details!

1) Most importantly, I think, is staying constant. If your first chapter is 100% 10/10 quality, don't post a drabble as the second chapter. Keep nick names standard, as well as other character identifiers.

2) JKR is known for having little useless information, if you plan your story you can have a small, unimportant, tidbit from chapter 7 an important plot point in chapter 25. It retains the HP style, and it serves to up the quality.

3)Pay attention to the time! Harry starts Hogwarts in 1991 and the final battle takes place May 2 1998. The Marauders were in school from 1971 to 1978. If you want to be extra detailed, sort your timeline by chapter then date, wolfram alpha will tell you when full moons, days of the week, etc. happen for specific dates, months, etc. If you're writing cannon, this is especially important. Muggle borns in Next Gen will definitely know how to use a computer or text, but Harry won't be particularly in touch with computers.

4) Geography is also important. Hogwarts is in Scotland, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were born in England (which is a part of Great Britian?). Geography effects weather, accent, etc.

*** I agree with sfjoellen's points, especially on not letting others dictate what you want to write. Yet, I think there is a difference between a strong writer and a weak one. This tends to come down to writing structure, continuity and character/plot development. Style, canon/non-canon, AU, plot, and OOC individuals are up to the writer's preferences. You'll find that readers will have their own preferences on what they like. Your flavour of writing style and exploration, of the HP world, might not be everyone's cuppa; however, no one can deny quality of writing, consistency, and careful crafting of story and characters.

Best of luck and be sure to post it when you do write something. We'd love to see it!

***** u/ScrotumPower:
#+begin_quote
  plot development
#+end_quote

Make (at least) a rough outline of major plot points first. Don't force your characters to follow it no matter what. Sometimes the story and characters takes on a life of their own. That is not a bad thing, it's a symptom of well-written characters and character development.

And for the sake of dog, don't force the story line through all the stations of canon. The /only/ reason Harry ended up with Hedwig the Snowy Owl, is that Hagrid bought her as a birthday present on a whim. No Hagrid, no Hedwig. Visiting Diagon Alley /not/ on Harry's birthday, no present for Harry.

It's about suspension of disbelief.

Which crashed spectacularly in one story where Harry was so weak and useless that Dudley had to cast a Patronus with Harry's wand to save the day. No. Just no.
