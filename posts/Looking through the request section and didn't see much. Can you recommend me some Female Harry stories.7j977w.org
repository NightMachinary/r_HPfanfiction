** You might enjoy: linkffn(10199439) and linkffn (7613196). I'm uncertain whether the Pureblood Pretense infringes any of your listed criteria; it's been a while since I've read it, but as far as I can recall, it doesn't.

  A Journal found in the year 3054 has left the people agog. It explains the survival of wizard-kind from the mass genocide attempted in 1998 by the world from the point-of-view of the wisest woman. They have to translate it though. Rated T for the curse words.

** I really like linkffn(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn) and it's sequel. It has good writing, good characters and fem!Harry is very well written. Despite the authors note on future Harriet/Snape, there is no romance so far and nothing regarding their behavior seems out of place or creepy. Has a lot of really sweet Hermione and Harry friendship moments.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** Generally speaking, there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter C2]]. If you sort by favorites, I'm sure you will find plenty that is well recommended.

Think I'll do that as well, actually. Been a while since I looked through these.
