"ah, it seems that Harry is worthy of excalibur but the problem your not a pendragon. King Arthurs line had died out so.... We have this particular.... predicament"

The problem was the sword is still in the stone he can pick it up and swing it no problem. he use it despite it having a chunk of rock on it thus is forced to use it as a sort of war hammer instead. A literal sword-in-the-stone weapon instead of a sword.

** Heh. That's actually a thing in the /Castlevania/ series, specifically /Aria of Sorrow/

*** I vaguely remember /Dawn/ having a boss-speedrun mode that unlocked some weird weaponry, including a stuffed teddy-bear, a pair of nunchucks with ridiculously short range but fast attacks, and the Excalibur-still-in-the-rock. You could get a few of them with a weird out-of-bounds glitch.

I don't remember any such thing for /Aria/ but I could be mistaken.

EDIT: Apparently it /is/ a thing in both, and I'm misremembering which funny thing was in which game. /Dawn/ had an RPG, a teddy bear and nunchucks. /Aria/ had the Excalibur-in-the-rock, a futuristic gun, and Valmanway/Crissaegrim - as per the [[https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Boss_Rush_Mode][Castlevania wiki]].

** What's he going to use it for? An actual sword would be useless enough, but he can't even stab horcruxes with this one.
