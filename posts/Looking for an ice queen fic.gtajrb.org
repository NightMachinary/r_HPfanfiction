I'm looking for a good romantic fic where Harry's love interest is an ice queen/ someone with a heart of ice etc. It could be Daphne or an OC, as long as she's paired with Harry. Preferably when they're still at hogwarts.

Ty in advance!! <3


** Have you read Icecream or Twins by andrious? Both are oneshots, but very heartwarming.

***** Well, seeing as many of the fics by this author have been very frequently recced for over 10 years now, I doubt it is bad.

******* Was looking through Harry/OC reccs and came across this thread. If you haven't looked at any of them, I'll tell you you're right to be hesitant. From what I remember, James Spookie's stories are technically okay, but boring and repetitive.

He's a lot like Robst, except he has Harry as truly downtrodden and unable to function without Hermione.
