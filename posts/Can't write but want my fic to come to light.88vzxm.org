** First, skilled writers usually have their own ideas, which is gonna be a problem.

But even ignoring this, you failed to provide the bare minimum needed for any collaboration: Effort.

This post is obviously not proofread and has a lot of mistakes that are extremely easy to catch - even for a non-native speaker. This 100% drives away anyone who would put in effort. It would just end up like a bad group project at school, so people stay away.

Seriously, if you want someone to pick up any idea you have and collaborate with you, you need to invest more than 5 minutes in "advertising". Give us more about the story, make sure it is succinct and written with correct grammar - or at least make sure it's obvious that you /tried/.

Edit: Lastly, the only way to become a good writer is to write. Talent might be a thing, but what actually counts is [[http://imgur.com/cFRUql9.jpg][practice]]

** No one can write at first, we learn by trying and trying again. I've published 90k words, but written at least 250k on the road of getting something akin to writing skills. I'm no native speaker, I care little about the literary paradigms of British literature, but you can teach yourself the sufficient proficiency in spelling and grammar. Instead of trying to dump a half cooked idea on someone else and then take credit for the "collaboration", try writing yourself.
