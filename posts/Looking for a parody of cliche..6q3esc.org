Like, harry got a blood test at gringotts, proclaiming him a descendant of slytherin, ravenclaw, hufflepuff, gryffindor, black, gaunt, and peverell. After that because the house is financially broken, his assets are confiscated. The wizarding world, the one who have claim to these houses contested harry's claim after all those house's debt are paid by harry. After all, the seat of wizengamot still exist for those houses and political power is still political power, and a person who by himself hold those house's power would easily get the majority of the votes and leaving such power on a child would not be healthy for the nation.

Not necessarily that cliche, but something like that?


** Then he found out that he was also liable for many magically binding contracts, such as giving descendants of X (whom he couldn't find but yet lives) 50 sheep for some long ago favor, or marrying the female descendant of Y who turned out to be an insufferable airhead.

** It doesn't have that specific cliche, but linkffn(Potter Ever After by Kevin3) is an extensive, fourth-wall-breaking runthrough of about a hundred different cliches in the fandom.

It's a couple of years old now, though, so it might not have the new cliches.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

  It had all started with a kiss. Not just any kiss, mind, but a kiss he never expected. If that sounds like a cliché, that's because it is...and it's far from the only one. Oneshot, Harry/Multi.
