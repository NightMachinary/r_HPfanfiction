Here is my personal opinion of the best HP fanfictions.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_U_Wt6HCMjKfFu8wZI6NwatwMUW79aSsZdFMCklycsE/edit][Enjoy!]]


** Nicely formatted list. I agree with [[/u/blandge]] that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/][Wand and Shield]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] deserve a mention well above something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], which is a decidedly uninspiring story to my mind.

Also, while I love Taure's ideas as much as the next guy, I dunno if a two-chapter unfinished story can be counted among the top 33 of the fandom.

Lastly, is it strange that while I know many of these are good stories, I haven't really been able to read them from beginning to end? Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/][Resurrexit]] is like the Schindler's List of fanfiction, surely incredible, but I just don't have the energy to invest in something so serious.

*** For those of you unaware, this is the author him/herself calling Power He Knows Not uninspired. I highly recommend reading it; the author's grasp of the source material is excellent and it's a fun twist on LOTR if nothing else.

**** Certainly in the wacky world of HP/Lord of the Rings crossovers it's one of the better ones, but it was my first ever 'completed' story and that was pretty much its sole purpose. It's a bit clichéd, and rather clumsy in places, it doesn't do anything particularly earth-shattering. If HP/LotR wasn't such a wasteland it wouldn't get anywhere near as much praise, but it is what it is. I will admit, though, that I always try and maintain a good level of canonicity.

Not at all, I've never made it all the way through many of these. Most notably A Long Journey Home and Prince of a Dark Kingdom. I think it comes down to taste to a large degree. Sometimes certain fics just don't catch you.

I'm probably a little biased with regards to Browncoat and Wand and Shield. They were the stories that got me interested in crossovers in the first place. Had it not been for them, I may never have got into writing in the first place.

** I noticed you mentioned that Fahad's crossover might be the best crossover on the site, but it tends to misinterpret several of the canon DxD characters.

I didn't particularly enjoy Harry's character in Contractual Invalidation. He was kind of dick. However, I never finished the fic, so I might have missed some explanation as to why he was acting the way he was.

I would definitely put Delenda Est above Knowledge is Power.

Other than that, interesting list. I will probably check out the fics I haven't read yet, which seems to be most of them.

I don't really mind that as I find his characters and world much more endearing than the original.

#+end_quote

I felt that Harry's 'dickishness', as you put it, was realistic and entertaining. People do not gain power or garner support by having impeccable morals. And overall he really wasn't a dick, but more scheming and shrewd. I found it to be a nice refresher from the average FF that always has the main character having almost no flaws besides some unimportant things like a short memory.

Both of these are incredibly flawed which is why I have them on the bottom. I found that Bella in Delenda Est was an uninteresting and flat character.

**** Fahad's fic created/perpetuated a lot of bad fanon. Many characters were far less likeable than canon.

Maybe Harry's dickishness was realistic in some sense, but it was not entertaining. I really didn't like how Daphne ended up falling for him. She should have just screwed him over at some point. There's a difference between having flaws and being an asshole.

I agree that both are flawed. In my opinion however, Knowledge is Power is far more flawed than Delenda Est. So much so that I'm wondering why it's even on the list.

***** I don't find the likeability of characters, especially non-important characters, to be a huge factor in what I read. Truthfully, I want to have characters that I don't like because it means that the author is invoking a reaction from me. And if someone perpetuates bad fanon that's on their copycats, not the original author.

****** In my opinion, likeable side characters enhance a story. Fahad's characters are often boring. Sometimes it feels like he is making up things about them specifically to put them down.

I prefer to have my main character be somewhat likeable. This is true even when the main character is a villain. Otherwise I find myself hoping for a bad end. This is exactly what happened with Contractual invalidation. On top of that, the romance was kind of shitty and the plot was boring. I only liked Daphne.

I wasn't to fond of the fanon Fahad created. Some things were just stupid.

It's not the greatest fanfic ever, but when I weigh it up against some of the fics listed, I have to wonder why it's not there - since there's numerous other AUs and HINOs, I'm puzzled at its exclusion.

** This is a great list, but I have a slight problem with you proclaiming the two crossovers you listed are "easily" top 2. Probably the foremost is linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) which certainly could make a claim at the best HP/ crossover. There's also linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) among others.

Also, not having linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) in a top 33 list is a crime.

** Nice list! I'm not sure if you're including incomplete fics, but if so linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) is one of the best written fics I've read. Also worth a mention (at least in my opinion) are:

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) -- I thought this one had some really interesting ideas about magic that were developed pretty well as well as an anti-heroine, which was a nice change.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpoint) -- technically canon compliant, and well-written!

And, of course, there's linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction) which is also technically fairly canon compliant and also is a really well crafted emotional story.
