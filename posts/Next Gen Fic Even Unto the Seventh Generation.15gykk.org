*** No, it isn't slash. It's set during the students' first year at Hogwarts--so definitely not slash! The K rating is Fanfiction.net's version of G.

"Even Unto the Seventh Generation" comes from the bible (not sure exactly which one) passage that basically asserts that "The sins of the fathers shall be vistited unto their children, yea until the seventh generation."

**** I commented in your other thread, but since I'm here now I'll ask my questions here...

Are you going to do all 7 years?

Will it eventually be slash as they get older? Just wondering... I'm not really biased either way, just nosey. (:

***** Pandame,

I made a /very/ detailed handbook of the world of the story and all of the characters in Albus/Scorpius's years, plus older, younger, and teachers, so if I want to, I can continue and do sequels. I'm not sure I'd do seven books--perhaps skipping ahead a year between installments.

I don't plan romance to be a big part in this book, because the kids are so young. As they get older, I am sure it will play the part. As for slash, I am not certain. It's important to "write what you know." But I wouldn't eliminate it as a possibility.
