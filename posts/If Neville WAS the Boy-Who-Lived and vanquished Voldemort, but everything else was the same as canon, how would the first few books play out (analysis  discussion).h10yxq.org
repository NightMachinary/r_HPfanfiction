The discussion on time travel threads got me thinking about this in general terms of AU worldbuilding. Harry in canon /does/ start with the fame!boost of being the BWL, but is also gifted various other assets throughout the course of the story, and ample opportunities to brush up his skills and weak areas. Sirius and Remus are still alive and introduce him to friends and allies. His natural flying ability is indulged by an opportunity to become a quidditch team member in first year, which positively influences his popularity in the school. The friendship of Ron and Hermione patches up his lack of social skills and lack of motivation respectively, as well as being a general morale booster. Dumbledore returns to him the cloak which facilitates his adventures, as does a friendship with Hagrid which he has for hereditary reasons.

Neville, conversely, has none of that. He will enter first year wizard-raised and famous as a hero, yet with a bigger question mark over his abilities and the mythos, given that Augusta will have still insisted he use Frank's wand. I would expect him to have all the same and more insecurities as he does in canon, given that nothing has changed except he has bigger shoes to fill. At the same time, Harry Potter will be entering Hogwarts /just/ as an abused child with no fame, and no reason for anyone to look any closer. Ron will have been nudged towards befriending Neville, rather than Harry - so may not ever develop any curiosity about Muggles, nor will he ever have reason if Harry doesn't outright tell him to question anything about Harry's home life.

What do we know about Neville in book 1? He's fearful, avoids confrontation, and isn't confident in himself, nor proficient with magic. How will he interact with Snape? Snape, presumably, will now have a direct order from Dumbledore to shield and safeguard Neville now, rather than Harry. This means he has no reason to care for Harry at all. McGonagall may be kinder to Neville than she was in canon if Dumbledore suggests to her that she should be.

*Major changes I would anticipate*:

- Neville befriends Hermione on the train as in canon, but then loses her friendship after he also befriends Ron and doesn't stop him from bullying her

- Neville and Ron become fast friends, possibly including Seamus and Dean. Neville and Ron do not rescue Hermione from the troll. Harry may have gravitated to her at that point however and may rescue her - or they may both be injured by the troll because two against one have a worse chance than three against one, and Ron provided the knockout blow in canon

- Neville is not on the quidditch team, forcing Quirrell to take alternative assassination attempts

- Dumbledore's hints to Neville to be a hero fall mostly on deaf ears

- Dumbledore will have to arrange an alternative method for Neville to find the Mirror of Erised

- Harry's popularity, assuming quidditch goes the same, may come to threaten Neville's

- The whole situation with Norbert is butterflied away because Ron and Harry aren't friends, unless Neville and Hagrid independently become friends through shared interests (not impossible)

- Malfoy is not a secondary antagonist because he has no direct reason to clash with Neville and Ron, or Neville alone

- Neville's likely friendship with Hufflepuffs thanks to Sprout and Herbology drastically affects who is secondary cast

- Neville and Ron are unlikely to either 1) find out about the Stone, 2) have the gall to try and steal it themselves 3) make it through all of the obstacles

That's book 1 done; how do the other books go? Or do you disagree with any of my conclusions?


** I don't think Neville would be anything like canon if he was the BWL. His family treated him like crap because, in their eyes, he was crap. If he was the BWL, he would most likely be treated better. He wouldn't spend time gardening to get away from it. Also do remember that the entire "Dumbledore controlled every single bit of Harry's life" thing is a fanfiction construct. It wouldn't have to go the same way, with the Mirror and stuff. Neville would most likely be something akin to a Gryffindor Malfoy.

Although it would be quite interesting to watch Harry in that case, with one of three possibilities coming to mind:

A) A canon flip in which Lily and James get turned into vegetables as canon Longbottoms did. There's no need to hide Harry away so he would likely be raised by someone in the wizarding world (Remus? Minerva? Not sure if Alice being his godmother was canon, but if it was, raised alongside Neville by Augusta?)

B) Lily and James are still vegetables, but he goes to the Dursleys. Malfoy wouldn't have a reason to drive him away, Ron wouldn't fanboy over him, so potentially a Slytherin!Harry trying to make his way in the wizarding world without any guidance? Quite likely becoming a Death Eater in the process.

C) Lily and James are all good and healthy, Harry grows up to be Snape's worst nightmare. A Golden Trio of Neville, Harry and Hermione, potentially?

*** In A) I think since technically James and Lilly are alive, at least somewhat, Sirius wouldn't have gone that ballistic with trying to hunt down Wormtail so I don't think he would have gone to Azkaban. And since Harry didn't survive the Killing Curse and became "The-Boy-Who-Lived" it is possible that Hagrid didn't come to the house to take him.

It would change so much, even from the beginning.

**** That's a fair point actually! Alternatively, they could just have brought down the fidelius after Voldemort died (I assume that's what the Longbottoms did in canon? Not sure, but I seem to recall Dumbledore telling both families to hide) and so Peter didn't actually betray them. Could be an interesting redemption arc for him there, since he technically didn't even do anything horrible. I'm a sucker for stories that feature Wormtail as an actual character, he gets killed even in most death eater Harry fics.

****** It's not just the fact that he's useful. He's a weak, cowardly person that was most likely threatened into joining. Like he's not even all that evil. Snape joined the Death Eaters willingly and rose to the Inner Circle (wait, is that canon? The last time I actually the books was pretty much within a month of each coming out so it's a bit muddy) on his own merit and depravity, then switched sides after he indiredtly murdered his obsession. If Lily hadn't died, Snape would just continue serving Voldemort without issue. If anything, Peter would deserve more of a chance at redemption then Snape does. I mean, I don't personally think that either of them does as they are in canon, but if I had to pick one of them it would be Peter.

******* In the graveyard in GoF, Voldmort's followers gather in a circle with clear positions, leaving spaces for those not there. Snape has one of those places though in that exact moment Voldmort thought Snape was against him. Either there are very few actual death eaters or there is a 'inner circle,' of which Snape had a place.

******** In that case, I'd wager that the named Death Eaters we actually see are the inner circle. Like it just seems silly to think that Voldemort would be able to take over a country with what, ten people? Even if people like Bellatrix and Dolohov are a lot stronger then the average person, I doubt they could take on the entirety of Wizarding Britain. There are most likely hundreds of them in the ranks, ones that didn't get caught because they're just grunts while the Aurors and the Order focused on the leaders. Since Voldemort was so obsessed with the prophecy, it would make sense for him to only send his very best into the DoM. Even if his very best turned out to be no match for six teenagers and a bunch of glorified housewifes (seriously, the Order has what, four aurors if Sirius being an ex-auror is canon? The rest aren't exactly fighting material.)

******* In his defence, because we are reading this from Harry's perspective we would've never gotten a redemption arc because while Snape was worse than Peter (in my opinion), what Wormtail did was personal. Especially since when Harry finds out what he did Sirius and Remus is there. I don' think Snape would've continued serving Voldemort in this scenario because while Lilly lives, she is unresponsive and although I don't think he would be as devastated as in canon, I still think he would've switched sides.

I haven't read the books in a while too but I think Snape was pretty important even if there was no 'inner circle', while I agree that Snape is worse than Peter in that sense that he was just a coward but he still betrayed his friends and I think none of them deserves a redemption arc.

******** I feel like a lot of it boils down to all the characters in the books being pretty much one thing without any nuance. It would be very interesting to read a fic where the only change is having the characters be less one-dimensional. I mean all the Death Eaters are basically caricatures with no positive traits, while a lot of the light side just sorta have one thing going for them. Bellatrix is the insane witch, Pettigrew is the cowardly rat, Lucius is ridiculously xenophobic, rude, has nice hair and bribes a lot, Voldemort is the big bad and obsessed with stuff with nothing else ever going for him. Molly is an overbearing mother, Neville is a coward, Hermione likes to read, Fred and George prank people, Dumbledore is Gandalf, Bill has a cool earring, Luna is not like the other girls.

Like if the characters were fleshed out a bit more, the whole story would change, even if the end result would still be the same. Seeing the reasons behind people's actions and a bit of nuance in everything would change Harry's decisions. And Dumbledore's, and Voldemort's for that matter. And don't even get me started on Fudge and Umbridge, there was so much potential in that story arc but it all literally boiled down to Rowling being anti-government and going about it in an extremely blunt, almost parody-like way by flat out portraying Fudge as an idiot.

********* One thing I've considered doing is making a fic depicting Snape's life in a canon-compilant manner in 2 different ways in parallell where we see his thoughts and motivations in both -- one where he is irredeemably evil, the other where he is a victim of circumstances, as a way to try to show that both interpretations are valid and that there's no reason to put Snape in either extreme in fics, and getting into flamewars about him is pointless.

That bit is a nice plot point, though. I remember reading a two-shot fic where Snape manages to get Sirius executed, and Harry ends up willingly handing himself over to Voldemort in exchange for Voldemort torturing Snape to death.

****** Why would he not kill Peter? Even if his only major fault is being a coward, and all his actions is a result of this, this would mean that he isn't exactly loyal. Why would you keep around someone who can be threatened to switch sides at any moment? And then there's obviously the personal angle, if Harry is still vengeful about his parents being dead, despite being a Death Eater.

Also, Peter, for whatever reason, decided to take initiative on resurrecting Voldemort. That doesn't really strike me as a cowardly action. Hell, that might actually have been one of the bravest actions he has done. Stupid, and evil, but brave regardless.

*** But isn't Neville canonically crap in the first few books due to shyness and a poor wand, and due to his shyness clashing with Augusta's outspokenness? If he was the BWL none of those core aspects would change /unless/ he had a different wand - if Frank's was, perhaps, destroyed.

Augusta is still a poor parent substitute /unless/ for some reason she embraces the fame of being the guardian of the BWL and becomes a very different character.

**** I mean, fame definitely changes people. I also wouldn't be surprised if either Dumbledore or the Ministry (most likely both) kept a close eye on Neville since, unlike Harry, he's not hidden away from the world. Especially with that shitty uncle Neville has - he seems to be the exact sort of person to flaunt the everliving shit out of the Boy Who Lived.

Also, being raised in the spotlight with tons of fans would probably make him a cocky little shit, even if he is shit. I've read a couple dimension travel fics where Neville is the BWL, and I honestly just can't find holes in their logic of it.

** I'm not sure the premise works. Why would everything be the same?

That there is no reason for Harry to go the Dursleys was already pointed out. The most logical outcome is that Sirius remains Harry's godfather, and he will grow up with him. So Harry won't be the same person. On the other hand, Neville won't be the same person either, and even Augusta may act differently -- perhaps she actually /is/ proud of Neville, him having defeated Voldemort (clearly a sign of magic) -- and he enters Hogwarts as the kind of person Snape always insisted Harry was: arrogant and with an oversized ego.

I'm not sure where your take on Ron and Hermione comes from. Hermione is a nightmare and doesn't have friends for a reason. Ron isn't "nudged" towards anyone, he happens to sit in the same train compartment and is your average 11 year old bloke. More importantly, Neville might already know him, and so might Harry for both of them, given that he grows up in the Wizarding World -- or then again either of them might not, and have no reason to know him before or during Hogwarts, because they have other friends. There are more Houses than just Gryffindor, and friends "close in age" needn't mean the same year at Hogwarts.

Going with bigheaded!Neville, he'll dominate the Gryffindor crowd, and if he has been encouraged to be overconfident, he will act in just the way Harry has in Canon, except for reasons of fame or recognition. Harry, meanwhile, has possibly stumbled over stuff from Regulus, and gets sorted into Slytherin, after all. Sirius is miffed, but loves him all the same.

At this point you can write a nice Slytherin!Harry, while antagonist!Neville annoyingly struts around the school and keeps poking his nose where it doesn't belong. Or that's not how it happens, and you write something else entirely. Changing something as big as who the BWL is, I don't see any "obvious" way things would have to happen from then on out.

Still, plot points to consider:

- Hermione dies in the bathroom
- Hagrid's hut spontaneously combusts and reveals a dragon the size of a dinner table
- The PS is lost when Quirrelmort shatters the mirror, as neither he nor Neville can get the stone out
- Alternatively, Quirrelmost is successful -- possibly not even at the end of the year, but sooner -- and Voldemort returns in first year

** Eh...

No reason for Harry to go to the Dursleys or for Petunia to keep him. Snape also has no reason to turn on /Voldemort/. He doesn't need an elaborate plan to kill the Lestranges and BCJ if Lily is harmed by them.

Harry interacts with Seamus a bit in canon and they get along well enough for Seamus to lend him his chessmen when he goes home for Christmas. I don't see why Harry would be excluded from the group or why this (possibly) more well adjusted child would find Hermione more likable.

Malfoy is definitely a secondary antagonist here. Ron is still poor and he bullied Neville because he could.

Regardless of Neville's personality, though, I don't think Ginny sees the end of CoS and don't think Neville makes it past GoF.

** It depends on what happened to Harry, if his parents are alive, then he grows up completely different than canon Harry, maybe he's less like James and more like Lily.

Snape would also have no reason to betray Voldemort, unless Lily was attacked by Bellatrix and Co.

Neville would grow up a little differently maybe, perhaps his family would put even more pressure on him.

IF Lily and James are unavailable, then either Sirius gets him or any other families since he doesn't need protection, if for some stupid reason he's still sent to the Dursley's, then his chance to become a Death Eater just increases by some 30%.

If he's raised by Sirius, probably even adopted if Sirius doesn't want to have a wife for some reason, then it's up to how you characterize Sirius and Remus. He could be like Draco or like Sirius OR be more unique.

Neville being BWL would change a lot for Harry's first years.

** I think Sirius easiest Harry. As Hagrid might not be sent there. Assuming Harry is raised magical he would be different. If Sirius takes control over his family could he bring Andromeda back into the family and maybe kick out Belatrix for going after Harry's parents? If Harry is taught about his parents early he might be inclined to study more. With him being potentially closer with Tonks Hufflepuff could be a option. Maybe a Ravenclaw Harry has a better chance of happing. I could see Neville cracking under the pressure. I think neither helps Hermione who either dies it severally injured. This could cause the press to use the story in the future. Would be be able to handle the snake second year? With the potential loss of Ron's friendship as early as first year.(if Hermione dies or is hurt) he may become more withdrawn.if the rumors spread he hated muggleborn students first year the coming out as a Pareseltounge the second year and the heir problem would be worse. If Neville survives the first 2 years then year 3 should be normal and year 4 is really bad. Look how Harry handled being alone with the first task. Now imagine that all year and the only support is a secret death eater. If Neville survives the 3 tasks he may not win and whoever reached the cup dies to bring Voldemort back. With Voldemort back without Dumbledore knowing would cause year 5 to be normal untill maybe Neville gets a vision of his grandmother at the ministry. Would be go to Dumbledore or McGonagall and would they think it's just a nightmare? During year 5 would Snape feed Dumbledore information as Harry is safe? Year 6 is the Azkaban breakout and panic. Who will side with Dumbledore and if they must believe in Neville. The Weasley family might be at odds by what happened first year (how would Hermione affect Ron and the rest of the family) and Ginny's potential death year 2?
