I've seen plenty of stories which place Hermione in Slytherin and over time all blood purists, Voldemort included, eventually accept her since she is now "one of them". But are there any fics in which she is not welcome in her new House? Fics in which she is disgusted by the blatant racism and nepotism of the Slytherin's, disgusted by Snape and his teaching style? Stories in which she makes friends outside of Slytherin or befriends some of the older students?

Please no Hermione/"anyone canonically associated with Voldemort", Hermione/Marauders, canon pairings or angst-fests. Femslash is ok with me, slash would obviously not fit this request.


** linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) should fit the bill, as well as linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthology, or) if I remember correctly.

*** How much of the narrative of /Chessmaster/ focuses on Hermione? The summary sounds very Harry-centric. Does Hermione get any agency in it? (/Mudsnake/ was promising, but she didn't actually *do* anything there.)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

Brilliant Magic by LJSummers is an awesome one wherin she's definitely not accepted easily by her house and continues to be a badass anyway. Complete, Fred x Hermione x George V triad (no twincest).

linkffn(12132374)

Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt fulfills the requirement of her not getting along with the Death Eaters and Co., but because of [[/spoiler][the fact that she's in Slytherin because a ritual during the final battle cracked time and her soul is sent back in time to stop the ritual, so she ends up undercover, occupying the body of a dead Death Eater's child who was originally killed by the killing curse before she was old enough to come to Hogwarts]] it may not fit your requirements as many of them are /quite/ interested in getting along with her. If you read the spoiler, you're probably thinking "wtf that sounds so convoluted how can this be good" but I assure you, it's just me failing at writing a good short summary and if you're not hooked by the first chapter I'd be surprised. WIP, no pairing as of yet.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU
