So I looked at this site again a few days ago. And guess what, found the SAME OLD SHIT again. So my question is, are there any good fics on this site? Don't get me wrong, I like sex as much as any other person, but most of the stories are so horribly written that it's just simply painful to read, or have such a weak plot that feels more like they tried to glue something with water together instead of using something functional. :/


** I mostly stick to sites with moderators, unless someone has specifically recommended something from elsewhere. I mean, it was better back in the day when certain sites could be more strict with their moderation because they had so many submissions, but they still tend to have a slightly improved quality.

** There's some good fics, but you have to really comb through the site to find them. Try going to the "Recent" page to find recently updated fics.
