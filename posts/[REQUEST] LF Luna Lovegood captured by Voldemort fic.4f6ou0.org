I've searched again and again for this fic over the years, because I probably read it about five years ago, and could never find it again.

I'm fairly certain it was on adultfanfiction, and it was a Luna Lovegood centric fic - she was captured by Voldemort, and one of the scenes that really struck me was when he passed her her wand to give her a joking "fair fight" when he killed her, and instead of using a defensive spell she conjured a host of butterflies. She was going to die anyway, so she conjured something beautiful, and the AK struck a butterfly instead of her.

At the time, I was head over heels for it, but I don't really remember any other details except that it was incredibly dark in places. I think it might have been a WIP, but it could have been complete and I didn't finish it.

So, yeah, if anyone has a link I would be extremely grateful.

  As a captive of Lord Voldemort, Luna Lovegood never thought she would live beyond the first 24 hours. Saved at first by her quick wit, Luna learns the depth of human evil...and becomes the Dark Lord's greatest weakness. Eventually LVLL.

I liked the fic even though I rarely like Luna in longer stories. Neither characters are perfectly in character, but I suppose it is inevitable to make the pairing possible.

** And once again, this old fic meets a request.

Linkffn(the book of Morgan le fey) (and its sequel) is a pre-hbp fix that focuses on ron and his abilities as a seer. Just as a reminder, pre hbp, so there are no Horcruxes.
