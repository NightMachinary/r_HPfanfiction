Say you have a bunch of hairs from someone recently departed (maybe they grew their hair out and got it cut to make a wig, or whatever), would those hairs still work as the final ingredient in Polyjuice Potion?


** I'm completely uneducated on the subject and maybe all wrong here.. but based purely on the fact Barty Crouch Jr. kept Moody alive so he could continue taking his hairs and didn't just kill him and shave his head, I'd say the potion needs some kind of connection to a living being to work.

I think Invasion of the Body Snatchers had a similar concept, where the host has to remain alive for a shapeshifter to take their form. The original bodies were sealed in cocoons while the replicant walked around pretending to be them.. not unlike Moody in the trunk then, actually. Maybe JK found some inspiration there? That's all just my guess anyway.

This is Crouch confessing. I get the implication here you don't necessarily need to. A few pages before Dumbledore says "of course they needed to keep him alive" but he never explains why.

So maybe? Lol.

Yeah, there does seem to be some ambiguity in that statement, and could easily be either needing Moody alive because Polyjuice doesn't work well with the dead, or Crouch Jr's need to make his Moody impersonation as perfect as possible.

** I've always wondered this.. I was actually thinking about this the other day. at first I thought no- but I can't really think of a reason why not- hair isn't living. Also, in chamber of secrets hermione /tries/ to use hair off of another witch's robe- implying the hairs can be naturally fallen and do not need a skin tag (as if pulled from the head) and in GOF I believe crouch cuts Moody's hair for the ingredient. So I don't see why not- unless yknow, magic

** I always figured the Polyjuice gives you the state of the person at the point where you got hold of the person's hair. Meaning that as long as you took the resources while the person was alive, Polyjuice should still function.

I have no idea what would happen if you try to Polyjuice using a dead person's hair. I don't think it'd simply render the potion inert, but I don't think anything good would happen.

** If so, then how dead is too dead? Could hairs be plucked from mummies and put into the potion, to see what the mummy looked like?

** I'm a big fan of Dresden files so my idea is that the hair is a connection to the person which is why it's needed. I'm not entirely sure that connection would even be possible with a dead person but even if it was, that connection would begin to decay immediately after being removed from the person.

** I imagine so- I have some odd google searches from researching this, but apparently hair growth is connected to the blood vessels at the base of every hair follicle.

#+begin_quote
  These blood vessels feed the hair roots to keep them growing and break through the skin. By the time the hair reaches the epidermis i.e., the outer surface of the skin, the cells within that hair are no longer alive.
#+end_quote

So if hair is technically dead, but can still be used for Polyjuice, it would seem logical to assume that whatever you're using doesn't need to technically be alive in order to use for the potion.

Hair also takes a lot longer to decompose than the rest of the body.

So here's my other guess: the state of the material used has an effect on the potion. So if you used decaying teeth or decomposing hair, the results you get from the potion might be less than ideal. To that end, I imagine using a rotting tooth from an alive person would also give you unsavory results.

So while you could go and pluck the hairs off a mummy and use them in a potion, you run the risk of being transformed into something gruesome based on how damaged the hair is from elemental decay, microbial decay, etc.

You could probably kill someone and use their hair and such to assume their form for a while but eventually you run the risk of the body parts going bad.

Counterpoint to my own argument: When Mrs. Crouch used Barty Jr's hair to change, she transformed into a sick person. If the potion can detect the well being of a person based on the ingredients, can't it tell when you're pulling ingredients from a corpse as well?

Maybe different parts have different levels of potency?

To conclude, I don't think there's enough information in the source material to be totally sure. But overall great topic, OP! It was really interesting to ponder.

Tl;dr- My guess is yes, you can- but depending on the state of decay, the results might be less than desirable.

Slight problem with this line: Mrs Crouch was already sick and dying before she ever imbibed any Polyjuice Potion, and it was in fact her dying wish to get her son out of Azkaban. So the real question would be what effect on Jr drinking the potion with something from his dying mother would have on him.

As for the rest of your post, I'm personally leaning towards it having some kind of negative side-effect to the person using a batch of Polyjuice laced with the essence of someone deceased.

In fact, that's essentially what I'll be doing in my Me-as-Daphne fic, where I (somehow) get some of Lily Potter's hairs, and end up looking like her, but with a greying complexion, and taut cracked skin; kind of like how some older depictions of vampires were described as looking.

You're right, I'd forgotten about the “One dying person in, one dying person out” line. Jr. would probably feel the effects of her illness in her form. I'd say the physical ones at least.

What you mentioned is something along the lines of what I'm imagining too - using a dead persons essence would give the transformed body corpse-y qualities. I like to think that the longer someone has been dead, the more gruesome the final form will be. And after a certain point prove fatal to the consumer of the potion.

Of course, that particular head cannon probably wouldn't work with your story. And speaking of, the concept of your story sounds pretty cool. Are you planning on the use of Lily's hair having any long term health effects on your protagonist?
