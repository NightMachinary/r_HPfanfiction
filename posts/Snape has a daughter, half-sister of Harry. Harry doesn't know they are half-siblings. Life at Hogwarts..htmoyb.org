FOUND - Red Sorrow by LupinLaughed.

Hi all,

I am looking for an AO3 HP fic where Severus Snape has a daughter, she is Harry's half-sister and she's older than Harry. Snape and his daughter have a good relationship. They only meet when they are in Hogwarts, but she knows she has a half brother. Harry grows up with the Dursleys. Harry is not told they are half siblings, and doesn't find out till I think the second part of the fic.

I think it was written a while ago, at least a year or two ago if not more, the fic was still being updated after the part where Harry discovers they are related, but I lost track of it!

Thank you!

Edit: I think it was also written from the perspective of Snape's daughter.


** Was it Red Sorrow by LupinLaughed? It was quite long, and removed a while ago, but sounds very similar to what you described. Here's a link to some downloads of it:

**** Yeah that sounds about right. The only thing i could hope for if it was a fic is that lily would not have cheated and the child was artificially created.

But for the love of god no mpreg

*** To be honest I don't fully remember the timeline, but there was a year or 2-3 age difference I think between Snape's daughter and Harry. But I am iffy on the details.

**** Am pretty sure it is the Half Blood Princess though... The summary isn't really reflective of the actual plot, but the main character does find out she is Snape's daughter and is half siblings with Harry, so you could check it out.
