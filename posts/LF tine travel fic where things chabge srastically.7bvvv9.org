Like, something goes wrong in the future and Harry or whoever goes back, but his foreknowledge becomes useless because of a strong butterfly effect, or he's too powerful and the universe decides to compensate, or something equally story-changing.

I started reading Backwards With Purpose but just could not continue because it was so..... vanilla? Their insistence to not change the Chamber of Secrets was kinda UGH and the way they just told Dumbledore everything... BLEH


** Yes, I totally sympathize with you about BWP. Its great writing was badly marred by a ridiculous plot.

As for time travel fics that bust the timelines, here they are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): one shot only, but with Wormtail and very much in character

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): another one shot, but very nice

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): basically an one-shot, but the only fic that has Hermione killing Tom Riddle instead befrieding/raising/shagging him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516)

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...
