Any stories where harry is a basically unkillable monster the likes of Alucard, Alex Mercer etc... 20k+ words.

Thanks, Warryn.


** linkffn(On A Pale Horse) Death!Harry has become the Grim Reaper himself. He has also completely lost contact with human empathy and is starved for contact because his mere touch will kill people.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** There's a HP/Dresden crossover where Harry is literally an eldritch abomination. It takes place in the Dresden world, where some warlocks try to summon an /Outsider/ and MoD!Harry appearing is the result. In the form of the Hogwarts express. With tentacles. He basically slaughters all of the warlocks and then some other stuff happens.

Unfortunately I can't remember the title or the author. I think he posted it on DLP as well as FFN.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

*** While Harry is sort of technically an eldritch abomination in this, he's also very much not one.

He is very human and understandable.

He also doesn't let his tentacles out.

** That´s the storyline of a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen book, though it is not officially Harry of course, but I don´t know if it really counts as fanfic though. [[http://lxg.wikia.com/wiki/Antichrist]] The story does really sound like something a edgy thirteen year would write, the intention though was to satirize violent media, by turning something whimsical into something incredibly violent, and no disrespect was intended.

*** Interesting, but sadly i'm more leaning into seeing how a Harry Potter could change with such elements, because it's always godlike power without a cost, in these stories I want to see unkillable monster Harry, but it actually extracts a cost, like drinking blood, insanity, or eating people to further expand on my post.
