Are there any? We know that Andromeda was one of the Blacks that defied her family's blood supremist mania, I am sure she would have been happy when Sirius also ran away from his family and they must have been really close.

She must have been heartbroken and betrayed when she heard the accusation which everyone believed.

When Tonks joined the Order and found the truth about Sirius, she must have told her mother about it, what do you thing would have been Andromeda's reaction. Lets say Tonks couldnt tell her parents about Sirius being alive she must have still found out about him when his name was cleared at the end of OOTP how did she react to that?

Are there any fanfiction talking about it?


** I don't really know any Andromeda centric fics but considering Sirius calls her his "favorite cousin" she probably was happy to learn the truth.
