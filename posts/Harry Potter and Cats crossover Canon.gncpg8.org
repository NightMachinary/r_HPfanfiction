So I just realized something. Dame Judi Dench plays Prof. McGonagall. And she plays Old Deuteronomy. And what is McGonagall know for being able to do? That's right! Se can turn into a cat! And Old Deuteronomy has lived for an unusually long time for a cat. Maybe, just maybe, that's because Old Deuteronomy has the lifespan of a human! In a movie where cats are anthropomorphized having Judi Dench play a cat, when another one of her characters can become a cat is pretty suspicious. Cats the movie wasn't intended for the theater buffs or the movie watchers. It was for us. It was the most expensive crossover Fanfiction out there!

Thoughts?

Edit: As elliemff pointed out. Dame Maggie Smith plays McGonagall. So new question. What if Maggie smith played Ild Deuteronomy, would the Movie still be just as.... “well received”?


** Dame Judy Dench doesn't play McGonagall. That would be Dame Maggie Smith.
