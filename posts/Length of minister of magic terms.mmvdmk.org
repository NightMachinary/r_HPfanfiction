Hi everyone! Just a quick question for a fic I'm writing: I'm reading on the HP wiki (page about Hermione) that minister of magic terms are 7 years long (assuming the wizangamot doesn't vote them out early, I assume). Is that canon? Any idea where that comes from? Couldn't find any reference for this.

Thanks a mil!


** It's pseudo-canon... Most of them seem to last seven years or a multiple of that. I think there are some inconsistencies though.
