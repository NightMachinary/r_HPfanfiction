Too few fics use dialogue between characters to portray emotions & Infomation and tend to say the stuff in the third person. Which can get boring real quick when overused.


** Good dialogue can be difficult. I've read a lot of fics like that. I tend to drop out of them early on.

** Dialogue can also be really difficult to do. Its hard to give every character a different "voice" and it can be a bit stressful for writers to keep checking and redoing dialgue to get it to feel natural, when a 30 sec written narration can be so easily done.

** Huh, I tend to have the opposite problem. My stories have a lot of dialogue, but I really struggle with third-person narration and imagery and all that, because I feel like I'll be wasting the reader's time on the wrong descriptions. Any tips for good narration?

*** Character said: "hello".

Other character said: "hi".

Character said: "wow are you doing?".

Other character said: "I'm good".

** My problems come when it feels like the story is doing chesspiece story-telling, Character does this, character then says that and there is no description of what said character feels and how other characters respond to what the previous character said. It feels very annoying.

*** u/rek-lama:
#+begin_quote
  no description of what said character feels
#+end_quote

I thought that was a good thing. Leaving it to the readers to infer from context what the character is feeling instead of outright telling them.

**** I don't know if it is a good thing but I know that I don't like it. I dont need paragraphs of description on how a person reacts to something but I just need something to make me understand how a character would feel. Its why some people like 'characters reading/watching their own stories' fics, they get to experience how each character could possibly react (while in character) to something that they didn't know happened.
