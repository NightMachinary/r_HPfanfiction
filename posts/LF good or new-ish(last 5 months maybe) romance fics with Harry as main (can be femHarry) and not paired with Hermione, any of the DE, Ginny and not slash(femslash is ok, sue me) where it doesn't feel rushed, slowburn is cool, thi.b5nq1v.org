#+TITLE: LF good or new-ish(last 5 months maybe) romance fics with Harry as main (can be femHarry) and not paired with Hermione, any of the DE, Ginny and not slash(femslash is ok, sue me) where it doesn't feel rushed, slowburn is cool, think The Legacy.

I think I've read a bunch of the notorious ones, but maybe some slipped through.

Just as an example, a few of my favourite fics (not just this genre) are Grow Young with me, Eclipse of the Sky, the aforementioned The Legacy, though not romance, Stages of Hope, everything(except H/Hr) from JacobApples and a couple from TE7 (his endings though... jesus. Only the Luna one doesn't have a shit ending)

Also read, though wasn't a massive fan (was at the time, now, not so much) Dorothea Greengrass's and James Spookie's.

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.
