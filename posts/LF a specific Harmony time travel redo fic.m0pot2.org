:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this fic Harry/Hermione get sent back in time when they get betrayed by Ron to death eaters. Part of the set up was Harry killed Snape at the end of HBP so never found out about the last horcrux. The duo get sent back to 4th year, Sirius is exonerated, Draco is disowned and tries to sexually assault Daphne Greengrass. Snape decides to help Harry rather than help Dumbledore against Voldemort. Those are the major points I remember but I can't find it.
