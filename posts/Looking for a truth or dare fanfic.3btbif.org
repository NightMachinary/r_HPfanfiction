This fic was one of my favorites, but I can't find it. It centered around the Maruders, and also had Lily, Alice, Hestia, and Frank. There was a dare that Sirius had to do that involved turning the great hall into an ice skating rink. Remus had to steal the sorting hat also. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

  Seventh year Gryffindors all decide they need a bit of fun and Sirius suggests Truth or Dare, but with a twist. Will it really go for a week non-stop? And what is with the parchment?
