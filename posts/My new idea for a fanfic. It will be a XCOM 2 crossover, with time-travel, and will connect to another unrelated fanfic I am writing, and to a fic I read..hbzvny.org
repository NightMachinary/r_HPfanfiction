Basically, in the uncorrupted timeline, Harry and his friends, and enmies, assist XCOM in driving out the aliens. A utopia is then founded, and the newly-christened Terran Federation expands to the edges of the galaxy. However, a psionic agent with a vendeta against Ginny Weasley travels back in time to the time when she was possessed by the Diary. He mindcontrols her, and she becomes permanently possessed by the diary, resulting in the Black Ink, Red Rose timeline. In this timeline, XCOM loses to ADVENT, and mankind is killed to provide the Elders with new bodies. But one man remembered the original timeline. He is Stryker, who was apart of a secret Temporal research project. In addition, he was one of Ginny's most loyal soldiers in the original timeline. He goes back to correct things. It would tell the tale of the original timeline, then break off into a Time travel story mid-way through. It will connect theologically to a Fallout fanfic I am writing.
