Soulmates don't exactly mean the same thing in the magical world as they do in the Muggle one.

It is an advanced form of magic, performed in-lieu of a baptism or christening, where a child (between the ages of 1 and 2) receives the name of the man or woman capable of giving them the happiest and most fulfilled life when partnered with them on their dominant hand. Not a binding of the souls but rather a measure of compatibility derived from Divination and some rather intricate Arithmancy. In the modern era, many took to ignoring it.

Of course, like many orphans of the war, Harry Potter's parents were unable to take him to St. Mungos for his soulmate tattoo. Not too big a problem on paper, Muggleborns always had the tattoo bestowed upon them as a right of passage on entry to the magical world.

But Harry wasn't a muggleborn, thus Hagrid (and Dumbledore) somehow allowed these facts to slip their minds. Meaning Harry arrived at Hogwarts entirely unaware of who his soulmate was supposed to be...

...and was slowly introduced to the seven people claiming to be his soulmate...

Seven? Assuming we're doing canon Harry and not harem all the random girls Harry, i can see six obvious ones (Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville, Draco). Who's the seventh? Cedric? Colin? Voldemort? Moaning Myrtle?

*** Wait... Ron /and/ Ginny?

That's just prime ribbing material for the twins.

And... a really harsh way to create jealousy growing up...
