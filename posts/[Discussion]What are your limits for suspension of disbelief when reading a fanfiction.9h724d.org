Yes, fanfiction is all about wish fullfilment AND alternate universes, but once you open the Pandora´s box, you will eventually find more than you bargained for.

Recently, I had the most unsetling experience of a fic that has been recommended many times over here, but turned out to be just a well written racist fantasy with epic undertones:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/]])

For the love of Magic is the Mein Kampf of the Harry Potter Fanfiction!

/Jesus/, the author is a ** piece of work** and DOES admit at being a racist misantrope who just wished to kill off blacks and middle easterns and placed Harry Potter as his alter ego ( and of course he gave himself-Harry , a huge dick and a harem!)

I have huge problems with fics that have Harry and lol, sometimes even Hermione being as much anti-muggle as Draco Malfoy- not to mention the ones where Voldy is simply a poor soul and end up either being friends or lover to Harry- but most of them are not being offensive, just presenting a different-if not ridiculous-twist in the story.

So, what are your limits when reading fanfiction?


** I adore Snape as a character, but when he's immediately kind and loving to young pre-Hogwarts Harry and becomes a super-loving dad figure, it just breaks my sense of reality. There /has/ to be some sort of redemption arc or something to explain the complete change in perspective and character. Snape is an angry, angry man and quite possibly a straight-up narcissist. He is not Dad material, not without a whole /lot/ of support.

it's only OOC if snape /isn't/ a super-loving dad figure. the model for how snape approaches *his* children is draco and the slytherins: where we see he's openly and vocally supportive, and lets them get away with anything. he's be exactly as good a father as lucius or vernon. i don't see why he'd treat harry that way, though lol

** Okay for me there are 2 main issues that can destroy my suspension of disbelief, the first you already adressed:

(1) When the worldview of the author doesn't align with my own. When things happen that in my eyes don't make any sense or worse given terrible unconvincing explanations, which are supposed to be convincing (and not an example of flawed characters). You already talked at length about the Hitler/racist angle, but a more "benign" example of this are house elves. For me, when a fic brings up the notion that there's some kind of biological or magical reason that House Elves need to serve wizards I get a little on edge, but it's not an immediate deal breaker.

What completely breaks my suspension of disbelief is when Hermione just accepts that reasoning and concludes that it is then not worthwhile anymore to fight for the rights of House Elves. It's a total non Sequitur, not a good argument for why House Elves should be abused and it wouldn't convince anyone, especially not Hermione... it just makes me think the author is an idiot and thus my suspension of disbelief is broken. Of course there are certain ideological red-lines that I wouldn't be able to suspend my disbelief over even if they are well reasoned, but if the reasoning is so bad that it makes me shout "that's complete bullshit!" at the screen, then there's not even a chance

(2) Inconsistent characterization. Comes in all shapes and sizes, but most often as some kind of idiot ball: "Why would they do that?!". It can also be the other way around, for example in a super angsty fic, where Harry has suffered terrible abuses and has been betrayed by all his friends, he then rises up and holds some kind of heroic monologue instead of killing himself. As someone who used to roleplay I despise such disregard for established characters. Any good GM would stop you right there and tell you "No, your character would not do this, he's a Paladin.", right at that moment when you try turn your Lawful Good Paladin into a thief just because it would be convenient.

Edit: I just remembered a fic that had both of these problems in a single chapter. It's called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12986878/1/][The Patronus]]" and I think I've only read the first chapter. Harry there defends himself proudly in the Wizengamot trial without the help of Dumbledore (2) and then it actually works and everyone in the corrupt governemnt is very impressed by his clever reasoning (1). Just, no.

*** I read a fic once where it stated that House Elves were put into an Imperious Charm by wizards, which was an interesting and- to my knowledge- original explanation. What I dislike most of the House-Elves problem is when it is used to make Hermione look stupid: yes, she was an idealist child trying to save a race and was bound to make mistakes in the ways to do it, but her efforts are no reason to bash her- she has bad qualities that could be used, not the fact that she cares...

Sure, I've also read one where it was some kind of huge enslavement ritual or something that bound them all and which is nonreversible or whatever. Then the topic is usually just dropped, as if it was settled. This argument only works if you believe that owning or having power over someone allows you (morally) to do whatever you want to them, which is just pathetic (and probably sociopathic).

But the whole Magical World is about wizards and witches have powers over muggles. The SoS is all about taking the right of choice from muggles by wizards just because they can.

Some time ago I stated that Hermione is just a daughter to her parents and her being witch doesn't give her any powers over them. I was heavily downvoted for such statement.

Therefore any motion for equal rights in the Magical World is meaningless, because it's founded on inequality.

One thing is for you to invest your time to read fanfiction and find out that the author was not writing the story he said he would, because there is a BIG difference between writing a Powerful!

** People changing too abruptly is the main one. If you say 'canon through x book' there had better be a good, reasonable amount of time to shift from canon characterizations. I can take an AU pretty much however extreme if it's an AU, but if Harry's whole personality changes over the course of one summer, that's a bit harder to swallow.

For instance, when within the space of a chapter or two Harry goes from hating Voldemort to calling him up casually to ask for help with homework, that's just a bit too much for me.

Not satisfied with that every woman wants to fuck Harry and he creates an Island- where of course, there will no be any person of colour- and calls it his Kingdom and he has sex with mythical figures there and lots of children with different women-veela.

The author started writing this long notes: first he tried to say that, if read correctly, you could see that Harry was a piece of shit ( yeah, he was, but not a racist- it came out of nowehre) and that it was part of his portrayal as DarkHarry, but then---oh boy, he admitted to being a lonely, sad, white guy living off his fantasies in the writings and that yes, he thought the only solution to the world was to get rid of Africa and Middle East because they proved to be lesser people,despite many chances of becoming better.

Dark Lord Dumbledore in a non crack, canon compliant setting: Similar to the above. Dumbledore had guile aplenty, but he's not Chaotic or Neutral Evil. He doesn't do anything for the lulz. Now, you could make him Voldemort 2.0, but you gotta give him a better motive than steal Harry's gold (he's the most famous, powerful wizard; dude doesn't need gold most like).

If anything, I find teenage fics where everyone is always fucking to be unrealistic. I know some of my peers were sexually active, but I also think fic exaggerates the hell out of it.

I'm not interested in the background character pairs the author came up with, but pretending that it doesn't happen just feels like unnecessary censorship. FFN forbids explicit content, but even movies rated for six and above have sex scenes and nudity (at least by the German rating system).

Statistically speaking, ~80 percent of all students will have had sex by the time they graduate. And most of those will have done it more than once. Add the fact that there's almost no supervision and plenty of room for that kind of activity. It's a miracle that teenage pregnancy isn't through the roof.

If I see the words "creature inheritance" or "right by conquest" that's gone.

If ordinarily normal characters are made grotesquely evil (rapist-Ron, Death Eater Ron, Turning-Harry-Over-To-the-Ministry-Because-He's-Breaking-Rules Hermione, maniacally evil Dumbledore, etc.) that's gone.

Harems aren't even entertained (not because I actually care about such relationships, but because those stories always suck).

Not as serious as the above, but I don't even bother with Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny (unless it's so minor as to not be worth mentioning in the story). They hold no interest for me.

CC was only referenced to show the idea that Draco *realistically* getting on with a Muggleborn is silly given he ended up with a pureblood (though has JKR been entirely responsible for CC, it's doubtful she would have written it that way, to say nothing of the play's plot holes).

i mean, the law of the wizarding world clearly didn't think so, since neither snape or malfoy are behind bars. harry doesn't think so, since he named a child after him. putting him behind bars has no rehabilitative use, because he's already reformed. it has no preventative use, because he's of no danger to anyone: he /serves/ the interest of anti-DE efforts.

**** The word counts point is correct, the others are not. It's just not a believable thing to take the canon portrayals of those characters and keep suspension of disbelief (for me, in any case). Voldemort is presented as thoroughly, eternally, immutably evil from birth. Snape is presented as , yes someone with a trouble home life, but also someone who was enamored with the Dark Arts before he even got his wand. Someone who almost immediately was palling around with known hateful people as friends, and a thoroughly mean and unlikable person who drove away his only decent friend because he was known to be hateful of people who were otherwise the same as her. Changing either of these after the fact immediately makes me realize: "This story makes no sense". The same for "Ron the rapist" or cartoon-villain Dumbledore. They take character flaws and elevate them to the realm of gross evil.

As for H/G, well, I can keep my suspension of disbelief as long as it's done properly. But it's true that I also don't like it.

Or if it is the whole " Slytherins are good/Gryffindors are bad" I could actually deal with it if it was a comedy.

I really hate pureblood Hermione and I agree with the whole Harry-Lord Potter-Slytherin-Black, especially when it is a an excuse for multiple pairings but I do confess to have read some fics gone this all and had a good time.

The thing for me is, if you are coming up with an atrocious AU, you either must write very well or be really funny.

Anything where Harry is a racist is a no-no for me...

PS: I am currently writing three fics with ridiculous A.U: one Hermione has been sexually dominating Draco since the Yule Ball; another where Ron panics and gives Hermione a love potion, then she panics, time travels and adopts Tom Riddle; and another where Harry Potter has a twin who is fucking everyone for Power. The only way I could do it is being openly comical in the Dramione pairing; going for tragedy in the Ron rapist and the last one, my Potter twin will have some sort of revenge on Snape and Malfoy in the end...

and , well, I must admit I simply LOVE a good Dumbles bashing- the more ridiculous the better, but not the ones where he is so evil that he turned poor orphan Tom Riddle into Lord Voldermot.

** I'll be the first to admit I have a very high tolerance for poor writing, inconsistency, etc. There are a lot of things that kind of take me aback (in regards to disbelief, not just things I don't like to see), but I can keep reading a lot of them. The only things I can think of that is a hard limitation (strictly due to disbelief) is young characters (we're talking YOUNG like 5-8ish) talking and acting like adults, but like, once they're in school, I kind of just power through it. I don't know really know why, but that's like the one thing that just goes too far out of the realm of belief that I usually stop there or a chapter or two later. There are some others that other people mentioned (like Snape with underage characters or harems), but that's more a thing I don't like to read, not so much a disbelief limitation. I think a really obvious racist thing (like the example you gave with FtLoM) would make me stop, too, but I think it would be less from disbelief and more being uncomfortable about it (and there's probably stories I've read with racist undertones that I didn't catch or think about at the time, too, if I'm fair).

*** I mean, anything that affects the story to such a level as that you are completely taken out of the world the author is trying to build would fit in the question I was posing; a racist Harry, IMO , not only does not fit with the overall themes, but distracts from the reading, so it is deeply subjective what breaks your suspension of disbelief to the point you cannot read or enjoy a fic.

**** That's fair, and I definitely agree it's very subjective. There are certainly things that take me out of the world the author built (things that don't fit with the themes or are distracting as well), but there's not a lot that would make me straight out drop the story BECAUSE of that reason. Or maybe I guess there's just a lot of overlap? Off the top of my head, I've dropped stories because it went from serious to suddenly crack!fic out of nowhere which I guess falls under OOC, but it would have to be mid-way, not just OOC from the start. I guess I just find myself pretty easily immersed in the story? I don't necessarily NEED the build up/whole redemption thing that I see other people mentioning (which is completely fair, those are great to have), but I just kind of... take in what the author starts with and go from there I guess? I feel like I'm having a bit of trouble describing what I mean. lol From my first post, I think the best I can describe it is just having a really high tolerance to less than great writing...

** I dont mind OOC or AU, as long as plot & characters seem to follow some logic. They don't have to be logical... but a batshit crazy char needs to act batshit crazy.

Characters shouldn't just know stuff that happens in canon (unless thats somehow part of the story?) or react or predict canon events. I see that and I'm out.

When an AU starts hitting stations of canon, I'm out.

When our hero starts gathering titles, properties, bloodlines, etc.. expressed as lists of names discovered by friendly goblins in some BS ritual.... I'm out (and laughing).

When your protagonist becomes so OP theres no drama / tension / challenge... I'm out

No, I don't want to read another shopping excursion.

No I don't want some senseless character bashing because you can't figure out another way to ditch the characters you don't like.

No I don't want your manipulative Dumbledore where the plot holes are bigger than the plot.

** Generally I would be interested in seeing death eaters and how they sold their propaganda. I mean Rowling tried a nazi allegory but it was kind of shallow in some respects. It would make for a great chilling fic that had Draco spouting things which wouldn't sound out of place in 1940s Germany. Or hell even what white supremists would say in the 90s, basically parroting his father.

Hell I still don't know why we didn't get Draco making some snide and gross comment about Weasleys ‘breeding like muggles'. A death eater would /so/ be all over talking about overpopulation and wrinkling their noses at what would be an allegory for ‘the poor' or you know ‘not european'.

There's be bs about how muggles were an infectious disease.

But all too many fics go too far and instead has the author buying into the death eaters viewpoint completely. It's pretty disturbingly misanthropic honestly given the fact we're all obviously... the canon fodder the DEs would want to kill if they were real.

Also super!Harry fics are boring. Especially if they make him the heir of 15 family fortunes or destinies. Making him an heir to a founder is always terrible.

Like one interesting thing about Harry is he wasn't really all that magically special. And honestly the one thing that made him stand out and aided him to do things others couldn't (speaking to snakes) was really down to the actions of his muggleborn mother in a sense.

Which in a way is kind of fitting in a book series where blood supremacy is y'know bad. It's bad you guys.

*** Chapter 38- after admiting that he made Harry sexually abuse Narcisa by ways of changing her brain to the point she was just a slave, making Professor Septima into Harry´s sex toy, and giving harem a harem of Veelas just because he wanted him to have even more sex, he says women are just throwing themselves at Harry because those like Power and Money- not even thinking what he said about Narcissa´s situation ( where she is a slave and thus, has no say in it) and Septima ( who is Harry´s Professor and as such, is in a professional relationship with him where she has the Power)

Then he goes and calls the reviwers who had a problem with the sheer amount of Big Dick Harry was having and found it odd that ALL females of some worth were just going bonkers and fucking him without a second thought "butthurt feminists" and says that they will have to suck his balls if they are unable to convince him that he had, at some point LOST TOUCH with plausibility in seeking to fulfil his crazy tendencies.

The problem with me is: you go ahead and write Harry Big Dick fucking everything that moves and everyone enjoying it, but at LEAST admit this scenario is crack,

As for the racism: Rant for chapter 53 where he calls to simply ignore the recent history of colonialism in Africa and the protectorades in Middle East because their backstories "do not matter" and Harry would " snear at a slave for not castingoff their own chains..."among other thingsm including insulting reviewers confirming it is his wold view etc,etc, etc

**** I just read what he had to say in chapter 38 and it was nothing at all like you said. He didn't say most women nor a lot of women threw themselves at men with power and money. He said some women which isn't a lie at all due to human biology. It even happens to men flocking to women or men to men or women to women. It's particularly true for me as I am literally sexually attracted to people with power given that I am a sub. It's a different type of power, true, (Especially given that I'm a lesbian), but my very existence is a basic argument in support of his claim.

Calling them butthurt feminists is wrong as well as, even though I thoroughly despise feminism, it's a wrong attempt to categorize people who disagree with him into a single group so that he can attempt to throw hate onto them. It's very similar to calling people who disagree with you Nazis. If you label someone bad, then you don't have to think about what they say. I imagine he views feminists in a negative light, so the effect is "You disagree with me, I don't listen to feminists, and you're a feminist therefore I don't have to listen to you."

As for Narcisa, I read that recently and I can tell you it wasn't abuse per se. It was more like Narcisa being a prostitute for Harry until Harry uses his sex magic on her enough to where she wants it. I'll admit that this segment is a bit sketchy, but I would label it as wish fulfilment rather than sexism.

As for most women throwing themselves at Harry, that makes him a poor writer if he doesn't admit that's what he's doing. It doesn't make him sexist. The fact that Veela have a canonical reason for being attracted to him in this story causing me to exclude them to only look at the other human characters.

I will admit that his views on Muslims are rather bigoted, but that isn't racism. That's hating on the religion and not the people. The context used was referring to those speaking of/to Allah, so it's a very fair assumption to make he was only talking about Muslims at that time and not whatever specific Middle Eastern country they hail from. This is further reinforced by the same vein of language being applied to Christians.

Although it is clearly personal hatred invading the story, it isn't exactly OOC. Harry has demonstrated he hates ignorance and people who don't respect reality (Magic in that world) and believe whatever they feel like. Harry views religious people in just that way, so it isn't out of character to hate on them. This isn't racism; it's bigotry or discrimination or whatever other word you choose. Unless you have some other evidence to provide that is.

And I hate this author. His story got progressively worse and there's nothing more I hate than someone who refuses to accept criticism. I particularly hate authors who tell a bad story, reject criticism, and *rant about it inside of the chapters where the actually story is supposed to go.* Unless you have more evidence, these are my conclusions.

***** You read Narcissa´s bits and I admit there is a "prostitute" vibe, but both the auhor and Harry´s POV explain whta he is doing with her brain, and, since she is being changed into sumission to his will, I do find this relationship to be out of my comfort zone yes.

There is light sexism- like the old James Bond´s movies, and a somewhat perversive sexism like this one: the author is not saying that women are worth less than men, he is simply working with situations where women are just means to an end and when most of relationships portrayed are transgressions- it is tintilatting for the sake of tintilating.

The notes are clear in that, he keeps adding sexual scenes because he feels there is not enough of it, not because the cracaters would go there; I admit that, as an author, it is your prerrogative- I mean, JK simply has Hermione going over to the Weasleys like her parents, who do not see her for 10 months, would not care just because the narrative say so- but with this story in paricular, I struggle NOT to find this story sexist.

What i believe is that the author did not go out to write a sexist tale, all he wanted was to have Big Dick Harry and the sexism stamms for that.

But, no, I refer to the author´s words; to say it is not like I said is to say the author did not say what he did.

If you must analyse what racism is, legally th definition, at least in Brasil is : to forbid someone from doing something based on race. Using a racial slur ( mudblood) is not racism, but preventing a muggle born, for instance, to use magic is racism.

I say that because you differetiate racism from discrimation when speaking about the author: you are intelligent enough to understand when I used the word racism, that I meant someone who sees another group of people as inferior based on race...

As for religion bigotry not being racism: it actually goes hand in hand. The fact of the matter is that he refers to a geography in his writings- Middle East- but defend his views using the Religion that is majoritaly followed in the area. Everybody knows that the reality in Middle East is a complicated melting pot where old tribes and different interpretations of their Religion, added with centuries of clashes with Europe, makes the area instable.

Or at least everone should have; the author is racist, yes, because he, by his own admission, feels that their past History does not matter: they- Middle Easterns- as a group, are underdevelop and the fact they follow this Religion is uded by author as the main reason for this. So, yes, he refers to the people that live in Middle East and the Religion bit is, in his view, just part of the explanation.

Again, you can understand otherwise, but, if I say, for instance, that the whole South America is a very violent place ( fact) and that they mostly follow an irrational Religion ( opinion) which shows that they are not people cpable of high understanding (prejudice) and that, regardless of centuries of colonialism, the fact they have not caught up with Europe is the sign of their limited intelligence , then yes...I think I can safely call this person a racist- there are different peoples, of different religion living in South America and they can hardly be called a race, but it is the same generalization he is doing with Middle Easterns, and for that matter, it means, as he says over and over again, that he does not care to make a differentiation.

Harry is racist in the story because the author is racist; he has an intelectual explanation for his racism, which does not mean that it is not racism; the fact he confuses or seems to use Religion as part of explanation why the many PEOPLES of a singular region are all unworthy of even immigrating to Europe( they close their borders) is as racist as it gets. It does not have to be " I hate to see all those brown skinned people with their silly clothes wlaking around the strees) to be racist...

But again, it is up to interpretation; the story gets worse, there are some pretty obvious passages, and I admit that the author´s behavior actually makes the thing even worse...
