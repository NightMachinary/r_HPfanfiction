** I have a fondness for lilyevans30's work - In Case of Emergency and Firsts, for example.

Of course, when Annerb does smut she does it fantastically, so We Can't Control (Watch Me Unfold) is excellent.

And finally, TheDistantDusk has some excellent naughty pieces, so check those out.

** I am reading Golden Boy by boyifyouknew on wattpad.

I know, I know wattpad sucks. But I got recommended this story and it's good so I endure the site. It's Fred Weasley plus OC but the OC is left pretty vague to be more like a reader insert I guess (like no mentions of hair color and stuff). It's post hogwarts it's 35 chapters in I think WIP. Lots of Ginny Harry Hermione Ron and George (they all practically live together). I mean there is somewhat a plot but it's mainly just friendship themes and smut. The twins store collabs with an adult performer for a line of magical s*x toys that interestingly are magicked to recognize consent which I thought was a nice touch. Anyway the toys make for some interesting scenes.

** Alright, this is, I'm pretty sure, my all time favorite HP smut. It's hilarious and ridiculous and super-multi and has a vague plot thread that actually makes the smut the central focus of the plot in a wonderful way - a bunch of the returning 8th years decide that the best way to cap off their schooling is to make a little pornographic booklet of solos, couples, and moresomes getting explicit in various locations around the school, courtesy of some niche charms and extra-long exposure wizarding film. There definitely is Harry/Draco action, but they also fuck a ton of other people, and other people fuck each other, so I don't think this specifically applies as Drarry since you said multis were fine.

  Harry and Draco write their own version of Hogwarts: A History, detailing their quest to christen as many rooms in the castle as possible. A silly, smutty slash adventure. Warnings for slash, explicit sexual content and language. H/D multiple pairings
