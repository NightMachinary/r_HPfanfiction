The curiosity arose now when someone suggested in a post "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" and "The Prince of Slytherin". Both are widely recommended and I would really like to read them. However they are both +1 million words and I don't have the time to read such a long fic right now, nor do I want to invest in such a long story only to realize that after 500k words the story is heading in a direction I'm not interested in. Therefore, I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering whether do you know of a place where I could read the synopsis of the story and if I like it, I may actually try to read the full story.


** Both have numerous reviews and threads on DLP. You should be able to get a general impression of the fic from those. The DLP reviews are never just a fanfest, so you should be able to pick up some details and issues with the fic that might turn you off.

** Are you just asking about those two, or did you want summaries of some of the other long stories/series?

**** I can't help much with those specific two, sorry. I read some of Dark Kingdom, but didn't come close to finishing it, and wasn't overly impressed by it. What I recall is that Voldemort had won and taken over, orphaned or Muggle-born magical children were brought into the Wizarding world and made to forget their prior families, and Voldemort took an interest in tutoring Harry because he's a Parselmouth. I haven't read Prince of Slytherin at all.

I'm familiar with some other long stories, like The Pureblood Pretense, Innocent, and The Peace Not Promised, if you want summaries of those.

**** The Prince of Slytherin is an extremely popular wrong-boy-who-lived story that tries to subvert all the tropes of that usual plotline - for example, Lockhart has a reason for being incompetent, Harry might not be the WBWL, Dumbledore is manipulative but not evil and there's a reason behind it, etc. During the first couple years, Harry is sorted into Slytherin, his brother is sorted into Gryffindor, they fight, Harry takes over Slytherin house with cleverness and snark, etc.

Plot isn't really the most important thing in this fic - there's a lot of hard worldbuilding and magic creep to try to justify a bunch of the tropes; this is the reason it's on 1.2m words and still in third year. It's a bit overblown for me, but it's definitely well-written and enjoyable. I think linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived) were better takes on the WBWL premise that, despite being abandoned, are better-fleshed-out stories with more subjective worldbuilding, and much shorter too.

The long fics I'd consider really worth your time (that I've read): Alexandra Quick, either Albus Potter series, the Stygian Trilogy, The Arithmancer, The Accidental Animagus, Pureblood Pretense, Lippert's James Potter series.

Long fics that I have as guilty pleasures: Cupboard series, A Darker Shade of Light, Chronicle of Halo Wiggins, Fabula Post Bellum, The Belmont Legacy, A Second Chance at Life, Aebbe's House of Cards series, Guardian of Azkaban, They Shook Hands, Claw of the Raven series, Saga of the Lightning Speaker, Harry McGonagall, The Prince of Slytherin, Alissie's Rose Weasley series.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
