I always wondered why so few stories deal with that issue. Molly is trying to break up her son's engagement by setting him up in front of his fiancee, Bill is kinda a dick for not doing anything about the whole mess, Ginny is overall awful, Ron is drooling and even Hermione just goes along with the Fleur "bashing". Are there any fics in which Harry finds that behaviour problematic and does something about it?

I don't care much about romances in this request but please no canon pairings or slash.


** Hermione doesn't "go along with it", she dislikes Fleur just as much as the others. If they need calling out, she should be called out on it too. (Also, Fleur was rather unpleasant, too.)

** Molly isn't trying to break up their engagement, I feel a lot of people missintreperted that part. THat's something Ginny says to rationalize the why Molly is inviting tonks more. However, we find out later than Molly is fully aware Tonks like Lupin, and she's trying to get them together so they can work it out.

And the whole thing about "I think she invites Tonks so often, because she intents to Bill fall for her instead" is just Ginnys "mindset"? Wow, i havent had this in mind. But then, the HBP is the least liked Book for me, so i didnt payed that much attention.

*** Molly might not be trying to break Fleur and Bill, but she has overtly shown enough animosity towards the potential union that it has convinced Ginny that Molly is trying to set up Bill and Tonks. Which in turn makes Ginny dislike Fleur more than she already does , as she probably views Fleur as taking Bill away from the family. I don't remember if it's Fanon or Canon that Bill was the nicest of her brothers to her. Hermione is just jealous that Ron is paying so much attention to Fleur.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** The thing about it is Fleur comes off as a bit rude, too. And Harry isn't necessarily her biggest fan. He doesn't actively dislike her, but he is annoyed with her at times during the Triwizard tournament and simply put, she is not the type of person Harry would be friends with.

I agree that Molly comes off bad in this whole subplot. She is cool to her son's fiance, and actively tries to sabotage their engagement by inviting Tonks over. Everyone else can be excused as simply personalities not meshing, combined with tight quarters and the fact that they are immature kids, to create hostilities. And if Ginny's perspective is true, Fleur treats her like a child, which is Ginny's biggest pet peeve. Hermione I'm actually less sympathetic towards as her anger stems from Ron mooning over Fleur, which is nothing Fleur can control.

**** Didn't say he did, but recall during the Triward she dismissed him as a little boy. (which also lends support to Ginny's version of events concerning how Fleur treats her). I think Harry was rather indifferent to her and while he wouldn't criticize her, he isn't too put off with the women of the house doing so. The fact that they all say kind things about Tonks, who Harry likes, probably blunts any negative feelings he might have towards how they talk about Fleur.

***** Not necessarily true. She's written from a sort of "not like the other girls" perspective imo. It was always really glaring to me that she didn't really seem to have many female friends besides Ginny. And I think the whole "all the other girls are shallow/catty/not as brilliant" or "girls don't get along with other girls" things are bullshit. I love Hermione, but I've noticed that when people write her or talk about her, they tend to ignore her very obvious flaws: a tendency to be judgemental and narrow-minded.

*** Hermione's reaction is understandable if one considers the entirety of canon. Not excusable - but understandable.

Fleur's introduced as a beautiful girl who makes heads spin due to her Veela heritage. Ron is immediately stupid attracted to her, and makes a fool of himself staring st her. Strike one.

She then insults “leetle boy” her best friend after the Goblet. Strike two.

Then, after the first task she is asked to the ball - however poorly - by Ron. The seeds of R/Hr were obvious even then if you looked for them, even if Hermione herself doesn't decide until Book 7. Strike three, but we aren't done.

Krum is then DQ from the third task for attacking her. While Krum was under the imperius, at this point Krum and Hermione are at least friendly, given that they do become pen pals. The Cruciatus is an Unforgivable, and under Imperius or not, Krum will likely see a courtroom for this. Strike four.

Fleur then, at the end of GoF, all but hits on Harry. Since Harry is clueless, Hermione recognizes it and sees someone as moving in on her friend. Strike five.

Over the summer holidays at the burrow in HBP (Fleur is off screen for OP), she is loudly critical of Molly, her housekeeping, and the state of things. She is also blunt and offputting to Hermione's only female friend, Ginny. She makes little effort to get along with her to-be in laws, and Hermione is nothing if not steadfast. Strike six.

Then, over the Christmas holidays at the Burrow, Fleur is again an ungrateful guest, displaying much the same spoiled brat behavior. Fleur specifically insults Celestina Warbeck who is Molly's favorite singer. Strike Seven.

Once Bill is savaged by Greyback, her first response is to recoil in horror. Strike Eight. Once confronted, she gets highly defensive, but then says that she is “beautiful enough for both of them.” Strike Nine. God almighty, can one girl be conceited enough?

Finally at the start of DH, Fleur gets to play exposition, which has always been Hermione's job, after the Seven Potters fiasco. Strike Ten.

Since Hermione gets a case of the stupid in HBP and DH, with numerous other writers discussing how OOC she is throughout both compared to earlier canon, I won't discuss it here. Suffice to say, in her mind, Hermione is quite justified - in her own mind - to treat Fleur poorly.

Strike one: So you mean that Hermione dislike Fleur for her Veela heritage? That means that she isn't better than the purebloods who dislike her for her muggle heritage.

Strike two: If she treats Fleur poorly for calling him "leetle boy", shouldn't she absolutely hate Ron for insulting him, abondoning him etc...?

Strike three: She was asked by Krum and already accepted the invitation. I know that Hermione is selfish but still...

Strike four: Doesn't make any sense, you said it yourself, Krum was under the imperius. And if Malfoy managed to avoid Azakaban with this excuse, an international superstar like Krum could too. I understand that you probably are a Hermione fanatic, but try to make sense.

Strike five: She didn't hit on Harry.

Strike six: None of this happened.

Strike seven: She criticized a singer. Big deal.

Strike eight: Of course she would recoil in horor! How would you feel if your loved one just got an accident? Laugh?

Strike nine: She was trying to break the sad atmosphere. And don'T be jealous of a beautiful person knowing it. I'm good at math and can say "I'm good at math". Why can't she say the same thing?

***** I will attempt to clarify, since you misrepresented or misinterpreted virtually every point I made.

Overall. Please consider - Hermione is written to be a teenage girl. She is not as rational as an adult, nor does she think like one. You can't apply adult thought to a teenager and be in any way successful, most of the time.

1.  She is mad at Fleur for Ron's reaction, not for her heritage. You intentionally misrepresented my argument.

2.  At that time, in canon, she is attempting to be a peacemaker between H and R. Someone coming in and casting aspersions on her best friend who doesn't know him or what he has been through is insulting to Hr.

3.  Canon is vague on when Viktor asks Hermione. Had Ron asked right away, perhaps she would have gone with him. Canon also states that Harry and Ron waited until very late to find dates. My point stands.

4.  Ad hominem attacks don't avail you. I am not a fanatic of any character. It is the hallmark of a weak argument to insult the arguer. To expand upon my point: As any celebrity can tell you, even if you're actually innocent (or found not guilty, which is not the same thing) of an accusation, being forced to defend oneself in court or in the court of public opinion does irreparable harm to one's reputation. And, of course, if you're actually guilty, it's worse. See: Tom Brady, Ezekiel Elliott, Ronaldo, Kobe Bryant, or any Hollywood dirtbag caught up in the #metoo wave. Being accused of committing one of the three worst crimes in Wizarding Britain, even with extenuating circumstances, would not benefit Krum or his career.

5.  Saying that she hopes she will see Harry again, which she does, can be interpreted that way. I'm sure no woman has ever gotten jealous of a pretty woman saying they want to see someone again. /s

6.  It can be inferred. Additionally, she is critical of the OWLs system too, but point conceded.

7.  So you won't mind if a guest in your house tells you that your favorite band or singer is (expletive deleted) then? Especially around Christmas? Manners are important.

8.  No, I wouldn't. Sorry. Not if it is someone I loved. Not showing that reaction helps people overcome their own aversion to their condition.

9.  You didn't refute my point, you justified Fleur being stuck up.

10. Um, wrong. Aftermath of 7 Potters is in Chapter 5, DH. Wedding is Chapter 6. And again - you assume Hermione is strictly and always rational. She isn't.

And finally - my very first sentence was that her reaction was understandable, not excusable. Just saying it again for those who didn't read it the first time.

****** 1.  I will give you this point. I never understood jealousy in a romantic way.

2.  Fleur calling Harry "leetle boy" hapened before the rift between H and R. Plus, now that I think about it, how would she know about it? Harry never was one who would complain a lot. He tried to hide his hand from Hermione when he was tortured by Umbridge, so would he really tell her about it? (Not sure about this point to be honest.)

3.  Same as 1.

4.  Sorry about the attack on you then. But my point is that we are in the wirarding word, where Malfoy claimed being under the Imperius spell, and still enjoy a somewhat good reputation. Friend with the minister, invited to prime seats during the Quidditch Tournament Finale. Besides, I find it hard to believe that even Hermione (and God know that I hate her), would blame Fleur for being tortured. Would you blame someone for being raped just because the rapist was your friend?

5.  Again, I don't see that as hitting on Harry (we already saw earlier that she had view on Bill) but even if she was, why should Hermione care? She isn't in love with Harry. She like Ron (and Krum).

6.  Glad to read it.

7.  It depends on how close the person is, and how she insulted him. I don't mind a debate. But point conced, Fleur and Molly weren't buddy at the time.

8.  Bill was unconcious at the time, so it was normal to show her true reaction. Plus I don't think you can really tell what you would do in her place until you are actually in her place. When my friend got caught in a car accident and had a horrible scar on his face, I couldn't help but wince because of the damage. I don't see him in a romantic way, he is one of my best friend but still...

9.  My point is that you can brag about your strength, be it natural or "acquired". If we can't then Hermione is more to blame for all the times she showed off how good she can learn from books.

10. You're right about the order. But still hating someone because of some stupid exposition is ridiculous.

I half agree with you, her reaction is not excusable, but she don't have a reason. When you are invited, you don't insult the fiancé of a member of the family who invited you. She should learn from Harry a little.

** I'd note that nearly all of the comments in this thread (including this one) violate rule 7 for the sub. Rule 7 is a stupid, ineffectual rule that is inconsistently (if ever) enforced.

Can we all just agree that it's irrelevant and remove it from the rules?

** This would have to be an extremely edgy Harry. One of those fics where he screams at Dumbledore in a ridiculous fashion and makes an overall ass of himself while still succeeding because the author is an edgy teen himself.

First Molly doesn't try to set them up. She is trying to help Tonks with Remus.She dislikes Fleurs behavior but still is polite enough. Second there is no proof of them either being awful in Fleurs face nor when Bill is around sohim doing nothing seems like his only option. (Only time he could have spoken up was with the christmas sweaters.) Ginny is a 14 yr old girl who gets talked condecendingly by an 19 yr old girl.Of course she will be awful.\\
Ron is drooling because she is a Veela which is still gross but totally natural. Hermione is in general not pleasant towards others so that's normal behavior too.

I'm not sure why Harry would do something? Seems the start of a bashing fest to me.

**** There is a difference. But since there is no real reason to do what you want Harry to do. It really becomes part of that edgy cliche where Harry is calling everyone out on everything.

****** No not really. Than you would change Harry in the edgy little douchebag that steals fiancees. That would defeat the purpose of calling them out.

No in canon there is no reason they say Harry should have called them out
