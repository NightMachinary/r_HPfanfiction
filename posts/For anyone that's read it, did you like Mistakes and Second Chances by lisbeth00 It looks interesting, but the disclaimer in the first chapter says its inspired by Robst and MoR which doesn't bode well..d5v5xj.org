I read the descriptions of the first two chapters and they don't really make me any more confident. I don't want to read 100k words of trash for the small chance that it gets better.


** Heya! This is the writer.

So, that disclaimer I put up on the first chapter was my way of saying "This is what I had assumed to be enjoyed and popular, and quickly realized is not."

I had begun writing that fic very soon after getting into fanfiction as a whole, and all I had read thus far had been stories along those lines.

About twelve, maybe thirteen chapters in I realized what a horrible mistake (haha) I had made and did my damndest to pull away from that mess.

If you have no interest in reading the silly, shitty portion of the story, there's a big ol' self deprecating summary to help you bypass the bad.

I'd like to think my story is worth reading, but I'm not going to be hurt if you don't enjoy it.

**** They weren't inspired by it, but they definitely had an effect on my early writing for the story.

I had no idea what was popular or 'wanted' - so to say - so I looked at what had topped the charts over the years and used it as a foundation for my story.

Essentially, I used it to prop up the story I created without knowing any better, but I quickly realized after reading more and more stories that it wasn't the wisest choice.

Afterwards I did my best to rectify it with an extensive edit of my already posted chapters, setting up later plot points that I utilized to subvert or explain the overuse of tropes at the beginning, while trying to ignore the ones that I couldn't reasonably work into the later plot in a reasonable manner.

** I don't know and am often in your position, just remember you can drop it after 1000 words or 5000 words or 20000 words, it's your life. If you think it'll be bad, find something else, if you think it's worth risking 5000 words, just read that many.

*** I could, but I'd rather ask people. That's part of the point of having a community. I can benefit from the people that have come across it before me and get their opinions. Whenever I come across a story that ends up being shit but that I'm interested in reading, I end up wasting at least a day of reading time figuring it out. It will be easier and quicker to just have people to tell me it's a waste of time if it's terrible.

** In the begining it has a lot of tropes (Manipulative!Dumbledore, Maste of Death stuff, etc) but it gets a lot better and if you're a fan of new and powerful Magic being introduced then this story is definitely for you. And in my opinion it has nothing to do with Robst besides using a few of the tropes that he has also used (but are now used in probably over half of AU stories). It does have a Fem!Harry and a Fem!Slash pairing, though that should be obvous from the summary I think.

PS: When I read the first chapters I had feared that it would end up being a weird transgender/ Male in female body type story, but luckily Harrys gender change is accepted easily by her and it doesn't lead to massive drama, so you're okay if you feared that, which you probably didn't anyway xD

So all in all I would say a decent story. Certainly readable and enjoyable.

*** Its the same with Son of Potter, Daughter of Black. You have a lot of overused tropes that lay the groundwork, but once they start focusing in on their own ideas rather than the tried and true ones then the stories become much more enjoyable reads overall.

** I read it last year and remember being pretty obsessed about it. I'm actually stoked as /hell/ to see that it is updating :-D

It starts dark, stays dark and gets darker at times. Engage the safeties on every trigger you have, maybe have a whisky and it can be great fun.

So yeah, I recommend it heartily. In fact, I'm gonna put down my current book to re-read this heavy bastard along with you.

Edit: So I caught up with the final chapter and preeeetty much stand by my comments. It has some slow and rough spots between chapters 4 and 12

*** I dunno, I get it. Both are filled with overindulgence. Of course this is fanfiction, so it doesn't really matter.

Robst does it the safest way by writing essentially the same thing over and over again with different scenarios.

MoR does it with technical explanation and characterization (issue is I don't enjoy either in this story).
