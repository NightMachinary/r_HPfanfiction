Just finished Survival Is A Talent on ao3 and it was an absoute masterpiece. Now I'm craving for good Draco fics where he helps the trio solve their yearly troubles and sometimes maybe gets his friends to help too. Any recs? :<


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code][The code]] by Aduro is a really good one, it has like 3 sequels too. It's currently being rewritten, tho the original is still up . Draco doesn't really join the trio till the next fic in the series but its worth reading through

** The series starting with /Innocent/ by MarauderLover7 contains an interesting take on Draco. The AU gives him a twin that takes his usual role as arrogant Slytherin bigot while Draco himself is set on a path that puts him into Harry's group of friends. I enjoy his character arc because it's well-developed, believable, and sets him up to add a completely different dynamic to how Harry's generation fights Voldemort.

Mild spoiler about his character direction as of the most recent book, if you want to know what to look forward to: He's being set up to be the double agent Snape could have been if he wasn't such a shitty person, with a personal loyalty to Harry.

The only reason I would hesitate to recommend it for your specific request is there's a lot of Draco-free content to get through pre-Hogwarts, but as a general recommendation it's one of the series that I look forward to the most.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
