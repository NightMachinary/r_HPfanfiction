Having just finished linkao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14251194]])

I was wondering if you could toss other stories my way featuring a non-evil Bella, preferably without main pairing being Slash..


** I'll throw the popular linkffn(Murder Most Horrid) out there, though the pairing /is/ slash and rather proeminent. It's popular enough that someone was bound to mention it, anyway. At any rate, strong points of this fic include a genuinely engaging "crime/detective story" feel, good mysteries, and a well-crafted AU, complete with a /very/ clever way of revealing how it came to be. Not perfect, but an enjoyable read nonetheless.

Well, I'd read that if it would refer to a good sucker punch.

**** Femslash /is/ a kind of slash, though. It's in the name. If it's specifically male slash (or specifically Drarry) that you wanted to exclude, you should probably have said so.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  Harry Potter has always had to be more adult than he really is. His aunt and uncle being abusive to him, then finding out he was a famous wizard at the mere age of 11... Going on to fight for good... He never really had much of a childhood, until one person decides to throw everything aside to give him what he needs most. ((Bad at summaries!))

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** This is surprisingly rare. From what I've gathered around here and on Tumblr, Bellamione basically has to include a shitton of angst, Bella has to be truly evil (at least until she meets Hermione), has to be a devout follower of Voldemort and so on. Whereas Harry ships whitewash her into oblivion and/or turn her into fanon!Hermione (so no Centaur gang rapes, only studying and chaste cuddles).

There are quite a few ones where she is shipped with Harry and is not a piece of shit, but those usually go too far in that direction. Perhaps the best out of that lot is linkffn(12317784), but for some reason, half of the time travel ones include some sort of duelling tournament as filler (and Harry never wins due to some technicality). "Passageways" deserves an honorary mention because it had a good Harry/Bella interaction before it got bogged down in "politics" and was abandoned.

If you are patient, there is linkffn(12101842), which might actually become the first decent harem fic (I know, hard to believe) despite being Harry/Tonks/Lily/Bella. The author is known for quality but updates are slow.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
