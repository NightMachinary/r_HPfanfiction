** Slytherin = Evil

If slytherins were inherently malevolent, then wouldn't Dumbledore be standing behind the sorting stool with the Sword of Gryffindor, ready to decapitate anyone who got a Slytherin sorting? No. Slytherins are, according to the Sorting Hat, cunning and ambitious. Now, at some point someone mentions that most dark wizards were Slytherins, and that does make sense. After all, a dark lord without ambition is hardly a dark lord at all, and without cunning would be picked off by Aurors before they had more than a handful of followers. However, someone leaning towards darkness may find themselves in Ravenclaw as they search for the optimal spell to make their enemies quiver. They may find themselves in Hufflepuff, not afraid to do the work necessary to succeed where others have failed and able to bring others along, not because of fear, but of respect and loyalty. They may find themselves Gryffindors, standing up to a society they think is broken (after all, one becomes a dark lord because they are unhappy with the current state of affairs. Whether or not they are correct may vary, but they see themselves as right), and willing to risk everything to change it.

In summery, not all Slytherins are dark, and not all darks are Slytherins.

Hell, I read a good fic a while back that involved Harry befriending Ron on the train, getting sorted into Slytherin, and Ron promptly telling him to go suck a basilisk egg while Harry is confused about where he went wrong, because not all Slytherins are evil, let alone him.

** [[/u/Starfox5]] generally depicts Magical Britain as advanced and progressive vs other magical countries. Magical France really sucks in his fics.

[[/u/Full-Paragon]] depicts MACUSA only marginally better than Voldemort.

And of course, JKR's Magical USA, as depicted in FB, is also significantly worse than Magical Britain.

So yes, I kind agree that Magical Britain was probably a lot better than other Magical countries, even though its Ministry of Magic was still a piece of shit by any standard.

I don't think "by any standard" is fair. The Ministry clerks as such may have been corrected, but the system itself works well enough, and its laws are reasonable and progressive except where it concerns nonhumans. In my book, I'd consider it better than a Ministry like 1920's M.A.C.U.S.A. that may make trains run on time but has institutionalized bigotry right there in the books.

*** I would note that my portrayal of MACUSA is highly dependent on what my plot needs. If I needed them to be competent and effective, they would be. I'm not bound by any headcannon, only the needs of the story.

  Murica. Where Wizarding America is a land of sunshine and rainbows where racism and government corruption are fairy tales told to children.

My headcanon has MACUSA only holding the East Coast, probably from Georgia to Newfoundland, with a federation of First Nations groups holding most of the rest. There's a French enclave that sends their kids to Beauxbatons.

** I'm trying to make each magical nation in my stories have their own positives and negatives. :) Like I make magical britain extremely progressive about gender and sexuality and the like, but crappy when it comes to corruption. My magical America is a high organized crime, dangerous place with lots of mafias and crime syndicates and stuff, BUT it has better and looser anti-discrimination and protection laws when it comes to muggleborns and their families, and doing magic in the muggle world. My magical Africa has way more advanced laws about magical nonhuman races, but it has lots of dangerous beasts around and a low population so nobody really wants to live there. Plus it's easier to get away with crimes.

I don't know what I'm going to make magical russia or france yet, but I'll decide when I get there! :)

The executive summary of Russian history is "it got worse", and IDK about anyone else but I'd be amused if it turned out that magic was involved somehow. Not necessarily deliberate or malicious, but still somehow magical in nature.

** - as you said - America/Australia being the greatest, safest, most ideal place ever with wisest, nicest people
- Marry Sue'Garry Sue, super power, Mag etc. fic, I hate characters without flaws who know everything, can do everything easly and generally no obstacles pose any difficulties for them. It's boring and unbelievable and the writers seem to always simplify the rules that govern magic
- bashing fics, there are exceptions but usually the characters that are receiving said bashing aren't even a bit similar to their literary prototypes

** - 'Mione. Used once, by Ron with his mouthful.

- "The Brightest Witch of Her Age" used as though it is a title she has won. Used as though "Her Age" was meant to refer to her generation or era, as opposed to how it was actually used, which was just once, as a throwaway by Remus Lupin and intended to say she was the cleverest 13 or 14-year-old he'd come across, but as he was unlikely to get a lot of teaching positions (due to his lycanthropy and general status as a pariah) how many 13 or 14-year-olds was he likely to know that well?

- Snape pinching the bridge of his nose when upset, thinking or exacerbated. Sure his nose is a prominent feature but it is a body language choice which has just been played out through overuse.

- Snape and/or Minerva single-handedly keeping the tea importers of Britain in operation.
