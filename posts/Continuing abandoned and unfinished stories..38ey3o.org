First one, and probably the worst abandon ever (for me at least):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2737363/13/Twists-of-Fate][Twists of Fate]]

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10394662/11/Children-of-Azkaban][Children of Azkaban]] which is maybe abandoned, I don't really know. Maybe shes just updating reeeeeeeally slowly.

I'm a horrible ghost writer as I can't even follow my own style half of the time. So no, I won't participate. But I support the idea, greatly.

****** Think of a fanfiction as an unfinished painting, that begins with a specific vision. Now imagine you go on vacation and come back and a neighbor you don't even know has come into your house and smeared poop all over the canvas.

It's their canvas and their vision, and you haven't got a right to it whatsoever. Abandoned or not. The rights of the author trump the flighty desires of fans, and the mischievous intention of unoriginal authors who can't come up with their own material.

******* Fanfiction is based on the very grounds of "finishing paintings." Fanfiction is at its most popular when series are unfinished/ongoing and the world still has much to explore. I'm not sure how you can be a consumer or writer of fanfiction and knock on derivative work.

As long as the derivative work is clearly marked as such and credits the original, there should be no issue. Of course, if the author explicitly forbids it, a la Anne Rice, their wishes should be respected. But we shouldn't foster a culture where writers of derivative works put their works on a status higher than that of the works they are deriving off of.

I'm not trying to be malicious or anything and I'm not even participating in this. I just don't get where you're coming from. If someone found my ancient, abandoned Zelda fanfiction and wanted to continue it, I wouldn't give a hoot. Especially if they got permission and said "So and so wrote this story back in 2004 and you can find it at this site. They wrote chapters 1-12. They gave me permission to continue writing it but it does not reflect the ending they would have written."

To me, the fanfiction I was writing was derivative, so why should I care if they do the same to me? I would feel hypocritical if I didn't allow it. It would also be clearly stated who wrote what, so I wouldn't be worried about people mistaking it for my voice nor tarnished.

Obviously this isn't how everyone feels, which is why I asked for a clarification on your opinion.

******** Personally speaking, and not the legal issues I already explained:

Half of my problem is that they're talking about stories my friends wrote, and I know my friends well enough to know they'd be very /very/ not okay with this.

The other half of my problem is that they don't /care/ about getting permission. If they receive silence into their PMs, if they even send them, they feel they have the right to go right ahead. The stories they're talking about have pre-existing (and often substantial) fanbases, it isn't your old abandoned Zelda fanfic.

Authors have copyright protections specifically because of this kind of predatory behavior. They're not doing it out of love of the stories, they're doing it because they can [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=822999][barely write]] themselves and want to piggyback on better stories.

A line is going to be drawn, and this behavior is going to be lumped in with the thinly veiled plagiarism it is.

This is also a forum that's going to be seen by what, maybe 1000 people tops? It seems like they're only talking about it on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] (<5000 subscribers). To be honest, I expect it to fizzle out.

** This is nothing less than plagiarism. Taking someone's idea without their permission is not okay, neither morally nor legally. Silence is not consent; it's not enough to message and continue if you get no reply. Only explicit and publicly given permission will do.

There are three main reasons why it's morally wrong, where HP fanfiction is, in general, not:

1. JKR has given her explicit blanket permission for HP fanfic to be written, which these authors have not done.

2. JKR's version remains the authoritative version of Harry Potter, regardless of what fanfictions are written about it. Canon exists. This is not the case with fanfiction vs. fanfiction. By taking over someone else's fanfiction you rob them of creative control over their idea.

3. JKR's works were published in complete form, so you were never robbing her of the opportunity to publish her idea before the alternative versions got to be made. She didn't just have priority in terms of authority in the universe, she also had priority in time.

Essentially it comes down to whether or not you believe a person should retain creative control over their original ideas. And just because it's fanfiction, it doesn't mean it doesn't contain original ideas unique to that author. Fanfics are only partly derivative.

There have been painful examples of such plagiarism in the fandom in the past. The most glaring example is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy][Original]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][Take-over]]

Original has 1000 reviews, the take-over has 7000. The take-over was published before the original was finished, while it was on hiatus and the author temporarily MIA, and robbed the original of its readership. Most people now have never even heard of A Shattered Prophecy, whereas The Darkness Within is one of the better known fics in the fandom. Project Dark Overlord completely lost any kind of control over his idea, and he lost the opportunity to create his authoritative version before others stole it.

*** 1. How about other works then? JKR might have given her express permission, but other authors have not. However, many take a silence on the matter as implicit permission. Whenever a work is forbidden (Anne Rice, Orson Scott Card, etc.), there are measures taken to alleviate the production and spread of such fanfiction. Hell, there have been some authors whose opinion on the matter (George R.R. Martin) has mostly been ignored. [On a side note, I think he changed his position, but he was firmly against fanfiction for a very long time].

2. Fanfiction that is spun off can still remain the authoritative version. All that is required is credit. This alone allows for the work to remain the "initial" idea. As long as it is clear, there is no problem. In the linked fanfiction "takeover," it is clearly mentioned in the disclaimer of each chapter that it is derivative. It could have also been included in the summary, but I'm of the opinion that it is sufficient.

3. No they were not. JKR's work was published over the course of seven books. This probably actually allowed for her work to become more popular fanfiction-wise, because the breaks between books were ripe periods of fanfiction. The wait between the Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix spawned a lot of fanfiction, and there are anecdotes of fake ebooks that fooled people into thinking some fanfiction was the Order of the Phoenix. People took it upon themselves to write alternate endings, alternate books, etc. She did not really have the priority in time, as many works sought to outpace her delve into parts of the world/timeline that she had not explored yet.

Your summary of your points (creative control over works) is a vast oversimplification and a strawman argument. Of course the author should be able to retain creative control over their works. But having derivative works isn't necessarily a loss of creative control, especially if these derivative works are not for profit and in the name of fandom. I don't feel we should encourage the pointless demonisation of derivative works, especially in a community which focuses around the enjoyment of a type of derivative works.
