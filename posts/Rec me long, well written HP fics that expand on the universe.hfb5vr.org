In the vein of Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man, I would love to see some more recs that explore the HP universe. Whether politically, magically, or both. Please only rec fics that are at least 100k, and NO abandoned fics. All pairings and characters are fine, but bonus points if the main character is Harry, Ginny, or Luna. Het, slash, femslash, poly, idc, just no harems. Oh, and no genderswap or POV first person. Thanks!


** Heyyy I'm currently co-writing a longfic, Harry's POV, third person, 294k words and counting (we are nowhere near finished), no harems, no current ships (possibly a sprinkle of it later?). Most of our fic is about mental illness/PTSD, Muggleborn politics, magical worldbuilding, and the horrors of war. Oh and it's eventual mentor/adoption Snape but he's still an asshole at present.

If that sounds interesting to you, and you don't mind slow updates (lol), then it can be found here: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

*** Just curious cuz I just finished Of a Linear Circle (ao3) which is really good. Author isn't done with the world yet, but part whatever is left at a fairly satisfying place atm. But dude if you ever thought to yourself... I want history and details! That is your story. It is slash, which is not everyone's cup of tea, so just checking before reccing. ðŸ˜„

The second one was actually on the list that Oprah's Magazine's website had listed as some of the best fanfics to read.
