** Would you like any pairing in particular, or would you prefer none at all? Most of the ones I personally know of this nature are TRHP/LVHP and TRGW, so preference on that front does matter some. :')

*** I'm okay with pairing, but I usually don't like slash. (There are a couple I do though.)

** You miiiiiiight like linkffn(Tied for Last) if you're into the idea of an HG/TMR romance. It's a super fucked up and horrifying relationship, although in the last five chapters things get pretty weird. I think the writing takes a bit of a quality drop and the ending felt a little tacky to me. But the majority of the story was really interesting.
