** From what I remember, this one is Kingsley-centric. linkao3(138155) I have to warn you, though, it broke my fucking heart.

  They say there is no such thing as a gay wizard. Especially amongst the Aurors. And the purebloods are the ones to say it loudest.

** I'm not sure what makes something character-centric to you, but feel free to ignore. Absolutely no bashing. I wrote the same one-shot from Draco's point of view as well. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11568239/1/The-Things-that-Voldemort-Took]]

** Can you describe Becoming Neville? I haven't read it but might have some good recs for similar stuff.

*** I really suck at describing, but I'll try my best.

So there's Neville, but he has some issues within himself--insecurities and fears. During the story he gradually overcomes them, like talking to Snape and talking back to authorities. Like at first he sees himself as "the other kid in the dorm" or as someone unforgettable. But as times goes on he gains confidence albeit he falters sometimes.

Maybe it's because I'm not finished with it yet, but the romance is, to me, put on the backburner compared to the mystery and Neville's character development. I guess I just want to see character development--going through trials, facing fears, and overcoming them and such.

**** Just finished this and thanks for the rec btw! Becoming Neville, although AU, really feels like Harry Potter and I loved it! I'll look through my bookmarks list and see what I can find that's similar. I feel like some of my favorite wolfstar fics are like that - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] comes to mind right away. It's really long and definitely worth the read if you haven't read it before. Linkffn(3378356)

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.
