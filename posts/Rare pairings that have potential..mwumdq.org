Personally, I've recently taken a liking to Ron/Astoria and while there admittedly isn't much, I think it has a lot of untapped potential. Astoria helping Ron get over his prejudices against all Slytherins. Or it could swing the other way with Ron helping Astoria get over her anti-muggle prejudice for instance. Either way, I feel that Ron doesn't get enough appreciation in fanfiction and I feel this is one of the pairings that might work best for him besides Romione of course.

What rare pairings do you guys think have potential if they found the right footing?


** I'm not sure it can really be considered a pairing, since the character is either barely canon or none at all depending of how you look at it, but I'm really interested by the Harry/ Tracey ship, the /monogamous/ ship not Tracey being a bonus for Harry after he gets Daphne Greengrass.

I really like the idea of a bitter Half Blood Tracey who hate being treated as inferior by the Blood Purist girl of Slytherin, but that can't leave the "gang" because that would make them treat her worse. And I think it would make a great parrallel to Harry's situation where he is also a Half Blood, but treated completely differently because "Boy-Who-Lived".

** It's implied that in CC Astoria (and perhaps Daphne by extension) was actually pretty anti-muggle like the rest of her family, but the War's experiences caused her to do a 180 -- she actually pissed off Lucius and Narcissa, her in-laws, because she refused to believe muggles were scum, basically.

Maybe a character could help be a quicker catalyst to that canon change and show her how the muggle world isn't as bad as she thinks it is.

...Oh, Metal-Head Astoria would be hilarious!

** One I found that was good in my opinion (be warned, there IS a bunch of sex in it like a lot of pairing fics) is a Neville longbottom/oc Malfoy sister. Seemed pretty good. Very long. It's called "you'll be the death of me." Major romeo and Juliette vibes. Definite angst and drama, but pretty well written.

** Pansy/Percy came out of nowhere but there's at least two excellent fics with them

My favourite rare pair is Regulus/Hermione and Hermione/Theo, but I also love the idea of Neville/Theo
