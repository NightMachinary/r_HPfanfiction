** It may be a tad cheesy, but I really liked Too Young to Die linkffn(9057950)

The Albus Potter Series is pretty amazing too, Reread it twice now. linkffn(4380964)

*** Love both of these. Also linkffn(Gray: Scorpius Malfoy and the blood runes) even if it goes a bit far on the "everyone has a shitty life" scale, it has quite literally THE best characters in any book ever. It's one of the few where I actually feel anything about the characters. Linkffn(Becoming Alpha; A Curse of Truth; Albus Potter and the Global Revelation; Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power; Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma) are all slightly less mainstream ones that I adore, even if some are dated and somewhat average quality-wise, although the second and last are of a very high standard.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

It's Harry/Hermione told through James Potter Sr's eyes. Hermione goes back to the Marauder Era, and James doesn't like her that much. The story is just as much about James, as it is Hermione. The HHr is almost pushed to the background, so if the pairing isn't your cup of tea, it shouldn't stop you from reading this fic.
