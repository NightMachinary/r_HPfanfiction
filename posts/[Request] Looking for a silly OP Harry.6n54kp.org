I recently read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026631/1/The-Very-Best]]) and enjoyed it. I've also read a lot of Carnivorous Muffin's works, and enjoyed those as well. Basically looking for OP Harry, like those two, where the fact that he's amazing isn't really a major plot point, and it's more about the character interaction. Prefer silly over serious, but tbh, I'll read just about anything.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
