:END:
An intelligent Harry studies beside Hogwarts and develops high tech. A super reactor, a supercomputer, satellites, bracelets. He meets Samantah Carter in the USA and later works for Stargate Centre. He also has a copy of himself running around. And he is overly talented in magic. I think he was also in a relationship with a girl from Hogwarts.

I read the story a long time ago. But I just can't remember where or what it's called.

Perhaps one of you will recognize the story.


** I have read a ton of StargatexHP, would even say all thats worth reading, and none of the fics fit everything you mentioned. Maybe you are mixing up multiple stories or the timeline of events is a bit wonky. But my best guess is the "In the mind of a scientist" trilogy by ZenoNoKyuubi:

linkffn(8551180) linkffn(9261735) linkffn(11304904)

He has a clone, works at the SGC, is with Tonks, is overly talented in magic, builds crazy stuff, is friends with Sam. And despite the summaries, the series is absolutely worth reading. I recently re-read it and enjoyed it again.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

*** Thought about that one too, but since he mentioned "a copy of himself running around" I went with the ITMOAS trilogy. But yea, entirely possible that it was this one he had in mind.

And agreed, mjimeyg does that in all their fics, but I still go back from time to time to re-read them all. For some reason they can make any crazy crossover work for me. Like the HPxJurrassic Park one or the HPxHawaii-Five-0. Shouldn't work, most people probably won't enjoy it, but I liked them. Guilty pleasure I guess :D

**** I like them myself, but I don't feel the least bit guilty about it. Sure, they're a bit repetitive, but they're also fun to read, for the most part, and it's fun to watch as a slightly exasperated Harry Potter becomes emperor again, despite his objections. The only one I don't like is how the Crossover with /Rosario X Vampire/ ended, on a very open cliffhanger. Not to mention the way the other canon characters ended up.

** I've found the story. *Balance* By *stargatesg1fan1*

It was a golem, as a copy. It's interesting what you think you remember. The story wasn't as good as we thought it was going to be. But still entertaining.
