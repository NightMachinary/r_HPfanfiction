  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH

** It happens in part 3 of

linkffn(Where In The World Is Harry Potter by nonjon)

If you like nonjon, give it a try. The series is quite fun at times, and a cool exploration of character in many ways. Harry is different, but the rest is a nicely characterized - and it's overall just plain fun.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  Set in a semi-comics compliant world, but one many years in the future and having no comic connection except a couple of references to Dracula's arc in season eight, and Spike's brief appearance at the end of that season. The Cleveland hellmouth is expanding and someone long thought dead has called for help. Buffy to the rescue...

  Wands are finicky things... What if that night in the graveyard actually did bring Harry's parents back to life? Life just got a bit more complicated and nothing will ever be the same.
