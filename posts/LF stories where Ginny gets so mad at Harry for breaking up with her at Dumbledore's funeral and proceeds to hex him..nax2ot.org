**** Replace hex with punch and you are basically admitting that you support domestic abuse.

Really, her being pretty rational isn't her being a dootmat, she is simply acting like a adult.

** So, if someone ended you, you would punch him/her? That's a little bit too toxic don't you think?

*** Why is everyone on Harry's side? I thought that he was a jackass for breaking up with Ginny in Dumbledore's funeral. Frankly, he deserved a good hex for breaking her heart like that.

**** I'm not saying that breaking her heart was ok. But hex him just for that is a little bit worse. He could certainly do it in a better time or place

**** Is breaking up with ginny a jackals move in the circumstances fair enough is domestic abuse okay no not the fuck at all if im a man a girl breaks up with me and then I punch her in the face nobody's defending me but your on ginnys side while not thinking about the fact that it is harrys choice to break up with ginny he didn't "deserve a good hex" he deserved to have ginny respect his choice (she did) and be a good fucking person

** So you want Ginny to be an abusive asshole? Awesome. She's already a bullying jerk anyway, so that'd fit her characterization. She hexes people for annoying her canonically, so go for it!
