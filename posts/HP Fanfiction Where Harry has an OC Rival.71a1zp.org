Can anyone please tell me any fanfics where Harry has an actual talented rival. It would be great if Harry is actually skilled in the fanfic and so is the rival. (I really don't like the fact that HP has no actual rival in the cannon. Apart from Draco but he's nothing more than a bully) Preferably the rival is a girl and the fanfiction is over 80K words


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7863744/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-Changes][Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes]] -- I have not read this in a long time. If I remember correctly, Harry is eventually paired with the OC, but has her as his rival for a while. He's an ice elemental while she's fire, or something. This could be the wrong story too, I just remember the one I'm thinking of had the word 'Elemental' in it. linkffn(7863744)

It could also have been [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4118383/1][Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power]]. It was deleted from ffn, but found it on fictionhunt. Someone please confirm which one I'm thinkng about.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

**** If you haven't look yet, he's referring to the second one. Elemental's Power is also the far better story IMO.
