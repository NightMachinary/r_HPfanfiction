  how is the author such a fucking retard that they don't understand biology that's taught to 16 year olds? what the fuck is wrong with them? who dropped them on the head as a child?

Lol chill.

I have no love for HPMOR, but most people don't remember any of that when they leave high school. Though it is somewhat amusing, considering that fic and its author has always felt [[/r/iamverysmart]] to me.

*** Harry makes street smarts errors. Harry makes interpersonal errors. These things can't be studied easily. Harry, however, studies. He does not get basic mendelian inheritance wrong. His character flaw is that while he's a genius, he makes critical mistakes when he isn't dealing with things he reads in books. That's where the character development in the past 23 chapters have occurred.

Getting something basic wrong doesn't even make for interesting character development when it has no consequences. You can't pass it off as character development when the author doesn't use it in the story to create conflict. It's a fucking excuse.

** The author has addressed this, and confirmed that his Harry's interpretation is in fact wrong. What's /really/ going on, he says, is that there is a /Muggle/ gene, that suppresses magic, but is sometimes damaged, producing wizards. Squibs happen when the Muggle gene is successfully repaired by the relevant enzymes during creation of the gametes.

Of course, there is an argument to be made that this is just a post-hoc justification, but while I do agree that Yudkowsky may not quite understand quantum physics as well as he thinks he does, I think it's a spectacular show of bad faith to seriously propose that he would make such a beginner's mistake.

At any rate, though, I refer you to [[/u/AutumnSouls]]'s comment below on the fact that not understanding genetics does not necessarily mean that one is phenomenally stupid, even if it /would/ be concerning if Yudkowsky, in particular, could have misunderstood them so (due to his being a professional scientist, though not in the field of biology, it's worth pointing out).

At most you could call it libel, and quite frankly it just isn't. The author is undeniably a monger.

**** Many sites consider that any attack on a real-life, living person constitutes a personal attack, whether or not they are a user of the same community. [[/r/HPfanfiction]] doesn't clarify itself on this point, but surely we should remember modesty to be the better part of valor, and assume that it is also working from an ‘insults on /anyone/ count' basis.

******** Even so, there are boundaries. When you call someone “a fucking retard”, you've crossed them and it is a personal attack. There are ways of addressing alleged incompetence in a way that isn't one, but that is not one of them.

Going with your earlier example, it would be like hearing a rumour that something is wrong with Donald Trump's tax declaration and immediately proceeding to call him a fucking retard on some forum that he may not frequent but that does have people interested in politics. I don't like the guy and I do think him stupid, but that ... yes, that would be a personal attack.

No, I don't like Yudkowsky. He has proven himself an arrogant person with something of an ego, and one who does make mistakes from time to time. I enjoyed bits of the story but as a whole I could not get through it. But of all the ways to criticise him, did you really have to pick the one that has no actual grounding in anything and is just crude name-calling? Especially when by doing so you're actually opening yourself to the same insult, as inability to recognise the fact that a character not knowing something is not the same as the author not knowing it generally puts the person in question fairly low on the comparison scale.

********** And if you actually knew what you were trying to achieve here, instead of writing the whole thing to insult someone whom you don't even known, you would have been aware that ad hominem attacks can be personal attacks and thus one cannot claim that it cannot be the latter because of being the former, just as you would have been aware that the moment your argument devolved into name calling it stopped having anything to do with fallacies.

It would be an ad hominem attack if I wrote that as someone who hadn't written anything of the sort you have no right to critisise Yudkowsky, and it would be ad hominem because of me attacking something that has to do with you rather than the subject matter (which would in that example be your capability to deliver a critique). If I wrote that you cannot criticise him because you are a fucking retard, then it would be nothing more than name calling, just like your ... whole of everything, really, here is, and it would be counted as such regardless of the fact that by now some people could argue truth of that statement based on your comments displaying lack of learning capability (which, in case you do not know, is a possible criteria for a medical diagnosis of retardation).

Now, no, it may not be assault, no, at least not if you want to speak legal definitions. But it certainly is a bad thing to do and it certainly is something you are incapable of defending as a decision. In general it's very hard to defend the use of such loaded and vulgar and denigrating phrases because in doing so you are causing other people to stop giving you the benefit of the doubt and start treating what you write as what exactly it appears to be, hateful name-calling.

******** And if you'd framed it in reasonable terms like “off-putting”, that'd be one thing. It's the “insults” part that we mostly take issue with.

And to reply to your Donald Trump example --- /Donald Trump is a tax evader/ would be a statement of fact. A politically controversial one certainly, and therefore an unadvisable thing to bring up on a non-politics forum; but not a personal attack. Whereas if you said, in a non-joking context, /Donald Trump is a f---ing criminal and people who support him are brainless monsters,/ then /that/ would be a personal attack.

** I think you would really enjoy reading [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/][this review]] of HPMOR. The author goes through each chapter and tears apart all the problems with it.

It's definitely a hate-read of the fic, but it's honestly really enjoyable.

That review seems pretty good. Thanks ^{-^}

*** I should state that linked review is a terrible way to construct an opinion about HPMOR. If you already hate it - then sure, have a pleasant read. But if you have not read HPMOR or only starting, you should keep in mind that more than half of what is said there is simply wrong, but in a subtle way you may not be able to catch even if you check. I will give one example, chosen at random, from the review of chapter 25:

#+begin_quote
  this is the terrible idea meatball) Using literally the exact same logic that Intelligent Design proponents use (and doing exactly 0 experiments), Hariezer decides while thinking over breakfast:

  Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of Magic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.\\
  The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with “Atlantis”.
#+end_quote

If you have not read HPMOR, natural conclusion to draw would be that Harry made up a stupid, ad-hoc theory on the spot, immediately believed in it as a religious fundamentalist, and never checked. (And this is supposed to be a story about how to do science!)

If you check the chapter, Harry does, indeed, think about that hypothesis. But if you keep reading, you will find out that Harry immediately noticed it does not help to explain fake-latin-sounding spells and this is the end for that hypothesis. It would never be seriously considered again and was said to be wrong by the author in the comments. The rest of the chapter is about how some problems are just way too hard to solve on the spot. Chapter's name is "Hold Off on Proposing Solutions" to make absolutely sure you got the point.

The whole review is like that.
