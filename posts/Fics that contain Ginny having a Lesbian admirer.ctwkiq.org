What i imagined would be that Ginny is not with Harry, but living on her own. A potential Bed sharing wouldnt be excluded. She would be working as an Auror or Detective or some other kind of Crime fighter or something like that.

She lives either in a Flat or a House and her female Neighbor gets a Crush on her, but might be to shy to confess this to the Redhead....maybe because homosexuality in the Magical world is frowned upon or because she fears that Ginny might reject her. But maybe Ginny has her own conclusion and they talk about it.

I dont mind what Ginnys sexual interest would be, so if she is Bi or Hetero. At one Point both Woman might have a Session with each other, but i leave this to the Fic.

I would accept an alluring Admirer who makes it obvious that Ginnys appearance is attracting her, too. But i would like the rather shy type more, i guess.

If Ginny being single is not an option, i would accept her with Harry.
