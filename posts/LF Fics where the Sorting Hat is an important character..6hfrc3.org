#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** The Thief of Hogwarts features the sorting hat. I would write more but I'm not sure how to say anything else without spoilers.

Summary: AU Young Harry learns to steal as he is fed up from his deprivation of his wants and needs by his guardians. A Thief is born in Privet Drive.

Additional Notes: Harry's not perfect, or a goody two shoes. He has developed a habit of stealing whatever he fancied, and always takes advantage of any given situation.

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** "Hogwarts Houses Divided."

It takes place eleven years after the war, when the first generation born after Voldemort starts school, everyone has had ten years to stew in Slytherin-hatred, and inter-house relations are worse than ever. The Hat is pretty much the entire reason for the plot in the first place; it's sick of the houses fighting and gives an ultimatum: "Either you learn to get along or I stop the Sorting business!"

While the Sorting Hat isn't in every chapter, it does have a very important role in the plot and gets probably more attention and characterisation in this one fic than it did in the entire canon. It also sings three songs during the story, and each one leads to an important plot development.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
