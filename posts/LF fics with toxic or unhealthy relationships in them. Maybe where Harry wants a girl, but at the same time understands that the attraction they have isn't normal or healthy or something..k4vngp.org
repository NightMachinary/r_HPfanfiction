** It's probably not what you're asking for, but a /lot/ of independant!Harry fics have extremely unhealthy relationships that are just framed as 'amazing', but in reality would fuck Harry up if not for his plot armor. It applies more to Harmony then Haphne, oddly enough, despite the arranged marriages that the latter usually has.

As for the sort you're probably looking for, the Downward Spiral saga by BolshevikMuppet99 on FFN has a very fucked up Harry/Pansy at some point, with Pansy being absolutely terrified of Harry and towards the end of the relationship only still dating him because she's worried he'll murder her if she dumps him. The following Haphne pairing is actually a lot healthier then most Haphne relationships, if you can look past the fact that either of them make canon Voldemort look as pure as a unicorn.

Just to make sure people are aware before they try the series - it's probably the most realistic depiction of a Death Eater Harry out there, very explicit and one of the darkest series out there besides the "shock value" edgy gorefics.
