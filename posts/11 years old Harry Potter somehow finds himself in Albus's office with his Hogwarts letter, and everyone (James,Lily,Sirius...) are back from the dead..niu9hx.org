:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can someone help me find a fanfiction, I don't know if it was time travel or dimension travel but I doubt it. But it starts with James, Lily, Sirius, Severus too I think.. Anyway most of the adults alive but kept theirs memories up to when they died ? And Harry had his Hogwarts letter and somehow ended up with them in Albus's office ? They kind of try to fix things and lily refuses to send Harry back in time. I never finished reading it and just remembered it and would like to give it another try.

I think at some point Lily and James took Harry and went to live in James's parents house, but Harry had a "clingy" phase and refused to get separated from his parents or have a room of his own.


** 2 things I absolutely loved about that fic. How Lily rips into pretty much everyone, at different times. And how they all seem to realize important info needs to go through her, not James, first. It's awesome.

  “The cupboard under the stairs?” she read, puzzled. She distinctly remembered her own letter being addressed to The Left Bed In The Second Room To The Right, back when Tuney and her had shared space and dreams and a sisterly love that she still sometimes missed.“What?” She heard Sirius croak, behind her. He'd been occupied glaring at Severus and also glaring at Peter's still body. When Lily glanced at him, she discovered he seemed to be in a bigger shock than hers. Perhaps, she thought, his death had been more gruesome than her own, and he needed more time to process it."What do you mean?” Minerva asked, but the child kept retreating and she stopped before approaching him.“That's why it's mine!” he repeated, and caressed the envelope carefully, like he wanted to erase the rumples with his blackened nails. (or: the one Time Travel AU where several parental figures in Harry's life plus Harry himself (aged 11) travel back in time to the Marauder's Era. Featuring koala!Harry and a very bitter Severus Snape)
