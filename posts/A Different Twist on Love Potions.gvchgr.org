Harry is shocked and horrified when he finds out that Hermione is under the effects of love potions. He gets her an antidote, only to get another shock when her reaction is one of anger: She's been dosing /herself/ to prop up her relationship with Ron.

Why would she do this? Maybe she thought that Ron was the best she'd be able to get and decided to use some bottled compatibility. Maybe due to the bigoted laws/culture of Wizarding Britain he was the best viable option as a husband or as a father for her eventual children. Maybe she did love Ron, but not enough or not in the right way, or the magic started to fade once they were no longer in constant danger.

Alternative idea: Harry and Ginny (or some other couple) have both been dosing themselves, each unbeknownst to the other. Other people's expectations pushed them towards each other, and/or each thought the other really loved them (as more than a friend/sibling) and didn't want to break their heart. Stopping the potions could lead to a breakup, or into a more genuine romance as they give their relationship a chance without artificial feelings.

As an aside, it does kinda make sense to me that love potions might be viewed in some circles and circumstances not as magical Roofies but as something closer to magical Viagra (though presumably there'd be a more direct magical equivalent to that). Couples in arranged and/or failing marriages might take love potions to avoid being miserable or to keep their relationship afloat.

  *J.K. Rowling:* It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

  *J.K. Rowling:* The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

******** At face value, sure - it does look problematic on JKR's part. But I think that the conclusion of victim of rape --> bad person really wasn't the whole of what she wrote - the story of Tom Riddle becoming evil is one of a brilliant child born to a loveless union, raised in an orphanage without love, and never being given love even once throughout his formative teenage years.

It's a tragic story, and reducing it all to the circumstance of his birth diminishes the effect of the rest of his equally awful life on his character. And in any case, the whole point of the story is that Harry had the same upbringing but found support - I think that symbolism is more powerful, personally.

** This makes a lot of sense to me. The only two times I can remember love potions playing a role in the canon plot is with Ron being dosed; directly leading to the discovery of another assassination attempt on Dumbledore; and in the distant past, with Merope Gaunt using them to sire Tom Riddle Junior. The contrast between these two instances; one a blatant attempt to trick someone into romance, and the other long-term sexual and emotional abuse; and the fact that they're sold in stores in-universe begs the question of what their legal use is. The idea that struggling or arranged marriages can use it to improve their relationship seems logical and likely to me.

Molly is held up as the exemplar of The Good Wife and Mother of the wizarding world, and even she seemed totally blase about love potions. It's been commented a zillion times that Rowling's Wizarding World seems 100% a-okay with rape as long as it's chemically-induced, but it seems a bit much to brush the issue off as just Ron getting dosed (played for laughs) and Riddle Sr. getting dosed (played for horror) as the end of the issue.

*** This is a bit like concluding the purpose of rat poison is to murder family members from encountering one incident where this is true.

Now, I'm entirely willing to believe ideas like "Wizarding Britain is a complete dystopia" or "prolonged exposure to magic destroys one's moral compass" but I really have to ask what the intended purpose of love potions is even so. There are clearly standards of right and wrong in wizarding Britain (even if they might be orthogonal to ours) so how do love potions fit in with this?

Here's what I remember as being canon:

- they're marketed to girls in a joke shop (OTOH that joke shop produces all sorts of different kinds of products, not just jokes)
- they're seen as girly (that Mrs Weasley quote)
- Amortentia is talked about in school with specific attention being drawn to what the pupil smells in it (are they learning a basic detection method???)
- Slughorn expects that Harry should be able to whip up an antidote (implying graduated wizards ought to be able to cure themselves?)
- there are different power levels to love potions but even the strongest just create an intense infatuation (what do the weak ones do?)
- Merope uses a powerful one to trap Tom Riddle snr for months/years (and this is telegraphed as being wrong... although not as being wrong because it's rape)
- Merope stops using the potion for whatever reason and Dumbledore speculates that she might have imagined Riddle would stay after all (which, if there's a basis for that speculation, honestly makes them even worse than usually presented in fanfci)
- they can be hidden in chocolates (again, rather insidious)
- (if we count it as canon) Queenie's use of a love potion on her boyfriend is presented as being wrong but not an overly big deal (suggesting that within relationship use isn't seen in the same light as Merope's usage???)

And I think these bits are also canon:

- the aforementioned joke shop helps smuggle love potions into Hogwarts (potentially indicating that they're banned at Hogwarts and that they're seen as just another harmless joke)
- they get stronger after they expire (suggesting that there is an intended consumption period in much the same way eating a chicken you've left on a bench for 24 hours is a bad idea)

It seems to me that while we can't be sure what exactly love potions are meant to do and that people acknowledge Merope style dosing as a possibility, that it's pretty clear that their purpose is not magical roofies.

I think it's entirely likely that the main purpose of love potions is recreational between consenting partners... and that somewhat amoral characters like the Weasley twins as business owners (I mean, they sell Peruvian Darkness powder to anyone) /might/ be encouraging people to dose others unsuspectingly. I also like to imagine that love potions have a bit of a beer goggles or even a Love Potion Number 9 outcome... they're used by shy people on themselves with no intended target.

If all they are is magical roofies, I just can't see why they exist in canon when every use of them as a roofie is framed negatively (albeit not as rape). Especially in a society where the major known function of every aspect of wizarding government we meet is regulatory or organising sports events.

To accidentally write magical roofies in and then forget about it, well it wouldn't be surprising since her prologue already has Harry and Hagrid disappear for a day.

***** The point is that there's nothing accidental about /this/ specific incident. When we see love potions used in the books, we see their use negatively. That's not a fan created interpretation but an engendered one. This creates the question, "Why are these allowed and sold to, it seems, anyone but Ginny by major characters, when they're presented as problematic?"

Your examples consist entirely of things Rowling did not or does not see as being problems. They're not at all equivalent.

****** Because the sale of many dangerous substances isn't regulated. I mean, the Weasley twins already have other questionable business practices such as testing on children without parental consent or medical personnel nearby. For a product which does not provide any actual benefit but is just a joke. They also tried to trap Ron in an unbreakable vow and fueled his fear of spiders.

What's one more questionable thing to their name?

******* Because few of those other things are presented as being wrong. Hermione doesn't like the tests, but Ron and Harry don't care. The spider thing is just a fait accompli and none of the other things they sell or produce are questioned. Their main line of business is literally about finding ways of people to not learn. It's only the unbreakable vow and love potions that we find being cast as wrong.

** A headcanon of mine is that the reason love potions aren't really frowned upon in the Wizarding World is arranged marriages. There's 3 important parts to a perfect marriage: implicit complete trust, compatible chemistry and passion. A well-arranged match can fit the first 2, but you can't choose who you fall in love with -- that part is a crapshoot. I can see Wix self-medicate on love potions to remedy that part of it.

Now, let me be clear: I still consider love potions in general immoral. I'm merely giving my headcanon of why they aren't illegal in Wizarding Britain.

*** Love potions you knowingly give to yourself are fine (as long as you aren't being coerced), love potions you slip to somebody else are 99.999% not fine. The only scenario I could see not being horrifically unethical for that is something weak and short-term, less "I love this person and will do anything for them" and more "oh hey, they're cute...".
