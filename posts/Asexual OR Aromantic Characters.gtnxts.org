It doesn't have to be a main part of the story, just wanted to read different aspects of potential characters.

Someone brought up at finding the idea of an Asexual or Aromantic Sirius Black interesting, on another thread of mine, so if you have a story of him being one of those, that'd be cool, though it can be ANYONE at all.

Anyone can be Asexual or Aromantic, it doesn't have to be the main part of the story.

For other characters involved with actual ships: I'm fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual, Et Cetra.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new, can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated if at all possible.

Would rather not have Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing, if at all possible.

If Harry is in the story: Would rather him not be OP, if he's smarter and/or more powerful then in canon that's fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.


** Since it will be hard to get a lot of recommendations for this and I myself have no interest whatsoever in this theme, best I can do is filtering for tags related to asexuality on Ao3:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=hits&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Asexual+Harry&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling]]

Maybe you can find something of interest that way.

  George was afraid of heights, so Fred dared and dared him into going higher and higher--patiently, kindly, gently--until at nine George didn't want to get down from a broom, even for dinner. When one of them set it up, the other had the punchline. When one of them started it, the other finished the sentence, or the sandwich, or the job. When Fred stared after Angelina in the Great Hall, George noticed, and looked to his plate. When Fred waxed eloquent about the grace of Angelina's passes in practice, George thought about what that meant for Oliver's game strategies. He remembered what it had been like, being afraid of air beneath your feet. When Fred talked smugly about the gardens outside the Yule Ball--the little niches and nooks, shadowed and cool, Angelina's backless dress--George fiddled with their latest recipe for Puking Pasties. (a series of snippets on ace characters in the HP universe)

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

  When Harry Potter sorts into Slytherin, Parvati hears whispers.He should have been a Ravenclaw, she hears, He's gotta be a smart kid, right?She recognizes the way that people underestimate Harry Potter, the way they downplay his bravery and cunning and stubbornness in favor of focusing on his brain, his grades.Sure, he may be the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, but he is expected to be a very certain kind of Chosen One. He is expected to be a smart one, a brilliant one, not a brave one or a valiant one.She knows their expectations of Harry just as well as she knows the expectations that she and Padma and Cho and every other Asian kid get. It's the same thing everybody expect when they see the slant of Remus Lupin's eyes, the turban Parvati's father wears, the sari wrapped around her mother's body.

** This isn't very helpful but a while back I read a drarry fanfic with asexual and sex repulsed Draco. I think either he or Harry was a legemis (sp). It was on ffn and it was notable for being pretty respectful w/ aroace. You can probably find it by googling asexual Draco rec list. it being very popular.

**** It was a long fic. Something like an extended battle of hog warts / a war zone and Draco (maybe) was a healer? I remember a hospital wing scene where they have mental sex? And/or talk about boundaries? I wish I could help more. I never finished it.

  This is the fic where Muggles find out about wizards, wars are fought, Apparition is abolished, political conspiracies abound, Draco is asexual, and Harry has Legilimency sex with him.
