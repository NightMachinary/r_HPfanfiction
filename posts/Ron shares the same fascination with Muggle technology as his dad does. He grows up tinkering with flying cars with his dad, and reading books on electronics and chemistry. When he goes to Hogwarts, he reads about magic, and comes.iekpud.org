*** If you like that, then you'll like RocketScientist!Ron from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay.]] Ron dreams of being the first wizard in space, and he's experimenting with mixing magic and technology to create his own mini rockets (which he could potentially ride in his squirrel animagus form).

And then he marries a girl from Professor Quirrel's family and takes her last name, so that nobody can call him a weasel anymore because his name is Ron Quirrel.

Seriously though, I'll have to read this fic at some point!

** Ron: Practical experience with combining magic and muggle things.

Hermione: Tons of encyclopedic knowledge of how technology works and obscure spells and enchantments.

Harry: Oh, you made a railgun that shoots a tiny bit of alchemical shield charm piercing metal at beyond escape velocity? Cool. We're going to need that on the next adventure that I'm going to stumble into.

*** Possibly, but the fact that Hermione is placed in Gryffindor indicates that valuing knowledge and wanting to learn more doesn't immediately make you a ravenclaw. I've always subscribed to the belief that your house shows what you value most.

I mean, in her first year she says “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery.” I think this shows her priorities.

In school I was a nerd, 4.0 gpa, complete bookworm, but I always believed kindness is most important so I identify 100% as a Hufflepuff.
