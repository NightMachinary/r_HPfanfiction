I don't care if this is time travel fic or dimension travel or summoned Harry or even "Lily and James are alive but don't remember who they are", I really don't care! I just want read something GOOD, something LONG and I don't want "oh, mom and dad, bla bla, I love you" and happy end! I want story where I can read every stage of relationship Harry and his parent.

I'm sorry if you don't understand something but I'm from Poland and english language is simpler when you read. When I have to write something then it's a lot harder...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Throughout the story, he was friends with them, but only exposed his true identity near the very end:

#+begin_quote
  Harry shrugged and, after swallowing a bit of chicken, spoke up. "It sounds like you've already figured out the gist of it. My name is Harry James Potter."

  "Congratulations," Bellatrix said, "you now know his deepest and darkest secret."

  Lily was not satisfied with this. "Surely there is more to it. What were we like in the alternate future?"

  "I was an only child. You and father both died while I was still a baby. The Dursleys half-heartedly raised me. I escaped to Hogwarts, and ever since my first year, have been dodging Voldemort and foiling his plans until three days ago. At some point in all that, Sirius became my beloved godfather until he died and made me a Black in his will. As far as I'm concerned, I met you, my parents, for the first time when I taught you Potions at Hogwarts," Harry said.

  Bellatrix rolled her eyes. "I think you can spare them more than that, Harry. And for the benefit of the younger part of our audience, I would like you to tell the story of your mother competing with her daughter-in-law for your affections back in the day."
