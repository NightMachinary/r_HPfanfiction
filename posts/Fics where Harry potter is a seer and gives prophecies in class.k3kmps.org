This is the only one i've read with harry taking divination seriously. It's been a long time since I've read it though so I can't remember how good it was. It's abandoned

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Kinda fits, Things Harry writes come true. Story is unfinished but still has enough of an ending
