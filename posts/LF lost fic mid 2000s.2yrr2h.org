This definitely appeared on aff, not sure about other sites and I stopped reading it around 2007 when it was maybe 30 or alot more chapters in. Harry gets kidnapped by either Voldemort or the Death Eaters. Snape is somehow in there, either as a prisoner or maybe acting as a Death Eater taking care of him. Harry falls in love with him, I am guessing Stockholdm syndrome but at the end it is revealed that Snape kidnapped Harry himself and kept him in that room for his own pleasure. Then there are scenes about Harry taking him to court, psychological dealings, something about white rooms. Trying to rack my brain here but I think this was happening in Snape's house, some prison room attached to his house to fool Harry into thinking he was being held captive somewhere. I think the captivity took place within a good amount of chapters. Sorry, tried finding it on aff and never could as I dont remember much. Thank you in advance if anyone is able to remember it!
