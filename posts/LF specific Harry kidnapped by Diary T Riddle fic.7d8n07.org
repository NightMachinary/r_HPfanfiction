Warning for complete spoiler for what happens so here goes

it starts with Harry killing Ginny with the basilisk fang, but this doesn't work. Riddle kidnaps Harry and takes him to a house in London that Harry eventually escapes from. Harry meets a 'homeless' man and stays at the National Library for a while but Riddle finds him again. To escape a final time Harry does some intense accidental magic and jumps out the window of the high-rise he's being kept in. It ends with Harry telling Dumbledore that Tome Riddle killed Ginny Weasley.

I love this fic and wanted to read it again but I've been searching for a while now and just can't find it. Thanks for any help.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
