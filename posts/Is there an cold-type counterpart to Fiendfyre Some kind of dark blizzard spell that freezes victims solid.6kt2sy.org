Just a random thought I thought of when reading the latest chapter of Divided and Entwined; if Fiendfyre incinerates everything, could...say, Cocytus freeze everything?

Does anyone know of any fics where cold magic on par with Fiendfyre is used?

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** Lighting Dragon's Roar has a scene where a water fiend spell is used against a demon. As well as another scene where voldemort has fiend versions of all 4 elements and manages to weave them together :|

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

** A bit of a tangent, but I remember a scene in the Bastard!! manga, where a fire mage met an ice mage, and a spectator commented that the fire mage would win since cold has an absolute zero temperature, but heat has no limit. That might come up with such a spell.

*** The problem with having an infinite limit means you need infinite energy to power it with. As always, it comes down to endurance. If one mage can outlast the other, they will overwhelm the opposing spell. Otherwise it's immovable wall against unstoppable force.
