Thanks


** Plenty of stuff by the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonnagal]]! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473197/1/Great-Deeds][Great Deeds]] is a work in progress with little snapshots into McGonnagal's life. The writing is really good and I love her take on Minerva. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] features a badass McGonnagal narrating about a third of the way in.

And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just A Random Tuesday]] by Twisted Biscuit is hilarious and worth a rec every time.

*** At a guess it seems they meant it to be 'Looking For' tho that may be assumed to be implied as the default case in this sub.

** While Snape gets even more stage time, in Arsinoe de Blassenville's novels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] and sequel, McGonagall plays a much more active role than in canon.
