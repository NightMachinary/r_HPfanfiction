Hi Y'all, longtime lurker here. I was thinking about writing a backstory to some of the wizarding races (Goblins, House elves, Veela, Banshees, ect.) , and was looking at Pottermore and the books for inspiration. Long story short, I realized that Veela wings don't have feathers and it messed me up:

#+begin_example
  "At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces where elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -" - GoF Ch. 8
#+end_example

Now, I've read quite a bit of Harry Potter fanfiction, and I remember them usually having feathers, 'down', and sometimes claws in Fanon. Now, I'm thinking I might write them as completely featherless with bird heads Ã  la the Rito from Legend of Zelda Windwaker. Does anyone else have a headcanon of featherless Veela?


** I always pictured those ancient dinosaur wings, with like scaly arms along the top with feathers growing down from there.

***** I'm aware, but I also think feathered dinosaurs are funny and like to take the opportunity to remind people about it.

** Wait, scaly? There's an idea, Veela are in fact the descendants of time-travelling magic dinosaurs, using illusions/transfiguration to hide their true nature! Or, or, maybe they're intelligent dragons/dragonfolk pretending to be human(oid)!

*** I much prefer them being dragon-related, both for the fire thing and the scaly look, since both lineages of reptiles with powered flight had feathers, although not in the wing membranes themselves, in the case of pterosaurs and scansoriopterygids. Though they woudn't have scales on the wing membranes eatiher. Thus, dragons.

** I pictured them to have gray coloured bat like wings and long faces with beaks in place of their mouths. Like Magica the witch from duck tales.

** I always thought of them as a mix of Harpy and Siren, so the scaley wings is a perfect mix.

** I never imagined them having feathers...they throw fireballs, to me that suggests "dragon" not "eagle".
