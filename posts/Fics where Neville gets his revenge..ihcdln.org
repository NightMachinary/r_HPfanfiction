Fics where Neville kills Bellatrix and/or the Lestrange brothers. It doesn't need to be the main focus of the fic, but I'd prefer that some focus is put on it and it's written in a way that has gravitas/emotional impact.

Any recommendations?

*** Like Neville should always have killed the trio of Lestranges not Molly. It was a shit way for Bella to die cos she should have been able to kill Molly like instantly
