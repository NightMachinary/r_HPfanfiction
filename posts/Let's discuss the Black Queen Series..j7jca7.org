What do you guys think of Jen? Is she evil? Does she still have good in her? What of her relationship with Lily Potter?

What do you think of the Potters?

How do you like Baron Samedi and the Powers?


** If there is one thing that's good about that series it's the expansion of and exploration of non canon magic,like rituals and the Powers, and the difference between wizardry and witchcraft. I don't agree with all of the choices the author made in developing their magic system but I always like a fleshed out magic system that's different from canon.

The problem with that series is that it includes dark content like child prostition but it doesn't do a good job showing exactally how wrong those things are, and in fact sometimes treats characters that are opposed to some of the darker aspects of the fic as if they are the bad guys.

As for the actual questions you asked, yes Jen is evil, she needed therapy a long time ago, she's largely the way she is because of her fucked up past. She does have (very little) good in her because she does care in her own way about a select few people and wants the best for them. The Potters in this series suffer from the same chiche writing behind most WBWL fics. Thinking your child is a squib is not a good justification for abandoning them, nor is the threat of Voldemort, and when they try to repair their relationship with Jen, well, they should have raised her from the start shouldn't they. The Powers or some sort of Gods are a neat enough concept.

** The whole thing would be a better and more coherent story without the weird pet shit with the basilisk and the hydra (I think it was). Those were so jarring and completely out of sync with the tone of everything else about the series that they ruin it for me far more than the fucked up subject matter.

** I get the sense that the author derives pleasure from readers being offended by the fic. Like that "you can't handle how edgy I am" type author.

But I'm not offended. I'm not sure that it's possible for a work of fiction to offend me. I just have no interest in reading a story with such a bad premise. A story where everyone just accepts child prostitution isn't edgy, it's just stupid.
