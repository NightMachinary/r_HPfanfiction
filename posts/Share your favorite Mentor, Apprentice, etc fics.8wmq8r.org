I'm in the mood to have a character learn outside of the classroom format, with the help of someone more experienced. The request is generic on purpose, so if you like the fic and think it fits, go ahead and link it!

If you want some more focus, here are a few preferences:\\
1) While any main character(s) are acceptable, I'd prefer at least one of the "Teacher" or "Learner" to be canon.\\
2) I'd prefer if the "mentorship", etc were a focus, not an afterthought.\\
3) Romance is fine, but I'd prefer it to be supplemental, not the point of the story. Tell the story first, and if "He gets the Girl" along the way, that can be fun too.\\
4) Completed is awesome as always, but not required.

Thanks All!

Harry goes back in time to give Snape a fighting chance at not being an idiot. IT IS AMAZING.

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

** Just finished a really interesting Drarry (if that's not your cup of tea don't bother, it's very much part of the story). Harry returns for his 8th year and sits down with McGonagall for career counseling. He decides (half out of spite, half out of his fear of becoming an Auror) to try and become a Potions master. He makes a deal with Snape's portrait that's quite funny. There's a lot of Potion making and it's quite fascinating where the author came up with some very convincing chemistry/potions/alchemy information. I won't spoil anything but it's well written.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

**** I'd say it's more on the explicit side (honestly I've reached the point where I skim sex scenes because they're boring and just to make sure nothing actually happens plot-wise during the sex). But I think the story itself is high quality. The writing is well done and the plot is intriguing. I really want to know where the author got her science facts from because a lot of the nitty gritty is fascinating and very detailed. Snape's portrait characterization is written very well, too.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
