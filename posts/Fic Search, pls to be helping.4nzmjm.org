The fic I'm looking for is a Honks fic. The fic had the ghost of Gryffindor take Harry to an ancestral castle, where he started teaching Harry. Tonks moved in too, as well as Kingsley along with his wife and daughter. I THINK Harry was a metamorphmagus in it, but I'm not certain.

And that's all I recall about it.

*** That seems to be it, yes, from the first chapter.

No wonder I couldn't find it on FF.net or AO3. :/

Much appreciated!
