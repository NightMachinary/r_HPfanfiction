As the Title says, there have been a lot of threads about what People would do if they were inserted into Harry Potter, most often as a OC.

But what if you are now suddenly Harry Potter and have to deal with his problems?

To clarify a few things.

- You have both your sets of memories, but its still your personality in charge, you may decide for yourself if you have a child's maturity.
- Your memories of your past are unable to be read by anyone against your will, though neither Harry's nor any new memories you acquire have that protection.
- If you are female, you may instead be inserted into a Fem!Harry who lived a extremely similar life to regular Harry
- This is the Book Canon continuity, so no Fanon, Head canon or Movie canon that contradict it apply here.

So, how would you deal with things like Voldemort, Death Eaters and the fact that you are a Horcrux?


** I'd probably let Hagrid bring me to Diagon Alley as usual, play along with everything, tweak Malfoy as much as I can, resist the urge to try out spells with my new wand, graciously accept Hedwig, and write a letter to Dumbledore the instant I get home because there is no way in hell I'm doing all this by myself.

On the bright side, I'd ace Snape's opening quiz.

Also, fuck keeping a child's maturity. At most, I'd try to tone down the profanity.

Welp, time to see if those so-called "protections" Dumbledore placed actually worked, or if the Death Eaters/Voldemort never even bothered. Because those protections would come crashing down for 99.9% of the people here, as we would never consider that place /home/. Especially after suddenly waking up in Harry's body of all places.

** 1.  Verify this is the CANON world

2.  Meet Dumbledore and tell everything about Horcruxes and other secrets

3.  Out Wormtail, exonerate Sirius

4.  Out Barty Jr and Sr

5.  With the above track record, get him to raid Malfoy Manor, get the Diary and put an end to Lucius's corruption of the Ministry

6.  Devise a way to capture Voldemort's wraith and save Quirrell. *If not possible, sending Voldemort back to Albania is still better than let him carrying out sabotage at the school. Because my presence already changed the timeline, I would rather not leave things to chance.*

7.  Push Wizengamot for confiscation of Lestrange and Malfoy assets, in order to compensate their victims and to obtain the Cup.

8.  Open CoS, bring enough roosters along to kill the Basilisk, harvest its venom, sell its body parts for Galleons.

9.  Sirius should bring along the Locket, and talk to Kreacher about Regulus.

10. Get the Diadem from the RoR, destroy that Vanishing Cabinet.

11. Place all Horcruxes at the Gaunt Shack, burn all of them down with Fiendfyre, which Dumbledore should be able to control.

12. Now that we have created some breathing space, Dumbledore can work on getting rid of my scar and bringing all inner circle Death Eaters to justice.

13. I will make some serious money by investing in AOL, Cisco, Dell, Microsoft, and Yahoo stocks. I will also advise Sirius to do the same.

14. Maybe it's possible to get Snape to search for Voldemort in Albania. Once Voldemort is in that weak homunculus body, a stunner in the back will see him finally captured. Then thoroughly interrogate him, find out where Nagini is, find out all his secrets, obliviate him with the Elder Wand back to his infancy, dose him with Drought of Living Death, and lock him behind protections stronger than Nurmengard. Even if Voldemort gets away in some very unlikely fashion, he will wander the mortal plane as a confused wraith until the end of times!

15. Scum like Umbridge still needs to be taken care of, but that can wait. now it's finally time to learn magic and make friends!

** I've lived a whole life of caring what other people thought of me. A lifetime of pretending to be normal. Boring. Sane. No more. Never again.

I die. I wake up in Harry Potter's body a bit before his 11th birthday. This is within my expectations of the afterlife. I wait for Dudley's birthday and set the zoo snake on the Dursleys. Oh, no, what a tragic accident that could not possibly be a crime committed by me, time to sue the zoo for negligence. I'm rich now. Cool. Haha, Dudley is crying, what a baby.

Well shit, I'm an orphan and the orphanage took all my money. That makes me bitter. I steal other kid's stuff because they're losers. Hey, Hogwarts letter, neat. But I'm still bitter. Dumbledore reads the address on my Hogwarts letter and is confused. He comes personally to check it out. He introduces himself as a Hogwarts professor, but doesn't tell me his name. I tell him I can talk to snakes. He looks spooked, but composes himself enough to set my wardrobe on fire and scold me for stealing.

I smile wildly. "Thank you, professor Dumbledore. I love fire." He takes a trembling step back from me.

Oh, this is going to be /fun./

"GRYFFINDOR!"

Exactly one person is surprised by my sorting. I stare innocently into his blue eyes.

...

"Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

I stare unblinking into Snape's eyes. My eyes sting, but I've spent the last few weeks training myself to keep them open just for this moment. Because that's how committed I am. I stare blankly at him for several minutes. He blinks many times. I don't. He turns away and starts the lesson.

Snape doesn't acknowledge my existence, in class or in the corridors, again.

...

I burn professor Quirrel to death. Dumbledore looks relieved and tells me it's my mother's love protecting me. I tell him I used Fyndfire.

...

They think I'm the heir of Slytherin. I tell them if I wanted to kill someone, no one would ever know. They believe me.

...

A dementor walks into the train. I stare at it. It backs away slowly. Professor Lupin pretends to be asleep. I steal his chocolate.

...

My bogart is not a dementor. My bogart is not Voldemort. It's a girl, Harry Potter's age, Harry Potter's height, no one recognizes. The bogart is me.

...

I put my name in the Goblet of Fire. I do it in front of everyone, while making eye contact with Dumbledore. Cedric Diggory is picked as the Hogwarts champion. That's fair. He's a much better person than I am.

I vow to not let him die.

...

Barry Crouch Junior tries to kill me once.

Once.

...

I stab Cedric before the final task. He spends it on the hospital wing. But he lives. That's what matters.

...

I changed too much now. I don't know what Voldemort will decide to do. Nor Dumbledore.

I'm scared.

** "Fuckin study I guess"

In all seriousness after the usual ascertaining that this isn't a dream after reading a reddit prompt, mourning for my lost life, etc. I'd probably just study really hard. Harry thrown back in time might be able to knock out all of the Horcruxes by his twelfth birthday but there is no way in hell I could do it. I'd need to know as much as possible about both magic, and the truth of canon vague aspects of the world.

Things that I could manage while developing skills would be arrange confrontations with Quirrel and Lockhart early in the hope of getting a more decent education (as well as getting dangerous men away from children). Snatch the map from the twins as a prank discover Peter Pettigrew and get him taken care of as well as Sirius. Pump Hagrid for information about James friends to provide explanation for recognizing Peter's name.

Grab the diary from Ginny at the burrow before she has a chance to be enthralled by it, bring it to Dumbledore, fall back on the "don't trust a thing that thinks if you can't see where it keeps its brain" as excuse for suspicion. Hope that Dumbledore is able to get some info from Tom through like, veritaserum laced ink or something.

Third year I'd take an interest in divination to see if there are any aspects of the branch of magic that are useful other than the Trelawny style propecies. Use that to spin some bullshit about divining/sensing the location of dark artifacts, especially after sensing/finding one in Grimmauld place once Sirius is free and rehabilitated. (Assuming Sirius is not okay to take guardianship until summer between year 2 and 3) Let Dumbledore think that it's due to the connection between my scar/horcrux and the others. Dumbledore takea out all Horcruxes except scar by the start of year four.

Canon most likely has completely broken down by now without Wormtail crawling back to Voldemort in Albania. Bertha Jorkins lives, Voldemort doesnt know about the tournament. Crouch Jr is under extreme spell limitations after his moment of freedom at the world cup and wont be going anywhere without Voldemort and Peter to rescue him. By all indications Voldemort was ready to hide in Albania until another tempting source of rebirth arose.

Enjoy watching the Triwizard tournament. Voldemort doesnt return.

Work my way through OWL year with a competent teacher hopefully, should be no reason for Umbridge without Fudge on the defensive. Continue extreme self study regardless. Top of the class hopefully.

Enjoy sixth year. Don't date children.

Enjoy seventh year. Rock the NEWTs. Presumably get told about the scar horcrux at some point during or after the school year. Work with Dumbledore on possible ways to survive its destruction. Maybe involve Flamel who should still be alive. Hopefully discover a safe way to destroy the horcrux without Voldemorts involvement. Without any anchors remaining, his soul drifts on to the next great adventure.

If both solution except canon Deus Ex Machina will do, plot with Dumbledore for best and safest way to engineer the end of Voldemort. Continue extensive self study and training under Dumbledore. End fight however that goes.

Work in the Aurors for a while. Conduct successful raids and arrests on various death Eaters. Go into politics for a while. Use game and money to pass laws preventing people from using game and money to pass laws. Reform society entirely in my own vision of justice and mercy. Retire to teach at Hogwarts and play 10 pin bowling with the spry old man that is Dumbledore.

** Get started on the Horcruxes early. Like, EARLY. Right after Quirrell dissolves. With the correct setup, hopefully you can dust Voldemort in the graveyard, just bring hella backup, and make sure HIS doesn't even show up.

If it seems too risky, just let things play out as they did, but find some other way for the chain of custody on the Elder Wand to go my way.

Also, murder Death Eaters. Lotsa lotsa murder on Death Eaters. JKR's Harry operates from the angle that killing is the worst thing ever. I wouldn't have that rule. The kid gloves would come off. I think Sirius and Remus could be talked into going all John Wick. And if Dumbledore advised against it, I'd point out what a GARGANTUAN HYPOCRITE he is.

I'd introduce Ron to Susan Bones or w/e and keep Hermione AND Ginny AND Luna for myself in school. (unless Ginny was SUPER jealous and didn't wanna swing. Not risking it.)

Also fuck becoming an Auror. In this 'line I'd have the Potter inheritance (and also possibly Sirius' too if he wound up getting himself killed). I'd just be a rich guy. If Ginny wanted to work I'd support her but I would just have rich guy hobbies and maybe start a business. Hell, maybe I'd buy a Quidditch team if I could afford it.

** Assuming Dumbledore is a good, smart person who means well (obviously barring the narrative necessities of his incompetence), I would talk to him first and try very hard to brainstorm a way to keep Voldemort trapped instead of killing him.

To ensure Harry's survival, Voldemort must tether him to life via Lily's sacrificial protection and kill him personally - with the amount of bloodshed that could be avoided in preventing Voldemort's resurrection, this plan becomes difficult to justify, especially with prior knowledge to prevent it. If it's not possible to contain him after the events of book one, deal with Pettigrew and Crouch - who would help him rise then?

Arguably, all this simply delays the inevitable. Perhaps prophecy would still come calling regardless of these decisions, in which case I think the war would likely be as bloody and hard as it was in canon.

Minus the management of Voldemort, I'd be studying magic to the exclusion of all else and really just enjoying magical life as much as possible.

If you get him to like you Canon Dumbledore would probably be okay with that, just look at what he says to Harry in Order of the Phoenix

#+begin_quote
  `I cared about you toy much,ʹ said Dumbledore simply. `I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

  `Is there a defence? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have ‐ and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined ‐ not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. *What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive*, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.

Seriously tho my actions from the moment I woke up started changing everything meaning that my plot armour is gone and as a grown man (mentally) and knowing that there is an actual threat to my life I should be able to focus and prioritize a lot better than Harry did Try to learn occulemency And start experimenting with rituals to figure out which ones have negative side affects (don't want to end up like Tom) Kill quirell during a feast maybe Halloween do it in front of a lot of witnesses so that nobody can deny toms survival

** I'd probably just take whatever time I have left in that world to be briefly a kid again. No worries beyond trivial homework, no complicated math (Thanks, Wizarding education with optional Arithmancy)

Explore Hogwarts, obviously. Though with a measure of care.

No playing Quidditch. Never been very athletic in my current life, and considering a particularily bad rollercoaster made me puke, that is just asking for trouble. I'd totally root for whatever House I end up in, though. Which would probably be Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. Gryffindor is possible even if I have never been particularily brave, but I dunno.

I'd totally treasure the Invisibility Cloak though, and hide it well. That Hallow is not leaving my possession again until the day I die. If I can, I'd get the Resurrection Stone too, and reset it in a ring after doing an academic exercise. I would have little desire to summon James and Lily, but there are deceased relatives from my old life I'd love to have a talk to again, if that is possible. Say goodbye properly, so to say. But after that the Stone can be a ring garnet once more. The Wand is cursed, and I would never want to willingly possess it. If I did happen upon it, I would place it deep beneath the tomb of Antiochus Peverell, and obliviate myself of the knowledge. It deserves to be laid to rest.

I'd probably be less awkward around girls, owing to whatever maturity I gained post puberty. I would not date, however, as my mind is that of a 20 year old. Maybe someone older or long after Hogwarts. Probably not, however.

As for defeating Voldemort ?

I'd be unable to.

Might as well live those few years I do have with comfort and see all there is to see before I die to a second Avada Kedavra. That would still be nice.

** When i read the title of the post while scrolling down, my verbal reaction was "F**King Cry".

And while that is almost definitely true, knowing as I do the various tragedies that surround my new life and future. For that first day there is one major thing I would change and a couple things that may be possible but would probably need to wait.

The major change, I ask Draco to help me pull a prank on "An annoying redhead I saw shouting in the second hand robes store" You see he had a pet rat and how funny would it be if the Aurors got an anonymous tip that his family was harboring a criminal hiding as an animagus. it would take a bit more finessing than that but you get the gist.

The other things I would look into are less opportunistic and more about quality of life.

Some stereotypical shopping, new clothes/glasses, some more books so I can read about more than just the first year curriculum. Buy a trunk that can shrink so I can hide it or carry it with me ("so the Dursleys cant lock it away" I would tell Hagrid), if auto shrinking is not a canon enchantment then I would get a undetectable expansion charmed bag to shove my stuff in, that at least I know is doable as Hermione had a purse she fit a whole portrait through fitting a trunk into a backpack should be easy.

Talking to my account manager about some very profitable investments (this might need to wait so I could be on time to meet Draco). Visiting a magical general practitioner (not all healing has to happen at Hogwarts or a hospital) to do a full physical and make sure there is nothing that needs fixing. Stock up on non perishables so I know the Dursleys cant starve me if I don't need them for the rest of this summer than at least they won't go bad.

And then I go "home" and study all about magic waiting to hear about the fireworks I set off with my prank.

Why kill Voldemort when I can fund him directly, and if he can bring back James and Lily cool.

I'd be sorted into Hufflepuff but if not then my ambition would be to get a harem.

Maybe be Wizarding Iron Man for fun, self sacrifice to get rid of the Horcrux.

This is me just playing I guess...

If I'm serious I'd have fun in Hogwarts, bully Draco for a bit. Make a shitty band and perform music ripped from the .muggle world that hasn't been released yet...

Make Hermione guess as to what iam, tell Dumbledore about the Horcruxes and let him deal with it.

Be the worst student and get in trouble, make a team with Fred and George and battle the slimy snakes.

Join a Quidditch team and if a player touches me I'll jump off my broom and tell murder to get a penalty, start a couple riots, annoy the house elfs.

Try to get blue flames and a katana and force people to call me Rin...

Also I'd fuck about with the Dursleys like burning their house down, getting Dudley drunk at 9 by switching his water...

** Welp, in order:Year one:-Go shopping with Hagrid

-Study. Like, a lot. Try to figure out how close of a blood relation needs to be for protections to work, ask Dumbledore about it if necessary (that one propably after he tells me)

-Go RoR -> mirror of Erised instead of taking the scenic route, try getting the stone. Fail miserably because i actually want the damn thing, but i'd be damned if i didn't try.

-Do nothing worthy of note, let Quirellmort wither away on his own gazing away at the mirror at the end of the year.

-Oh yeah i've got no clue how i'd be sorted tbh. Might just go Gryffindor. Be mates with Ron because why not, bloke's a great dude.

-Not touch Sirius/Pettigrew affair, Sirius did well enough for 10 years, he'll make it another 2, and i don't want a surprise!Voldemort getting at me before schedule. Or expected!Voldemort at all if possible.

-Get some info from Dumbledore about why i'm at the Dursleys (tied with point 4 and blood protection effectivness), ask about Voldie's real name

Year 2:

-Tell Dobby i'm a good boy and i know all about The Plot (TM) and he needn't worry, now give me back me paper since i need some of that human contact and help getting out

-If i've managed to befriend Ron - go canon route, go to signing, 'see' Malfoy slipping diary into Ginny's cauldron, retrieve Book of Doom (TM)

-Give the book to Dumbledore, say it's funny since it writes back to me and says it's Tom Riddle

-Chill for the rest of the semester

-Look up Patronus charm

Year 3:

-Not get kissed by SoulEaters

-Tell Marge to stuff it

-Pet the Friendly Black Doggo

-Learn Stun and Animagi Detection Charm

-Give a pet rat to Dumbledore

-Chill for the rest of the semester

Year 4:

-See that damn Cup with me new Godfather (hopefully)

-Check that 'empty' seat next to Winky

Then it all hinges on how did Peter and Crouch debacles went. If they both locked up - chill for the next few years. If not, and The Plot is back on track (easy to tell since Soul Link will give me some funny dreams if Voldie's coming):

-Get into tournament, 'cause i really have no choice.

-Try to make it through

-"Oy, Cedric, what if it's not a real cup but another obstacle? Do that thing from the first task and send a doggo to check before we grab it"

-<shocked pikachu face>

-Red sparks go brrr

-Talk to Dumbles about Soul Link Dreams, ask for Occlumency lessons

If i fuck up and Voldie's comes back anyway:

-Since i didn't dust Quirell, he doesn't know about blood protection. Chill and let him off himself the next time he tries to kill me.

-Once i learn Occlumency - tell Dumbledore about 'last funny dream i had' about a shack with a ring in it. Tell him to take backup/me so he doesn't get offed by it.

-Then chill, study soul magic and hope Voldie ain't comin' back with me blood, cause if he does i'm screwed - i know about 'screwy love magic plot Dumbledore figured out' and i won't sacrifice myself since it's me and not Harry - either live my peacful days out, or try to separate the soul of Voldemort from me somehow, or bank on my soul being a different entity than Harry's+Voldie's so i can tank a killing curse and still stay there.

Then finish Hogwart's, figure out how to get muggle proof of education and go to med school instead of engineering this time around while studying magic in my free time since i'd prefer some easier university this time around. Go check if this pararell Universe has my own version living in it unawares of magic, if so - give a primer about it once that counterpart is in me twenties so i don't have to deal with fear of death no more.

** Well, first I'd scream "Fuck! When I said I wanted to go to Hogwarts this is NOT WHAT I MEANT!!"

I'd keep my current adult personality, because I /really/ don't want to go through my teenage years again. Once was enough, thank you very much.

The most important thing I need to do first is obtain a source of my medications, because if I'm going to defeat the Dark Lord then I can't have my OCD and ADD in the way. I'll have three weeks to get my hands on them or I'm dead. Literally.

Once I have the medication (maybe I can get Hagrid to hook me up) I spend the summer studying and carefully tapering up to my current dosage (I'd probably die if I immediately went for my current dose, doctors already pause when I tell them how much I take). Though instead of an owl, I'd have Hagrid get me a cat, because I'm a cat person. In fact, I'd make him get me Crookshanks. Sorry Hermione, but I need the super intelligent cat.

Now it's time to turn on the charm. I try to befriend or at least be very cordial with everyone I come across (yes, even Malfoy), because then they'll be more willing to help me. Sure, Malfoy, I'll be your friend. Here, Ron, let me buy us a bunch of snacks. Wow, Hermione, it's super cool that you can already do a few simple spells! Absolutely Neville, I'll help look for your toad!

The second biggest hurdle will be getting into Gryffindor. I'm very much a Slytherin (my relentless determination and ability to play a ton of roles), but I need Ron and Hermione. To accomplish this, I'll let the Sorting Hat see my non-Potter memories and tell it I have a mission so it has to put me in Gryffindor. If I don't get into Gryffindor, I immediately leave Hogwarts and transfer to Ilvermorny because fuck this. The Dursleys would be all too glad to ship me off to America. Once there, I establish contact with my parents, become a dear family friend, and have a nice, peaceful life.

Okay, I make it into Gryffindor. I make friends with everyone there. Then, I turn the charm on my teachers. Growing up I was always the teacher's pet, so this won't be hard. The biggest challenge will be getting Snape to like me, but since I'll be fem!Harry I won't remind him as much of James. I'll be respectful, polite, and helpful. I'll work extra hard and butter him up. I'll tell him how much I admire him. Hell, I'll even get him a Christmas present, and a birthday present, too.

Once Snape likes me, I go in for the kill. I change my behavior suddenly so he gets suspicious and reads my mind to find out what's up. That's where I'll let him see my "real" memories and how everything plays out. He will immediately march me off to Dumbledore to verify what the fuck is going on. My knowledge lets Dumbledore know where all of the horcruxes are and that Sirius is innocent. Since I am only 11 and Dumbledore now has everything he needs to know, he can do it all himself.

I use Parseltongue to help Dumbledore defeat the basilisk so the sword of Gryffindor is strong enough to destroy horcruxes. He then goes out and destroys them. The Diary will be hard to get, though, right? Nope! Remember how I befriended Draco, too? I get him to get the diary for me and bring it to Dumbledore. Bing bang boom, horcruxes dealt with.

BUT! Do I ever have a fantastic plan for getting rid of the horcrux inside me. And Nagini.

We reveal Pettigrew to the world and I go off to live with my godfather Sirius Black, because fuck those Dursleys. I already have enough torment in my brain being barely held back by my medication, I don't need those abusive fucks bugging me, too. Instead, Snape is the one to go get Voldemort from Albania. Dumbledore gets a gun and polyjuices into me, and then the ritual happens.

Only, it's not my blood, right? So that whole protection thing doesn't happen. Voldemort rises out of the cauldron, and Dumbledore breaks free and shoots him in the head. Then he kills Nagini.

That still leaves horcrux-me. But instead of killing me, Snape simply repeats the ritual to bring him back, thus using the horcrux-me. Dumbledore shoots Voldemort once more, and now he's dead for good.

I proceed to live the rest of my life in relative peace. And am immediately re-sorted into Slytherin because I did it all through manipulating others.

Oh, and I buy stock in Amazon as soon as that becomes a thing.

*** You can't join the SAS(or any UKSF unit as a civilian). Of course you could just Imperio them as back up, would be a lot faster.

All one has to do to prevent Voldemort's return is to expose Peter. Without Peter, Voldemort can't carry out his plans to get a body and Dumbledore can take care of the Horcruxes.

** I would let things happen till I get to kings cross, get on the platform by myself, find out le Jordon and the twins and join the most mischievous group. Having fun in a magical world is the best.

I would crack Snape in my first term with all my tragedy and a little story about petunia telling me everything of past and about him being my only friend here at Hogwarts. Learn everything from him for my future training. Legillimence, dark arts, potions and the subtle art of not giving a fuck when needed. I would love to get the plot Armor for first 4 books while keeping all the things same. Probably ask out Hermione on regular basis from 3rd book onwards and go to ball with her.

(Now keeping it canon and not running away from voldy and finishing him off as fast as possible I'll play it out as in books) On Voldemort's return, I'll convince everyone of his return. First sending Dumbledore and ministry to the graveyard of tom's father to trace magic and ritual and maybe find the man himself. Then confront Dumbledore about my dreams and connection and a lot of surfacing memories about horcruxes and a vivid memory of me asking Horris about them.

We can go on horcrux hunt together as I tell him all the visions I keep getting and calling of little voices in my head which keep leading us to all of them except me and snake. At the end of 5th year, I retrieve the prophecy alone as an act with Dumbledore waiting for voldy in atrium. I let the killing curse hit me to protect Dumbledore. He then go ahead and fight with my protection and finish the snake and then voldy.

I'll ho back to my Godfather, tell him about Reddit and it's redeculos fanfiction subr. I live with Padfoot till my coming of age, ‘charm' Granger, inherit my ancestors money and power and enjoy the Wizarding world for ages to come with my ‘borrowed' stone from first year with the greatest witch of my age.
