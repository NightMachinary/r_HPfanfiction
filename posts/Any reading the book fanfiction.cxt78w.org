** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1244458/][Struggle to Salvation]] is a lengthy fic I accidentally stumbled upon, I didn't know it was a 'reading the book' story, I just started randomly reading it, but had to abandon it due to the length. It is probably, just what you are looking for.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's had a hard life, much harder than most people could have ever thought of. Unfortunately, it only gets harder on him in his fifth year. Finally he's had enough and decides to go all out for once, but when Umbridge fights back, it affects both his life, and possibly her freedom...permanently. This may sound like the story Exploring Harry Potter's Life. Well...it is. When reading this story, you will have to have the appropriate book beside you. This is a reading the book fic, without the actual story line. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. Labels: Paragraph = self explanatory.Dialogue line = One or two lines where a character speaks or does an action while speaking.Dialogue set = More than two lines where a character is speaking and doing actions.
