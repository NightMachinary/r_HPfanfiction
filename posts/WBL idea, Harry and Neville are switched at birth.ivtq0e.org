Most wrong boy who lived stories involve a brother to Harry. Not this one. Harry and Neville are switched at birth. An overworked nurse puts the boys in the wrong basinet. The switch isn't discovered until the sorting hat is placed on faux Neville and the sorting hat says you aren't Neville Longbottom you are Harry Potter. I know the difference between the Potter and Longbottom magic.


** Hmm... Interesting idea.. But how would this work since Harry is literally a spitting image of James though?

*** Obviously there's some sort of magical incident changing their appearances, which is what causes the swap in the first place.

*** Maybe Augusta takes back Actual Neville? And maybe she thinks actual Harry is as big of a disappointment that she thought of actual Neville first year Canon, so gives him up?
