I really wanna read one that's like this, as much as possible pleeease??

I'm gonna write one myself, oh I've been planning to do that for ages (actually it's been about 2 weeks, since the first time I watched Peter Pan (this year) with Jason isaccs as hook) I just wanna finish something else first 😅

But I really wanna read something like this, like where Harry could hate both of them, dumbles and voldy, or could be neutral to them o that's one like the other I don't care But as long as he's kinda like voldys son, tho he's not evil or anything, he's not out to kill him or anyone else, he's not the boy who lived but still the chosen one or something idc, but he's like, voldy trusts him dumbles trusts him he doesn't give away plans or anything, has some control over the death eaters

I don't care what the other characters are doing but I don't really want any relationships but if there is any, no dramione please and no harmione. Drarry yes Wolfstar yes Romione yes. But still preferably no relationships 🙏

I dunno if there's any like this? But if there is please link it 😑🙏😅🌟


** Anyone willing to work with Voldemort is evil, what with all the murder and bigotry

*** Okay I mean, true, but like I mean

Harry doesn't kill or torture, he blatantly refuses, and half the time he doesn't even watch, and voldy cant force him to Or something? I just mean Harry isn't completely Voldemort evil?
