Well, i love almost every pairing if it is well written, but there is a pairings that works better on different tropes. Here's mine:

Post war : Harry/Hermione

Time travel to marauder era : Harry/Bellatrix

Harem : Harry/Fleur/Tonks

Soul bond : Harry/Ginny

Fix it/Re do/Second Chance : Harry/Daphne, Harry/Hermione, most of the pairing works well here

Guilty pleasure : Harry/Narcissa

What's yours?


** I can love or hâte any couple according to thé writing, but my favorites are :

Post war : Harry/Ginny

Time travel to marauder era : Harry/Bellatrix

Trios : Harry/Daphnée/Pansy or Harry/Patil twins, Carrow twins work too.

Harem : Harry/Luna/Fleur/Tonks/...

Soul bond : I hate this trope, but Harry/Gabrielle Delacour

Fix it/Re do/Second Chance : Harry/Slytherin girl.

Guilty pleasure : Harry/Older woman

A/B/O : Worst pairing and worst trope.

Harems: Harry/Hermione/Ginny/Luna/Tonks/GTBNL (Girl To Be Named Later)

Time Travel to Marauder's Era: Harry/Any Black Sister

Soul Bond: Harry/Hermione

Other Bonds: Harry/Fleur, Harry/Luna

Fix it/redo: Harry/Hermione, or any of the Trios

Post war: Harry/Hermione or any of the Trios

Guilty Pleasure: Harry/Narcissa/Bellatrix

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

** Overall I am open to pretty much any and every pairing as long as a couple criteria are met.

No drastic physical or mental age differences: No time travel into younger body relationships, no Harry/Snape without time travel to equalize ages)

No unhealthy power dynamics: No forced relationships, no slavery, no will-overriding soul bonds.

Written believably: Canon Draco and Hermione could never work. Give me a believable reason to see the two together and I'm perfectly happy.

As long as those are met I'm happy with any relationship. The only times I tend to have a preference are for Time Travel to the Mauraders era, when I generally prefer Harry with sane/pre Death Eater Bella.

** How long post war? Hermione might be better at comforting Harry in the immediate aftermath, but eg Northumbrian has done a good job of writing Harry/Ginny domestic life years and years later.
