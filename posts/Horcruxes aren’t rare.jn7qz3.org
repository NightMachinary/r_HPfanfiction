Tom Riddle thinks he's landed upon a rare and special discovery when he finds the book on horcruxes in the restricted section of Hogwarts library. It turns out, it's not rare at all and instead is a common practice, and the reason magical people live so long.

Perhaps the trope of them (horcruxes) only lasting a particularly long lifetime is applicable; meaning that people use them to avoid death by accident, but still die of old age.


** Well then Hogwarts turns into a hunger games sort of arena and hopefully when you attempt to murder someone for the process of making a horcrux, you pray they don't already have one and are willing to make a second. Also, taking into account the theories that making a horcrux involves necrophilia or cannibalism, I would think that the school punishes rather harshly being caught outside your dorms after curfew and Filch is righteously entitled to requesting the return of the punishment by whipping only for having to clean all that mess alone on a daily basis. All in all, I am grateful I never received a Hogwarts acceptance letter in your world.

*** omg amazing!

Though I have to say I've never heard those theories about necrophilia and cannibalism, though now that I think of it, they sound about right

** A bit of a different angle than yours, but I'm actually really biased towards my headcanon that the reason Horcruxes are seen so rarely isn't because they are obscure. I actually headcanon it that pretty much any Pureblood family or any person that takes an interest in obscure and 'dark' magics recognizes the name instantly. But the reason they are so rare is that in order to make one you need to have some mental peculiarities that are insanely rare in a person. Like believing your own life is the only one that is worth anything, and maintaining that belief constantly or else the Horcrux falls apart. Not feeling emotions (the way a psycopath does not), and stuff like that. Things that would normally be tackled really early on by parents and mended at least enough to make a Horcrux impossible.

​

TL;DR: Horcruxes aren't obscure at all, it's just that Tom and Herpo were among the very few that had the right combo of mental problems to make creating one possible.

** "What do you mean, murder? How old is that book? Oh, that makes sense; it was Professor Dumbledore who discovered it's unnecessary. You can just Confund yourself into thinking jaywalking is a horrible sin and break your soul that way."

** In fact, phylactery soul binding is taught in 7th year. It is 400 years of improvements on the old horcrux ritual.

These days, a proper horcrux is generally only made by indy geniuses with more magic than sense. But once they fracture their soul, the phylactery method wont work, bwa-wahmp.
