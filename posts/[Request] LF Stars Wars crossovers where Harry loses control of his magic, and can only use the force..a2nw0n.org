** What's the difference? In fact if we look at some of the force feats in various SW materials they far exceed anything done in HP-verse:

- Vitiate drained lifeforce of ENTIRE planets.
- Sidious could summon force storms that destroyed entire fleets.
- Mother Talzin used force voodoo across the galaxy to literally torture count Dooku.
- Sidious and Yoda able to see into the future, sense danger and deaths of other characters across the galaxy.
- Heightened senses, strength and speed far beyond normal human and anything achievable with magic.
- Mental shields, mind reading, etc.
- Luke could walk ainaided literally on molten Lava.
- Luke was able to project himself onto another planet.
- Force lighting
- Extraordinary telekinetic abilities.
- Ability to create illusions and trap others in them (Sidious trapped Yoda in an illusion in one of the animated series. Sort of)

And all of that without a wand or any other focusing device. You want Harry helpless? Just take away his wand!

Secondly can a lightsaber deflect spells? (Most magic are depicted as points of light that travel through space and time - much like blaster bolts) - if yes (and it's up to you) then jedi/sith can easily fight him and even deflect his own spells back at him.

I think good story would find a way to balance different characters and their respective powers. Also why would Harry's magic be different from the Force? I mean it doesn't have to be the same, but it could be simply a different way of using it.

Just my 2c. Good luck with your story.

*** In both of my stories, I have magic and the force as the same thing. I essentially use the excuse of them simply being the result of difference disciplines or upbringing. I think of it like an RPG, like you've got wizards, clerics, druids, shamans, etc. They all do different things, but really, in the end, it's all just magic.

**** That's actually how I've seen several of my favorite crossovers do things. The Force, Magic, some minor differences in terms of philosophy and handling of it but in the end it's the same mystical power.

*** Just to tack on to this, SW abilities OP listed out are non-canon, and are used only by the masters of the greatest jedi or sith to exist in all time. I'll take magic where anything is possible, then the force where it fucks with your head.
