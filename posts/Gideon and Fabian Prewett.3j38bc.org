Anyone read any good fics featuring the two of them? Especially as the lead character(s)?

I read one of Mary Royale's fics and found them really entertaining

linkffn(The Best Laid Plans) (does this work on the initial post?)


** I read one where they were side-characters, but they were brilliant and very entertaining. It was a time travel fic, so I just need to figure out which one it was.

  Madara had a plan. The Yondaime ruined it. Madara made another plan. One that could not fail. But the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry and this one had just run straight into the number one most surprising ninja in Konoha, one Uzumaki Naruto.
