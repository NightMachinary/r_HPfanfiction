I am looking/requesting a fanfiction where little orphan Harry either learns that he is a Magi via a fantasy book or something like that at a young age. From then on, he tries to get his magic to work and starts to create his own spells or recreate them wandlessly. There are some fics that I have read that involve this premise, however, one is not the best quality and is dead, and the other has Harry sleeping with everything with a heart beat.

If someone accepts this challenge to write it, I do not want it to be the cliche 'Independent Harry'. Yeah, if he has looked into D&D then he could get a bag of holding, but I do not expect an 11 YEAR OLD to be able to make financial deals with goblins, buy a trunk that could fit everything, get some weird magical familiar, or stuff like that. An Idea that one could use would be Harry finding that the Wizarding Word sucks and instead emulates the Sorcerers of fantasy.

If one has any other questions, feel free to ask. PS, I would write it myself, but I have quite a few projects (Including a Harry Potter Fic) that I wold have to deal with first.


** Blindness, linkffn(10937871) might be what you're looking for... Harry doesn't discover magic himself, but is told about it by the Dursleys. Plenty of self taught magic though...

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Seconding Blindness as a recommendation. Although it doesn't involve DnD, it is a very well written story about Harry making his own spells from scratch and being as a whole, rather unimpressed with the Wizarding World.

** Take a look at 'Core Threads' linkffn(10136172). An injured Harry instinctively calls on his magic to heal his wounds and experiments with his abilities without guidance, rapidly bootstrapping himself into near godhood.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Crossovers are one of my favourite types of Fics, even writing a few. However, I never got into Fairytale and I only got up to episode 18 of Naruto (There was a scene I wanted to see) before I gave up because of all the filler.

The Issue with other muggleborns is one that needs to be dealt with in a way that is unique or something like that. If I were to write it, I would go the Horcrux route like I did in Henrietta Potter and the Secret of the Horcrux. Basically, due to a burst of accidental magic, H(arry)enrietta is left alone in the woods and quickly succumbs to both the snowy weather and exhaustion. The Horcrux takes notice that its vessel is dying and (due to Voldies lack of knowledge on the subject of Horcruxes) tries to fix it but ends up merging with Henrietta. Due to this, she now has hidden knowledge of how magic works and (Because tom could do it) wandless magic.

Wizards need to stop using 'obliviate' as a be all and end all of problem solving.

** Check out Rising Powers linkffn(5133535) if you haven't already, it's not the best and hasn't been updated in over a year but it's certainly long enough to be enjoyable. Harry takes notice of his magic early and tries to find ways to make it work inspired by books and movies, he also runs into Hermione early on and teaches he too.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.
