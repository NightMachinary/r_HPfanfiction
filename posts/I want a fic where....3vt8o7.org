... the main trio stays very close friends, but each is paired up with outside people (i.e. no Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny). To be honest, both of those pairings just turn me off, but I adore the close-knit dynamic between the three of them, and I want a story that focuses on them as "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners][Heterosexual Life Partners]]". I think it's more realistic for them to meet other people (or not) and have romantic relationships with them, instead of finding romance within their close circle of friends (this includes Ginny).


** Damn this sounds great, let me know if you find anything like it!

** It's annoying that whenever one of the Trio enter a lasting relationship with a character outside of the circle, the other two usually hook up - Harry/Ron included. That being said, there was one fic of indeterminate titling had Harry marry Parvati and Hermione with another witch. Can't remember what Ron was doing, but he was around.

I'm hoping to do this at some point... will probably take around ten years at this rate though, lol.

And good luck with that!

** This is exactly what I was rooting for in canon actually. I didn't want any of them to end up together. It's an ongoing fanfic search of mine but I don't have any results. Still wading through the muck. One day.

... I guess I haven't contributed much to this discussion. Sorry.

** The Problem with Purity by (I think?) silver birch (on mobile; can't look it up) ... Has Hermione/Snape and Harry/Draco. I don't remember who Ron or Ginny ends up with, though.

*** No. I shall never read Hermione/Snape or Harry/Draco or anything like that. Far too OOC for me.

***** Oh gosh! Hermione is a, like, a unicorn animagus, so she only eats salad, fruit salad, and chocolate mousse.

******* She eats very little and requires less sleep because she's a unicorn animagus, yes.

It is probably the only 'magical animagus' fic that I actually liked. Probably because of how extensive the author expands several forms of magic from canon (animagus, potions, dueling, wards).

******** I read it ages ago when my tastes were even less refined. Basically, it works because its decently written enough to be enjoyable and is long and completed.
