:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago where Harry is a genius, but not in a showy way: he's just very smart, but also very quiet. Petunia is glad that he is artistic and delicate compared to Dudley, making comments about Evanses appreciating beautiful things (there is a birthday present of a big sparkly ball?).

She is much more ambivalent towards Harry than in canon, and it is left ambiguous how much she loves him. She makes him very distrustful of Dumbledore. It's left unclear if her helping Harry is entirely to get revenge against Dumbledore by ruining his plans, or if her lack of affection and hardness towards Harry is an attempt to protect him (and her) from what is to come. There are moments where she is teaching Harry lessons about how to approach things, and Harry clearly understands, even though it is never spoken.

There's a focus on the idea that Harry has to be given â€˜safe' things to play with, particularly innterms of how Vernon sees it. And a scene where he gets his own room, and I think he is given paints and decorates it?

Anyway, I remember it as an interesting angle on the Dursley dynamic, but I haven't read it for a long time so it could be awful! I can't seem to Google it up, though.


** That does sound interesting. Ping me if you find it, will you?

**** So, I started it, and the Dursley dynamic was somewhat interesting. And then Harry went to Diagon Alley, and established that he's Lord Potter, with at least three different Gringotts vaults, and four properties including a manor, which the goblins are happy to show him around, and eight house elves, and he gets a one-of-a-kind custom wand attuned to all four elements and containing a core that's never been used in a wand before, and a magical hold-everything trunk and a special potions kit and a fix for his eyesight, and his aunt is arranging to sue a bunch of publishers for writing fictional stories about him...oh, and his parents left him letters that explained all about the Marauders and Snape and what they expected of his guardianship, plus a magical protective amulet and an heir ring. And apparently, being eleven and a Potter, he could then expect to have a dream where he would see his fated true love.

Sigh. Oh well.

***** Yeah, like I said I think I mixed some of it in my head with a different fic, although I /think/ it ends with a nice moment for Petunia (if I recall). I similarly got disappointed as it went down the superpowered Potter route.

  What if Petunia put the blame where it belonged instead of on Harry? OOC Petunia Dursley Rating for mild language

*** I'll add that while it is the one I was thinking of, I think I've muddled it in my mind with another fic that had more of a focus on only giving Harry safe things out of fear of what he would do, and I think it's the other fic that had the sparkly ball and Evanses appreciating beauty.

** Oh im sure ive read this!! In the story, harry is actually quiet because he had lived in germany? Or some european country in a open studio apartment with Lily and James who became artists. Harry thus grows up practicing painting and when Lily and James are murdered one night and Harry moves to the Dursley's, Petunia forces him to paint so she can sell them (which is the majority of his chores).

I remember enjoying it but i can't remember the name either!! Ill try search for it but changing phones deleted all my saved fics unfortunately smh

*** Not that one, no. In this one, the only thing explicitly changed is Petunia's reactions (although things happen that may not be canon, which influence that). That then changes other things.

** Hey OP , it could have been Harry Potter and the methods of Rationality? I read it a long time ago and it does seem to fit that desc. Cheers, :)

*** Lol, no. I don't think there's a single part of my description that fits hpmor, and the fic I'm thinking of is full of emotionally intelligent motives for what people do and how they feel.
