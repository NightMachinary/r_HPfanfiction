edit: Ummm. Sorry for the spam, I actually found it. I was at my wit's end when I posted this and I think the process of posting jogged my memory. It's called Paradigm of Uncertainty and it is written by Lori. If you haven't heard of it before, it's truly wonderful! Sorry again!

Hello, I for the life of me can't remember the name of the author or fanfic, but there's one I remember really enjoying that was written right around the time Cassandra Claire was really popular. These two fanfics(the draco trilogy and this one I'm looking for) are really the only fanfics I've ever read and I'm really sad I can't find it. If I remember correctly, and I might not have, but this other fanfic was title like the originals where it goes, "Harry Potter and the _____". I seem to remember it being somewhat of a play on words too, like "paradox or problems" or something.

They were both updated on this site that was specifically for novel-length fanfic whose name I also cannot remember. Sorry for being outrageously vague, but if this rings any bells for anyone, I would be absolutely psyched to reread this piece of literature. Thanks in advance for anyone who tries!

Also, I might be wrong, but I think the author's name started with an "m".


** I went looking for this exact fanfic last month. I remember it, always, for the swing-dancing. It is, in fact, where I first heard of the song "Switchblade 327." Which is how I found it. After a week of wondering, I just plugged in Harry Potter and the song title.

** Is it Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality? It fits all of your descriptions, though you didn't say whether your fic was completed or not (this one isn't.)

*** No, it doesn't. The /Draco Trilogy/ was from 10+ years ago. /MoR/'s only ~2 years old (can't be bothered to look up actual date).
