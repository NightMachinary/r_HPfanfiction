Why the hell is Minerva so loyal to Dumbledore? Her response to his bullshit requests and handing off his job to her should be along the lines of /yawn/ /blank stare/ "I'm going to dinner and a nap." Based on her actions and demonstrated attitudes she should really have been some form of shepherd or retriever. Maybe a collie.

The obvious answer is, of course, "Rowling isn't a detail writer", but I've never seen this raised in fanfics, even when the writers spend multiple chapters on Animagus theory and practice, and are all "discover your inner self". Am I missing something?

Canon examples include Pettigrew = rat because disloyal, lazy and disgusting (which is way off base for anyone who's owned a rat, but a common misconception so OK, JKR, whatever,), Sirius = dog because daaawg, James = stag because proud and possessive of Lily.

Fanfic examples are legion.


** Just a side note, but I believe Minerva's "blind devotion" to Dumbledore is greatly exaggerated in fanon.

*** This. The series literally opens with her criticising him for trusting Hagrid with baby Harry.

She's loyal to him largely because she agrees with him. But where she disagrees she has no hesitation in making her disagreement known.

**** This goes right with Hermione harboring a blind, uncontested trust in authority figures. The girl who lied about pursuing the troll on her own to make friends, made the Polyjuice Potion, turned back time to rescue an escaped Azkaban inmate, tried to upend the Hogwarts house elf system, founded a secret club in explicit violation of authoritarian rules and ended up fighting a war.

Lol, Hermione Granger is one of the most rebellious characters in the Potterverse. Just because she trusted that Dumbledore knows what he's doing doesn't make her a lapdog of Authority.

**** Yeah she might tell Dumbly how she feel but still follows his word to the T.

She let him leave a baby outside in the cool with only a blanket and note. Show me in canon where anyone cast any spell to help a baby stay warm or a sleep. At his age a kid would get cold wake up, cry and then craw around.

She asked if they could do some thing about the scare but because her hero gave some odd answer about scares can be useful she does not insist on getting a kid that just got hit by an AK spell get a small look over by even a school nurse let alone a healer.

The even though she liked both his parents and she knew where he was and that they where "the worst sort of muggles" she still never went to even check on him. She could have went and made it so no one would have known but she did not because blind faith.

Plus she could not have been really thought Hagrid was a bad "babysitter" because it is the same person that first takes him back to the wizarding world just a few pages after. What changed her mind to think maybe Hagrid was maybe not so bad a keeper? One thing...blind faith.

I could go on if need be but it is clear that she might tell the headmaster her thoughts but still always follows what he said no matter what.

** Sirius' animagus form was a play on his name. Sirius is the dog star, making his name “Dog Black” essentially. Hence him being a black dog.

** Considering that the form an Animagus gains comes from the same place as a person's Patronus, the Animagus is a physical expression of the soul, but unlike a Patronus, a person's Animagus form is set once they complete the transformation, so while a person can change, their form cannot once it's been set.

** I think the idea of matching animagus forms to personalities came after Rowling had already introduced McGonagall to us as an animagus.

Actually... do we know that she is an actual animagus and wasn't just using some generic form of self-trasfiguration?

** In response to Pettigrew's form, the way I see it the animagus forms are based on common depictions of animals. I mean, snakes aren't evil, but in religious and mythical stuff they are often depicted that way. Same thing with rats. They make really intelligent, cute pets, but Rowling seems to go on the way animals are traditionally depicted. And when people think of rats, they usually think of wild, disgusting, disease ridden rats. I don't know whether that's a misconception on Rolwing's part, or her just using the widespread ideas people have on animals.

So Pettigrew; indeed, lazy, disgusting and a piece of vermin.

Sirius; his animagus form is of course based on his name, but he's also incredibly loyal and playful (prankster).

James; I would say he's a stag more he likes to strut, rather than being posessive. But proud, definitely

And as for McGonagall, I don't know, it fits somehow. But that might just be me. She comes off as stern and severe, but she's got a pretty soft heart underneath. That fits with some of the cats I've been petsitting, who had to warm up to me at first and were distant and untrusting, but turned out to be wonderful cats once they started trusting me. But I admit McGonagall's animagus form is the least obvious out of all of them and perhaps the least logical.

And either way, I sometimes petsit a wonderful cat who is completelly stupid, wants constant attention, is a lapcat and really clumsy. Aloof and disinterested doesn't go up for every cat.

** An animagus form perfectly reflecting somebody's character doesn't quite make sense anyways. After all, your character changes all the time. You can fundamentally change as a person in just a few short years. Yet, there's nothing to suggest that an animagus form changes. Not that it matters much for literature, since you'll only see a small slice of a character's life at a time.

Of course, there's more to cats than sleeping all day and eating whenever. They /have/ to play or hunt or they get bored. They're solitary most of the time, but are still capable of social behavior and do form small packs on occasion. When they're hurt or scared, they isolate themselves and hide, which is sometimes instead interpreted as pride. Lord knows we have plenty of ideas about arrogant cats.

You can write around that anyways. Perhaps Minerva /used/ to be aloof and disinterested. If somebody also had an academic interest, then went into teaching, they would seem like a strict professional. Only socialize when necessary, and only develop a tolerance for others after prolonged exposure. You could even write a fanfic about how she actually came to respect her colleagues, particularly Dumbledore, after the first conflict with Voldemort. You could use her reactions to others while she's a cat to illustrate what she thinks of them, and the big turning moment would be when she seeks out Dumbledore of her own accord - like how you know you've earned an aloof cat's respect when they come to you without any prompting or bribing.

The way I see it, it's not so much a plot hole as it is a missing detail which doesn't necessarily need to exist in most stories. Hell, it's not like it mattered much in canon anyways. About the only really important animagus transformation was Peter's, and the important thing was how it functioned as his disguise. On the other hand, you can expect a story with a focus on animagi to go in whatever direction they feel is most appropriate for making it an interesting topic in itself.

OH NO. THE THEORY OF SELF. People either never change or are always changing. I don't remember which philosopher said it, but it's been posited that our personalities are entirely contingent on circumstances and context and not at all solid so that would support that theory. Of course, there's a dozen to dispute it but that's philosophy for you.

** I always thought of the Animagus transformation as an expression of what you want from yourself. Not in your own animal choice (that part being more a subconscious choice), but in what it represents for you. And then as they come to understand their choice they grow closer and closer to it.

Take Peter, he was small and weak. And what he wanted was to be quick, smaller, sneakier even, and what he got was a rat.

I always thought James wanted to be a Lion, but ended up getting a Stag. Same concept of wanting to be proud, but different execution.

Sirius wanted to be a Dog I'd bet, but unfortunately got a scarier and more intimidating form than he wanted. Because of his own need to be strong, not wanting to be like his family.

McGonagall perhaps wanted to be Regal, or Aloof, or however she herself viewed cats. That represented what she wanted from herself.

Let's try Harry, what animal represents him? Perhaps a Peregrine Falcon, they travel farther than any other bird, fly faster than anything else, and are loyal to their partners, and in general are solitary. Good reasons, but that's fitting him to an animal to me.

Why would Harry want to be this animal? Because they are free, they go wherever they please, and they enjoy moving fast, talking down birds much larger than them. Size doesn't mean anything. From that mindset coming from an abusive household, regularly locked up by friends and family, the appeal of a flying form seems perfect.

Hermione, some would say she's an Owl, because Owls are representing smart people. That's pretty dumb reasoning. I'd choose a Lioness for her. She chose Gryffindor, she wants to be brave, she wants to learn, she wants friends. I think a young Hermione would easily pick the lion and be surprised at her subconscious choice.

Ron would want to be Lion for the same reasons as James to be brave and proud. I'd give him a peacock, remember the Mirror of Desire? He wants to be noticed, to be looked at, have fame. To not be like all the rest. It's not easy to ignore an peacock with it's tail flared. No matter how wide the shadow of being friends with Harry Potter is.
