[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/Literature]] Mostly plots from here but if there were other scrapped plots not listed, I will accept them. I find alot of these scrapped ones interesting (especially the Dean one which I remember Perils of Innocence bringing up) and was wondering if there was any fanfic authors that decided to tackle them. I recall several that had the Grangers raise Harry.


** What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin deals with the Dean plot line, kinda. Would be spoilers to say more.

** I think I only know about one scrapped Rowling story idea, and that was that the events of Half Blood Prince were going to happen during Chamber of Secrets? Or they were going to be swapped entirely in number placement? I would like to see that happen in a fanfic, where Harry's second year is him finding the potions book and becoming a better potions class student! Maybe it would even get Snape to reevaluate being mean to him and seeing him like James all the time, if he saw Harry being so good at potions now. :) Snape might think at first, "Is Harry actually putting in EFFORT in my class now? Hmmm!" :)

** "On Rowling's website, one of the Easter Eggs shows an alternate plotline for Book 1, where Harry's parents had apparently stolen the Philosopher's Stone, which partly explains why the Potters were so rich."

Also from your website link, I found this plot which I am actually going to save in my story ideas folder for later! It sounds so amazing and I want to make a whole entire fic about it at some point. :) It would make Harry confront that his parents weren't perfect idolized people way earlier, and also it would give Lily a lot of depth and flaws to work with if she was a criminal thief. :) Yes, Harry would have to try to reconcile how his parents were thieves and got rich off that, but that they both died to protect him from Voldemort. :)

** Two thing for the list that I'd like to see are Hermoine's younger sister that was so ignored that she was written out of the story, and Ron's bratty wunderkind cousin who is in Slytheren.

*** I'd like to see the Ron's horrible cousin character, but put her in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. Stereotyping Slytherin sorted students is horrible enough in canon that it doesn't need more. :( They're all just kids, nothing changes before or after the sorting. :(

  After Frisk's first year at Hogwarts, things should be looking up for the Dreemurr family, as the awarding of the Order of Merlin suggests. But the next new students at Hogwarts may tip some very delicate scales... and in the Underground Kurt Kairos and Sans have a project of their own. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Underground's Saviour.

  Not much would make an Azkaban escape become second page news among the Wizards of the United Kingdom, but the freeing of the Monsters under Mount Ebott would do it. And thus Frisk becomes one of Hogwart's newest, first year, students...
