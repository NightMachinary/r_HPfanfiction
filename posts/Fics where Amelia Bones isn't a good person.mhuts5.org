Something that irritates me is when authors use Amelia Bones as the epitome of perfection. Like she can do no wrong. I want a fic where she's actually shown as a bad person.

Other characters that bug me are the Weasley twins, Bill, Charlie, and McGonagall

** The Cult of Dionysus by Ynyr

She's technically "good" but as like with all of Ynyr fics, she is a character with their motivations and goals. It's kind of amazing how good the author was at creating interesting characters, even if they didn't get much coverage.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

***** The author kind of lost the plot and just digressed from the most amusing and worthwhile concepts that made the fic great. Mainly Carrow and his view of the Wizarding World. She went from crack into more serious topics and it basically killed the series. Even she stopped writing it, since she probably realised it sucked at that point.

But the first two in the series are pure gold. Carrow is a force of nature, since he's so stupidly overpowered that there literally are no obstacles. It was fun watching him interact with the normal people, which was the whole premise of the fic. Later, it became either repetitive or convoluted.

Also, the author seemed to abandon the insanity of the 40k universe for the in-fic world, which, again, killed all the humour and wonder.

It was a greatly written crack fic and should have stayed that. Trying to make it serious in any way was the way to failure.

****** Tbh, I was fine with the attempt to turn serious. It was the way she tried to straddle the fence that worked so poorly in my opinion, along with certain weird elements like Godric's Hollow and Aquila Industries that just got bizarre. And don't get me /started/ on the kids at Hogwarts. If it'd either stayed crack or become entirely serious, it had a lot of potential. Trying to do both at once was where it went wrong, imo.

** I don't remember the name of the fic, but there was one I read where Grindelwald broke out while Harry was little to raise and train him. When Harry finally goes to Hogwarts, he ends up in a relationship with a Slytherin Ginny Weasley. Later, she gets thrown in Azkaban (because the Ministry has turned against Harry) and only barely escapes getting r*ped by an Auror. When Harry rescues her, he confronts the now captured Amelia Bones about it and she responds along the lines of "She was going to be Kissed today anyway, so what do I care what happens to her beforehand as long as it makes one of my Aurors happier?"

It did not end well for Madam Bones.
