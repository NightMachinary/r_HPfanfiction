I prefer good crack, but I'll skim through mediocre crack. Bonus points to anything with Hedwig or Hagrid as a main character. I'd really like something to make me laugh, it's been a trying year and this is my first vacation in ten, I'd like to kick it off in a good mood. Thanks.


** I really enjoy linkffn(dear order). Also linkffn(the teacher's notebook) and linkffn(the professor's point of view)

  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.

  You could ask ten different people who Charles Potter is and why he does know things no one else does. You would get ten diffrent answers, one more unlikely then the other. No one of them knows the truth. He's the twin brother of Harry Potter, one of the boys-who-lived. He's a Slytherin, a genius and more often then not an insufferable asshole. And yes, he's being evil on purpose.

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

I didn't write the stories for FFN. I put breaks in the story in what seemed like natural places and when posting to FFN I arbitrarily decided to make those breaks into chapter breaks. I much prefer it as one long document, personally, but figured if this is what the kids are doing...
