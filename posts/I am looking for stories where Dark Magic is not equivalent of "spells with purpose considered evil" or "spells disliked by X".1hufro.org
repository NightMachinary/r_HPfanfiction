** Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave. There are some really interesting ideas about Light and Dark magic explored in that series. :) There's not much in the first two, but from the third onwards there is. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

*** I adore this series, and the author weaves some awesome magical theory into the story. Plus it's incredibly long, and thus provides hours and hours of reading pleasure.

**** I got to the 6th book before I had the ending spoiled by the biggest asshole in history. That was probably 4 years ago. Still haven't finished the series :(

***** Oh man. I, too, have not read past book 6 (I finished book 5 a few weeks ago and have been a little busy), and I would /kill/ the person that spoiled the ending for me. That's terrible.

****** You should finish it! And then encourage me to finish it! Win win!

I did want to murder said person, but unfortunately it is difficult to track down and assassinate anonymous internet trolls.

******* If you haven't already, you should finish the story. Knowing the ending is a small price to pay compared to getting there with the characters.

**** OK, tell me, is this beast worth finishing? I'm halfway through book six right now and really bogged down in a bunch of Snapey angst...I don't know how much more I can take. I just took a break to read another book and realized how little I'm enjoying the Sacrifices Arc by contrast...

***** I actually haven't read any further than you. If you're not enjoying it, then by all means stop reading. I personally find it hard to stop reading a book even if I dislike it, so if you're like me, I can't really offer you much hope. I don't know how it ends or how good the seventh one is. Eventually I'll read through book six, but I'm a bit busy right now.

****** Yeah, that's what I'm like too :P I've settled for skimming big chunks of it that just deal with feeeelings until I get back to actual plot. I wonder how many people have actually finished the whole thing. I guess it would be more fun to read in serial since it was updated daily while it was being written.

******* I don't know if you're still reading, so I'll say this anyway. I wasn't too bothered by most of the "feeeelings" but I did wish they'd get their head out of their asses sometimes haha. On the whole it didn't bother me, but I have never not finished a story I've started unless the editing made it undecipherable.

All in all I thought it was worth finishing and was severely disappointed when I ran into the end.

******** Yeah, I finished it. I'd say it was a net positive experience, but I wished I could have edited it...there was so much good stuff in there but so much more useless cruft.
