Hi everyone, I'd really appreciate your help - there's a fic that I read ages ago and I'd really love to find it again - I've searched through loads of fics and I just can't find it. Slytherin!Harry, obviously, and I think it started out with Snape giving a stern house talk the first night. I think his first direct interaction with Harry is when Harry gets up early to shower so his dorm mates don't see he was bruised from Vernon, and Snape gives him a detention for being out of the dorm too early.

This is literally all I can remember of the story, although I'm fairly certain that it was quite long. I don't think there was any slash, but as I said, I really can't remember much else.

If anyone has any ideas, I'd really appreciate it!

*** No, not really, IMO. Slow-moving, angst-y and focuses overmuch on the relationship between Snape and Harry (who has, of course, been heavily abused). I do recall being impressed at the characterization of Slytherin house in general, but this was quite early in my fanfiction experience, so can't tell how well it bears up.

But it's very definitely not a fic I'll ever look to re-read.

*** I've been rereading it and it's good - it's got a fair amount of abused!Harry in it, though, so if you don't like that, I'd avoid it. He does get support from other characters, though, so at least he doesn't have to deal with anything on his own, and it's not terribly graphic. And it's well-written and long, as well.
