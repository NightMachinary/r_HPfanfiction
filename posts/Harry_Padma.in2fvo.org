Hi its me again.

I'm looking for any and all harry/padma fics especially the ones during the triwizard tournament. Harry/Padma doesn't have to be a major part of it but I would like the fics to be primarily Harry/Padma. I would also appreciate it if Padma in the fic was like how Parvati is typically portrayed; slightly vain and stunningly beautiful. It would be appreciated if there were bets or other wagers involving Harry's performance in the tournament. All help is appreciated!


** I read that as Harry/Padme and was wondering why you never once mentioned Star Wars in your post. I am dumb at times

** You'll have probs read this lol but this is a post Hogwarts fic with Lovecraftian horror elements. The mystery is intriguing and the tension between Harry and Padma is well written. linkffn(4323036).

** There's a Harry/Padma time travel fic that's escaping me at the moment.... Harry accidentally yeets back before his wedding to tiny bab harry and decides to take care of him. Padma is understandably annoyed and goes back to smack her soon to be husband for accidentally yeeting himself away without her and then blah happens and now they go by the peverells. Yes, bad grammar. But yeah. If someone can figure out which one that is, then thanks.

** The only completed story I've been able to fund of this pairing is Harry Potter's Army: A General's Lament. Hopefully the bot cooperates.

** There is a Harry/Padma alternate four year story, with no triwizard tournament, (but there is some other mystery thing, I think something with time stopping? maybe). Anyway it was abandoned but I remember liking Padma's characterization a lot and the H/Padma romance was great & believable. Unfortunately I can't locate it in my favorites list. If anyone knows of it do post.
