Also Hagrid is portrayed in the image of Donald Trump, and Malfoy is a female, in love with an egotistical Luna Lovegood. K thanks!

Also John Snow has a Pet Lupin.

Alright, I've got this:

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
*Hagrid:* A full giant (instead of a half-giant), with wealth inherited from both sides of his family (his father had a golden goose); a bit of an egotistical ditz with a clumsy speaking style, he regularly borrows from his parents to fund all kinds of zany money-making schemes.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
*Malfoy & Luna:* Tiamat Malfoy grew up sheltered and surrounded by love and comfort, making her kind but naive. Luna Lovegood is a certifiable genius who considers there to be only one proper way to do economics, criminal justice, government, etc, habitually looking down on everyone else.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
*Filch/Voldemort:* Rather than being a magical prodigy, Tom Riddle had very little magical power at all, barely enough to see through Muggle-repelling charms. He hates wizardkind, especially purebloods, for the way they hold themselves over muggles and other magical creatures; he ended up with the nickname 'Filch' for stealing things out of spite from such wizards. On the run after one theft too many, he snapped and invoked a powerful dark spell to mutate himself into a monster, using blood sacrifice to cover for his own magical weakness, and went on a rampage to exterminate all witches and wizards.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-4
   :END:
*Dobby:* The Malfoys' most favoured servant, and the sheltered Tiamat Malfoy's link to home while she's away from Hogwarts. When a now-insane Voldemort becomes hellbent on destroying the Malfoys for being (what he thinks are) pureblood snobs, it falls to Dobby to protect his young charge.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-5
   :END:
*John Snow:* A muggleborn and direct descendent of the English physician John Snow, for whom he was named; his first introduction to the magical world came not with his Hogwarts letter, but the talking wisewolf Lupin (remember how on Pottermore it says about how if two werewolves mate under the full moon they give birth to super-intelligent wolves?).

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-6
   :END:
And there you go; put a muggleborn with a talking dog together with a sheltered rich kid with an elf and an insufferable genius. Add Hagrid as comic relief, Voldemort as a completely inhuman monster, and...alright, who wants to write this?

Not sure which.
