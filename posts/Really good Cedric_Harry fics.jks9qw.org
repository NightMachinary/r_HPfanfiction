Preferably on the longer side. I like a darker Cedric but I love cinnamon roll Cedric too. I honestly love this pairing in all shapes and forms. Fics where it's past Cedric/Harry and Harry is super angsty after he dies (whether he gets with someone else or not) are great too!

I'll drop some of my favorites in the comments, but I'm hoping for some new recommendations please!

*** Oh gosh this is a paring I didn't realise I wanted until you mentioned it. Are any of these completed? I don't bother with in progress ones.

**** (honey) there is no right way and Testor Ego Amorem Perpetuum are complete! The second is actually part of a series and I believe the first three (of four) are complete. But unlike a lot of series, the individual books don't leave off on cliffhangers and can be read independently. It's definitely worth reading!

This is definitely one of my favorite pairings though!!! And there's lots of complete stories, especially on ffn.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3567080/chapters/7858319][This one]] is Charlie/Harry, but Harry and Cedric had a relationship on his fourth year.

(Maybe it doesn't apply here, Cedric is already dead before the story begins...)
