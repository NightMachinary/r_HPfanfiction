Why is it that when Harry is not wanted by the Dursley's he is put in an orphanage? Why not Foster homes? While I get that the author wants to make Harry as close to Tom Riddle as possible, I believe most orphanages were closed by the 90s so he would have actually ended up in Foster homes instead. To me that would make a huge variety of possibilities. One could teach him marshal arts, yoga, fighting or lock picking and theft and the abuse, physical, verbal and sexual would still be prevalent as well as the out right neglect of the caregiver. Another he could be like G in NCIS: Los Angeles and have 31 foster homes because no one wanted him for long. I know I've read one story where he ended up in a half-way house of sorts but that was after he was at Hogwarts and thrown away.


** I feel like it's partially to avoid making any close/meaningful OCs. In an orphanage, the adults can pretty much be mentioned in passing and ignored. Even the other kids can be greatly glossed over if you don't want to make any plot with them (ie bullying Harry, finding another witch or wizard there, etc).

If you go with foster parents, you need to flesh them out, give them realistic dialogue and interaction with Harry, give them longer scenes, etc. You have to do it whether they're abusive shits, or loving parents. If you just skim over most mentions of the foster home and parents, it would probably feel sort of empty and make the reader think "eh, why bother writing it that way at all then? Why not just put him in an orphanage?"

The main reason though, I'm sure, is what you mentioned about linking Harry and Voldemort.

*** Depends where you start the story. If you reveal the past slowly with cryptic references by Harry without flashbacks expect as absolutely needed this could be done.

Maybe makes a n you mumbled refernce the the home when a skill for there comes up, thanks thirteen or indent want to talk about five. Something like that. A new home each summer while at in school. Though that might drive to a wbwl story.

**** I was thinking that too. He has been in so many homes that he doesn't even try to remember names, just calls the adults Ma'am and Sir and ignores the other kids or leans whatever they can teach him.

*** With crazy shit happening when he gets stressed he could always bounce around foster care and bounce in and out of group homes.

** Kid Voldemort went to a bad Orphanage. Let's mirror Harry's childhood to Voldemort's even more by putting him at a bad Orphanage (sometimes the exact same one)

*** With the same caretaker no less. Not shitting you, I've read more than a few fics where Mrs Cole was still the matron in that orphanage almost into her nineties.

**** Bonus points if she's a speech capable Inferi and it's Dumbledore's doing to give Harry Voldemort's childhood and for Harry to overcome it "FOR THE GREATER GOOD" whilst Dumbledore twirls his Moustache like all the "Greater Good" Dumbledores are, as they're evil.

**** Which would mean she was a matron in her 20s, which is also very unlikely.

** Harry in a foster home does exist, I read one but I forgot what it was called. His parents were rich that wanted a kid as an accessory
