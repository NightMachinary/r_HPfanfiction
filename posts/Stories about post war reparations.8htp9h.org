** Anyway, I've written "Divided and Entwined". The last twenty chapters deal with the question of how to deal with a country after a bitter civil war that tore it apart. People out to settle scores, foreign countries meddling, people trying to keep a new civil war from breaking out, others trying to do exactly that, politics, trials, the works.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Never fear moomoo is here!

Seven Names is about how the post war decisions were not as simple as those in canon. Hermione is exiled from britian, but returns after over 50 years. Find out what made her leave! :) Wow I made that sounds really cheesy. Either way this is one hell of a ride and I highly recommend.

*** The story has a crucial failure - two, actually. First, it plays into the "suffering martyr Hermione" trope. As if Hermione would give up magic and live like a muggle just because the British Ministry demanded it - when the entire magical world would be open to her.

Second, the whole idea that all of her friends would turn on her just because she didn't want to spill the names of seven people who murdered Death Eater prisoners is shit. Utter shit. Harry himself used (or tried to use) Unforgivables in canon. He certainly wouldn't judge Hemione for not selling out friends and allies. That he would support her exile, instead of telling the Ministry to drop that shit, is stupid. Doubly so it, if I recall correctly, the Ministry didn't send the Malfoys and all other Death Eater supports through the veil for what they did - which was far, far worse than protecting people who murdered genocidal scumbags. Hell, Malfoy got a pardon, apparently, and he actively supported Voldemort for years. But everyone would turn on Hermione for not betraying friends? Yeah, right.

Judging by what happened post WW2, the whole thing would have been buried. Probably together with the Malfoys and their ilk.

**** I would agree very much with your first point.

However your second? Not so much. The whole point of the trials is to be "impartial"; showing favor to ones friend defeats the whole purpose. Harry may personally disagree with what the result is but how can he do anything else? He is on the panel, these trials are to regain faith in ministry, that both sides would be treated with justice. /Making a double standard for his friends defeats the purpose of this entirely/. Regardless what Hermione did *was wrong*. As much as Harry may be her friend, she is not in the right here. Her friends aren't necessarily turning on here, she is obstructing justice. She deserves exile. However obviously there are many flaws to the post war scenario built here, I believe what happened is rather accurate.

***** The thing is, what she did wasn't as wrong as Malfoy did. Not by far. She simply refused to testify. Malfoy helped mass-murderers. If her trial and especially her punishment - exile - had been fair, everyone even remotely connected to the Ministry during Voldemort's reign, every Snatcher, and every Death Eater would have been executed. There is a thing as mitigating circumstances, for example. Sending a heroine into exile for not testifying, and pardoning scum like Malfoy? That's not justice. That's not impartial. That's simply shitty plot railroading. In a realistic take on that, she would have been sent into exile, then pardoned a few months to a year later. (Or right after sentencing.)

****** They made an example of her. For better or worse the government needs to be seen as impartial, her receiving a slap on the wrist validates their (pure bloods) concerns of bias.

Is her punishment a bit harsh? Perhaps. But she is protecting murderers, she is directly standing against the justice system. People like the snatchers and Malfoys are responsible for their crimes, however they are not in open rebellion like Hermione is. Dissidents such as that need to be dealt with, especially a high profile one. /People must have faith in the ministry./ It isn't unreasonable that should would be silenced.

As an aside, I do think that their justice system has a lot of merits. Why should the winning side not answer for their crimes? No one should be exempt from their actions, and justice should not look the other way for the victors.

******* Yes, the winning side should answer for their crimes. But Hermione's crime is minor here. And open rebellion? Malfoy and co were the ones in armed, open rebellion. As long as Malfoy isn't executed for his crimes, any punishment levied against Hermione is not just. Or in other words: If Malfoy gets a pardon, Hermione should get one as well.

That's my point: Justice is spit upon here. The Death Eaters' victims will not trust a Ministry that punished Hermione as if she had been a mass-murderer, yet let scum live who actually helped murder innocents - pardoned them, and let them work for the Ministry!

I wouldn't consider this plot shit if there were actually justice done. But as long as Malfoy isn't punished and Hermione is, despite the huge discrepancy between their crimes, this isn't about justice at all. It's really like if, after WW2, they had let Rudolf Hess become Bundeskanzler but exiled Patton for slapping a soldier.

******* First thing, no one remembered what happened there, its just Cho Chang - who is incidentally a death eater - told and they opened a buried case that no one cared about.\\
I am surprised that there were no rebellions from her friends for the perceived injustice, if they made example out of her - people should have questioned the validity of UAC itself - which included Malfoy.\\
UAC just pardoned itself and gone for witch hunting, I am surprised with her own friends acting hostile to her.

*** It's wrong that you've been downvoted.

I think it's because Hermione is sacred for some redditors here.

Even if the story has some issues, all stories have them.

Hope it won't discourage you from making recommendations in the future :-)
