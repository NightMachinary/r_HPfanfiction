I really want to read more fanfics of them as a couple, totally involving time travel and a lot of romance. please recommend me anything


** A lot of the regulus/Harry fics in existence are either unfinished or quite...well...mpreggy

These are my favourites that aren't that:

Fem Harry, but this one is great: linkffn(11654455) (flecks of rust)

Linkao3(11045280) (wild magic)

Linkao3(5986366) (face death in the hope)

  On Kreacher's deathbed he reveals to Harry that Regulus is alive and living in the Muggle world with no memories of who or what he is. Harry seeks him out on Kreacher's request, and finds more than he bargained for.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  But then, the woman speaks again, and his entire being grinds to a halt. "So, I hear you're hunting Horcruxes." FemHarry, some smut present

  A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe?

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius runs away in 1976, Regulus starts writing him letters he never intends to send. They're simply a way to talk about all the things he can't say out loud to anyone - a chronicle of his descent into the Death Eaters, and the eventual realisation that he made all the wrong choices. In 1997, Harry is searching for the Locket-Horcrux at Grimmauld Place. Instead, he finds a stack of yellowed parchment that not only tells a tale that's more captivating than it has any right to, but might also hold the key to information on the remaining Horcruxes. Regulus Black installed a failsafe. Though neither Regulus, nor Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Sirius expected the result of the ritual to be quite this literal. With an Ex-Death Eater who was assumed to be dead in their midst, the Horcrux-hunt goes a bit differently. Regulus is mostly conflicted if his unexpected second chance is really worth all the trouble his company keeps putting him in.   Spoiler: It is. He just likes to complain.
