Hi everyone, I was watching Happy Death Day, and after liking it, I re-watched the Scream and Halloween movies. Which led me to wonder, are there any fics that are like these 90s cliche yet loveable slasher scream queen fics in the hp fanfic fandom? Thanks.


** That depends on whose behind the mask, a screwed up loser with a grudge or a psychopathic man-child with an overdeveloped desire to play pin the tail on the donkey.

**** Well, the Nightmare Man is sort of a horror fic.

Voice of the Nephelim also has a horror one shot in the DoM scene (time monster sort of thing)

If zombie apocalypse is more your thing, try linkffn(incorruptible: a dementors stigma)

****** Thanks for the recs, greatly appreciated. Do you have any that are have a female main character? For example, the Halloween films have Laurie, Scream has Sidney etc. It could be Hermione, Ginny, Daphne or any of them. Thanks.

******* The closest I can come up with is something like linkffn(The Very Secret Diary).

It's CoS from Ginny's perspective, but the sinister nature of Tom (and what's implied) sort of fit with the stalker horror genre.
