:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was this fic i read ages ago on ffn, where Harry wakes up with Xander's memories because of that Halloween thing.

I remember he escapes the dursleys, tricks his way into Grimmauld place, and crashes an Order meeting and then keeps pranking Dumbledore about why he suddenly knows everything about Harry Potter (it's actually because he read the books)

One thing I do know is that it's not listed as crossover with BtVS or tagged as YAHF. I don't even remember if it was abandoned or something like that.

Please help me find it, I searched all the fics listed under BtVS crossovers and all the YAHF fics i could find and it wasn't any of them. :(

it was definitely longer than a few chapters


** That's in Rorschach's Blot "Odd Ideas", [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/132/Odd-Ideas][chapters 132]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/136/Odd-Ideas][136]].

*** Oh wow. I'm such an idiot... I binge read Odd Ideas, so I didn't remember the fic being there as a one-shot and it was so long I couldn't accept it was just 2 chapters... damn... that means there's not gonna be more chapters of it
