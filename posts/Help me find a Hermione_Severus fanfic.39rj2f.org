I've been looking everywhere for a story I read forever ago and I'm completely stumped.

In plot, it's a lot like "The Love You Take" by Subversa. Hermione is cursed with a spell that forces her to be bonded to Severus Snape and there's a sexual compulsion in the bond. If she does not have sex with Snape promptly, she suffers pain in her back, and eventually seizures or death.

The only specifics I can remember are that she tries to stay away from him after their initial joining because it was so traumatic but the pain she suffers for not going to him sooner is so intense that they end up having sex in a classroom during one of the feasts. He had given her an aphrodisiac of some sort the first time and so that joining is excruciatingly painful.

The only other thing I can remember is that Draco finds her a while later in the story and either intentionally or accidentally delays her in getting to Snape so she's in a lot of pain and has to somehow summon Snape to rescue her.

If you have any idea what this story is or where I can find it, I would SO SO appreciate it!! I'm dying to read it again!


** It is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/1/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]]?

*** I don't think so. I adore that fic, but the bond is different in that story. In the one I'm looking for, I don't think she's physically branded and they return to Hogwarts differently than in Bound to Him.

**** Are you sure? I just finished reading it (what's been finished, anyway), and it point-for-point matches your description.

** I know this story but I can not, for the life of me, remember the name. I could swear I read it on [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]] and I know it was quite long... I'll poke around and see if I can find it.

**** Perhaps [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9646277/1/The-Love-You-Take][The Love You Take]]? This one has sexual compulsion and pain without her satisfaction. Didn't see anything about Draco in a quick browse through.

Or [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=14458][Augory and Ardor]]? This one has Severus forced to wed her and Draco pissed about not getting her and a potion in her wine glass before the wedding night.

Do you remember how long it was? I tend to read things that are novel length, but I've ventured shorter from time to time. 250K words +?

** Sounds like [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=7404][The Harlot Potion by yutamiyu]], but it's been a while since I've read that one.
