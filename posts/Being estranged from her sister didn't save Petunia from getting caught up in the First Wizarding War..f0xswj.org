The Order wasn't able to spare the extra man power to watch over Lily's muggle relatives, and when Professor McGonagall goes to check them out prior to Dumbledore leaving Harry with them she discovers the Dursleys were targeted by Death Eaters due to their connection to Lily and James.


** My head canon is that Lily and Petunia's parents were killed in the first war by Death Eaters. Which would explain the vitriol and desire to be as divorced from that world as possible.

I always felt jealousy was a bit of a weak motivation for 11 years of hatred towards a child. Especially given how limited the interactions between Petunia and Lily would have been once Lily left for Hogwarts.

Also explains why there's absolutely no mention of Harry's muggle grandparents.

*** It's my headcanon as well! I also wondered why the Death Eaters never went after Petunia and her family, especially after Voldemort learned of the prophecy and the fact that Lily's son would fit the requirements. You'd think he'd send his followers after any family members she had left, in order to try and get info on the Potters' whereabouts.

**** Depends on how savvy the Death Eaters were about tracking down relatives and how much they cared about muggles.

If there was no contact between Lily and her sister they night have trouble connecting them or they decided that Petunia's death wouldn't matter much if they were estranged.

She would also be a Dursley rather than an Evans by the time the prophecy was given. Might have been enough to go under the radar.

Also, no real need to get information from muggles given Wormtail's existence.

*** one of my theories before JK said it was old age -which is weird as he was only in his late 70's which aint old by wizard standards, also looking at dates they had James when they where in their 50s-

was James parents died because of the war which caused him to mature alot in his final years of hogwarts

**** Or if somebody else from the family(like aunt, uncle, cosines) died when he was younger a reason why he was so vicious against Slytherins
