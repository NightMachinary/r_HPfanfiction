Most time travel stories involve you following the protagonist from the future into the past. Are there any that are solely from the perspective of someone in the past, who are bemused or just plain confused by the actions and language of the traveler?


** linkffn(10687059)

Is mostly from Hermione's point of view with Harry being the time traveller.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** I think linkffn(Far too many time travelers by Lord Jeram) is mostly from Harry's pov, who isn't a time traveler.

Linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) has some of that, too. Even if you don't like the pairing, the early parts are fun.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

OK from the description I thought I had read this before. But just a few paragraphs in it is clear I have not. And this is great!

*** That was good, I really wish it had continued. The worried thoughts of Narcissa that kept deepening reminded me of HP Lovecraft.
