** Oh boy.

Linkffn(Harry the Playboy) is a good place to start as not only does it have actual plot but it's quite good in prose as well. In this same vein Linkffn(Dark Discoveries) is also a bit like this.

Linkffn(The Breeding Ground)

Linkffn(Altercations- Petunia and Harry) is mostly what it sounds like.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the exploration)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and his Ladies and Girls)

Another one on ff.net is called Population Control. I'm not gonna link it for reasons that become glaring obvious once you read the A.N. at the beginning of chapter one.

Have fun!

  Adult erotic fiction. This is the story of what happens between a lonely housewife left alone for the summer with only her nephew for company. The needs of the two outweigh the needs of the many as a budding young man and his lonely Aunt find that their lust and physical attraction can be beneficial. Note: I would rate this hard M.

  Fast-forward, ten years later. Mistress Hermione is so proud of her little Harry! She knew this was exactly how things were supposed to happen right from the start. She's sometimes slightly dysfunctional, just a little possessive, but still adorable... although disagreeing with Mistress Hermione is not recommended. She has a little problem, though. “Happily forever after” is more complicated in real life than in books...

  Whilst Voldemort's prisoner, Draco is made a vampire and forced to take Harry as his first meal. With Draco managing to resist the temptation to drain him, just barely, in a moment of blind rage at what he has been forced to become, he aids Harry in the destruction of Voldemort. But even with that threat vanquished, once back at Hogwarts, Draco finds himself disturbingly addicted to Harry's blood. And amongst all this, a dark shadow looms ominously on the outline of the forest, watching them closely. A vampire!Draco story and also an ‘Eighth year' story.
