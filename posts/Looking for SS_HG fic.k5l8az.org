:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read two SS/HG fics a few years ago and can't find them anymore. I've forgotten both the title/author.

In the first, Hermione signs a contract to teach Muggle Studies for a year. Snape is Headmaster. She works with Snape on a proposal for a new Muggle Studies curriculum that is current. He is convinced she won't stay for longer than year because she will hate being isolated from her friends and peers her age.

In the second, it's post war time and Hermione is hit with a curse by death eater (I think Yaxley?) Due to the curse she can't perform magic and works as a potions assistant at Hogwarts to hide this fact/for protection.

If anyone knows the title/author of either fic I'd be so grateful! Thanks!


** Both sounds very interesting! I hope you find these fics. I would be very interested in reading both.
