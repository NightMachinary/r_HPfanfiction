** I always feel weirdly bad for Filch! I know he's a grouchy asshole, but he assuredly had a rough time of it growing up as a Squib in the wizarding world. I mean, being a school janitor already kinda sucks, and that was probably one of few employment options. If we can humanize Snape, we can surely give poor ol' Filch a shot

*** Agree with you. He is a human being who have faced prejudice and discrimination at every turn, and of course he would love a creature that depended on him. Him! Just a small squib, but a life is dependant of him.

** I always thought of Filch as someone who went to Hogwarts but became a Squib due to some sort of magical accident (or maybe as punishment for a crime). He seems to care so much about the magic that he doesn't have, that it almost seems like he had it at some point but lost it.

*** That... or he was raised to believe magic was the only thing that gave you worth that even if he didn't have magic since birth, he would have thought that it was the only thing that wouldn't make people deem you less than a human being. Maybe if Dumbledore didn't keep him as a caretaker, making him leave the wizarding world, he could have found an opportunity to succeed in the muggle world, but I guess whatever prejudiced lout for parents he had and with the environment he grew up into, pretty sure he was brainwashed to hate muggles.

** If I was raised around people who did magic and broadly considered people who couldn't do it to be lesser, and I couldn't do any magic myself, I would kinda hate them and everything about the "culture" too. I would especially hate the kids who are sent to school to learn magic and spend most of their time being little dickheads and making a mess of the place I have to look after instead of studying.

I feel bad for Filch. He is immersed in the magical world, isolated in location and also by being a non-magic-having adult in a school full of wizards and witches. Muggles have loads of things that make not being magical easier. No floo or apparating? All good, I can drive or take advantage of an extensive public transit network (in the UK anyway, a lot of Americans are SOL there). Quills are a messy pain, but I have a ballpoint pen and these days can type on my phone. My phone also sends messages and without shitting everywhere, and charging it is easier than feeding it mice.

I am not sure why he works at Hogwarts, but I don't think Dumbledore was necessarily doing him any kindnesses. Hagrid clearly loves his job and enjoys magic. Filch just seems trapped and miserable.

** Not sure how long Filch has been at Hogwarts or who hired him (he seems to have been around since before Dumbledore made Headmaster), but let's face it, he IS essentially superfluous... there's nothing he can do that the house-elves who are already there couldn't do better and quicker... so the job seems to be more just for his sake. I can just see it: Look at the poor Squib, let's give him a job, make him feel useful. He can't do magic, but he can at least clean corridors and patrol the halls.

That said, in a weird way, Filch seems happier with his lot in life than Snape does. He may hate the students of Hogwarts, but by golly does he LOVE hating the students of Hogwarts.

** I think he was one more step in Dumbledore's plan. Everyone knows the fiercest fighter is one fighting for their home - Dumbledore had a knack for employing those people who would get short shrift elsewhere. McGonagall had lost her husband and was alone, Hagrid and Flitwick are half-breeds, Firenze is an outcast, Trelawny incompetent (barring 2 genuine instances). Even Snape was put on and retained when his known Death Eater stance would have made it difficult to seek life elsewhere. Hiring a squib fits right in with Dumbledore's hiring policy. In the end all these staff could be counted on to fight for Hogwarts til their dying breath because they don't really have anywhere else to go.

  Flitwick are half-breeds

Flitwick has "a touch of goblin blood" so it's not really halfand it doesn't seem to be widely known. Pottermore Ravenclaw introduction has a prefect theorizing that he may be part house elf, but many would just guess he is just short and ugly due to normal, human reasons, and not interracial ancestry.

**** Anyone who uses the term isn't going to care about how much blood is in them, additionally it is even used on werewolves iirc. At least I think I remember Umbridge calling werewolves half-breeds.

***** My point is, it's so far relation that it's not really obvious (he is just short, movie exaggerated things), so most people won't know.

** I would think that Filch has to be related to some one important, or have some sort of connection. His ill attitude aside, he is completely superfluous. The house elves can take care of cleaning just as well or better than he can, and he's shown himself to be completely unfit for the supervisory/adult Prefect role he sometimes has. Sure, Dumbledore can do what he wants as far as hires go, but he had war related reasons to hire Snape. What reason does he have to keep Filch, much less in a role where he interacts with students?

*** I have a theory that Mr Filch and Mrs Figg are siblings (maybe even twins), and that Filch had a much harder time dealing with being a squib when he was younger -- acting out, etc. Dumbledore hired him, gave him a job that kept him out of trouble, and this earned him Mrs Figg's gratitude and loyalty, thus giving him someone in the Muggle world to get info from, use for things he couldn't use a wizard, etc.
