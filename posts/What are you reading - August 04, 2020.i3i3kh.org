** Reading Adflictation Lair by WitchesinTraining. I'm really loving this one. Its rated M. Has lots of gore, angst, adventure, romance, drama... Starts off at the Dursleys, typical Vernon abuses Harry badly trope. After a car crash, everything just starts going downhill for Harry, might I add, lots of death, layers upon misery... Its pretty good for people like me who just enjoy those types of stuff, not for the faint hearted. It also has a sequel to it, really looking forward to reading that one too. Can't believe I found this gem, it was written a long time ago and its completed so perfect for me. May have some OOC characters though, not acting like they usually do in canon.

** Just finished linkffn(The First Day by little0bird), and will probably continue on to read the following stories. It's a decent handling of the year immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, starts off rather angst-heavy but eases off gradually. Looks like it will be epilogue-compliant.

** linkffn(13603363) Ouroboros

Time traveling Voldemort go back in time and raises himself

First I absolutely love the characterizations. Voldemort is basically a sociopathic father. Tom is basically a sociopathic child, but due to the early adoption begins to diverge in behavior from Voldemort

That's the brilliant thing about this fic. Voldemort beginning to see the difference in his younger self, and the conflicts that it leads to. He still respects his younger self, but you can tell his frustration.

There's also some unintentionally humorous moments that arises because of this divergents.

It's still a rather dark story. For instance Voldemort is discreetly killing people that he knows will interfere with him in the future

Anyways, it's a great read if only for the characterization

A recent publication has been “Alastair's Cupboard” which explores the classic fan theory, “what if Harry was imagining Hogwarts?“, but with a tragic twist at the end. It's just a one shot, and I felt it was well written. Definitely bring your tissues. Rated mature for violence. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13657777/1/Alastair-s-Cupboard][Alastair's Cupboard]]

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

I first found this story in 2015 or 2016. I don't exactly remember how I stumbled upon it, considering I didn't (and still don't) read Harry Potter or other “fanfiction” stories. Regardless, I gave the story a try and was blown away. The story pulls off the “Mystery & Suspense” label very well, and manages to do so without losing the Harry Potter feel or altering the characters.

** I've been reading the Challenger trilogy again!

The first part is titled Red Bolt Of Lightning, and It's pretty long(first book has 18 chapters, next has 20 something, third has 30 something, plus an epilogue). It's got two well-written ocs, a lot of drama, and admittedly a few clichés.

I've also been reading the Bond Of Family Series by Daily-Chan. The order is on the author's profile, btw.

It's really good, again has a few clichés, and a lot of drama, but it's also really cute and filled with fluffy family moments.

I've also also been reading The Undergrounds Savior series, a hp/undertale crossover. It's very long, has three currently out books, the author has their own book for sale on Amazon btw, it's got good characterization and is generally a good read. One of my favorites. I've been reading for weeks and am only in the second part as of now I believe.

It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

*** I should warn you, that honestly, the character development for everyone not named Sirius Black is amazing. over 200k words in and Sirius has actually regressed as a character, with little or any growth. Orion, Walburga and Regulus are all great, with characterizations that make sense in canon.

The writing is good, I would even say its excellent. However, if you are looking for anything with any action, or anything where every character is not scheming to get their own way (Which is OOC for several of them such as Sirius), then this is not for you. I'd say its a familial based political drama with low stakes in the grand scheme of a war with Voldemort.

Definitely give it a shot. It just wasn't for me. I wasn't invested enough to continue even though I'd finished, essentially, a third of the story so far.

Edit: one of the things that turned me off could be that they spent 30 chapters and I don't know how many words but were only just starting 4th year when I quit. The story started the night that Sirius was saved from the Dementors in 3rd year.

Edit2: and Oliver Wood for some reason didn't graduate on time and had to be consoled when informed that quidditch had been canceled due to the Triwizard Tournament. Missing on basics like that is a huge turn-off.

*** Most of the ones I have read have to do with Harry leaving the wizarding world. Stories that take place Post- Hogwarts the reason is usually something along the lines of wizarding Britain thinking he is too powerful so he has to escape. Usually his journey is planned and the fact that he crosses some dimensional barrier is a plus.

The other stories if he goes when he is a kid pre-Hogwarts he either travels by accidental apparition to naruto universe to escape Dursley abuse or the Dursley's find some familial connection to a clan in Konoha and send him or ask someone to come get him because they don't want him.

I have read very little about the naruto characters coming into the wizarding world because somehow I don't have an interest in the fandoms interacting that way.

I have generally enjoyed them all though Harry is almost always OP.

** I finished up to what's currently posted for “So Close To Magic” by Sonny13 on Fanfiction.net and it was so good that I am currently rereading it again. It's currently sitting at 579k words 55 chapters and is incomplete but is regularly updated. It's an M-rated (but not obscenely smutty or anything) Fred/OC fic and it has literally changed the way I view his character for the rest of my life. Like I haven't been able to stop thinking about this fic since I started reading about it it's becoming an obsession. The plot is AMAZING and I love the OC so much the characterizations in this fic are some of the best I've ever read. I liked it so much that I read it in 2 days. Basically length wise that's like reading the entire LOTR trilogy plus the hobbit in 2 days. Like I've been begging all of my friends to start reading it so I can have someone to talk to about the fic. My literal ONLY gripe is that now it has ruined me for any other Fred/OC fic because I can't find any that compare to it. And that it's not completed. But yeah if you're into OC's and into long childhood friends to lovers slow burn fics that LITERALLY have just 200k+ words of pure PINING AND YEARNING then this is the fic for you!

*** I loved it. Though the author could have put more plot/advanture and less soul-bond stuff.
