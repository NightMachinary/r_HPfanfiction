Best examples are: Alexandra Quick series and A Long Journey Home.

What I don't want: Founders fics.

Crossover fics are fine, as long as they dont take place at Hogwarts.

EDIT: THANKS GUYS. YOU ARE ALL INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE.

** linkao3(half awake and almost there): non-magical AU in America, well written aside from a slow first chapter

linkffn(Unatoned): I'm /pretty/ sure this fic is entirely post Hogwarts.

linkffn(The Skitterleap): total AU world, Harry is a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian empire fighting the russians.

linkffn(Gothic): mysterious treasure-hunter Harry never went to Hogwarts, recruits Ginny for world-wide artifact hunt.

linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): Harry is competing in the titular event, and flashback explain how he got to that place. A short but sweet story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3494062/oniforever][oniforever]]

I have to admit that this story blew me away in terms of both story telling and character growth. It actually made me root for Tom Riddle as the protagonist of this fic.

Before I read this story, I guess I had a sort of pessimistic view of Tom Riddle considering he grew up to be Voldemort. I actually did not even understand why people wrote fanfics about him. However, I did later got into reading the Harry Potter and MCU crossover. Eventually, I found Come Together where the fic was set during the WW2 era. With me being a fan of Captain America the First Avenger movie, it already peaked my interest. On the other hand, I also noticed that one of the main characters labeled was Tom Riddle Jr. Plus the summary made me conclude that the fic was from his point of view. I weighed my options and just went for it since I had yet to have read a crossover fic involving the first Captain America movie.

As it turned out, it was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my entire time I have ever came across a HP and MCU crossover.

It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction. I just keep coming back.

Anyways, the whole story takes place in a different country where Tom is taken prisoner with other soldiers.

After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings.

It's a non and POST hogwarts AU where Voldemort stayed in hiding in Albania. :) I started it because I wanted to tell all sorts of adventures and stories outside Hogwarts - and ones that don't involve Voldemort and the Death Eaters. :) Though, they will show up again toward the very END of the whole thing... :) :) Because the prophecy must be fulfilled at some point!!! :P
