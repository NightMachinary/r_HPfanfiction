We often see Indy Harry fighting against Dumbledore and being this little Lord, but I want a Harry that sees that nobody will protect Hogwarts's students if he doesn't do it. So I will like a story that it's set after Dumbledore leave the school in OOTP where Harry goes against Umbridge

I don't know if I explain myself well, but if you have any fic who fits the idea please leave it here. Thanks ðŸ’œ
