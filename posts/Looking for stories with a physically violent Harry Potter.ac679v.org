Been reading a lot of chill Harry Potter stories recently, but a lot of the characterization of some of the other characters, while within character, are starting to make my blood boil, so I'm now looking for stories with a physically violent, but not necessarily Slytherin, Harry, where he takes no guff from anybody and responds to people trying to mess him with physical violence. This violence can extend to other problems too, say, Fluffy or the Triwizard Tournament.

I'm not necessarily looking for a sociopath or psychopath Harry, just one where he's not particularly afraid of using violence to achieve his ends.

*** This was a really weird one....like....it really meandered and did nothing with the general premise (Harry raised in the Elder Scrolls).

Just sort of seemed there to wank the author's game characters.

**** Did it? I thought it was pretty good actually. It's on my all-time favorites list. I tend to like fic's where an ability in one fanon breaks another fanon though. To each their own.

***** I think it's because of the fact that it so rarely focuses on Harry more and more as the fic goes on. That and the references to his Dad's time in the Fallout 3 universe. It meanders, it's so unfocused, it brings things up...and then nothing. Like how both the ES and FO worlds are still literal video games in the HP universe. Seems like that sound mean...something. But no.

  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)

Harry is a cat Animagus and gets a black belt in Karate before going to Hogwarts. When the Slytherins take their insults towards Hermione too far, he pulls out some ancient laws, shouts "I DEMAND SATISFACTION!" and duels anyone who gets in his way.

Also, his cat form turns out to be very good at being violent towards Harry's enemies, including Death Eaters, Slytherins Monster and multiple Werewolves, as well as many of the monsters in the tournament.

Unfortunately appears to be abandoned but what's there is great. Harry finds a loophole in the Triwizard rules that allow him to get away with basically anything short of cold-blooded murder, and he takes advantage of this. A lot. Also uses military grade Muggle equipments during the tasks (won't spoil anything more than that).
