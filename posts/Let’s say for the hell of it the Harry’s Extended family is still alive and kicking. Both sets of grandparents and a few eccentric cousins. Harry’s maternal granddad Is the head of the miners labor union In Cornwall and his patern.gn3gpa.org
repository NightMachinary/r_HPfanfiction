How would these two men and their best halves Influence Harry's life? What would Dumbledore have done when faced with an enraged Muggles Miner and his Ferocious Counterpart , A man commonly referred to in the shadows of the ministry as Vulcan or the potter Volcano.

What would've happened if Harry had been raised by both sets of his grandparents and his grandfather's two men with deep political connections and massive tempers who would burn the world to the ground to protect their families

I'm not a native English speaker so it may also be some less used word, but isn't 'Vulcan' a term from Star Trek? Also, I don't know why Dumbledore would be unwilling to give Harry to Lily's parents. In fact, I am positive he would have preferred this being a possibility since there was no bad history between Mr and Mrs Evans and Lily.

Other than that, this seems like a very promising prompt.

*** Vulcans are an alien species on Star Trek but Vulcan is also the name of the Roman god of Volcanoes. Sorry I should have put a link or a footnote mentioning that. People calling Harry's grandfather Vulcan implies he has an explosive temper like an Erupting volcano.

** This is such a neat idea. It would be cool if despite his relatives over the top personalities, Harry is shy and introverted, to the point where people don't seem to notice him unless he makes himself known (cloak).
