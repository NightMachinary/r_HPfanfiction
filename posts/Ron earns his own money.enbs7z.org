I am tired of fics where Ron is shown as a jealous idiot who only complains about what he doesn't have but never actually works to try and get what he wants. Is there any fan fiction where Ron gets a job and buys his own wand or school supplies himself. Just anything where he is actually trying to improve his life.


** The chessmaster series on ff.net has Ron wanting to prove himself and working odd jobs as a kid.

** You know child labor under 13 is legally forbidden (in most country at least, certainly uk), and Ron canonically gets his own wand at the age of 13?

*** What i mean is that i don't mind the idea of Ron finding a part time job or something (after he has had his 13th birthday, at the very earliest) to give himself better equipment, but it's not like there is a plausibility for him to work part time, being in a boarding school for about 3/4 of the year

**** I meant more like before Hogwarts. Kids find ways to get money when I was little I walked dogs and occasionally mowed lawns for extra spending money. So I'm looking for fics like where he does small jobs for money and can save up for things. I remember one fanfiction where he entered muggle chess tournaments and earned enough money to pay for his school supplies.

**** - Hagrid - Assistant - Paperwork, spell boy, piecemeal tasks
- Filch - Assistant OR cleaning OR spell boy: He can always clean for money. Or help Filch out with magic. Supervise detentions. Help filch out with paperwork. Piecemeal tasks.
- Madam Pince - Grunt work. There has to be books that are charmed/enchanted to be impervious to magic.
- Madam Hooch - Assistant, can supervise the pitch when students fly by themselves (if only to call for help if there's an accident), help reserve the pitch for the other teams. This one can help Ron with his Slytherin bigotry. He has to be neutral to them, otherwise his paycheck bites it.
- Madam Pomfrey - Assistant, patient watcher, taking stock of things.

That's just the things he can do AT school. He has free periods, after classes, weekends. And then there can be a stipulation about grades.

*** I don't think the magical world cares. Look at Merope with her love potions. Date rape drugs are illegal. Yet the only thing she would have gotten in trouble for was potioning a muggle. Not love potioning him and getting a kid.

**** true, but as in any country we have to consider that laws and moral codes change with time. We cannot base what the magical world would think on incidents that happened in the 1920s.

***** In HBP, sixth years were taught how to brew the strongest love potion that existed.

The WWW also sells love potion infused chocolates, so that implies nothing actually changed.

Moreover IIRC there weren't any consequences for Romilda Vane when she tried to potion Harry, and ended up potioning Ron.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
