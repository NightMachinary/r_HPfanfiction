The book also contains a bloody quidditch tournament for prisoners of Azkaban where they have to play quidditch to survive and Harry makes a new friend who Infact is Voldemort.


** I gotchu. I loved it.\\
Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients. Not sure where but easily available on google. If you ever find out about its sequel please let me know.\\
In order, this was book 6. Book 5 was also called OotP but instead the Order was a thing that let you bring exactly one person back to life. HarryxCho, DracoxGinny, everyone's an animagus.\\
Honestly, I loved that series. The Immortal Potion, Dumbledore's son as a student, Wizarding dueling cards.
