Hey team,

I just read an update for Impose by Marauderlover7. It's a pretty good rehash fic (although incredibly long), but the bit I look forward to is Draco. Draco has an Irish twin (Hydrus) and the Malfoys decide that Draco will go to Gryffindor as a spy and Hydrus will go to Slytherin and be a "proper" heir.

This is an incredibly cool concept to me. I find Draco at his most interesting when he's off balance or out of his comfort zone. The only problem is that Impose has so much going on, we get very little Draco (we're just at the end of Book 3 and we've already passed 1.5 MILLION words).

Does anyone know of a fic focusing more on Gryffindor!Draco?


** I think I can remember a very good crack where this is the main focus. If you're interested I can try to remember/find it.

**** Haven't read it in ages, but what I remember of it was that it was interesting in the early bits, started to get worse but I stuck with it, and then it was just too boring.

**** I loved the Dangerverse! I think the writing quality started out a tad rough but got better with time, to the point where I regularly find myself thinking about one of the major plot points from near the end of the series. It does some things I've never seen done in HP did before or since, and I like that. YMMV if you prefer heavy angst (angst is plentiful but tempered with comedy and healthy familial relationships) or dislike OCs (three main and an infinitely revolving cast of minor), but I really love it.

** Sadly, this is unfinished, but Draco is in Gryffindor. It's Peggy Sue (though not an Overpowered Peggy Sue), so YMMV.

** I remember a rather popular one where Draco was sorted wrong in an attempt to please his father (I guess?) but he still picks fights with the trio nearly every chance he gets.

He does still display some Slytherin tendencies, of course, but it's obvious he belongs in Gryffindor. Give me a moment to find it.

Edit: [[https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Philosophers-Stone-Rowling/dp/0747532745][Here]]. It's the first of a series, and it goes through all seven years, though Draco isn't the focus for +some+ most of them.
