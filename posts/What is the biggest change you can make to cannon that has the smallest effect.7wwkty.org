Many fics are based around small changes to cannon that snowball and have far reaching consequences. On the opposite end of the spectrum, what is the biggest change you could make that would have the smallest effect on the cannon?

**** You do know that Wormtail is actually an ace Auror right? It's just that he is an introvert and has confidence issues with new people.

After all, he succeeded in fooling both the Aurors and Sirius.

The Aurors locked up Sirius without any proof. Placing him in prison.

Sirius actually was tricked into performing magic at a public muggle place, so he would still be locked up in prison.

Pettigrew escaped, despite Sirius being a 'better' wizard.

***** /s is all fine and good, but you're not /that/ far from the truth. Pettigrew was not /quite/ as good at magic as James, Sirius and Remus, but he was /still/ a Marauder and one of the only known four people to become an Animagus at fifteen. Just going off the canon Graveyard scene, he was good enough to conjure ropes silently and cast a Killing Curse, all with a wand that not only wasn't his, but was a (super-loyal-Phoenix-cored) wand whose allegiance currently belonged to Voldemort. People both in- and out-of-universe look down on him because of how pathetic he was as a /person/, but he was still a very much above-average wizard.

********** Sprout is the herbology professor. The herbology professor grows the mandrakes.

The herbology professor does not have to be Sprout. Any herbology professor could grow the mandrakes.

Removing Sprout as the herbology professor does not remove the position of 'herbology professor'. When Dumbledore was ousted as Headmaster, the position of 'headmaster' did not suddenly vanish.

Therefore, any herbology professor could have provided the mandrakes in CoS, not just Sprout. Sprout did nothing unique in the series that required /her/ to be in that position instead of a different herbology professor.

I literally do not know how I can make this simpler.

That just randomly gave me an idea where characters keep disappearing from the setting, and others have to take over their responsibilities. Like that one Next Generation episode where Dr. Crusher ended up alone on the Enterprise.

Could go a number of directions with that. Parody, mystery, existential horror... could go anywhere from "characters have no idea it's happening" to "they have a vague feeling that people are missing" to "it's openly a mystery from the start". Maybe break the fourth wall, pit the characters against a strawman fanfic writer, or bring in existence-devouring Lovecraftian horrors and Revelations About The Nature Of Everything That No Sane Mind Was Designed To Comprehend.

Remember, Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort ever feared. Which means no Battle of Hogwarts, thus moving the final showdown somewhere else.

Not to mention Dumbledore's death was the catalyst for the Golden Trio leaving Hogwarts and going Horcrux-hunting. If he's still alive, they have no reason to do so. In short, if Dumbledore lives, you're looking at a complete rewrite of DH.
