Let's suppose that Harry and Neville's roles where inversed. While Neville's parents died and he became the boy who lived, Harry's parents were tortured to madness by death eaters because Pettigrew betrayed them. People still believed Sirius was the traitor, since James and Lily were unable to tell the truth (they're gonna spend the rest of their lifes in St. Mungos).

Little Harry is still going to be alone in the world. This time there is no blood protection to make Dumbledore send him to the Dursleys.

Except Harry has no other relatives, so that's the only place for him to go. BUT there is no reason for Petunia to accept him in ? The first time Dumbledore wrote to her about the protection, I chose to believe that that was the reason why they accepted him, because there is no way someone would take in a child that they hate for no reason. She was probably afraid of what would happen to her and her family if they didn't keep him.

Are there any wizarding orphanages ? If not that means a muggle one ? Remus was absent during the first 13 years of Harry's life but surely he wouldn't let him go to an orphanage ? Im still a little dubious about him.


** You can't properly switch Harry and Neville's roles and make it make it sense. But if you want Sirius in Azkaban, Harry goes to any wizarding family that would take him as that would have happened had Dumbledore not placed him with the Dursleys.

*** This. And since he wouldn't be the Boy-Who-Lived, you wouldn't have people trying to adopt him for his fame, so he'd probably just go to some random family who we didn't hear about in canon because they didn't have a kid Harry's age.

I guess he could still be adopted by someone trying to get at his money, but I'm not sure that they or Harry would actually be able to access it until he turned 17, since his parents would technically still be alive. But I am definitely not qualified to say for sure either way.

Are we talking the canon amount (a decent nest egg for Harry's school years and a bit beyond, but not enough to forgoe gainful employment) or the fanon amount (more gold than what physically exists in the whole of the Solar System)?

***** Your "canon" amount is also fanon. Canonically, he has a ton of money. Far more than what the entire Weasley family manages to get by on. Any attempt to figure out exact amounts is doomed to failure because Rowling is bad at math, but you are definitely downplaying it.

***** Canon amout is pretty high i think. His grandfather had a lot of money from his potion and 2 of his great granfathers were in the wizengamot so they would get paid well. James died at a young age so he didnt have time to spend his inheritance. All of it probably went to Harry. Lily's family wasn't rich so i don't know if lily left him anything.

***** What in canon indicates that Harry just has "a decent nest egg for the school years and a bit beyond"? Your estimation could easily be just as off as Harry being uber wealthy. I think he has a lot more than a small nest egg in canon, even if he isn't actually the heir of every wealthy family known to wizardkind with enough money to buy several countries.

** If James and Lily were still alive but tortured into insanity I don't see Sirius just leaving them on the floor, I think he'd take them to Saint Mungos where he'd be interrogated and the secret keeper swap would be revealed. What we /would/ probably see is a Sirius who is even more militantly anti-Black due to Bellatrix's involvement in the torture.

** It's possible that they would have dropped the Fidelius after Neville became the Boy Who Lived and therefore not been betrayed but just found and tortured because they were no longer under the Fidelius, which would lead to Sirius raising Harry.

If they didn't drop the Fidelius, Pettigrew betrayed them when the other Death Eaters were looking for answers, and Sirius was believed to be the traitor, then I would assume that he would likely still be offered the Dursleys as his closest living relatives. The Dursleys could either willingly take him in or not.

If the Dursleys didn't willingly take him in, then here are some possible options:

- Though Harry is the last Potter, most wizarding families are connected somehow, so he could be taken in by a more distant Potter relative.
- Orphanages aren't really a thing by this point in time. If he went into the muggle system, he would go into foster care and potentially get adopted by a muggle family.
- There's no evidence of wizarding orphanages or wizarding foster care being a thing in the books, but it could just be something that does exist and doesn't get explored in canon. I would presume that there is no such thing as a wizarding orphanage, because otherwise Tom Riddle would have likely ended up in one after he started at Hogwarts instead of continuing to return to his muggle orphanage. If a wizarding foster care system were to be a thing, then Harry could end up in that system.
- Theoretically, perhaps Remus Lupin would take him in but judging by his character in the books, I don't think he would. He would be just as ruined and depressed by James and Lily's condition, Peter's “death,” and Sirius's betrayal as he was in the books. He would still be a poor werewolf. I don't think he would do it.
- James and Lily could have had a will that specified multiple guardianship options other than Sirius, and the will would be followed.

** I think Harry would be raised with Neville

Now hear me out

A lot of fanfictions have Lily and Alice as godmothers to both Neville and Harry

So i would think Augusta wanting to honor Alice would adopt Harry

*** I don't know, would a grandmother really be willing to take on two toddlers at once after losing her son and daughter-in-law, one of whom isn't related? I think she'd be far more concerned with grieving and keeping Neville safe than taking on another kid who also had people after him.

(But I also don't subscribe to the fanon “Alice is Harry's godmother” idea, so this could just be my bias against that scenario. JK has said that Harry didn't have a godmother, and there's no proof they knew each other other than being in the Order. Being in the Order doesn't automatically make you friends with someone.)

**** I feel the best proof is the attack on the Longbottoms. They were targeted because Bellatrix and co. wanted information on what happened to Voldemort. JKR has claimed that this was because the Longbottoms were the other possibility for the prophecy, but I just don't see Voldemort showing weakness to his followers by telling them about it. The same reason be just took Peter to Godric's Hollow. I feel it makes more sense if the Death Eaters knew (or at least thought) that the Longbottoms and the Potters were close and so the former might know something of what the latter had done.

Other justifications are: given that Alice and Lily were effectively coworkers in the Order who were pregnant at the same time and then both were worrying about the same prophecy, it would have been weird if they didn't get to know each other. Also Sirius doing the 'I am your godfather and you can live with me' speech in book 3 does beg the question of does Harry have a godmother and if so where are they, which Alice neatly fills.

***** I still don't buy it personally, but we'll probably have to agree to disagree.

- Even if the Death Eaters didn't know about the prophecy, the Longbottoms could have been targeted simply because they were Aurors and members of the Order. At this point, a lot of Order members were dead, so they went after the ones they could find.\\
- They worked together in the Order, yes, but what was the Order actually doing? They would have met in meetings, but it's not like that was an everyday occasion. Members likely had different missions and were working on different things, it wasn't necessarily a coworker relationship like you'd get at a real job so we don't know how close they could have gotten. In the OOTP, there wasn't an indication that everyone in the Order was close friends just because they were in the Order.
- We don't actually know if the Potters and Longbottoms actually knew the prophecy or not. We know the Potters went under the Fidelius on Dumbledore's recommendation because Snape told Dumbledore that Voldemort was targeting them. We don't know if Dumbledore told them specifically why he was after them. Dumbledore keeps things very close to his chest, so I wouldn't be surprised if he kept the prophecy a secret.
- JK has said in an interview that Harry didn't have a godmother, so it is a fact that he didn't have one.

** There's no way that the Ministry would let Remus Lupin, a Werewolf, take in a child. Not by what we see in Canon. Even if Remus was willing to do so. Which... as much as I love Remus, I don't think he would be. Too busy wallowing in self pity.

I could see the Weasley's take Harry in. Bill is also a curse breaker.... (at this time?). He can strengthen the spells and make better protection spells on them.

Or a interesting thought: Be forced to move so Death Eaters don't know where the Weasley's live.

** Tbh he I think would have gone to a muggle orphanage he might have gotten a similar upbringing to Tom Riddle because the magical kid was probably creepy though at least no world war and the orphanage probably less shitty. Once he went to hogwarts though no reason he had to return to the orphanage. He could live with the Weaselys or in his own apartment he is still rich.

I always figured Remus didnt adopt him because without regular access to wolfsbane it would get real risky keeping a toddler around once a month. Plus the physicsl injuries he would cause himself would require recovery all that would be very stressful to handle on its own let alone as a single parent.

** Would the same fate even happen? In canon, it was Frank and Allice vs The Lestranges and Crouch Jr but if they attacked the Potters there would have been a really big chance of Sirius and/or Remus being there? Ergo making it a 3 v 4 or even 4 v 4
