I have never understood why people like this ship

Same goes for wen people ship snape and Hermione I just don't get it can you guise give me some reasons why these ships are so popular?


** Because hanging on for the past 30 years, of the girl you met at age 9, is a sign that you have a TRU WUB Romantic Soulâ„¢.

Snape is the modern and magical version of the classic literary romance trope, the Byronic Hero. The dark, brooding, troubled man with a tragic background and a fatal flaw. If you never liked /Wuthering Heights/ or /Jane Eyre/, you probably won't understand why people like these types of characters, and what they see in the ship. Which is a potential for angst, redemption, and character studies.

It's not my cup of tea either, but I can see what other people like about it. Even if what they like about it is essentially the fanon Leather Pants'd version of Snape, because the canon bitter manchild Snape isn't sexy or sexually appealing as a love interest.

*** The Snarry dynamic reminds me of Mills & Boons from the 80s. Except that Snape is poor where no Mills & Boons hero would ever be.

Also, would just like to point out that Snarry was a thing before book seven came out, which makes it both more and less creepy. IMO, book five was where he crossed the line from misanthropic wanker to abusive asshole.

** I think most of it is what [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]] said in his comment, but I also think the movies have some impact as well. Alan Rickman certainly has some sex appeal (Hans Gruber from /Die Hard/ comes to mind, although that was three decades ago), and we already know the actors for the Trio have some as well. I would imagine a number of people just want to see two actors they think look pretty making doe eyes at each other, so they write a fic to elaborate that mental image. The same thing I would imagine happens sometimes with the various Draco Malfoy/random trio member fics. 'Look, two pretty people that otherwise despise each other! Let's have them get together so we can enjoy staring at them both *at the same time*' is what I feel it sort of boils down to for some of these things.

Maybe I'm just inclined against slash though. Wouldn't really surprise me all that much.

** I don't like Snape-positive fics but that's mostly because Sirius Black is my best guy and fics like these invariably throw him under the bus. And also the fact that he's a bitter incel with anger management issues who at least verbally abuses children under his care. And that fact that Harry is a child under his care who was abused by him, verbally and physically. So I don't like Snape.

However, if you only consider well-written fics and ignore the drivel, enemies-to-lovers is a highly popular, and very interesting, dynamic to explore. There's tension there, and a lot of conflict to overcome, in order to get to a satisfactory resolution. Plus Alan Rickman is a sexy, sexy man. All that cloak swishing and the drama and that voice - if his character were less of an asshole, I could see why he'd be considered a TILF by his students.

More importantly, OTPs that become popular early on in the creation of a fandom will continue to be huge until the fandoms end, and the big three for slash pairings in HP will always be Drarry, Wolfstar and Snarry.

**** To me also, but people like what people like. I'd probably be more down with it if Snape was just generally a misanthrope and didn't target Harry specifically with his hate, particularly when Harry is his student.
