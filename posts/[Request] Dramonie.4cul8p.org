Hey, I'm looking for some dramonie fic to help me get into the mood for something i'm writing. Something long, with a plot. Or something short which feels like a window into a larger story. Where the voices feel like they are actually the characters. Nothing of a certain nature before the characters involved are 18. And a strong reaction to the relationship from Ron would be great to read too.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** Not sure if it meets all your requirements, especially the sex part, but one of the best known dramione fics is Isolation. It's long but it's damn good.

**** It's likely written by someone older than you, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Look at the novel Lolita.

***** I've heard of lolita thanks. Lolita is a literary work designed to show us how fancy language can lead us to sympathise with a monster, most erotic fanfic presents the sex as just that, erotic. So while its fine for people who are that age i'd give it a miss.

****** Okay, but you're specifically asking for examples of fics with a romantic pairing. Age of consent in a lot of countries is 14-16, not 18. Half of the romance novels that exist throughout the world include "underage" individuals sleeping with each other - it's not realistic to expect that a decently written romantic novella is not going to include explicit sex just because the characters aren't 18. It's the whole appeal for teen porn - the idea that they are "just barely" at the age of legality. There's a lot of that in dramione as well.

If you don't like it, search fanfiction.net with a K-T rating. The more well written and longer novels are more likely going to be by an older and more mature writer, with lots of writing experience, who is going to include sexual content. Remember, sex sells.

TL; DR: You want well written and long? Prepare for smut.
