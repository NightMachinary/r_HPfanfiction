** Out of curiosity, what makes you say they are the most popular HP fanfic writer? Based off any metric I can think of they really don't seem to be?

*** Look at the number of reviews her HP stories have on all the sites that do Harry Potter fanfic.

**** I did that's why I'm confused, all of her stories combined on fanfiction.net have roughly 7,254 reviews. That's less than a third of the reviews some of the authors like robst have on individual stories.

***** I said on all fanfic sites that have Harry Potter fanfiction. Not just Fanfiction.net.

****** Fine give me an exhaustive list of every website but unless she gets on average 30x more reviews on siye than she does on fanfic (which considering it only allows stories that feature hinny and therefore doesn't allow many popular stories) she's still nowhere near. To be clear I have no issue with her writing, I've read it I thought it was pretty good but you seem to be working off a personal bias.

******* As a side note I've checked siye now which as expected of a site with a smaller though more focused community her stories on average have maybe half the reviews they did on fanfic which doesn't do much to help. Only 3 on Harry Potter fanfiction.net none of which crack 50, and she's not on archive of our own.
