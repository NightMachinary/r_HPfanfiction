Just looking for story centered around quiddich


** This post had a bunch of recs based around the sport:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dlg0sd/quidditch_based_fanfic/]]

I also really liked JBern's take on the sport (particularly the chaser/keeper dynamics) in both linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games]]) as well as in his The Lie I've lived (granted Lie I've Lived has 2-3 relevant scenes in a 230k word work).

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

** I think Jeconis has a couple on FanFicAuthors that have a plot that are least partially rotates around a quidditch match. One is a Harry/Ginny and the second is a Harry/Gabby

** Hi,

​

I'm working on a fic right now that centers around Quidditch and Hogwarts life. My first chapter went up last night and I plan on updating with a chapter every couple of weeks at least. I hope I'm not breaking a rule here by promoting my own fic, but I could link it if you're interested!

*** There's no rule against it, so feel free, but you will be downvoted if you self promote when it's not relevant.
