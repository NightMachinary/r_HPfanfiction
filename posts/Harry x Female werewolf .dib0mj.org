Hey guys, im currently looking for a Harry x female werewolf character, AU, i would preffer OC or some unusual fem to pair with Harry, but if you don't find someone different there is no problem.

One of the other points of preference would be if Harry became werewolf or animagus in some time of the plot.\\
If some of you could help me i would be very thankful ^^


** Woah...

Can't think of any at all.

The only one that I've read, and comes close, is the Blue Eyed Doe. That features Lavender after the film DH2.

linkffn(7150923)

That's pretty niche fic you want to find, I'll actually be checking this thread if anyone finds one that fits your description.

Although, as I'm writing this, there is one that technically fits your description:

The Prince of the Dark Kingdom, Harry does develop a somewhat romantic (as far as he's able, considering all the shit that's happening to him) relationship with a female werewolf.

  Harry, shattered by Ginny's death during the Battle of Hogwarts, retreats from public life, even from almost all contact with the Weasleys. But he is not the only one with scars. Six months later he comes across a witch who may be more damaged than he...

Spoilers for the Dark Kingdom

Does this happen before or after Sirius' tribe gets wiped? It was a bit of a hard blow and I basically stopped reading after that point (especially seeing as I adored the depiction of werewolves in that fic).

****** He was angry she used him as a vessel for Greyback to fight the German aurors, she gave him special weed, basically, and he didn't appreciate that. The romance died at that point.

EDIT: Greyback became a god and possessed Harry, btw, that's why it was such a big deal. Even though it was not Luna specifically, she still knew what was going on and went with it.

** Mostly read H/Hr, so what I have aren't unusual females, instead just Hermione...

Both of these have Hermione "infected" by Remus. I haven't actually read Weremione so no guarantees on quality of that one, but That Which Truly Matters was good if I remember correctly.

  Transferred from my FenrisWinter Profile. Events surrounding Harry's third year at Hogwarts force Harry to re-evaluate what is truly important in his life and just who he wants to be. He's not the only one experiencing a change in outlook either. Like Dumbledore said, there is a difference between doing what is right and what is easy. Starts off rated T, On Hiatus.

  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.
