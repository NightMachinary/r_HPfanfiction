** FanficLore has a list of HP Fanfiction Archives, some of which are pairing specific. You might find a pairing you like in those.

[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives]]

You can also do a subsearch here. If you go to the reddit search bar and type in what you want - usually Person/Person if you want a specific pairing - then tick the 'limit to HPFanfiction' box, you'll get all the posts that include that term in this sub.
