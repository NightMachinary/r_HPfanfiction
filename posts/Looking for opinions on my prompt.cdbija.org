Hey, so I'm new to Harry Potter fan fiction but I thought of a prompt I might want to try writing about and I want to hear your opinions on it. It takes place after voldemort dies, the main character is a child prodigy who is aspiring to get into MIT, when he then gets a strange owl appearing at his window with a letter that says he has been accepted into "Hogwarts". As a simple teenager who is muggleborn, he soon finds out that he has other schooling options to consider :). I can go into more detail below if people are interested.


** So you have a character (does he have any flaws or characteristics beyond beings genius?), now you need a story.

*** Hey thanks for replying. He definitely has a number of flaws, to be more specific he is a genius specifically in the "muggle world", which of course does not always translate to being a good wizard. One of the arcs in his character development in the first story is the frustration he feels from going from child prodigy in the muggle world to below average student in the wizarding world (he's one of the only people in his class who starts out not even being able to perform a levitation charm). However he is very much above average at certain disciplines like potion making as muggles know more abut extracting materials and chemicals than wizards (he even goes so far as to buy a couple lab beakers and tools, which work much better than mortars and pestles, to get perfect scores on his brewing assignments). The main trait as it pertains to the first story is he comes at odds with the rules of the wizarding world when his muggle friend comes down with cancer ( the rules being of course that wizards cannot use magic on muggles).

**** It doesn't sound like my kind of thing at all, but best of luck writing it, there's certainly an audience for it.

**** And how is that a big problem? Just don't tell anyone - it's almost certain that there's a huge underground scene providing healing to muggles.

***** Well the not telling anyone is the idea, but he has to make a potion that offers long term vitality, normal healing spells usually are just for wounds, ie if he just healed him once the cancer would probably come back, not to mention that the ministry can actually detect if magic is used around muggles like when Harry summoned a patronus in front of Dudley. This story is mainly about his first year and it goes into the politics of the wizarding world post voldemort, with the backlash from a rogue entity infiltrating the wizarding government leading to an almost police state-like form of ministry.

****** Then you have the problem that your protagonist is a little kid, and your main plot is happening outside Hogwarts. You can make that work - but it's hard, and not everyone might like "see how things turn to shit, every character in canon is useless, and everything the fought for is turning to ashes while our protagonist can only watch".

If you actually want to deal with wizarding politics, you need an adult protagonist. And, I dare say, an explanation why Harry and co. don't solve the problem easily.

******* Thanks for the input. Ya the main character is definitely a little kid, this is his first year but it does mainly take place inside of Hogwarts, the entire main plot of the series is just hinted at and a lot of it is about his first year in the wizarding world. As for everything turning completely to shit it really hasn't, the character who is the main villian hasn't completely turned evil yet. This isn't a story about a clear good side and a clear bad side, the best way I could describe it is if Voldemort's goals were compared to Hitlarianism (which is evil right off the bat) the new villian and the wizarding politics are taking a turn towards Stalinism(which on paper is an ideology that tries to be fair, the perfect example of the road to hell is paved with good intentions). As for Harry and co being able to easily just solve everything I don't think this is true, it's not a well defined problem, it's filled with grey area. Also although Harry is good at dueling it's not like he's a God, he was able to defeat Voldemort because he was meant to, I don't think even in the last books he was as powerful as Dumbledore. However, some main characters are in this, mainly Hermione as an auror working in the ministry. There is a main story that I haven't talked about yet, but it's similar to the first story where Harry has to find and defeat something inside of Hogwarts. And ya the protagonist is a little kid, but so was Harry in the first book and I think it's safe to say that turned out alright lol.

******** The problem with that plot is that it sounds like "Harry Potter 2.0", with the old guard now being useless adults who can't keep from turning fascists and have to rely on kids at Hogwarts to save them - as if they had learned nothing at all from their experiences.

**** If he's a genius with muggle science and has adequate magic skill (enough to slightly modify existing spells by upper year) and gets drawn into some kind of conflict (I'd make him a Ravenclaw in the same year as Harry so that there can be some battle action) he could use modified light spells and conjured chemicals for everything. I'd love to read about pureblood death eaters trying to figure out how to deal with chlorine trifluoride fire or burning infrared lasers.
