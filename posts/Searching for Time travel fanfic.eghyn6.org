Hello ! I'm searching for a time travel fanfic I read a long time ago but can't find it anymore where Harry and Voldemort are sent back in time during the Hogwarts battle.

I remember it as a hilarious fanfic, not completed at the time. Harry was first send in prehistoric era, but then he was in the Marauders era. He had acquired a very eccentric personality, was still parseltongue, and he also met a snake he transformed into a cat.

Hope you will be able to help me! Thanks in advance !
