Groupthinking, narrow minded, prejudiced, ministry following, daily prophet reading duffers with their sanctimonious goody two shoes facade to hide their lack of either spine or brain.

It doesnt have to be that extreme, but yea, I'm looking for a fic where either Harry or another POV character that strongly dislike puffs.


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Tongue-in-cheek though.

** But Tonks was a Hufflepuff, and she doesn't fit that description

Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)

Harry doesn't hate his House, he just hates that they stand for hard work and diligence. He just wants to be lazy

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** Doesn't have to be rational or true. After second and fourth year it's pretty plausible that Harry makes up his mind about the house before getting to know tonks.

Also, I really enjoyed that fic but it's not what I meant.
