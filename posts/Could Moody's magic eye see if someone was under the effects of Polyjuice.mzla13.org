Just trying to figure out what (if any) limitations that eye has.


** I don't think he could. As far as we know from the books, he can see through objects and spells meant to hide things, while the Polyjuice potion physically changes a person into someone else, it doesn't create an illusion that they are the person they are impersonating.

** I agree with [[/u/Key-Leopard-3618][u/Key-Leopard-3618]] that polyjuice changes the actual body, and thus there is nothing to see through. Moody's eye, it appears to me, sees through PHYSICAL barriers (even an enchanted cloak is, after all, a physical cloak). It's more likely that his skills as a paranoid auror would help him spot it.

One thing canon doesn't go into but should, is that morphing into a completely different body should require a period of adjustment to be able to "drive" that body. If you're used to shorter arms, for example, you're going to knock over a lot of glasses just trying to take a drink. Of if you're used to longer legs you might try to take stairs two at a time, but your new shorter legs can't reach so you trip. Harry will probably have a habit of pushing his glasses up, that will seem strange in a body that doesn't wear glasses. Or somebody with long hair who has a habit of tossing their head might retain that habit even with shorter hair.

Spotting habits (like Barty's tongue thing) would require a knowledge of the person in question. If the person is going in and out of polyjuice, and interacting with Moody in both forms, perhaps he would note a physical habit like drumming fingers. (Or maybe as an Easter egg, you can have somebody polyjuiced into Harry have Daniel Radcliffe's habit of tapping the wand against his leg.)

*** This is also my headcanon for why Tonks is so consistently clumsy; she's always changing her body as a metamorph as party ticks and whatnot, so never has a single "form" shes used to for long enough.

*** Well yes but it is feasible that the potion includes mustle memory and changes neuron pathways by literally rewiring your body, to the way the other person has it, your brain already has to change in size when shifting between genders or people of the same gender with a bug difference in height, so no reason to assume you retain anything other than your long and short term memory.

This would also fit with the common Tonks headcanon since she lacks the muscle memory as a whole from shifting too often.

** Canon didn't say, so do whatever works for your story. I can see it going either way, either that polyjuice works so thoroughly it fools anything, or that potions leave some magical trace that his eye can detect. Maybe he could tell that the person is on some potion, but not know which potion.

** I don't know how that one is possible unless there's some cellular sign and he can see down to that level? Or some other side effect that he can easily see?

** It's not said if the eye can see beyond anything but spells, charms, physical objects.. Potions are not mentioned, but I think you can invent something. I think that this eye (vision) has counterparts for each sense. With that said, maybe some potions and potions' remains can be identified by sight sometimes, due to some effect, idk, glowing, blur, sepia effect etc. But some can't, instead it's through smell or hearing. Or so, a special nose may give someone the ability to tell if someone is an animagus or werewolf... Now I'm conjecturing....
