Hi folks

I'm looking for stories where instead of being born to Molly and Arthur, Ginny was born to James and Lily, but Kidnapped by Dumbledore and Molly, with a few memory charms being done "For the Greater Good"

Preferably with some Harry/Hermione or another one of their year.

Cheers in advance

(Edit: Yeah, that seems sensible, putting a down vote on a serious question. Sorry I wanted to read a different type of Molly and Dumbledore bashing!!)


** I don't think you understand what "For the Greater Good" means. I don't think you understand that a well-written fanfic Dumbledore, and even canon Dumbledore, has put the idea of the "Greater Good" behind him out of shame.

*** Wait what?! You mean Dumbledore circa 1990s doesn't still posses the pre-Nazism fantaticism of that one friend, you know the one that might have literally, if not almost certainly indirectly, killed his sister, from what amounts to mostly a summer fling?!

You're telling me that a century of experience and action to the contrary means he didn't secretly still believe that Grindelwald was right and no matter what the ends justify the means?! I'm not buying it.

PS: I love reading 'For the Greater Good' I just get the scene from Hot Fuzz stuck in my head every time I read it!

***** The American Wizarding school is some kind of Super School. Harry has a sister that is eleven, yet somehow knows she is bisexual and came out to Lily and Harry. Harry is supposed to be powerful, but he never does anything meaningful, as he is too busy acting like a cuck.

****** Since it is my story in question, Harry's sister, Rose is 12 and I don't see that as being too young to have decided her sexuality. Harry is powerful in a way, but he isn't Super!Harry, and I'd say his Animagus ability, and his performance in the first task is "meaningful". Ilvermorny is not a Super School, it just isn't backwards like Hogwarts. It is more advanced than Hogwarts, yes. But only because in my story, American wizarding society isn't as old fashioned as the British one is. It is more modern.

******* #1 No, I've rarely heard of twelve year olds deciding upon their sexuality, as that age is just too young for such a decision. #2 His Animagus ability is all he has, and his performance in the first task was boring and unoriginal. You, like many authors before you, believe that because someone is an Animagus, they must use it every chance they get. It's like making Harry a metamorphmagus, and having it show up in every battle-scene, it isn't practical. #3 The wizarding world itself was proven to be backward, and yes, a school with 5 defense classes in which they learn how to hunt Dragons classifies as a Super School. The whole 'thunderbird' helicopter thing was laughable. #4 You still have yet to refute that all you did in that fic was pander to 'woman power' by making Harry accept that he is in a Marriage contract with a witches witch. The whole Tracey arc in itself was forced.

******** Well that is your opinion, and I will not fault you for it. But I can understand why you aren't reading it, which is fine with me. There are plenty of people reading my story, and more coming every day or so, according to my alerts on my email. No bother to me when someone doesn't want to read my story. I write for those who want to read my stories and enjoy them.

A few pointers here...

Harry doesn't use his Animagus every chance he gets. Aside from the task, he only did it on Full Moons, and to get around fast in long distances.

I know of several schools which has different class types for one subject. For example, math. I could name at least four, if not more. Different subjects for Defense isn't absurd, it is practical. And they don't learn to hunt dragons. Dragons are simply one portion of the curriculum... along with werewolves, boggarts, etc. And the thunderbird thing is simply something unique that a Muggleborn Headmaster wanted for his own school. Like the giant carriage for Beauxbatons. Not absurd at all.

Harry isn't in a contract with Tracey at all, she's in one with Daphne -- the only connections to Harry she has is Daphne, and the fact that it was partially his idea to help her. And Daphne is not a witches witch.

********* Not a story anyone can enjoy, that's a simple fact. Your alerts are probably by people ironically following the story like I do, to see what other sporadic plot-points you can come up with.

Not from what I read, his Animagus formed was mentioned in at least every other chapter.

Math is math, Geometry, Trig, Algebra, whatever are all completely different forms of math. I would think that America would make a singular defense class, but in multiple periods of the day for different facets of Defense. I just find it a little convenient that they learn about Dragons the same year they're supposed to fight one, not to mention the fact that Remus, Sirius, and Harry's mother all managed to get teaching positions at the school, despite not being from America, and having not went to Illvermorny themselves. Giant Carriage is generation compliant and compliant with the French as a people. Wizards somehow having access to technology is not, especially considering the fact that Wizards and Muggles are extremely segregated in America (Fantastic Beasts).

So you're calling Daphne bisexual? How many bisexuals are in this fucking story dude? You do realise that being bisexual is essentially a phase, and you gotta choose one day when you're at the altar, a Harem doesn't circumvent this at all, in fact, it makes it worse. Might as well tell Harry to cut off his dick now.

I would also like to add that you were completely unoriginal with his wand, American Wizards probably have Phoenix Feathers as well. The forced in Neville relationship was also quite stupid.

** Yeah, I don't really think you understand what "The Greater Good" is.

But anyways! There was this real shitfic, where after killing the basilisk, Harry is told by Ginny that they are really siblings. Harry learns about the prophecy. There's some magical deity thing (or maybe the ghost of Salazar Slytherin?). Basically every single bad indy!Harry trope. /And that's all in the first chapter/. Don't recall the name, but I think I found it here sometime in the last year? Maybe while lurking over at DLP?
