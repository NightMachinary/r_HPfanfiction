Ok, so, sorry, but while the title does just say Percy Jackson, I'm looking for some that are very specific. I recently got into reading stories where authors make Draco, Neville, and Luna demigods, and I LOVE them. Unfortunately, most of them are a little short, so if anyone knows of ones longer than 9k words, it would be very appreciated! Thank you!(any platform is fine unless it's on a r-18 site :p )

​

Edit: Thank you everyone!!! Tbh, I didn't really expect too many since it seems like a really random request, but I'll check these all out! thank you again!!


** linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter); Might be my favorite crossover and one of my top HP fanfics. It is quite different from the others and what you asked for, but I would highly, highly recommend it.

linkffn(The True Half-Blood Prince by lildrummerboi); Features an older Percy sent by the ICW to help Harry in his fight against Voldemort post GoF. It is one of my favorite crossovers and works as a good HP story (unlike many crossovers that ruin one of the universes).

linkffn(Empire of Dirt by sweets10); This story is okay, features Percy as quite strong and in some ways places Harry and the Hogwarts cast in secondary roles.

  While Magical Britain may be content to ignore warnings of Dark Lords the ICW takes such threats much more seriously. They dispatch an investigator to look into the claims, and what he finds will shake the bedrock of the Magical World.

  Following the Battle for Manhatten, nearly all of Percy's closest friends are dead. Grieving and left as the last Greek hero in New York, Percy is confronted by two goddesses who desperately need his help. Miles away, a young wizard is inching closer to the end of the prophecy that has defined his entire life...the only problem is that he doesn't know it yet. AU.

** No good percy jackson fics exist currently if they are cross overs, you can have decent ones, cracky ones or trash. As for long crossovers with percy jackson and harry potter, the harry pottee squatter fic is already recomended so I cant really give one?

** I like the x-overs by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2720956/Engineer4Ever][Engineer4Ever]], though it must be said that they vary in quality imo with "The Ever Twisting Wind" being the most entertaining and "Consul of the Underworld" the least.

I also enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12662997/1/Carpe-Diem][Carpe Diem]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11441234/1/Son-of-Athena][Son of Athena]], though both of them have their own faults, but they're the best I found so far imho.

** Recent one I've read sorry it doesn't have HP demigods. linkffn(12446944)

Quest to the Past by Marisandini. Is a Marauders-era fic with Percy Jackson and his best friends Severus, Lily and his frenemies the Potter gang. The writing style is really good in that it reminds me of the fun, crazy PJO style. Original storyline's in each Arc or “School Year” first book explore the Mystery of the Ghost of Halloween and the Second Book explores the Lost treasures of the Founders.

PJO elements feature in that Percy is not safe from monster attacks even.. on the Hogwarts train.

AND it updates frequently. Give it a try :D

  Circe has broken the Ancient Law. To spite her mother, she went back in time to help the Dark Lord caused more chaos to her precious Wizarding World. Who else would the Olympians asked for help by none other than Percy Jackson and sent to the past in the Marauders Era. I don't own any of the characters except OCs.
