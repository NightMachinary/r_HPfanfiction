I am an avid fan of Hermione and all her flaws. I don't like fics where she's a complete Mary Sue, I love all her edges. So I'm asking y'all to drop your fave Hermione-centric fics, because I desperately need new fics to read.

I personally love the "dark" side Hermione even if it comes off OOC. Or just generally dark fics. I'm not particular with any pairings, just that personally prefer Het and no Ronmione. I could read a Thorfinn x Hermione, Rodolphus x Hermione, Dolohov x Hermione, etc if it's well-written enough or has intriguing plot. I'm just not on the Ronmione sail yet, haven't thought of crossing that bridge.

So I'm just listing my faves here too just bc we're already on the topic:

1) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11132624/1/Persephone][Persephone by dulce.de.leche.go]]

2) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12991569/1/][Madame Umbridge Home for Wayward Girls by A Lovely Villain]]

3) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse by Lady Moonglow]]

4) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12917045/1/Manacled][Manacled by SenLinYu]]

5) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology or by jacobk]]

Also Dangerous by blacklotus would be on this list but it's been abandoned and I don't want y'all to go through the rollercoaster of emotions only to be frustrated in the end as I have. I still want that to finish, but we can't have all we want. But it's personally intriguing for me.

It doesn't have to be necessarily just romance, I'm always here for the plot. Tho, this is just specifically for the Potterverse, no crossover Hermione-centric fics yet. (That's for another post)

Thank you y'all in advance for putting down your favorites.

Absolutely love this fic. Only thing I don't like is that it's only 50k words.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

The Death Eaters go all Nazi, slow legal takeover of the government by putting pressure on politicians, pushing through discriminatory laws. After Umbridge manages to get all muggleborns legally thrown out, Hermione organizes a group of them to fight back. Things get quite bloody and gruesome.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm surprised the arithmancer hasn't been mentioned yet. It's overall great and Hermione has nice character development, but I stopped at year 5, because Umbridge had an unbelievable plot armor and got away with way too much shit without anyone even trying to stop her. It was a pity since so far it was a great fic.

**** I have read the Arithmancer, though I've only begun on the 2nd book. I guess in a way what put me off is the pacing. The character development is one of the realistic ones in fanfic and I absolutely loved that she's no Mary Sue. But the pacing was just a little too slow and I'm currently trudging through the 2nd book.
