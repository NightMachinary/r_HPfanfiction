:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember literally nothing about this story except that someone gave Norbert a teddy paper to sleep with when she was a baby dragon, and now that she is grown up at the dragon preserve, she grabs full sized adult bears and snuggles with them. It's been driving me crazy that this is all I can remember.

*** Funny enough, I've now binge read through about three quarters of the story (26/34 chapters) and I have in fact encountered Norbert snuggling with a bear; thing is that is literally the only thing in this story that I have recognized. Not a single time while I've been reading this has that little bell in the back of my head dinged to say “Hey, I know this!” Not entirely sure what to make of that, especially considering I have a fairly good memory when it comes to things I've read.

***** Possibly. Either way, I've enjoyed reading this story so far and want to thank you again for posting a link to it, especially since it did in fact have what I was looking for.

** Sounds familiar, so I'm pretty sure it exists. Not much help, I know, but at least you have some confirmation it's probably out there somewhere.

** Yes, 100% true. As facilitated (teddy bears) dragons and such in plush being found everywhere. Desire can manifest in an out of control way, due to all the bastardized little voodoo dolls that seem harmless. Now add a narative (even the most unexciting). Tend to appear after some time. These are terrible concepts to play with and leave the wannabe master (m/f). In a world contrary to need but full with desire. A world of pain like no other (no plush anymore) folks awaits.
