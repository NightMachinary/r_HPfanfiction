Some other details I remember:

- The first time Harry was killed, he was heading home from primary school when he walked into a bewitched house, was found by Walden MacNair, and delivered to Quirrelmort.

- When he gets to Hogwarts, he's sorted into Slytherin. When he's killed by the troll the first time around, he ends up returning to just after he was sorted.

- Another time when he's killed right after blowing up at Quirrel, he's sent back to just after he killed the troll.

- He has trouble building relationships with people because of the loss of days or months of work every time he gets killed, but he keeps his spell knowledge...which in turn makes people wonder about his knowledge of curses.

- There are no RPG elements, unlike other stories where Harry 'saves' and 'reloads' and grinds his skills.

- One more thing! It was definitely on Fanfiction.Net.
