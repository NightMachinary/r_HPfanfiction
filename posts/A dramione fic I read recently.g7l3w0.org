:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hermione and class (take a potion, say a spell, cast a charm etc) that lets them see and experience two different possible futures. Hermione sees one with Ron and one with Draco. I believe it's an after war fic and once the (whatever it was) wears off she ends up with Draco :) any ideas????


** Omg I need to find this
