I am trying to find an old fic. Where it's set during the age of Wagon Trains going across America. Harry is still with the Dursley's and never went to Hogwarts. They emigrate to America and take the Wagon Train to the west. Some of the Hogwarts teachers and students are also going along with the Wagon train as they are trying to find another spot for a magic school. They start finding out that someone is using magic and find out that it's Harry.

Harry is also abused by the Dursley's and is rescued by Severus Snape as they travel. Poppy is there as well, and the Wiazrds make sure that the muggle children all have some of the water to make sure that stay well.

I can't really remember much else from it. But I've been looking for it for the last couple of months and had no luck since I can't remember the title or author.
