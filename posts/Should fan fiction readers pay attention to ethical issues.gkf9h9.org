Hi. I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, and respect all the coupling related to Harry Potter novels. (Both official and fan-made)

Recently, there is a controversy in the social community I'm participating in. It was an opinion that making adults and adolescents a couple causes problems in reality. Riddle/Harry, Snape/Hermione, for example.

I'm a normal adult now, dating with an adult normally, and I /never/ feel sexual tension to a minor in reality. I just enjoy reading those fan fictions online.

But the majority in the community said that my preference for such an adult/minor couple will have a negative impact on many other real minors.

What do you think? Should I like them secretly because of the ethical issue? Is my preference weird?

** As long as the relationship starts over 16 which is the legal sexual relations age for here in the UK, with parental consent then sure I dont mind. I wont read it but I wont gove a shit.

If they are below 16 then idk man, that's pretty suspicious for an adult.

Now 16 is barely legal so I'll still put some eyebrows but otherwise ignore it. But if the characters wait until they turn 16 then that's also bad.

Tldr just make sure there the legal age

** people write about murder, torture, etc. all the time. Rowling has both in abundance in canon. sex is treated uniquely by our society, but the fact that authors have written about absolutely despicable things even in that category and continued to receive praise (cough cough stephen king) shows fairly firmly that it's generally at least /tolerated/ in fiction. showing the problems in these sorts of situations has led to brilliant writing in the past.

that being said, snarry is wack and i'm quite happy to avoid teacher/student fics.

*** I think you're basing the age difference on Alan Rickman's casting as Snape. (As much as I loved his portrayal, he was much too old for the part.) Canon Snape is the age of Harry's parents, and thus 20 years older than Harry. As Hermione is nearly a year older than Harry (birthday in September), that makes Snape "only" 19 years her senior. Not to say that twice her age is necessarily an acceptable age gap, but he's not old enough to be her grandfather. There are many current cultures where a 30-something with an 18-year old would raise eyebrows but not draw censure. Hell, when I was 18 I had men in their 30s and 40s hitting on me. (And yes, I thought it was creepy but because I wasn't interested in pot-bellied middle managers, not because I thought they were pedophiles.)

Your formula is your personal bias, not a societal rule of thumb. We also should extrapolate that the longer lifespans of wizards likely results in a greater tolerance for age gaps *as people age* (not applicable to students). Even in our current society, is a 70-year-old considered a cradle robber if they marry a 50-year-old? Twenty years is literally a lifetime to somebody your age, but it loses its significance the older you get. So despite the fact that I think Harry/Tom is a squicky pairing, an adult Harry who gets together with him doesn't cause me any turmoil other than the pairing itself not appealing to me.

In the real world, any teacher who considers a relationship with a student deserves censure regardless of age, because it is an unequal relationship. And I say that as somebody who once pursued a college teacher I had a crush on (not my finest moment).

That said, I read and enjoy Harry Potter teacher relationship fics because Hogwarts *is* the Harry Potter world, where our characters lived throughout the stories, and it is fiction. Fictional characters are not harmed by fictional relationships.

I respect that you believe Snape/Hermione has too large of an age gap for you. What I don't respect are those (not you!) who say that all such stories should be banned because they believe that reading such stories will lead to actual teachers abusing actual students. Do murder stories lead to more murders? Did "Criminal Minds" lead to more serial killings?

I believe that people who maintain that readers need to be socially conscious fail to realize that entertainment is just that. I'm sure I'm a product of my generation when I say that such people have ruined children's programming by deciding that it all must teach a lesson, rather than simply entertain children. Sometimes a story is just a story.

** This is a really complex issue. On one hand, I've seen some truly disgusting pairings. Lockheart with a 12 year old Harry, Hagrid with 12. Year old Harry, Dumbledore/Harry, James Potter and Bill Weasley with TODDLER Harry. It's objectively disgusting and morally wrong. But people are right when they say it doesn't harm anyone. Personally, I don't think it's good for you to read that kind of stuff, not necessarily because it will make you more inclined to being a pedophile, but just in a weird mind f**k way. But this is all based on my feelings and no facts. I guess my answer is yes. I don't think sex with minors should be written unless explicitly labeled as rape or non con or dub con. But again I don't have facts to back me up.
