  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

Bruh, it's not because your criticizing their forum and attitudes (and occasionally, for some of their years older behavior, criticism can be appropriate).

It's because you're being a shit not contributing anything to the conversation.
