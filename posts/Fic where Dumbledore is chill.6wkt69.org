I know it's stupid, but I was browsing [[/r/trees][r/trees]] on imgur when I found this post: [[https://imgur.com/r/trees/YYICMab]]\\
I laughed, then I thought, "Could there be a fic where Dumbledore is at least chill?" He doesn't need to smok, just needs to be chill.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the most electrifying man)

Crackfic with focus on Harry, but nice bits of chill Dumbledore.

** Self-promoting here. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610360/1/We-Harry-Potter]]) has a decently chill Dumbledore. Not /that/ chill, but chill enough when dealing with a student who's turned into a literal five-headed dragon.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

** There's certainly more than a few. The times when he's not is when the fic is about Harry or whoever doing their own thing independently of Dumbledore where his interests conflict with Dumbledore's. And that does appear very frequently since fanfiction usually diverges from canon, and in the canon Dumbledore's plan is more or less exactly carried out by Harry and everything works more or less perfectly.

But Dumbledore is especially an antagonist where there is time or dimension travel because Harry and co are on the look out for him. I'd say that the best example of this where Dumbledore is very chill and on their side is linkffn(Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always).

I actually agree that this series has an amazingly cool Dubledore. One of the best, if not the the best, I've ever read. But he's not exactly /chill/ in the way OP seems to be implying.
