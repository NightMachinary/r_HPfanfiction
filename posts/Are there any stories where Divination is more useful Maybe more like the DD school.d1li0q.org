I was wondering if there were any stories where Divination teaches more than just how to read omens/see the future. It would be cool if the class was more like the [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/school/divination][D&D school of magic]] and included things like scrying and dowsing and true seeing.

*** Fair warning, though, it hasn't been updated in over three years, and the last chapter ends on a cliffhanger.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Another classic, apart from Rent-a-Hero is MystShadow's Forging the Sword. Probably one of the inspirations for brainthief actually.

** Shameless self promotion, but my fic Flutter has divination used more often and more in depth. It's certainly useful when it's used, as well.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
