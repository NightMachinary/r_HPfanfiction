/Dear Professor/

/We have chosen to stand by Hogwarts./

/We will still battle for our school's soul. We know what mistakes our fellow Slytherins will make. Voldemort will recruit us, he thinks that we will all help him./

/This a lie/

/We will never bow to the dark mark, we stand with Potter./

/We will do our part as you will do yours./

/In case we don't survive. Please remember that we existed/

/Sincerely the Slytherins of Parsle Sect/
