Also: I think grimmauld place is disgusting and harry takes it upon himself to clean and criticized Remus for how disgusting it is, making harry act like a servant, and having no food


** Just a heads up, I'm pretty sure What's That Fic is a more accurate flair. I haven't read this myself, but I'll look for a bit.

  Harry Potter's temper has always been rather dangerous, but it's not until things start bursting into flames that people realise exactly how fiery it is. And now that the fire's been lit, Harry isn't all that willing to let it be smothered again, in fact he's all for letting it burn. And should the Ministry or Voldemort stand in his way? Well... fire solves everything.

****** Tbh I usually am against dumbledore bashing - I still like a good chunk of them but I generally prefer good dumbledore because ‚Äúbashing‚Äù dumbledore is usually not nearly as good a story as non bashing. It usually just means an OP harry that points out all the bad things dumbledore does And has nothing bad happen and dumbledore is somehow a great genius evil manipulator who sucks at every attempt to beat a 12 year old kid üòÇ. Put it this way - a lot of bashing stories are bad but I like to read them? Idk I just sometimes get on to a dumbledore bashing kick? Some of them are really well written and I like them and a lot are not well written and I also like them. I usually prefer dumbledore stories that are more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù - dumbledore is a flawed individual who may not do everything for the sake of harry but is not evil and is in fact a talented genius.

******* I know that, I just don't think people should judge others for what they like. Dumbledore bashing for me isn't "canon dumbledore is horrible, the devil, and probs killed five orphan's cats" it's like, "oh THIS dumbledore- which is not canon in any way- is a bad person and this fic is so extreme and bends all of canon is such fun ways that dumbledore is a villain"
