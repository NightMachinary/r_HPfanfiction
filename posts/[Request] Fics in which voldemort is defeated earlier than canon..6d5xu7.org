Say, 4th- 5th year at the latest.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]]: [[/spoiler][Voldemort neutralized by the end of Year 1]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]]: Not defeated, but close to neutralized before Year 3 even began

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/][The Accidental Bond]]: Voldemort finished off in the Graveyard

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/][Uncle Quentin's Spy]]: Voldemort finished off before Year 5 was over

*** Is The Accidental Bond the one where near the start (spoiler) they need to touch, or else they feel pain? That one was pretty good, but it got uncomfortably sexual for how young they were, and then they got to the part where they were being forced to have sex so often they were bleeding and then something about the philosophers stone and immortal babies? It just got too weird, I had to stop.

**** No, that's "The Bond of Blood" by Darth Marrs, who likes writing edgy stuffs.

They didn't have sex in "The Accidental Bond" until much much later. The need to touch in this story only lasts 24-48 hours.

***** Oh, is this the one where they move to France? I've read that one twice, but I've given up around that part then too

*** Cheers mate. Gets frustrating when people create these superpowered versions of Harry but the canon plot proceeds relatively uninhibited.

** Linkffn(Blindness) has Voldemlort beaten at the resurection ritual (mostly. Barty survives, grabs The Ring and makes a new Voldie from the shard, but this one is much less competent and is quickly taken care of)

Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool ) has him eliminated before year one begins, with the rest of the story being about Jamie (time traveling Harry-turned-female) trying to start a new life.

Linkffn(A Different Halloween) has Voldie get blown up on All Saints Day (a day or 2 after Halloween) and by a quirk of Horcrux magic and Mother Nature having none of this shit, the Horcruxes are rendered moot, and he permenantly dies that day. The rest of the story is Harry x Hermione fluff (they're kids), Ministry trying to pull itself back together after the war, and Dumbledore believing that V will come back and making terrible plans accordingly.

Hope you enjoy those. Also, in case its not clear/matters, I very quickly got tired of typing in V's name.

** Since the bot is effed, I'm going to try and link these directly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]] is 900k words and finishes on the night of Voldemort's resurrection.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][The Unforgiving Minute]] also defeats Voldemort then, but only focuses on the night of his resurrection [[/spoiler][with the help of a time-traveling Harry]]

Actually worth going through or one of those fics that goes in to mind numbing detail on every insignificant event and bores you to tears?
