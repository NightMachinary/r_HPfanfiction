I always wondered why Hogwarts didn't seem to tutor students that needed help or hire someone to help the students when they had free time.

I mean Neville especially had trouble with Potions class, Ron had a few troubles in classes as well as some other students.

So I was wondering if there were any stories where the teachers, the students or someone else ends up tutoring the students that need help.

Any rating is fine, would rather be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing, don't like it. (Unless it's like Percy).


** No one has any? That's a shame.

** My fic has tutoring in it. But it's not the main plot. The OC tutors some of the younger years and she ends up through a series of events tutoring Neville. They slowly start to like each other etc. I do have a bit of chapters where the main parts are tutoring, but the fic is still a WIP. It's romance OC/ Neville pairing.

Tutoring deal takes place in chapter 7.
