** I'm a sucker for worldbuilding, and all of the fics I enjoy execute it well to varying extents depending on the necessity. But above all else, a sparse and seamless seasoning of new material is easier to savour, and R-dude handles this better in a few chapters than some have attempted in half-a-million words.

*** You might enjoy the Tamblin books then. As they go on they add more to the setting but they introduce it slowly and try to be very canon compliant.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
