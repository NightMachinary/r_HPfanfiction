Happy New Year! Who wants some 2020 AO3 HP Fanfiction stats?

[[https://www.futurephotons.io/shipwatch/img/activity2020-final.png][AO3 HP Fanfiction Totals]]: 65,243 Harry Potter fanfictions were posted to AO3 in 2020. That's an 80% increase over 2019.

[[https://www.futurephotons.io/shipwatch/img/totals2020-final.png][Total Fanfictions for Most Common Pairings]]: In August of 2020, Hermione/Ron overtook Harry/Snape to become the all-time 3rd most commonly-occurring HP ship on AO3. As far as I know, this is the first time since the launch of AO3 that a new ship has entered the top three. Draco/Harry continues to hold an ever-increasing lead at the top spot, with Remus/Sirius in a comfortable second.

Here are the 25 most popular AO3 ships from 2020:

  Voldemort has been going fruitlessly back in time for several cycles to try and prevent Harry Potter from winning the war, but nothing works. At last he decides that, since Harry only really won because of his friendships with Ron and Hermione, he will seduce Molly Prewett and ensure that she doesn't give birth to Ron Weasley. Genius!

** I find it interesting how different some of the stats become when only factoring in new fics. I maintain a somewhat similar list myself, but for top30 Ao3 HP ships of all time. [[http://home.fiq.se/top30.txt]]

Speaking of stats, any idea what happened with Remadora at some point in the earlier half of 2020? Between early January and June, the total fics with the ship went /down/ by 215. I have no idea why this is.

EDIT: According to my own tracking, Romione overtook Snarry in November. Are you tracking "restricted" fics (those who need you to login to see)? Because I do, which would explain the discrepancy.

*** Interesting. All of the data I have was scraped during October 2020 and later so I would have missed that. Maybe there was a tagging issue in the AO3 backend and something was registering as Remus/Tonks that shouldn't have and when they fixed it the number dropped?

***** Ao3's readership is very disproportionately LGBT, if that's what you're trying to get at. It's called “archive of our own” for a reason. (Although that's probably not exactly what the name is referring to). It's also common for female authors to write slash, and you'd also find readers skew female more on Ao3 than other sites.
