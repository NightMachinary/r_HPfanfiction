I used to think so to. But the series is told from Harry's perspective and he is more likely to side with Ron over things than Hermione and is often irritated by Hermione. In the third book for example Hermione looses her friends for a few months and is all alone with her work while Harry and Ron continue to have fun together. People call Hermione a know it all so her intelligence is often treated as an annoying trait. And Xenophilius Lovegood does call her narrow minded so Hermione is called out her flaws like Harry and Ron are. I just feel if Ron and Hermione are in a fight Harry will usually side with Ron and Hermione will be a little cut of from everyone.


** Definitely feels like out of Ron and Hermione, it's the latter who's "proven right" more times than not while Ron's character is forced to retread the same character beats over and over and left as more "useless" at times.

His big quidditch success is still made to be down to her.

*** The only Quidditch success down to her is her helping him get on the team. Otherwise the two cups he wins are all down to him. But Ron had a different character arc to Hermione. He had to learn to overcome his insecurities in order to become the best version of himself. I really like Ron's character development and don't see it as him getting the short end of the stick compared to Hermione

No, I don't buy "the horcrux affected him the worst" - why not? Because they don't say why!

It is not like Ron had a worse childhood than Harry (who wasn't affected much!) or Hermione! Yes, he might not have had as much money as Hermione, but frankly if anybody should have been affected it should have been Harry!

** I think all the Hermione hate in this sub is because people blend the fanfiction Hermione with the book Hermione, and lonely teenage nerd girls are very likely to use her as a self-insert. And also because people act like the ways in which she is wrong are "less wrong" or portrayed in a "less bad light" than the ways Harry or Ron are wrong or bad.

Like, people make comments here about Hermione being "too smart" or "right all the time". Even though a) there's entire chunks of the narrative dedicated to her being misguided (SPEW), she makes silly mistakes (cat hair?), she spreads herself too thin and doesn't confide in anyone often (all of book 3?), she obsesses over books even when something requires more practical knowledge...

These are bad things. But for some reason even though /basically everyone agrees they are bad things/ and even though /the narrative presents them as bad/, people act as though it's some sort of unpopular opinion or crazy deduction that they are bad things, and like the narrative "coddles" Hermione because her big strength (knowing shit) is actually useful (as it should be).

Like, what would a situation in which /Hermione is not "coddled"/ look like?

She's wrong more often? Okay. So like, her one big thing? Her one big skill? "A situation in which Hermione is not a M a R y S u E is one in which the actual reason why Ron and Harry started to hang out with her is removed"?

Because they didn't like her in their first year. And they barely seemed to care in their second year until the potion debacle. And they were separated enough from her in their third year for her to be able to time-travel secretly for most of it. Not to mention that Hermione /is an insufferable know-it-all/. If the audience isn't thinking that at some point it would be /bad writing/.

Hermione is more isolated (as you noted, with Harry and Ron both being more likely to take each other's side), is less charismatic, is less "fun"... All the reasons people complain about her are ways she isn't treated as perfect or held up by the narrative. Because if she was, those things wouldn't be /freaking self-evident/.

If you remove or reduce her /one big plot-useful thing/... You're left with a person /Harry and Ron wouldn't want to hang out with for long/. Someone who is obsessive and exhausting and /boring/ to them. Who doesn't share their hobbies or their interests or even on some level their values.

A scenario in which Hermione isn't "coddled" is either one in which Hermione is a radically different character with a different personality, one in which they start hanging out after like 3rd year once she's mellowed out a little, or one in which... She's just not fucking there at all.

Which is what this feels like sometimes. It feels like people just don't think Hermione should be there. Which feels a bit like a slap in the face to all the young nerd girls who had Hermione as their /first and only/ actual character that was /like them/. Which is a shrinking population as "the nerd girl friend" becomes more and more of a stock character in children's media, but we shouldn't forget that it /is/ a population. And that Hermione was a /big deal/ to that population. Which is why so many unskilled teenage girls kept writing more and more and more of her, in fanfics, poorly. Because they /needed/ that.

*** It's not that she shouldn't be there. Fanfiction that removes Hermione tends to be bad.

She's top 3 in every book when it comes to narrative importance. But her character arc is very unsatisfying.

Hermione tends to be right for all the wrong reasons in the books. Sirius sent the broom, though it wasn't dangerous and she didn't even voice the reason for her concern. Scabbers wasn't eaten, but her cat should have been controlled. Trying to jump the gun by tricking house-elves, contrary to long-term progress wasn't right. Scarring Marietta is not alright. Confunding McLaggen so Ron got on the team wasn't right. The Half-Blood Prince's potions notes weren't anything bad. Kidnapping Rita Skeeter wasn't completely right either, but Rita was an adult who was spying on children.

The difference is that Hermione's negative actions tend to directly affect other people. Each of these incidents probably should have been addressed.

#+end_quote

Isn't that just saying that she has a good intuition, but when she tries to back things up with facts she sometimes gets things wrong? She feels that Crookshanks couldn't have eaten scabbers, but due to her lacking social skills, can't put all the reasons into words? I get that way sometimes, I have a mental list of reasons for something, but when it's time to list those reasons sometimes the important ones get left out. She might have a long list of niggles and intuitions that tell her that this couldn't have happened, but in the heat of an augment she can't get them all out?

***** Hermione was definitely right about her cat not eating Scabbers, but she was dismissing her cat attacking the rat. It was never about the rat being dead. Hagrid then tells Ron and Harry that they're wrong for being annoyed with her about the pet, which just dismisses the issue entirely. She was apologetic, but I would have rather the trio work out the issue themselves.

Book 6 is a bit exaggerated, but should still be taken into account. I chalk it up to hormones pushing her to the extreme.

I don't know. I actually enjoy reading her elsewhere in the books, with the Pince/Filch joke scene making me laugh especially, but it just feels like whenever she does something wrong it gets glossed over.

Her friendship with Harry is great, but I feel like the books don't let her learn from her mistakes like Ron and Harry.

Edit: Fanfiction has colored my opinion definitely though. I really shouldn't get on these types of threads.I used to love her character about as much as I loved Harry when I was younger, but going back to read the book and rejoining fanfiction,I looked at what she did (like Marietta) and thought "Huh, that's a bit mean." instead of "Oh that's so badass." like I used to.

I think part of the problem is that Ron might not have accepted an apology without that outside nudge. Scabbers was one of the few things that his brothers didn't have, so was important. Harry I think is trying to be non-confrontational, and would I think, just follow the lead of whichever of his friends got to him first.

#+end_quote

Part of the thing here is that looking at these situations with a slightly different light than you do, she can come across as right to some people. Other times when she is presented as wrong, it is framed more as a joke, with her actions with SPEW being treated more as comic relief than actual plot.

Edit:

I think part of it is just how you look at these things. For example the scars, that's not book canon. That's Rowling in an interview saying that she had scars there because ROWLING didn't like Marietta. Whether HERMIONE would have made SNEAK permanent is another question...

In some ways yes, in some ways no. She still has to act as the research and exposition character throughout the series, but she does grow in otherways. She gets better at quick thinking, learns not to overwork herself too much, and does get more caring towards her (small) circle of friends.

What do you mean? Do you want Harry complaining about her all the time in his internal dialogue? He is annoyed at her whenever it does affect her, like the broom or the potions book. And Ron is pissed when it affects him or Harry. How is anything being glossed over there?

And even if her mistakes aren't mentioned as strongly as you want them to be, Harry is the narrator so your problem is actually with Harry being unable to be annoyed with her for long. Or with anyone except Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape for that matter.

Regarding her learning from her mistakes, we never see her perspective. We don't know if the polyjuice disaster led to her being more careful or if seeing what she did to Marietta led to her having doubts about it and subsequently deciding to put more sensible punishments in her magical contracts. And it's not like she doesn't have any character development at all.

And the mistakes she makes that actually matter (like the disaster that is the horcrux hunt in book 7) are shared by her friends as well.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Scarring Marietta is not alright.
#+end_quote

Indeed, another thing wrong with Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  Confunding McLaggen so Ron got on the team wasn't right.
#+end_quote

I think this is the first one that the narrative paints as like, silly fun, instead of something that is wrong or fucked up. And you are right, it wasn't right. So I will give you this one.

#+begin_quote
  The Half-Blood Prince's potions notes weren't anything bad.
#+end_quote

They kind of were, though? Like, it was on some level cheating to just use better instructions, and even if it wasn't, they probably should have gone to McGonagall about it. Harry even wound up using a ridiculously dangerous spell out of the book because of it.

#+begin_quote
  Kidnapping Rita Skeeter wasn't completely right either, but Rita was an adult who was spying on children.
#+end_quote

That one struck me as fair. Ideally, you would just actually tell an authority and pursue legal action, but that's not really something easily available to them, and they are all basically starting-high-school age at that point.

#+begin_quote
  The difference is that Hermione's negative actions tend to directly affect other people. Each of these incidents probably should have been addressed.
#+end_quote

The difference from what? From Harry getting or almost-getting people killed? From Snape being a dick at almost all times and in almost all places? From Dumbledore... Dumbledoring? Every single character in this story does bad things that affect people negatively, with the possible exception of like... Neville, maybe?

At this point it just seems kind of unclear to me what's going on. "Hermione is always right and perfect" is not compatible with "here are a bunch of times in canon where Hermione was wrong and non-perfect". Is it that she's not "punished" enough for her actions? Because that's not really how life works. And even if she "should be punished more", we're talking about /the one mudblood/ in the team of people fighting a war where mudbloods are being persecuted. I mean... come on.

For me, it's about her lacking any consideration for other people's agency, independence, and point of view. If someone doesn't follow the same logical thinking/interests she does, she immediately dismisses them (Luna, Lavender, etc.). She is very quick to demand ethical conduct from others but in canon she is not held accountable for the unethical things she does (the plot to kidnapping and impersonate Crabbe and Goyle, erasing her parents' memories, etc.). She's right and even when she's wrong, she's right. She is coddled by canon as Hogwarts for the most parts caters to her strengths (logic, memorization, traditional testing) while either dismissing any classes that show her weaknesses (divination, flying) or not including them at all (arts, athletics, discussion based learning).

Percy? Hagrid, who is nice to almost everyone? Who else? I think even Dumbledore finds her a little annoying. Everyone else seems to basically tolerate her at best, or be perpetually annoyed by her.

I think part of the reason why people feel like she's not getting negative social feedback is that she doesn't get a lot of /change/ in how people treat her after she does fucked up things. But that's not just "because people ignore her bad behaviour", or even /mostly/ that.

Did we read the same books?

Hogwarts is a place where having your heart in the right place matters more than knowing stuff. Divination is not "dismissed" by the narration, almost every prophecy basically anyone makes winds up coming true in some fashion. Hermione dismisses it, but Hermione is also /wrong about it/. Flying is the biggest fucking thing in Hogwarts, and everyone is obsessed with Quidditch, not to mention that it becomes a huge plot point basically every single year in one way or another. So... how is that dismissed?

And... who thinks Hermione is "an idol to follow"? Yes, Hermione is fantastic, just like Harry is and just like Ron is, but Hermione is probably the most miserable out of the three, and the most miserable /due to her own bullshit/ out of the three at that. Harry has more terrible shit going on, obviously, but he's also far more resilient than she is. With her... There's always a problem, there's always some next thing to obsess over, it's not /healthy./ It's part of why so many young nerdy "social dimwit" girls identify so hard with her, because she has /their problems too/.

This once again just looks to me like "a bunch of 12-to-16 year old girls are happy to see someone like them presented in a good light, and they get a little overenthusiastic, and instead of ignoring that people find reasons to be angry about it".

Nobody with some amount of critical thinking skills could see a character that is very persistently being presented as /annoying/ and go "yes, this book is saying that person should be emulated in every aspect". Nobody wants to be that. It is, once again, part of why so many people identify with her. Because they are also young, and socially inept, and "annoying", and that is a very painful position to be in. Seeing someone who is like that, but also... important, and good at at least /some/ things? Well, it matters.

**** I would disagree with you that she is static and doesn't show growth. I mentioned it already in this thread but Hermione signals her story arc at the end of the first book. "Books and cleverness-there are more important things-friendship and bravery." Hermione as a person shows tremendous growth in Year 1 alone.

She develops on this revelation throughout the books but she also has setbacks where she falls into her old habits and insecurities. Rowling did her no favors by having her have a massive setback in HBP for narrative reasons.

People who complain about Hermione and Ron getting a 'free pass' in canon for their flaws ignore the fact that the story is told from a narrator who never had friends before, grew up around truly awful people, and is very good at sussing out the good people from the bad. Ron and Hermione are very good people with flaws. Harry, our narrator, moves on from the bad whenever he can because he appreciates the good.

** Perhaps not. There are several times when Hermione is portrayed in a slightly negative light, but then again, far less than either Harry or Ron. She always has an answer, she is always correct in her deductions, she does all the magic throughout the series, she solves all the puzzles etc.

However obnoxious she is in the books, she is way more obnoxious in the films. Where all lines of Ron are given to her, she performs way more magic than in the books and she is played by Emma Watson. Compared to the other 2 leads, she is a goddess. You must acknowledge that those facts also colour the perception of the character, even when considering pure book canon.

Overall, I think, that Hermione is definitely a self-insert, even if not the main character, she is the voice of reason and magical solution to the vast majority of the obstacles.

No, it doesn't. You literally say she has all the answers...does all the magic...she is always correct in her deductions. All of those things are objectively wrong. She gets a lot of things right but she also screws up. Just like Harry. Just like Ron. Half Blood Prince is basically dedicated to Hermione getting most things wrong and acting poorly.

Hermione is the most driven and logical of the three so it makes absolute sense for her to make the most preparations and try to cover for as many contingencies as possible. That does not make her right all the time. Or mean that she has all the answers. It means she is the most prepared. Harry very clearly came up with the answers that ultimately defeated Voldemort...with Hermione and Ron's help.

It's clear you are of the opinion that Harry would never have survived without Hermione's help. I agree. It's also true that Hermione would have never survived without Harry's help. She literally would have died two months into her first year if not for Harry. Maybe even more importantly she would have never grown as a person without their help. She says it herself in the first book. Books and cleverness...there are more important things.

***** As I tell people, there's a line between confidence and arrogance, and movie Hermione is super arrogant.

Hermione growing as a character in the books was disappointing though. It was always treated as amazing when she broke the rules every year, even though that was an established character trait in book 1.

Hermione has a ton of good qualities in the books, but her mistakes get downplayed quite a bit. If Ron attacked Hermione with birds after the yule ball, would he be put in a sympathetic light? If Hedwig kept hunting Crookshanks, would it be dismissed by Hermione? If she got some sort of unfair competitive academic advantage, would she dismiss it (/cough,/ time turner, /cough/)? If Harry gave Malfoy permanent scars, would it be downplayed?

So, yes I feel she was coddled, but not to the point of fanon. And it's still better than the movies.

****** Admittedly, most of the issue you mention are due to inherent sexism. When a girl does something awful, it's cute and funny. When a boy does the same, it's a crime. Which has been the cultural norm for thousands of years. It's not easy to just shrug off. But we're not discussing anthropology here.

Of course, you're right. I disliked book Hermione, for being an inconsistent and pretty awful character. Film Hermione is way, way, way worse. Fanon is whatever the author wants, so it's difficult to quantify.

There are very few stories in fanon where Hermione is treated fairly. As an actual human being. Most of them are Harry/Ginny or Harry/Other, since it eases the pressure off the author in making Hermione perfect. I enjoy those stories the most. Where Hermione is just an intelligent girl and not a near perfect embodiment of the author.

** At this point, due to all the HP fanfiction I've consumed, as well as the long number of years since I've last touched any of the canon literature and films, I can't state with complete confidence what canon Hermione's flaws are, though I'm pretty certain she has always been a loyal (without being fanatical) friend to Harry (much better than Ron!) and the most analytical of the trio (I gag whenever I read or hear "The Golden Trio"). While she does that her irrationality and feelings displace her mental faculties occasionally, such as telling McGonagall about his new Firebolt and trying to free the Hogwarts house elves without first investigating why the creatures are the way they are, she has a much better head on her shoulders compared to her two, ugh, friends---an uninspired idiot who strives to be average and a disgusting slob with a titanic inferiority complex.

I don't take canon Harry seriously, because he is a complete r*t**d. Instead of trying to soak up knowledge like a sponge the second he learns of the Magical World, he limits his worldview to Hogwarts. Instead of building connections, alliances, and meaningful relationships, he grasps onto Ron, that great black hole of mediocrity, and Hermione like lifelines, refusing to venture beyond his pathetic two connections. And instead of building up his magical knowledge, skills, and power like a madman, partly since he knows Voldemort is constantly hounding his scrawny ass, he stuffs his face with treacle tarts, develops terminal stage of Hero Complex Cancer, and is content to be a mediocre wizard. The only reasons he manages to kill Voldemort are due a combination of deus ex machina and the series named after him.

He latches onto Ron and Hermione because he has had no friends growing up due to his abusive childhood. Why shouldn't he have a good time at Hogwarts like a normal kid.

**** Harry attended Hogwarts for six academic years. I can forgive him for just trying to immerse himself during the first year. Yet after his first year, during which he had another near mortal experience with Voldemort, what does he do to prepare himself, knowing, at the very least, that Voldemort is determined to kill him? Nothing.

As for friends, I prefer quality over primacy. So what he encountered Ron first? While loyalty is an important trait to have in a friend, underneath it all, friends are those who are willing and able to constantly make beneficial exchanges with one another. While Hermione passes that test, the reverse is not true. All he does is leech off of her academic work (and shame on her for indulging this unethical and detrimental habit of his), a habit that is no doubt worsened by the presence of Ron. And speaking of Ron, he brings nothing to the table, but because Harry just so happened to meet him first, Ron has a perverse stranglehold on Harry's broken definition of friendship, blinding him from making better friends. Of course, this doesn't excuse Harry from being a complacent fool, refusing to put in the work to better himself, waiting for the author to gift him crucial information from conveniently helpful others.

On the contrary, it's because the series is so lacking in strategic and tactical complexities that I haven't bothered to read the books and watch the films for a long, long time. Rowling's first generation of HP readers grew up parallel to the series, so the series should've evolved the world's politics and the protagonist's methods for problem-solving. Instead, good old Harry, like the cannon fodder he is, confronts Voldemort for the last time and manages to vanquish his enemy through the powers of (severely limited) friendship and ass-pull.

He is meant to be an average kid who everyone can relate to. I can understand why Harry latches onto Ron,. Ron gives him a family and loyalty is a great trait to have in a friend. You choose your friends as a kid on the basis of who you like and have fun with, not who will bring benefits to you.

I find Harry's walk into the forest very powerful and would prefer that to some strategic victory which would feel so unrealistic as Harry is just some average kid.

****** I agree that fighting terrorists should not be a pre-teen's job, yet reality doesn't give a flying f*ck about that notion. Either one relies on someone else to accomplish something, or one does it themself. The adults are, for the most part, useless. Corrupt politicians and officials like Fudge are too stupid and willingly ignorant to nip the insurgency in its bud. Lawfully competent ones like Bones have their hands tied. And Dumbledore and his bird-watching group are too passive, only gathering intelligence when they should be assassinating Voldemort's supporters. So in light of this atmosphere, whining that Harry is only a kid becomes an excuse for inaction, not to mention this complacency actively jeapordises his mortality on a yearly basis.

Why would anyone want to experience a protagonist who is merely average? Reading about a character with little mental growth throughout the series is not recommended for a reader past the the initial feverish phase where every element of the fictional universe is considered to be brilliant.

Again, Harry latching onto Ron like a leech during their first year is understandable, not so for the subsequent years.

Harry walking to his death in the final battle of the series is not powerful; it's stupid. He just blindly trusted the words of a man with a penchant for keeping secrets and telling half-truths regarding his embedded horcrux. Instead of, you know, researching on every viable method of destroying the horcrux without sacrificing his own life, he blindly lays down his life for a society who are so gullible, ignorant, and fickle in their beliefs.
