:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I've been searching for this fic for a while now and I seem unable to find it. Here the parts I remember: - Harry x Fleur - Harry plays Quidditch professionally - It was on FFN last time I read it - I think the spelling wasn't atrocious, but that could just be me, remembering it wrong - I want to say that it is 'Harry Potter and the Veela' but I'm pretty sure that he wasn't a 'precog'


** When i hear pro quidditch i think TheEndless7, but while they've written harry fleur, their closes to that is harry x Gabrielle.

********* Yes, QWC is definitely the fic of mine I hate the most, right [[/u/Rpeh]] ....there is no other fic I wrote that I absolutely detest. None at all.

That being said if they made a movie out of it I'd probably enjoy it. But I have no standards.

********** Let us think... Lettuce alphabet epistles. It's like there's something stopping me from focusing on some other story.

Shrugs.

But as for QWC, I don't see how any story where Harry and Ginny fall out while both playing pro Quidditch could possibly work. Pfft. You'd need to be some kind of moron to even try!

************** You'll never manage it. Especially while your beta is actively trying to drain your enthusiasm.

If you were even going to try you'd have to make obvious shortcuts like reusing an OC from a previous story, and you're far too proud to ever do anything like that.
