12 year olds do not use this word. 50 year olds do not use this word. Hell, even my ninety fucking six year old grandmother didn't use this word. I don't know if it's just me or not, but why does it seem like every story seems to feel the need to use it in every other sentence? There are dozens of ways to get around using it and most of them will let your story keep going without making the characters look like the 14 year old denizens of [[/r/atheism]].

I'm sorry if this post isn't constructive, but I really needed to rant at something. I just got through reading a story where an 8 year who grew up in a muggle orphanage used this word constantly.


** It's British, and it's still in common usage. It may strike the American ear oddly, but it's perfectly acceptable and unremarkable in British prose and conversation. It's not a posh word, merely an idiom that's apparently unfamiliar to you.

In speech, it's not really all that noticeable unless it's drawled or pronounced with deliberate pomposity. It fleets by rather quickly when spoken by someone accustomed to it.

Also, I wouldn't be surprised if British language conventions get Americanized when a book is published over here, similar to the way the 'u' is dropped from colour and s's converted to z's. It means we (in the US) don't necessarily see it pop up in American editions, but I've certainly encountered it a lot in British literature.

** I use the word whilst. Not incessantly, but it's definitely a part of my vocabulary - and I'm surprised to hear that using it is rare.

***** And when did I ever say that there are only two countries that speak English?

I do admit I could have specified that no, there are also other countries. But when others are already talking as if it were where the author of this thread was from, that makes it one, and the UK is because I happen to know what it is like there, which makes it two. Adding other countries to the list, in this case, would only have been a silly version of “political correctness”.

So really, while I do accept your point, your jab back at me was done with a rusty knife. Please use a clean one the next time you try for I can accept verbal jabs but that one was just ... unhygienic.

Edit: And yes, I am jesting; it's basically a jab back with an inflatable hammer.

** Quick assessment: it's used once by Lockhart (book2), once narratively during Harry's blow-up at Grimmauld Place, once by Dumbledore in describing the protection offered at the Dursleys (book 5) and again narratively during Narcissa and Bellatrix' visit to Snape's house (book 6).

It's a Britishism, slightly on the pretentious side.

and it fits right in with the concentrated pretentious snobbery of the scene.

I really doubt it's a britishism. I lived over there for a year I didn't hear anyone use the word whilst.

**** Keep in mind that because wizards live longer lives, children may frequently be in contact with very old relatives and other old people who use more formal language, making it easy to pick up older words themselves. Also anyone who reads might use words they've read in a book when they're trying to sound intelligent.

** It's not out of character for someone who reads a lot. Voracious readers pick up all sorts of anachronisms. It's perfectly reasonable for Hermione, known for her obsessive reading, to use words that aren't commonly used, many of which would be jarring if used by Ron.

Actually, come to think of it, one thing that probably would happen that I don't generally see is Hermione correcting her classmates when they try to use more sophisticated vocabulary, but end up doing so incorrectly.

** When I was twelve, I used the word "whilst." However, I was also a bibliophile, so I agree seeing particularly young children (eight-year-olds) use advanced vocabulary is jarring and poor characterization. But I will disagree that "whilst" is obsolete.

** While I'll admit that even in my experience (as a Brit) that 'while' sees more use than 'whilst' I don't think I'd so much as blink at seeing it in a passage.

Or, more formally,

Whilst I can accept, even in my own experience, that 'while' sees more every-day usage than 'whilst', I do not believe the presence of it would be enough to draw me from the narrative of the story.

Whilst simply felt right in the second sentence, while while felt more at home in the first. The first employed contractions and other in-formalities and the second did not. But it's true, I would not expect an eleven year-old to use it all that regularly; unless they are mimicking an adult.

** Home Counties UK here, I'd say it's very common usage. It's not an age or socio-economic identifier either. In fact I used it about 3 times whilst at work this morning.

** Hearing it spoken is jarring for certain, especially by younger people, but reading it doesn't bother me. Granted, good authors are able to keep speech patterns consistent with the age of the characters, but you're reading fanfiction. Do what the rest of us do and learn to ignore all the mistakes so you can enjoy the extra 9% that is actually readable (1% gold, 90% absolute shit).
