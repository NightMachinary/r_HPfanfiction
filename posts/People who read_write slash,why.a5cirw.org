I'm not homophobic or anything(some of my closest friends are gay.)Ot doesn't really make sense to me.They are all either sexualizing a platonic friendship or pairing enemies together.It's sort of disgusting tbh.It's also changing big elements of characters(their sexuality) to make it work.


** I think, historically in fanfiction, (eg Star Trek zines with Kirk/Spock), there were 2 reasons: lack of developed female characters to write stories with, and , like other commenters said, finding a space you can make your art seen at as a marginalized person.

*** The thing with the HP universe is that a lot of the male characters which are shipping favourites for slash are war criminals, human trash, murderous scum, racially motivated terrorists, magical wannabe Nazis (take your pick).

You are basically left with the Weasleys, Neville, Dean and the name only background chars.

Whereas eliminating the female scum leaves you Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Tonks, Fleur, Cho, characters like Lavender, Parvati, Andromeda, Padma, Gabrielle (once she is 16), Katie, Angelina and Alicia, and the complete background ones like Susan Bones, Madam Hooch or Demelza Robins.

Tl;dr: Most gay ships involve scum, most of the scum is male therefore more female options are available (and offer more variety).

** A lot of people started reading fanfiction during the three-year delay between when GoF and OotP were published (it felt like we were waiting forever for JKR at the time!). As a result, some characters' sexuality simply hadn't been addressed yet. It wasn't clear whether, for example, Lupin and Sirius were straight or gay.

So while I love Lupin/Tonks, wolfstar is still a beloved headcanon to me because I read it so much, way before we even met Tonks.

Also, while I'm not gay, I can imagine that it gets pretty frustrating (for those who are) to see straight pairing after straight pairing in every. single. fandom. Fanfiction is probably a way to bring the romances you'd like to see for once in your life into the fandoms you love.

Over 90% of humans are straight. Assuming heterosexuality is the right call ~95 times out of 100 (assuming 2.5 homo- and 2.5 bisexuals, which is in the upper end of queerness ratios).

This says little about the individual, but homosexuality is vastly overrepresented in fanfics (39% for gays on Archive as opposed to 1-3% IRL).

Hagrid is half giant, so his parents count. Fleur is part Veela, so again it's definitely happened in her family. Remus may or may not (depending on how you categorise werewolves) be human, but that doesn't seem to stop Tonks.

If sex between a human and a non-human is canonically happening, same sex stuff between humans is nothing by comparison.

Also, no matter how you want to envision it, Hagrid was not the result of regular sex due to the massive size difference as it would be quite impossible for Hagrid's father to actually have sex with a giantess.

** I'm more frustrated with romantic relationships (mostly the smut aspect) being shoe horned into most plots. I don't care who's involved, just please acknowledge that less is more. Romantic/sexual relationships are less common than friendships, family relationships, and other relationship types like mentor/mentee. I don't understand why people insist on shipping enemies, friends, teachers with students, etc. Just because two people are close doesn't mean they're going to sleep together, and strong feelings (positive or negative) are rarely because of sexual tension.

Edit: The amount of quality canon featuring heterosexual characters is a lot more than quality canon work with LGBT representation. Writing fan fiction is not easy - it takes time and commitment. I think what happens is that authors wanting to see LGBT characters in fiction have more reason to actually put the effort into writing.

As for pairing enemies together: When I first started reading HP fanfiction I tried to avoid those stories. But when I was searching FFN for a specific character tag I realized that those sorts of fics were ubiquitous. Eventually I gave up and started reading them to see what I was missing. I found some that were surprisingly excellent, so now I don't mind it at all.

Het vs. slash pairings: From my perspective all smut scenes are equally absurd regardless of the gender of the participants. I typically skim-read to get past those parts, so I don't care what their genders are as long as the personalities and emotions throughout the rest of the story are well written.

**** *Sturgeon's law*

Sturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Theodore Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

**** That law is exactly the sort of bad unfounded pseudo-statistical thinking that should have no place in any discussion. If both het and slash is 90% crap then there's nothing meaningful to be said. But what if it's 70% for one and 93% for the other? What if it's 80 and 65? What if it's different kinds of crap? Then we can expound on that and draw conclusions.

Things have degrees.

Edit: I'd imagine that not as much gen suffers from oversexualisation as slash or het, for example.

That's kind of the point. Anyone can say "most of x is bad," just as you have done, but without actually going through every single fic in each genre to tally them up, any claim like that is just an unfounded assumption based upon personal bias.

**** Sturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Theodore Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

** I don't care for slash in this fandom but read a lot of slash otherwise. Personally I think it has something to do with many relationships between friends (mostly male) being written as deeper and more meaningful and lasting than romantic relationships in canon (again, not this fandom). Adding a sexual relationship to it is optional imo, also, if two ppl (men) love each other so much that they would do anything for each other and die for each other, can basically read each other's minds, why shouldn't they also be "together" as opposed to the often horribly superficial relationships that they are depicted to be in with women?
