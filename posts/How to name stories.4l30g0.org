So I'm trying to write some plot bunnies that have been running around my head and I was wondering if you guys could give me tips on how you would title a story, just general tips so that I can title my stories regardless of plot and genre.


** Your story title doesn't have to point towards the plot, although it's an option - for example, 'The Lie I've Lived' is vague but applies to the plot revealed in the first few chapters; 'Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time' is much more direct. However, you should avoid intentionally misleading the reader. If your story is about fighting, politics and intrigue, then calling it 'The Days of Blood' or 'Right Word, Wrong Time' is fitting, and calling it 'Imago' or 'Disjunct' is fine, but calling it 'Moonlight and Roses' or 'A Soft Hand, Reaching Out' is bad.

As long as the story title wouldn't push away readers looking for the genre that you're writing, it's fine. I don't read romance stories, so I wouldn't check out a story called 'Moonlight and Roses' regardless of the tags on it, because there are so many options that it's easier to just scroll down than look for tags and the summary. However, if I can't tell the genre from the title - and it sounds interesting or at least not awful - then I'll skim the summary and tags, and decide based on that.

** "Untitled fic #" is how I organize my writing folder. I can crank out a few thousand words per day but rarely does anything get long enough to warrant a title, let alone publishing.

I'm a fan of 1-3 word titles for things I read. Doesn't need to be complicated, just catchy enough that Google can find it again when I forget. 'Character Name and The Plot or Object' is way too common and just a canon rehash habit.

** Naming stories for me is weird. Sometimes it's the very first thing I do, sometimes the very last. When all else fails, I usually just pick a song or album title that I like and pop it on even if it has nothing to do with the story. For stories that don't get published, they're sorted by pairing in sequential order, so for example, "Euphoria" started out in life as "Harry/Fleur idea 9" while my most current Harry + Daphne entry is "Harry/Daphne idea 32"
