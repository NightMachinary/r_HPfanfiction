** ...nah. He's arguably on the same level of /power/, depending on how he's written in relation to other Dark Wizards --- he definitely is from a Muggle perspective --- but never mind his mangled, charred soul, his motivations and psyche are all too human to count as "eldritch". Physically, red eyes and no nose aren't going to cut it, either; there were /World War I soldiers/ who came back more deformed than him.

** Not in the traditional sense, with a canon based Voldemort. Closest representation I've seen is that Voldemort is a Lich.

That said, nothing is stopping you from writing something where Voldemort slowly shifts further and further into eldritch horror territory. If I were to try to do that, first, I wouldn't tell any of the readers your goal. The unknown is what makes the horror terrifying. Second, the Horocruxes are the obvious way to go about his trasformation. "The real reason why splitting your soul is horrific is that the more you split your soul, the more you become a target for /them/." along with something like "Perhaps you can get away with one, maybe two horocruxes without drawing /their/ attention, but 7? That's madness." Toss in a generous helping of came back wrong, and stare into the abyss.

*** I overheard some people in a coffee shop agreeing he was but i wanted to point out that eldritch abominations definition cause insanity just by viewing but the woman's argument and my lack of sleep over the past few days made her argument rather persuasive.

** Came here to say no. "The Eldritch Abomination is a type of creature defined by its disregard for the natural laws of the universe as we understand them. They are grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. ... Reality itself warps around them."
