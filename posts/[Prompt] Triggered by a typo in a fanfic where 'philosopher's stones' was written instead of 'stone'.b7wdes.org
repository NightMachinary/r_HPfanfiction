Had this idea that the Flamels aside from living long lives, have access to various dimensions through the philosopher's stones. They entrusted one to Dumbledore so they could go in and out of canon HP's dimension. With its destruction, they will 'die' in that dimension hence the need to "settle affairs" with their leftover Elixir of Life since they could never access the dimension anymore.


** Well, this didn't go anywhere I was expecting. When I read the title I was thinking "euphemism for testicles".

Your idea is more interesting, probably.

*** That's where I was heading, too. Imagine how wrinkled a set of 665-year-old knackers would be!
