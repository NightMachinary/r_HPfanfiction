Prongs is lonely, and after the dementor incident at Privet he decides that Harry should appreciate him more! Like jeez kid, saved your butt but you don't even give me a carrot? Rude. Whatever, he's not gonna let Harry vanish him this time.

When the Order come to pick Harry up, they walk into a large, glowing stag pracing around a muggle living room and munching on vegetables. Harry gives him the vegetables.


** Harry: How many times?

Umbridge: As long as it takes for the message takes to -ahem- /sink in/

/-Gets gored by Prongs' antlers-/

Harry: As much as I appreciate that, this is going to cause problems.

  What if James used his head when Voldemort came that fateful night? Inspired by a Tumblr post I saw yesterday.
