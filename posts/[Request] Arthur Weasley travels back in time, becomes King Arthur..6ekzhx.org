**** I guess it works if we think of coincidences, not the time travel thing.

I think it would be brilliant if he was really King Arthur that was transported to the future, or he "came back in times of great need". It would explain his fascination with muggles, since they changed much more than wizards. And two of his children bare names of those close to him(Percival and Ginevra(kind of like Guinevere)). Though naming his daughter after his ex wife is a bit weird, but Arthur Weasley is a bit eccentric.

** I mean, the Burrow IS in Devon. And Ottery St. Catchpole IS near Exeter, one of the potential locations of Camelot. /Totally/ circumstantial at best, but a fun connection to play on.

*** Probably one of Rowling's thematic things - the Weasleys have a lot of king Arthur in them, or just names of royalty in the past:

Ginny/Guinevere Percy/Percival Arthur Bill/William Charlie/Charles Fred/Frederick George .. And then there's plain old Ronald

**** From the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley][wiki]], so Ronald does in fact still keep with the King Arthur theme.

#+begin_quote
  Ronald is the Scottish form of the Scandinavian name Ragnvald, which was derived from the Old Norse Ragnvaldr, composed of the elements ragn, "advice", and valdr, "ruler". It is a cognate of the name Reginald, which is derived from the Germanic form of the name, Raginwald, meaning "the prince's counsellor". All these names carry the meaning of a person who acts as a trusted advisor to a person in power, much as Ron acted as a friend and confidant to Harry Potter. *In keeping with the pattern of Weasley family members taking names from Arthurian legend, "Ron" is the name of Arthur's lance in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain. Ron is short for Rhongomyniad, which means "striker spear" in Welsh.*
