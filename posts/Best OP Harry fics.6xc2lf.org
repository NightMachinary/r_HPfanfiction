*** The whole thing is bathed in warm and fuzzy feelings, which is nice. In fact, the story simply wouldn't work if there was the slightest bit of angst. It's one of my favorite fics simply because of that.

Funnily enough, there's a fic in the /Worm/ fandom I like called /Taylor Varga/ that has a surprisingly similar premise and tone: child gets absurd power and proceeds to have fun and wacky adventures while mentally dealing with the fact that they could potentially end the world if they had a bad day; meanwhile, their friends get power upgrades as well while they get drawn into the adventure.

A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** I remember \linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart) as an OP harry where the opposition scales well with Harry. E.g. both Dumbledore and Voldemort are also baddass.

  Summer before third year Harry has a life changing experience, and a close encounter with a dementor ends with him absorbing the horcrux within him. Features Harry with a backbone.
