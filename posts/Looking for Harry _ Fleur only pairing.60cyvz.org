  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

** About this pairing: I used to really love it but I've changed my mind. Unless it's set in an au with different ages or several decades post hogwarts it just doesn't make sense to me. I still like reading about Fleur, but I can take or leave the pairing.
