It's a Dramoine Fanfiction. Takes place during the Second Wizarding War. I read it a few years ago and forgot all about it. Key points are: • Seamus Finnegan died in the first chapter • Neville Longbottom is a cripple • Ron Weasley is Dead, Potter/Voldemort killed him out of jealousy? • Draco Malfoy is in command of the rebel group with Hermoine Granger being second in command • Draco Malfoy can turn into a wolf • There's a spy in their camp murdering their members • had about 30 chapters last time I read it • Cormac Mclaggen has been brainwashed and has attacked Hermoine Granger twice now • Most of the Weasley's are dead except Ginny and Charlie • Victor Krum was in it and wanted to get back with Hermoine, but she was hung up on Draco
