Help me find this fic, I read it years ago and can't seem to track it down again. It was Tonks/Lupin, some hints of past Tonks/Charlie. She's depressed, addicted to sleeping potions, and almost dies. I feel like Lupin reads to her a lot in it?

Please help me find this, it is bugging me so much.


** Damnit, I know which fic you mean, but I can't remember title or author either. I think it was on LJ, though, right? Pretty sure that's where I read it, at least

*** I'm not sure where it was posted! I remember some things very vividly (like I think there was a tag "tonks/Charlie if you squint") and some scenes (Tonks OD'ing), but I can seem to find it no matter what Google or fanfic search I try. Maybe it's gone?

** I know I'm late to the party, but have you managed to find it? I haven't read it and would love to...
