I'm trying to remember a fanfic I read once that had Hermione leading a badass revolution/rebellion against Voldemort and maybe the Minstry (can't really remember). I'm pretty sure it isn't Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution, but I do remember a couple things:

1. Hermione and Co. dropped pamphlets everywhere to spread the word to the muggleborns about the ministry.

2. There is a liberal use of explosives that they get from Seamus' connections in the IRA (I seem to remember them blowing up a Death Eater's ball)

3. At the beginning of every chapter there is an excerpt from a book about the revolution.

Please help me find it! Thank you!


** That's "Divided and Entwined" by me.

It's also on AO3, if FFnet is down.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
