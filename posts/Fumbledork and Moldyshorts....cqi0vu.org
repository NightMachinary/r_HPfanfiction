...Dumb-ass-dor and Vulturewarts, and all the other mocking names for the Enemy in fanfic.

These aren't cute.

These are cringe.

Please stahp.


** The thing about those names is that they just feel so unrealistically tame. I don't know how British teens talk when referring to their betters derisively, but in my experience it's outright swears, not silly little wordplays. Kids I knew growing up would say "that fucker" or much worse, not "moldyshorts". I get that maybe it conflicts with the tone of Rowling's original work but so does 90 percent of all fics written.

That said, I love reading Indy!Harry fics where the author thinks Harry sounds like a badass when he says those dumb names, and not like a huge fucking dork trying to be edgy.

  "You won't manipulate me anymore fumbledork! You meddling fool! You're not my dad!!!" Harry yelled at the mirror as he listened to his blink-182 album for the 13th time that day.

** It's one of the things that will seriously make me consider stop reading the rest of the fic. It's fine to use it once or twice if the situation calls for it (like in a jokey twin sort of way for instance), but when the characters speech and inner monologue is riddled with it I can't keep reading. The worst thing is that the author somehow seems to think this makes their character more mature and independent, while all it does is show them being petulant and childish.

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.

** Yeah, the only time I actually use these is in the plotting phase. Not in my actual fic. And even then it's just Dumbles and Voldy because they are faster to type. I'd drop a fic pretty quickly if this was in it. Although... I could see like a drunken crack!fic scene where they try to come up with the most outrageous names... shit, go away plot bunny!

** In fairness, canon Harry does deliberately use Tom's birth name, instead of his chosen title, to get a reaction. And there's an established pattern of creating affectionate or nasty nicknames - Moony and Padfoot, "Loony" Lovegood, the Slug Club, Phlegm. And Dumbledore's stated reason for using the name "Voldemort" is not to show respect, but rather the opposite, to show a lack of fear. So using a derisive nickname like "Moldyshorts" is not exactly far-fetched.

*** There's a difference between calling Fleur ‘Phlegm' (as she is a normal human) and a mass murder and magical terrorist ‘Moldyshorts'. One is realistic as it's family fighting, the other is just ridiculous. We don't have cute made up nicknames for Hitler.
