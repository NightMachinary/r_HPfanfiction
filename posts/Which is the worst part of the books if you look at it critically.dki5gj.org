There are a lot of contenders here:

- Draco's failed attacks which were to prove that he was not evil: Countless war crimes and abusing civilians for them on top of that

- The casual use of love potions: We see how devastating an over the counter, "harmless" Version can become, nevermind the potent ones. They are rape drugs and yet treated rather harmlessly (eg Metrope, whatever Molly did with them in PoA) (and I know that Molly never admitted to using them, but most people who cook meth don't throw it away after creating it).

- The justice system in the magical world. Between no convictions for Death Eaters, Sirius not getting a trial, the state of Azkaban and summary executions for escaping prison, I don't think I need to say much. As a child it was annoying or unfair, but as an adult it is truly disgusting and a reason to immediately leave the country.

- Umbridge. She is a wonderful antagonist, no question there. Yet there is no punishment for her that the reader sees, not for torturing children and not for her bureaucratic side of a racial cleansing. In fact, the entire Ministry is never properly reformed, not from the corrupt state of the 80s and early 90s and not from the state under Voldemort.

What are your thoughts on this? Which part got significantly worse as you gained a different perspective on the books?


** Albus Dumbledore.

First chapter of the first book. Rather than knocking on the Dursleys' door in the morning, informing Petunia that her sister and brother-in-law have been murdered, that her nephew is now an orphan, and asking her to look after him, he abandons Harry at the doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter. But /fuck/ common decency, right?

Then, it gets worse. And /worse/.

- Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
- Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
- Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
- Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
- Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
- Keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts knowing a Dark Lord was after it and thus risking the lives of all students.
- Suspecting Quirrel but not confronting him even after there's an attempt on Harry's life during the Quidditch match.
- Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
- Not doing anything about the Chamber of Secrets even after five decades, though he knew Voldemort was the culprit. Twelve year olds solved the problem.
- Leaving the petrified Muggleborns in the hospital wing for months rather than buying the restorative draught. Not evacuating Hogwarts even though the attacks killed a student last time. (Why was the Ministry not involved except to arrest Hagrid?)
- Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
- Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
- Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
- Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
- Then, telling him half the truth when Harry was emotionally vulnerable after Sirius' death. Emotionally manipulating him throughout the conversation.
- Isolating Harry in an abusive, neglectful household and forcing his friends to cut meaningful communication, even after he's witnessed a student's death and the resurrection of his parents' murderer, even though there were viable and safe means of communication available like the bodyguards following him secretly.
- Having bodyguards follow Harry /secretly/. Trusting Mundungus for the position.
- Allowing Malfoy, a wannabe murderer and terrorist, free access to the school knowing that he's been tasked to kill him, even after two students are nearly killed. Admonishing Harry when confronted about this and then blatantly lying that he gives a shit about the students.
- Leaving the hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes to three teenagers rather than a few trustworthy and qualified adults. Not telling Harry /how/ to destroy horcruxes straightaway.
- Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)
- Scheming Harry's forced suicide-by-Voldemort with Snape, leaving Harry with no *practical* choice but to walk to his death because he was informed at the last possible moment that he was a horcrux. (Why? Because his answer is the only possible answer and that no one else could've found another way?)

This list (or rant) is not comprehensive by any means and my disgust for utilitarianism is showing, but honestly, Aberforth was right about his brother.

And I sympathize with Dumbledore!bashing fics coz their worst flaw is that their authors lacked the talent/skill to express their anger and disgust with Dumbledore properly.

** Dumbledore being a grade A asshole to Harry in OotP and HBP. I know this was necessary for plot, but my god was he terrible. And the worst moment for me was when he got upset with Harry for being upset over Snape telling Voldemort of the prophecy.

Lack of character development for almost all the characters. I don't think we talk enough about Harry and Dumbledore devolving in OotP and getting progressively worse. The funniest bit is Harry knowing the name of some random like Eddie Carmichael, but having no idea who Theodore Nott was.

The lack of auror presence. All the students knew Harry had been injured and Quirrell was dead. Everyone knew the chamber had been opened and Harry/Ron received special awards for services to the school. Yet no one tried to covertly meet with him after GoF until Scrimgeour.

Also, it was *Dumbledore*'s portrait who told Snape to leak theinfo. And he did so *as a portrait*, whichmeans he was already dead because Hogwarts headmasters do not have portraits instaled until after their deaths.

The plan to move Harry before his 17th birthday was 100% concocted *after* Dumbledore's death. Heck, here's one more: Whe the Order apears at Privet Drive early, Harry is susrprised. Moody replies with "Change of pöans".

1) When Harry turned himself in for execution, this is what should have happened:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort then strip searched Harry and performed a thorough Veritaserum and Legilimency interrogation on him.

  Voldemort: Hahaha, that's interesting! Dumbledore was indeed cunning, but you daft moron just blew his carefully crafted trap for me. Harry, do you believe I would just cast a killing curse at you? Do you believe I was really that incompetent as not to perform a full interrogation of you? But now, you have completely lost. Nothing will stop Lord Voldemort anymore!

  Voldemort: Rookwood!

  Rookwood: My lord?

  Voldemort: Dose this idiot with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind the strongest ward in your Department!

  Rookwood: Yes, my lord!

  Voldemort: My most faithful, the final victory is upon us. We shall now take the castle and crush their last pitiful resistance. You must kill Ronald Weasley and that mudblood whore Granger at all cost!

2) Moody Impersonation Plot. In the Books, Barty Jr only got Moody the night before he went to the Hogwarts. There was no time to interrogate Moody about every possible security questions. Barty Jr only had to blow one for Dumbledore to suspect and capture him. Then Dumbledore would easily know Voldemort's hideout, and capture him in his weak Homunculus body. It shouldn't take long until Dumbledore reduced his Horcrux to just Harry.

No, the correct impersonation target is his own father. Nobody knows his father better than him, and he still has plenty opportunities to hack the Goblet. Even better, he will have direct access to many Ministry officials.

3) Harry wearing the Locket Horcrux. It's totally fucking insane and stupid. It's not like he doesn't know what Horcruxes can do to people. I'm afraid this is solely a plot railroading effort so she can make Ron break and run off later. Fuck that!

** Having the Philosophers Stone at Hogwarts during Harry's first year. The more I think about it, the more absolutely astonished and disgusted I am with Dumbledore for allowing it in the school. He knew it was a target, he knew it was dangerous to have around, and he did it anyway putting numerous students at risk or worse. Not only that, but the so called defenses around it were fucking laughable. Two muggleborn first years and Ron Weasely beat them with remarkable ease.

Allowing Hagrid as a teacher or allowing him to be in charge of students. Hagrid is a fine groundskeeper, but as a teacher or being responsible for students he is absolutely horrible. He recklessly put his students in the way of dangerous creatures they had no way of protecting themselves from just because he found them 'interesting', assigned a dangerous textbook that could have caused grevious bodily harm if a student mishandled it, and in general the entire clusterfuck that was Harry's detention in the Forbidden Forest. He allowed them to go off alone knowing there was a dangerous creature killing unicorns with little more than a cowardly dog for protection.

Azkaban in general. The inhuman conditions of the prison, people not getting trials, and the fucking dementors? That's a human rights clusterfuck of epic proprotions wait to happen.

  "Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. *"You did do the thing properly, didn't you?* Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat and agreed it's all for the best."

Dumbledore purposefully made the Philosopher's Stone challenges easy, kept Fluffy locked in a room for a year, to not only tempt Voldemort out of hiding, but run a big test for Harry. 'Cause he just had to make sure that Harry was the right Chosen One and not a pampered prince or something.

Do you honestly think that it is okay to use an /eleven year old/ as Dark Lord bait? Because IMO decisions like this make Dumbledore an irredeemable monster.

***** They blatantly cater to the trio's strengths though. Chess game, flying game of catch the +snitch+ key, and a logic puzzle. Then there's the fact that the mirror wasn't even down there until after Christmas, and Harry happened to stumble on it so Albus could give him a little lesson right after giving him the cloak? The plant makes me think Dumbledore was hoping they'd drag Neville along tbh.

I'm not a big fan of Dumbledore bashing... but whether it was intended by Rowling or not, the entire situation is sketchy as hell.

** Hermione's characterization.

As Hermione gets older, it became less and less easy to excuse her flaws and careless treatment of other people as the actions of a naive child. As the books reached their end, there was less and less chance of her getting a character development arc that even the minor supporting characters got to have - Molly accepted her kids growing up and living their own lives, Lupin attempted to build a life outside of stewing in his self-hate and guilt, Pettigrew reaped the rewards of his traitorous choices.

So my contender: Hermione's coddling by the narration. Her scarring of Marietta, blackmailing Skeeter, Confunding Cormac McLaggen, pettiness toward Harry, leaving hats and scarves in the Gryffindor Common Room to forcibly free the elves, and recurring hypocrisy getting minimal meaningful reactions from the other characters, or consequences in the story.

Example of the hypocrisy:

#+begin_quote
  "Should've used Muffliato, Harry."

  "No, we shouldn't!" said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells.
#+end_quote

And later on:

#+begin_quote
  "Muffliato," she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.

  "Thought you didn't approve of that spell?" said Ron.

  "Times change," said Hermione. "Now, show us that Deluminator."
#+end_quote

The story just moves on and the narration never thinks of it again. Just why...

*** Marietta was perfectly fine in my opinion since her actions were directly helping Voldemort and the woman who craved words into children's skin. And she betrayed them without coercion. If anything, I would have picked a worse curse given what was at stake and who was the enemy.

Skeeter was wrong but perfectly understandable IMO. And none of the trio had reason to feel sorry for her. If Hermione kept Parvati in a jar, that'd be different, but what Rita did should have landed her in prison long before Hermione got her in a jar.

The last two books on the other hand are a character assassination across the board. There's no one who comes out looking better at the end. That being said, McLaggen and the Prince were definitely low points for Hermione.

That being said, I don't think that the lack of a critical eye on Hermione was the worst part of the book. Certainly not compared to the lack of justice for the likes of Umbridge.

**** Here's my take: What's the point of a character being given flaws, if they don't try to grow and improve past them? That doesn't mean that they have to succeed at it, just that they /try/ to develop and overcome their faults and weaknesses. If they don't try, if they make no efforts, then they remain a static character.

As a reader, I find static characters to be uninteresting, and a flawed but static character to be a missed opportunity in narrative terms. It would be like reading a novel about a drug addict who stays addicted to drugs from beginning to end.

In the HP setting, maybe you consider the external goal of winning the war to be the most important part of the story, but it's not the same for me.

** 1. I hate it when things don't make sense. Like the entire plot of GoF. If it was possible to abduct someone from Hogwarts grounds with a Portkey, why didn't Crouch Jr give Harry one during the first day at school?

2. People not using magical methods they are familiar with. Students travel to Hogwarts by a train instead of a Vanishing Cabinet. Marauder's Map can be created with student level skills, but not one member of staff in the history of Hogwarts has created such a map for staff purposes. Fidelius Charms do not protect every single private property. Harry doesn't volunteer to testify under Veritaserum that Voldemort returned. Voldemort doesn't demand that all Death Eaters swear an Unbreakable Vow to him. No one uses Mandrakes as weapons of mass destruction. House-elves can Apparate through Anti-Apparition Jinx and take humans along with them, but until 1998 no one ever uses that possibility, and after that Harry and friends conveniently forget all about it. Until 1998 no one ever succeeds in a break-in at Gringotts although all it takes is a few Imperius Curses.

3. Rowling's ideological biases make certain elements in the story not make sense.

Example A: Voldemort is both a psychopathic serial killer who cares nothing of anyone but himself and a obsessed racist. If he cares nothing of anyone but himself, why does he care about someone's blood status? To him, everyone should be worthless. Rowling just wanted to make a statement against racism, but in the context of the story it doesn't make sense. (In fact, Voldemort being a blood-purist actually makes him less evil than being just a psychopath. This way there are some people in the world whose lives he does value.)

Example B: Death Eaters are members of the aristocracy. They are rich and influential. Why do they decide to take power in Britain by force? Why don't they pursue political positions the normal way and bribe people like Fudge? What made them so desperate that they accepted Voldemort as their leader? Rowling just wanted to make a statement against hereditary power and wealth, although in real life aristocrats always support the status quo.
