I love the premise and it was absolutely hilarious for the first 15-20 chapters. But now I am sitting at chapter 30 and am sooo tired of the constant same joke. I mean, 90% of the story seems to be banter, which would be ok, it is a humour fic after all, if the author actually had some originality. But no, the same joke of Harry misunderstanding a question on purpose is used like 10 times per chapter. No other banter. Just that.

So I guess the question is, does it get better? Is there actually a plot coming? Do the jokes get better? Or are the next 70 chapters just more of the same?


** Better jokes? No not really.

But Harry does use his OP-ness in fun ways, and the Omakes and Outtakes at the end of each chapter are fun.

Towards the end, something quite significant happens, which promises to give Harry a growth arc. Unfortunately the fic ends right after that.

Edit: By 'ends', I mean that's the last chapter as of now. The fic is still ongoing.

*** Thanks. Sounds like I will bench this. I don't think my sanity will survive another 50 misunderstood question jokes (aka 5 chapters). Pity, really. Was quite happy that after a few weeks I had finally found a good story I hadn't read yet. But if it takes the author 100 chapters of repeating the same joke to finally make something happen that MIGHT make Harry grow up a bit, I don't think this is a fic for me.

***** Whew! And for a fleeting second i thought that it was abandoned right when things were looking to become interesting

** Honestly, I enjoy it but I'd never call it good. It makes me laugh but the humor appeals to me.
