I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10343740/2/Deer-tracks][Deer Tracks]] recently and I was wondering if anyone knows any similar fics?

What I really like about the story is how the characters react to magic. So if anyone can point me to one somewhat like this (somewhat light and humorous, a light read) , I'll be really greatful.

On that note:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654155/1/Find-Me-a-White-Knight-Cloaked-in-Black][Find Me A White Knight Cloaked In Black]] is another fic I like. Its a fun read really.

If you have a fic that really isn't like the first one, just give me a link if you think that I'll like it. Please, just no to the bodyguards goes to Hogwarts fics, I can't stand those. And I've already read/not interested in the first two pages of the 'sorted to favorites'.

Also, I just remembered a fic I really liked. Its the one with Harry being reborn as Kurenai's kid with Asuma, and everyone thinks that it isn't Asuma's since reborn!Harry still has his green eyes. If anyone can give me a link, that will be great.

Thank You!


** Well, my all time favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4806048/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Orange-Alien][Harry Potter and the Orange Alien]]. Hilarious and mostly IC.

** Short and funny, here have this little fic: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/585996][All Hallow's Eve - Konoha]].

It's one of those Master of Death!Harry fics that manages to capture the imagination without taking itself too seriously.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]] has Hermione dying at 20ish and being reincarnated into the Narutoverse as Sakura. As a warning, it's tured very dark in recent chapters.
