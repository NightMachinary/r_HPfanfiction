Ideally female SI and set in golden era.

The SI is kind of powerful but it has its drawbacks. There are also Slytherin politics which I know not everyone likes but I enjoy that fic in paticular because of the family and friendship dynamics.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

** Definitely [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lovegoods-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-hp-oc-si-ish.388120/][Lovegood's Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors]]. Not female, unfortunately, but still I'd give it a go. From the description:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a Boy with an imaginary friend that lived in his head. A voice of quiet confidence and encouragement, his friend was ever so clever, and would teach him things and whisper stories into his ear, pushing him ahead of the other children in class, and giving the Boy the most beautiful dreams of the-world-that-could-be. The Boy lived in a tower with his father and mother and younger sister, and he was ever so happy, watching his mother experiment, his father write fascinating stories, and his sister play, and he couldn't possibly have been more content.

  Then a thing happened, and the Boy shattered into a million tiny little jagged pieces and ate the imaginary friend.​

** Linkffn(Triumphant, the dreamer by Shadowblayze) is really good. Incomplete fic though. Probably abandoned too.

  Heather's not exactly sure how she got here, but at least the role of 'older sister' is a familiar one.
