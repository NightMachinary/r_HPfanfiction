Am I the only one who finds pairings portmanteau to be utterly ridiculous?

Snarry, Dramonie, Honks, Heur, Lunar Harmony, Wolfstar...

Use of such immediately drops my respect for the poster several notches. Fanfiction has enough of a fangirl slash-obsession image problem; why must we compound it with this sort of silliness?

** Whatever happened to the old fashioned pairing of initials? I thought it was kind of elegant. Rather RLNT, than Ronks, which sounds like a discarded portion of elephant anatomy. Or JPLE, HHr, you know?

** It's part of the culture and I can understand its practical use (Snarry vs Snape/Harry is better to get by ff.net's word count and might return more consistent results for what the reader is looking for). That said, some sound really odd and unnecessary, and they're not very consistent.

I don't use portmanteaus but it's a non-issue for me and I don't see how it propagates a stereotype. The stereotype is a non-issue for me, too. There's great and weird stuff in every group; slash is just a large vocal one and I don't want to deem it a problem because I'm not part of it. Fandom is about sharing space, especially sharing space with people with the opposite views and/or concerns. It works out: you're clearly not interested in fics that use portmanteaus and they're not looking for your readership. I understand where the annoyance comes from, of course; I just like to try making fandom a more friendly place.

*** Snarry isn't shorter than H/S or even HP/SS, though I suppose I can't argue with consistency, but I have to agree with the OP that ship names are awful. I've never come across a ship name (in any fandom, not just HP) that I actually like.

**** Oh, I should have clarified; I had an explanation in my head that I never wrote out. I imagined that in the earlier internet days, there might have been issues with site search engines not processing the "/" character correctly. They often interpreted it as a space, thus searching for "HP" and "SS" instead of "HP/SS".

**** FF.net's search function used to not allow you to search terms that were less than three or four characters, so searching something like H/S would have been an invalid search term. While I prefer initials to designate pairings, search problems like that may have contributed to the rise of pairing nicknames.

** I don't have a problem with them. I think a lot of them fit well, actually. The names combined can have a double meaning. Like Snarry, there's some emotional manipulation going on, Snape 'snares' Harry. And though Harmony cheesy, Harry/Hermione is so right that I forgive it. Honks is good because they'd be incredibly awkward together and ducks are awkward creatures. Dramione is good because it makes me want Dramamine, the nausea/air sickness medicine. Scilly (Scorpius and Lily) works because the pairing is just silly, everyone knows Scorpius is supposed to be with Rose. And Scorose is good because their past is scars and there are sorrows but they are still a rose together. Jily is a stupid one though.

** Honks and Harmony are perfectly fine honestly, Lunar Harmony is easy enough to decipher and kinda cute on its own. Better than "Flaming Nargles".

Heur is pushing it, and seeing Snarry, or Drarry makes me sick to my stomach, mostly because I don't like either of those characters even in fic where they are "good".

Dramione...isn't the worst pairing name, even if I hate the thought of the pairing...

I typically though, just stick with H/Hr, H/G, H/L etc, spelling out the second character name if need be (ie H/Tonks) and that is usually only when you are including a secondary or background character like Tonks, Fleur, Gabby, Pansy, Daphne, Tracy etc. "main pairings" are easy to decipher, others not so much. I agree the cutesy sounding pairing names are unneeded, but if they describe the perception of the couple/threeple then alrighty then.

** I like Harry/Fleur. It's not my favorite by far but it makes sense when you think about it, at least how it's justified in the stories. Both of them always being stared at, their want for real affection. They're both somewhat similar.

That others do it doesn't make it sound any less idiotic to my ears. I see 'Snarry' and while the post or story might have the most brilliant prose put to electronic ink, I think "idiotic and not worth my time." I don't care whether it's Spirk, Narutinta, Drarry or a combination of the three (Spirknarutinadrarrycthulhu), they're all repulsive language manglings.
