My story shows a student showing off to the class after Harry wasn't able to answer Snape's questions. Amidst showing off, he reveals that he figured out how to produce a very potent poison.

Snape used Legilimency to see that he was telling the truth, and things got heated

Here's how I currently have him react, but I don't think it's adequate enough.

“You,” Snape said in a deep, resonant voice, “will not be speaking to anyone about this.”

The hair at the back of (character's) neck stood up. he could feel the cold magic emanating from where their professor was standing.

“Yes, sir.”

“Detention with me, after class.”

“But sir, I have Defence Agains The Dark---“

“No more talking.”

Any thoughts and suggestions? What should the detention be about? I'm planning on having Snape talk about the dangers of revealing such information, but I'm not sure how exactly to go about it.

Do you think he should react more strongly? Do you think he's reacting too much? Does he seem in character?


** Okay, this is my reading from canon- he wouldn't particularly care that a student knew how, or try to keep the student from imparting this knowledge to other students.

The Wizarding World is vastly different from the muggle world. The students are put in dangerous positions all the time, and expected to deal with it. So if this was a regular poison, that would kill someone very quickly, well. There are lots of things that can kill a person quickly. Knowing how to make a poison isn't any worse than knowing that if you stick a knife in someone, they will die. People with good judgement who aren't murderous psychopaths aren't likely to do either. Honestly, they seem to make things in potions class that could kill or seriously injure students all the time.

So first, by /very potent/, you'd have to mean something like "the fumes from making it will kill everyone in Hogwarts" or something on the level of what could only be a terrorist action.

Things he might care about are where the student got the information, if the student is very young or could only have obtained this particular recipe from Snape's private journal, or from a death eater family, or something like that, OR if the student was caught /making/ the potion or Snape saw that he had plans to make the potion- naturally why and what the student was planning would come up.

Also, if the student has a class next, then likely so does Snape. Even if he doesn't, I don't think anything during school hours would be termed a detention. "Stay after class" or "You will be staying after class," would be the way I personally think Snape would phrase this if he wanted the kid to blow off his next class for the emergency of talking to him about the toxin.

*** I agree with this. There are some easy ways to make deadly poisons out of household chemicals in the real world, but a student just knowing about it isn't necessarily a cause for concern.

And Snape especially I think would be cynical about it. He might give the student detention and a tongue-lashing, just on principle, but I don't see him being particularly surprised or alarmed unless the student was actually making the poison with intent to use it. And maybe not even then, depending on the circumstances.

** Well... I think his way of approaching the matter would depend extremely on whether the student in question is a Slytherin, for one thing. (Depending on what conception of Slytherin you adhere too, it might not even be that much of a surprise, let alone cause for serious concern, that a Slytherin would know the recipes of potent poisons. At any rate, though, the ways of Slytherin politics, combined to Professor Snape's status as the Head of House Slytherin, would certainly affect the way he'd go about it.)

*** What if the student in question is a “twin” of Draco Malfoy, but was sorted into Gryffindor?

**** Then we need more informations about Snape. Is he simply Head of Slytherin, or is it the kind of story where he is really good friend with the Malfoys and Godfather of Draco (plus this twin).\\
A basic Snape would probably use the opportunity to take 50 points from Gryffindor, try to destroy a child self esteem and will to live and be done with it. A godfather may be a little more involved and either try to understand with the kid would do it or give some advices.

** Personally, and based on your mention of the character possibly being in gryffindor, I would think Snape would be far more underhanded about punishment. In the moment, I think he would silence the class and cease all chatter, conversation, etc. to stop the student from spreading the information to others, and also in hopes of ensuring as few people cotton on as possible. Next, I would expect him to deduct points and give the student an evening detention, or several consecutive ones, ‘for talking out of turn' (but really to try to rectify the issue of them knowing about this potion) wherein he develops punishments designed to terrify the ever living shite out of the student. These punishments would be closely related to the process and after effects of the potion in question, but I'll leave the details up to you. Depending on whether he saw intent to brew and/or use it, the punishments/terrification should be escalated accordingly.
