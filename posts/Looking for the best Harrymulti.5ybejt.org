I haven't read a Harry!multi fic in a while. Looking for stories like Heart and Soul(probably the best Harry!multi fic ever written - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul]]), Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble, Three to Backstep, and Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

Preferably longer than 100,000 words. I don't care if it is completed or not.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

*** I'd like to issue a warning: This is by far the angstiest fic that i have ever read. I'm honestly not sure how i managed to get as far as i did but there's literally someone crying in every chapter (usually it's Harry) and then they all start crying and then they all condone a teenager violently torturing someone because he was sad and angry and that makes it alright.

I'm not saying it's horrible, because it's not. I've read far worse but it's not everyone's cup of tea.

** What if the fic is multi but no romance has started yet? If you're fine with that, go read I'm Still Here: linkffn(9704180)

**** Well she did start that other story in which Harry and Tonks hook up pretty much right away so maybe there's hope yet.

***** Haha, that's true! I should point out that she did it because she was challenged by her co-author to write a story in which Harry gets together with someone in the first couple of chapters.

Kathryn has proven she can adapt, if nothing else.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
