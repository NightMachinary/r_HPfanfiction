Any good Avenger/Harry Potter Fics, but not /A Child Avenged, Of Wizards and of Heros,/ and /Steve and the Barkeep./ I've already read those and they're awesome. Any other fanfics like those?


** *Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe* - linkffn(13326497)\\
AU - The war goes differently, everybody but Harry and Voldemort dies. After a final battle, Harry wins, and the ritual Voldemort was working on activates. He ends up in the MCU.

Harry ends up joining the Avengers, developing magical devices that improve humanity, politics, ands up upsetting the plot quite a bit.

*Heroes Assemble!* - linkffn(12307781)\\
Instead of the epilogue, Harry goes traveling after the final battle. After five years, he settles down in New York and opens a cafe. When the Battle for New York happened, he joined in and pisses off the ICW. He ends up joining the Avengers as an ICW sanctioned member.

*Say a Prayer* - linkao3(4629198)\\
AU - After a prayer to Loki, Loki adopts Harry. Upsets the plot completely. Adds a new bad guy that was working behind the scenes. What looks like bashing isn't really bashing. It's plot relevant and does get resolved. ANYWHO~ The Golden Trio breaks up, and Harry ends up spreading his wings socially. He makes new friends, creates a club. Sort of Muggle bashing?

Anyway, SHIELD is kind of an enemy in this one? Annoyance? SHIELD and HYDRA are in there, doing their own thing, while Harry and co do theirs. They intersect once in a while, and make for some good intrigue.

*On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads* - linkao3(17926664)\\
James was Loki. Harry is half Asgardian. After finding out, he starts planning: to punch his dad in the face. Warning: Loki's face gets punched a lot. And then plot ends up continuing. The Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship is really great in this one.

This fic is practically completed, all that is left is the epilogue.

*Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis* - linkao3(17946929)\\
AU - FemHarry ends up as the Avengers' cleaning lady. Some good humor in this one. Holly goes about her job while keeping her magic a secret. Secret ends up getting out. Some action, some comedy, and some drama. Holly plays matchmaker with Hogwarts and Jarvis. WIP

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends.

His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** Since Nyanmaru listed a bunch of great ones, my list is going to bit a bit short :D

*Like Father, Like Son* - linkffn(13216994; 10950591) - A fun story that has Harry being Cap's son (sperm donor). It's a re-imagining of the abandoned (but still worth a read) 'A Happy Accident'.

*Finding Home* - linkffn(8148717) - MoD!Harry with the Avengers. This is what got me interested in these crossovers... and also got me to sit down and watch the damn MCU movies.

A note about /Say a Prayer/ - this isn't really a crossover and if you don't like bashing (of Ron, of Hermione, of Ginny, of... well it bashes like everyone) then skip it. The first part is a pretty ridiculous parody however, it does get more serious as it goes along.

  It all started with a blond strand of hair. From there, all Harry Potter has known about his life begins to unravel as he finds out the truth about his past and who he is, unearthing secrets that he didn't believe possible and finding family he didn't know existed. But maybe these changes could be a new beginning, a blessing in disguise, if he looks at it the right way.

** I have a couple of favorites, both WIP, which I don't see recommended very often. The Blood on My Hands. . . It Scares Me to Death has a wandless and emotionally scarred Harry land in the Avengers world. Beautifully written and sometimes brutal - one scene actually made me cry. There's just one chapter to go so I'm optimistic it will be completed. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11799474/chapters/26614947]]

Red Threads of Fate has a femHarry infiltrating the Avengers for a mission and has a great way of intersecting the HP and Avenger worlds. Also a soul mate fic which I don't generally like but I think they pull it off OK. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20298055/chapters/48118987]]

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

- Draco is a Death Eater spy for the Order. Despite him being a spy, he is convicted for being a Death Eater and is sentenced to the Veil. When he passes through it, he lands in the MCU sometime around the first Avengers film. The fic is really good, and I apologize for the sparseness of my summary - I didn't do it justice, but it's a beautiful fic.

^last update Feb 2020

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See the Moon]]

Another gorgeously written fic - it's after an alternate version of DH, wherein Harry's not quite alright after his Horcrux is destroyed. In this alternate timeline, he was friends with Loona and he applies a lot of Loona-isms in his speech and thought process. He also has some sort of amnesia. He befriends Banner a little after the events of the "Incredible Hulk" and the two share adventures trying to stay under the radar and traveling around the world. When Banner joins the Avengers, Harry follows suit. I'd like to emphasize that this is a very different Harry from canon, but nonetheless one that grows on you.
