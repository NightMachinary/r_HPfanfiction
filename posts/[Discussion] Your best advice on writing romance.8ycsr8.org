And don't just say, "Not HBP."

If you can make it character-specific (i.e., what they might find attractive), then that's even better.


** Make it natural, don't force it on the characters. Build it alongside your story and make it feels organic. I'm not a writer so I can't give you better advice but for me, this is the essential. One thing that makes me drop a lot of fanfictions is that the romance is unbelievable, I mean, there is no romance, no chemistry no nothing and then suddenly, in a matter of 2 chapters, they are a couple, so try to build your characters in a pace and as you present them to the readers, you present the romance alongside.

Sorry for any English errors, it's not my mother language.

*** I'm not an experienced writer, so maybe take this with a grain of salt. Speaking from a reader's perspective.

  Maybe someone finds a guy's glasses dorky and dumb-looking while another thinks they make him look cute.

Going off of this one a little bit: To me a lot of romance is just characters /noticing/ things.

Maybe have your character mull over the fact that their love interest has one particular expression that matches to a feeling, or maybe they can't figure out the emotions behind it. Or they have a nickname they really dislike. A little nervous tic- tapping their figures, tucking hair behind their ear, rubbing their neck. A particular laugh that's different from normal. Hell, maybe they pronounce something in a particularly endearing way. A stutter when they're flustered. Anything! It makes them /unique/. It's a bit of depth to a character.

And don't get me wrong, I don't want six paragraphs talking about a particularly cute cough. Just mention it. Hell, do it mid dialogue. Then have their love interest break them out of their thoughts. Then they're embarrassed, and you can give /them/ some depth with how they deal with it.

** I think it really depends on if the story is centred on the romance or if the romance is a background thing in the story. Stories are about conflict, people overcoming challenges etc. If the romance is the centre of the story then you have a much harder time coming up with a genuine conflict that doesn't sound like teenage drama or stupidly contrived. You also need to decide if the conflict/challenge is in the couple coming together or what they face as a couple, you could even do both but than can feel like a drag without a clear division. A story does need an end, throwing challenge after challenge for the sake of putting more words on the page fatigues the reader very quickly and often the sources of conflict come across as increasingly outlandish. If the romance is a background of a story then make sure the story needs it before you put it in there.

With regards to what people find attractive, it can be anything for anyone. I once had a friend describe what he found attractive in certain people's noses over several pints before concluding his perfect nose on a girl was like a ski jump. Arse and eyes are a shallow but valid attraction. I like the way some people sound, their accents the way they use words at times. I come from a place where the local accent is being lost and a nasty hideous accent is creeping in from what was the London slums before they were cleared out. Its made me very aware of how people sound.

** If you're writing a romance story, then it should be tied in with the conflict. /How does problem x affect character a and b's relationship? Does it drive them apart? Bring them together?/ If it is a romance that is budding, but not the center of the story, then I should be able to digest their relationship with relative ease.

Unless you're writing some sort of casual sex story, the main characters should NOT be having sex by the second date. If they're teens, the relationship is going to be awkward, painful, and cute. Adults seem to date a little more smoothly, but teens have some serious drama.

Finally, make the characters realistic. Take Voldemort (gross, I know). He is a literal sociopath that canonically cannot feel any form of love due to being conceived under the effects of a love potion. You'd have to change some serious character background to make him capable of being in a good relationship that could end happily. My point here is make sure characters have chemistry. Whether they end up together or broken apart, there should be some sort of chemistry that starts the chain of events.

** Late but a few thoughts:

- You don't go from strangers to in love overnight (breaks suspension of disbelief). Make sure to explore the stages of attraction, casual dating, serious relationship, etc.
- Agree with what others have said about body language - extremely important. I think physical contact that isn't sexual is very underrated. And the characters should be drawn to each other's physical traits too - ie searching for someone's hair across a room.
- Conflict is key, especially if the relationship is the focus of the story. There are only so many ways to generate conflict in a relationship so it can be predictable but here are some options ** External conflict: Family member disapproval, lives in danger, illness/deat ** Internal conflict: Cheating, jealousy, miscommunication, misunderstanding, information asymmetry (one partner knows something the other doesn't), partners want different things, pregnancy, etc

My favorite trope is when one partner thinks the other is dead. It's cliche but the angst and reunion are so fun. I also enjoy stories where a hetero couple has a kid but the male partner is unaware. Good luck!

** Well, it kind of depends on what sort of romance you're referring to. Slow burn is going to be different than whirlwind, for example. Are you looking at an opposites attract? Hate turns to love? There are all different sorts of romance, so number one is figure out what kind you're going for.

The heart of all stories is conflict. Internal or external, there has to be some sort of conflict in the story. Is there something keeping the lovers apart or something throwing them together in an unexpected situation? An example of the latter is the movie Romancing the Stone. Joan Wilder is pressured by the external conflict of finding the jewel to save her sister, so she's forced to hook up with Jack Colton to achieve that end and romance ensues.

One thing to definitely avoid is contrived situations. The conflict must be something concrete and real with real repercussions within the story. A simple misunderstanding won't do and stories that have a misunderstanding as the main plot device are a huge pet peeve of mine. None of this "I saw you talking to [Dean, Neville, the Boggart] and I knew that meant you weren't interested in me!" Baloney.

As for what's attractive, that's going to be up to you and the characters you write about. There are the external, obvious things such as hair, eyes and body shape but don't forget the internals as well. Sense of humor, wit, general attitude (optimistic, pessimistic, loyal, introverted) ... all of these contribute to one person being attracted to another. When you're writing, put yourself in your POV character's shoes and think about the other character--maybe there's something in them that you yourself are attracted to--and highlight it. Try to avoid overly-flowery or descriptive words when highlighting a feature. For example, hair. Hair doesn't have to be long, flowing locks that caught the sunlight like a mountain stream. Hair can be a nice chestnut brown that framed her face perfectly, making his heart beat faster.

Take your time, think about what kind of romance you're wanting to portray, what the main conflict of the story is and who your characters really are and start writing it down.

** Don't be afraid to make it awkward at times, especially if you're writing teenagers. Romance seldom is perfect, and making it realistic helps avoid at least some of the tropes.

** Romance itself isn't a plotpoint. There actually needs to be something going on in the story.

*** Romance is the best selling category of published fiction and keeps publishing as an industry alive. How a couple falls in love can very much be the â€˜something' going on in a story.
