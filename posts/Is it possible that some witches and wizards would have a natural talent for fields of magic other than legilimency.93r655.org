Since Queenie Goldstein seems to effortlessly practice legilimency, it doesn't seem she learned any of it but was rather born with a pretty strong talent for it. This leads me to believe that she didn't have to learn to achieve that high a level of control over it. Rowling also said that Snape has a slight natural talent for legilimency. She makes it sound like it's in their magical genes or something. Maybe like a gift, sort of like being a seer or a metamorphmagus (but on less levels).

Is it possible that this also applies to other subjects as well? Like charms, potions and transfiguration? Where some people don't need to practice as much as others to master the level of control over a certain field of magic. Or is that only possible for legilimency?

What do you think?


** (Mostly copy pasting from something I just posted)

In the real world, you're running into the skill vs talent fallacy. Sure, some people are may start off better than others at things, but most of the time, if you see someone doing something masterfully and effortlessly, it's because they've spent hours upon hours working hard on that thing, or at least something like it. That guy you might know who can pick up a mandolin for the first time and play it flawlessly? He's probably spent several thousand hours on things like the guitar, that he's able to transfer the skill. That guy who is an incredible artist? He's read books on the subject, studied the work of other artists, and has been drawing as a passion since he was five. See Howard Tayler's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4qBSrLe19k][lecture series "Talent? Who needs talent?"]] as well as Stephen McCraine's superlative [[https://doodlealley.com/2009/11/29/the-need-for-sustainable-creativity/][comic series "Brick by Brick"]]for more on the subject.

That said, this is fan fiction, so if you want someone to have an affinity to certain branches of magic, that is up to you. Apply the questions you should ask anytime some new magic or technology is added to a setting (What is this? How and why was it made, or where does it come from? How will it affect the richest/social elite? How will it affect the poorest in society/socially disadvantaged? How can this be abused/manipulated? How can it be marketed? What does the black market for it look like? How do these things cause conflicts that can further the story?)

*** I don't think this is true of "natural talents" in the HP sense. Tonks' metamorphmagus ability seems entirely instinctual, with changes reflecting her emotional state. We know that Harry's ability to speak parseltongue was not practiced or studied. And in FB, Queenie talks about how she struggles to control her legilimency - she "can't help it". All these point towards there being certain people who have the innate ability to perform certain magical acts without any training or practice - a skill completely divorced from a person's general magical ability. Indeed, if any training is involved, it relates to /stopping themselves/ from performing the magical act accidentally.

**** To be perfectly honest, I was primed for this comment by having just posted the first paragraph on another thread, so that likely biased my point of view of OP's question. Also, I've not watched Fatastic Beasts, so I'm unfamiliar with Queenie.

That said, this sounds more like a affinity, or more compellingly a flaw in her magic, than a mere talent.

I find talent to be a vague word, because it's so often equated with trained skills that the two often get confused. As a personal example, I'm perfectly fine if you look at a miniature I've painted and say "you're talented" because for the most part, people don't see the progression of skills over the past several months, where I've been painting a mini or three each week, learning something new as often as I can find a tutorial. I know it's a skill I'm honing, but people who just see the end product can't tell that.

Things like a flaw or affinity that is innate for someones magic is something that any author should be looking to abuse for a story. A flaw will cause problems. An affinity will solve the same. Use as needed, and write good things.

Edit: Grammar.

** Yes, I think it's likely. However, let's remember that legilimency is a single spell, not an entire branch of magic. I doubt there's anyone out there who can perform the entire body of Charms without study or wand. But a specific Charm? That seems entirely possible.

*** While it is just a single spell, I am found of the idea that spells have depth and breath to them. A wizard can spend his entire life studying a single spell and still have more to learn. He might be seen as weird but, for example, we know multiple books have been written on the summoning charm, so at least some wizards are putting some serious study into individual spells.

So, yes, it is a single spell but that doesn't mean it isn't a field of study in its own right - within the larger field of charms, within the still larger field of magic itself.

**** Agreed - I have promoted this idea extensively myself (e.g. in my headcanon doc). But my point was not to belittle legilimency. Rather it was to head off the idea of someone being able to cast an entire branch of magic without studying it.

** Regarding potions, some fanfics explore the idea that potion making requires a great deal of mental focus. Thus, potion mastery doesn't require an affinity for potion making per se; instead it requires an almost meditative focus, which would probably be part and parcel with mastery of occlumency.

For the other branches of magic, I don't see it as magical affinity. I think it's more likely that people's minds are better at certain tasks.

For example, someone good at transfiguration might have an extremely strong imagination such that they put greater detail into their mental image of the change they want to make. Someone good at charms might have better hand coordination such that they are better at remembering and executing small patterns of wand movement.

**** The way I see it, occlumency requires strength of will in regards to understanding and mastering yourself. Legilimency is a step in a different direction, requiring understanding and mastery of others.

It's sometimes difficult to understand the deeper processes of your own mind, especially for people who have parts of themselves that they would rather not examine too closely (unpleasant memories, feelings that they don't want to accept, justifications that they invent to cover up feelings of guilt, etc.) Thus, to be good at occlumency a person must have an aptitude for unflinching self examination.

On the other hand, legilimency requires understanding the motivations and weaknesses in other people's minds rather than your own. Someone with an aptitude for legilimency might be a great social manipulator or criminal profiler: they intuitively understand what motivates the people around them, even the unpleasant truths that their target would prefer not to acknowledge.

So, in my opinion, an aptitude for legilimency comes from a person's personality rather than magical qualities.

***** I find it odd that the same can be said about the patronus but it's still considered a sign of superior magical ability. Come to think of it, Defense requires a lot of spells concerned with personality (patronus, riddikulus). But legilimency seems like a spell from what I gathered from the books.

****** The patronus as described in the books seems to require extreme focus on a single emotion (happiness) to the exclusion of all else. Same with the riddikulus: it requires focus on laughter while ignoring fear. To me that's like the burst of strength that a person needs to overcome their pain in a time of crisis; rather than understand and accept their fear as a part of them, they just stuff it in a hole and ignore it while drawing up other memories as a temporary cover. This would explain why Harry can summon a patronus but is pants at occlumency: he has great strength of will in a crisis, but he does not have deeper mastery over himself.

** I thought FB pretty much confirmed that wizards can have affinities for different fields of magic. I mean, definitively confirmed it for people who weren't previously convinced of this by canon.

From canon we know that Snape is particularly good at Potions, Voldemort took Dark Arts further than anyone, Dumbledore did things at his Transfiguration NEWT the examiner had never seen, Harry takes to flying like a fish to water, Ginny is great with hexes, Lockhart's Memory Charm, the fact that wands are described as particularly good for certain fields of magic and that wands choose wizards...

Haven't we known this since book one? Book two at the latest?

** I figure it's the same as any other talent: like someone good at cooking or drawing or singing. It doesn't mean those people don't have to learn how to do those things, just that when they do they /get it/ faster and easier than people who aren't talented.

Sometimes they figure it out for themselves, which can make it seem like they were born with the ability, but nobody is actually born good at anything.

**** I'm not sure I understand your point. Do you mean Tonks didn't figure it out herself because somebody taught her, or because she was able to do it since she was a baby?

If it's the latter, I have to say babies and little kids learn things faster than anyone else. It's all pretty much downhill from there.

Personally, I see the metamorphmagi ability (and parseltongue, for that matter) as partially physical abilities. In the same way as somebody who is double jointed: if you're not, there's no way you're going to be able to twist your arm around backward the same way someone who is can. So for Tonks figuring out how to be a Metamorphmagus would be just a part of figuring out how her own body works. Nobody teaches us that as babies, but we learn all the same.

But I always thought Lily had the innate ability (exactly like Queenie's but with potions) and Snape used his brainpower (altering stuff) because Slughorn described her as intuitive and instinctive.
