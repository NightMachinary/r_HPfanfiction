** I mean this is a pretty reasonable request, why the downvote?

--------------

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]] is 500k words long, H/Hr, and very M. That site allows you generate downloadable EPUBs.

** I have to rec Keira Marcos' site, because she has a few good Harry/Hermione fics ~100k: Courting Hermione Granger is 90k, while the Harry Potter & the Soulmate Bond series is almost 400k, and there are some 20k-30k scattered about.

​

She also has some Harry/Draco and Harry/Hermione/Draco (Darkly Loyal, which is 181k), so be sure to look at the ship listing and tags to avoid what you don't want. Though she has me back into Harry/Hermione because I love her worldbuilding.

​

I'm obsessed with her fics right now, so I'm just going through every bit of her HP stuff. Her site is pretty well organized with a tagging system by ship and fandom (and sometimes title if it's multi-chapter or multi-installment in some fashion), and then she provides individual tags per fic/series.
