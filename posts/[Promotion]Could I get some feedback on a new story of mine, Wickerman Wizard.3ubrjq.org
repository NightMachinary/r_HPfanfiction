** I liked it and followed it. I don't really have much commentary besides the use of "rohypnol." I thought that was a weird descriptor to use. Would a wizard be aware of that term? It doesn't seem to fit.

** It's interesting. I don't fully understand what's happening, but if there was another chapter, I would read it.

I don't know if this was intentional or not, but there's a distant quality in the writing. I feel like we're watching Harry, rather than seeing the world through Harry. What's Harry feeling? What's he thinking (it's shown a little, but not much). Mystery is essential for a good hook, but I mostly just feel like I'm a bit out of my depth reading this. Maybe have a reference to familiar characters? Why is he on this journey to El Dorado? Why is he in the business of killing vampires in a different country? Eventually you'll have to explain these questions, and if you don't intersperse it, it will become info-dumpy. Also, consider the audience -- throw them a couple of bones to keep them hanging. If things are too vague, they won't continue.

This chapter is only 1k words so I can't give too much feedback. But I also noticed a missing word in the "base instinct" piece of dialogue.

*** I hadn't realized the main character was Harry!

**** Oh... now that I look back, I realize that I kind of assumed because Harry P is listed as the main character in the summary.

Yeah, that's a problem, OP. You should definitely mention who the main character in a scene is, unless it's supposed to be some sort of mystery to be solved (unknown shadow man shoots guy in dark alley and walks away with a shiny suitcase). From what I read, I think that guy is the main character, and it is Harry, but you should most definitely call him by name sometimes.

** This is quite good so far, and I will be waiting eagerly for more!
