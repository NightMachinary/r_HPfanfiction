Im thinking about writing a cult of the deathly Hallows fic but im struggling to think of characters that would actually believe in the hallows enough to join not including Dumbledore or voldemort

So far my list includes

Luna & her father obviously

The department of mysteries & that includes rookwood

Igor but not any of the durmstrang students

Ollivander

Any remaining grindelwald followers

Mr borgin

Gregorvich

Runes & magical numbers professor at hogwarts (forgot thier names)

Anyone else you guys can think of


** Honestly you probably are going to have to go OC/crossover if you want more.

Perhaps decedent's of Grindwald's followers- his symbol was the Deathly Hallows- surely some of that Dark Lord's followers were either taken into his confidence or did a little research on the matter- and at least some of their children/grandchildren would probably rather like power or to talk to their dead leader (depending on their knowledge/the place in the timeline).

Mundungus Fletcher and other criminal types- the invisibility cloak would have them salivating.

Nico di Angelo from the Percy Jackson series- son of Hades and all- maybe he wants their power for himself or maybe he was ordered to return them to Hade as a quest.

Thanos- guy worships death, I can't see him not wanting to get his grubby mitts on the things.

Pretty much anyone in the series that has lost a loved one- I bet Snape would have cut off his danglies for a chance to speak to Lily again.

*** I'd love to see a scene where Snape uses the Resurrection Stone and Lily appears and just yells at him for what a shitty person he is.

**** The Resurrection Stone is an artifact that compels its user to seek death. If Snape were to use to bring Lily's image back, she'd convince him to join her in death.
