I really liked the idea of the challenges listed at the end of the chapter. Has anyone done these challenges?

*** The Blacks are probably the worst of them: human trafficking.

Nobody fucks with them either, because there's always a market for pureblood children.

***** Nah.

Potters are the elite mercenaries. When you need some violence done, or you need a thing to remain untouched, you have some choices. You can hire a dozen mercenaries and maybe they'll succeed. Or you can hire a Potter and relax, even with the almost excessively high price required.

OR Potters are the information brokers. They know where all the bodies are buried, they know whose skeletons are in whose closets, they know who's sleeping with who, where that last shipment went, and who paid for it to get there.

To make the Potters real underworld nobility, you can combine both options. If you need services or information, arrange a meeting with a Potter. They'll fix you right up, if you can pay the price.
