would love to see a knowledgable asshole harry with constantine at his back.


** "Alright, Harry, this is the part where we drink the demon blood and get sent to hell." John Constantine said whilst unscrewing a jar full of blood. "Just remember, we don't have that much time while we're down there. So this will be a real quick tour and then we're out."

"Got it." Harry nodded, wand clutched tightly. He was excited and terrified at the idea of going to hell but John Constantine was his tutor and if he said it was alright then he trusted him.

"John Alan Constantine, what on earth are you doing!?" Professor McGonagall strode into the room with fire in her eyes. "Is that ritual what I think it is?"

Harry looked to Constantine who was hastily re-screwing the lid back on the jar with a bright fake smile.

"Er, it's the ritual... of... firefly summoning. Yeah. Isn't that right, Harry? Just wanted to show him some glow bugs." Constantine patted Harry on the back rather forcefully. Harry was confused.

"I thought we were going to hell." He said, turning to Constantine. "You said you wanted to show me what a real demon looked like and that if I saw one, I'd never be afraid of dementors again because they're like kittens compared to those real ass motherfu--"

"What a kidder!" Constantine grabbed Harry's shoulder again but in a tight grip.

"Come with me, Mr. Constantine." Professor McGonagall was scowling fiercely. "Potter, I'm sorry about all of this. Feel free to join your friends or go back to your common room. I will catch up with you later."

"Bye professor, Mr. Constantine." Harry waved as the two left. Constantine had shot him a small smile before he completely left the room so Harry figured they were alright. He imagined it would be quite like the time Constantine taught him to shoot fire with his hands and he had used it to scare the shit out of Malfoy. Oh, they had gotten in trouble, but Constantine was good at talking himself out of major punishments.

Picking up his schoolbag, he noticed that Constantine had left the jar of demon blood behind. Harry mused for a second before running all the way to the Gryffindor common room where he knew his friends would be.

"Ron, Hermione," he gasped, out of breath from running, "wanna go to hell with me?"

** What does DCs magic even contain? I only know about Zatanna and her reverse speech spells, and John Constantine and his demon fighting.

*** It's fairly soft includes basically everything, but not in a way that everyone can access. Some people cast from themselves (Zatanna), some use tricks and trinkets (Constantine) and some have connections to various things (swamp thing) among other things.

**** Is it like in Harry Potter where only those born with it can use it, or like Marvel, where anyone can learn?

** Constantine would have run into Harry while fighting a demonic incursion, and ripped out the dursley's souls to patch the portal closed, reasoning that it was kinder that what awaited them, and then adopted Harry.

  Sometimes, life bashes you upside the head with a brick in a sock. Hogwarts is about to get its latest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, a man cast adrift from his native world- a man named John Constantine.

  Is Hogwarts really ready for the cynical, foul-mouthed, chain-smoking Professor John Constantine?
