Basically is there any other fanfictions like "In light of silver memories" or "The one he feared"? It could also be as harry being wise (time travel or not), powerful but skilled but not over the top bullshit. Another great example is " Wind shear". Any help would be great. Preferably no slash or fem.harry Thanks!
