(This is an AU in which Harry was sorted into Slytherin and gets Riddle's diary, and it starts in his second year. What happened with Quirrel is not clear right away, though it is hinted at and will be revealed later in the story. The magical theory behind Horcruxes, Harry's backstory, etc. are the same as in canon. What I want to know is what kind of expectations this scene sets up for the reader, and whether you would keep reading or hit the back button. Any other suggestions you have would be great as well. Thanks!)

“You go in first, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Merlin knows what you've picked up over the summer.”

Harry couldn't help but laugh as he was pushed into the second year dormitory ahead of the other boys. After his miserable summer, it was wonderful to be back among people who recognized him as one of their own, even if he did have a reputation for casting spells on them from behind. “Just for that,” Harry quipped, “you're going to get it tomorrow morning.”

The Slytherins filed into the room, sighing and sluggish from the feast, and found their trunks at the foot of their beds. The rounded dungeon ceiling and smouldering emerald sconce lamps were the same as ever, and a Grindylow pressed its ugly nose against the stained glass windows to welcome the students, nearly invisible in the murky nighttime depths.

Wanting nothing more than to surrender to sleep after a long day, Harry unlocked his trunk to fish out his pyjamas. Contrary to Malfoy's suspicions, the contents of Harry's trunk had remained untouched for the entire summer, not that he was going to admit it. It was bad enough that he had to live with his aunt and uncle and his hog of a cousin---his Housemates couldn't know that he was their House Elf as well.

Just then, Harry's hand brushed against something smooth and he barely bit back a yelp as a tiny jolt left his skin tingling. He stared at his hand as the sensation turned to warmth and then faded. Nothing he owned could have done something like that, so he gingerly pulled aside one of his shirts to reveal a thin, black leather journal lying on top of his school books.

Harry glanced over at Malfoy, who was watching him curiously. Malfoy flicked his gaze at the book before looking back at Harry, and shrugged. Harry was left on his own when Malfoy began complaining loudly to Crabbe and Goyle about the new Defense teacher Lockhart.

Tuning out the whines about Lockhart's family status and hideous robes, Harry poked the journal with his wand. Nothing happened. He decided to pick it up.

The book thrummed beneath his fingers, and Harry felt a growing warmth in the pit of his stomach. Excited, he flipped through the pages. Nothing. Yet, he couldn't shake the hunch that he had seen it somewhere before. There /had/ to be something in there, but where was it hidden?

He examined it more closely. The leather cover was a bit scuffed, almost good as new, yet the year on the cover said “1941.” On the back was embossed the name of a Muggle variety shop in London. The first page said, in faded writing, “T. M. Riddle.” A Muggleborn?

Suddenly wide awake, Harry plucked a quill and an ink bottle from the box in his trunk and clambered into bed without changing. He barely felt the softness of his sheets as he leaned back against his pillow and opened the book on his lap and began to write.

“My name is Harry Potter.”

The words disappeared.

Hands shaking, Harry dipped his quill again and tried to write something else, but before he could manage, the ink came back, this time forming different words in an unfamiliar hand.

“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. It is a pleasure to meet you at last.”

Harry frowned. Many wizards had said the same thing to him when he was first introduced to the wizarding world, but this book was fifty years old. Unless somebody had told this Tom Riddle about the end of the war, there was no reason he should know about it. His response was blotchy.

“How do you know me? And what are you?”

“Does this diary seem at all familiar to you? As though from a long-lost dream?”

Harry's stomach leapt. “Yes, it does actually. But why?”

The page stayed blank for a long moment. “That's because it was you who put me in here.” Before Harry could respond, it continued. “It is a long story, and one I shall surely tell, but simply put, you and I were once the very same person.”

He sighed in disappointment and leaned back against his pillow again. This was surely a joke product of some kind. What had he been hoping for? “You mean, I used to be Tom Riddle too, or were you Harry? I don't want to be rude, but that sounds completely mad. Did Malfoy send you?” Words came back almost immediately.

“Are you or are you not a Parselmouth?”

He stared down at the page, mouth hanging open as the words faded. That was not what he'd expected. He was indeed a Parselmouth, but noone knew this but the Dursleys and the snake he'd accidentally set on Dudley a year before. He'd first learned of Parseltongue while overhearing some older Slytherins talking in hushed voices about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Not wanting to give any substance to the rumours of why he'd been sorted into Slytherin (“You-Know-Who must've thought he was competition---and he got it right, didn't he!”), Harry kept his talent a secret. No amount of searching in the library had given him any Parselmouths outside of Slytherin's line and You-Know-Who himself. It was an uncomfortable thought. And this Tom Riddle had no business knowing about it.

“What would that have to do with you?”

To his annoyance, Harry got the unmistakeable impression that Tom was amused. The lines came with a flourish.

“Parseltongue is an ancient power that can only be passed down through blood. The most notable Parselmouth was Salazar Slytherin, and the gift has only survived in his line. I am the last living heir of Slytherin, and you and I are the only two known Parselmouths in all of Britain.”

Harry was not convinced, but another possibility made his mind race. “That's it, then, right? We're related.”

“No more closely than any other old families are. I passed the gift to you directly when our soul split apart into more than one body.”

“I still don't understand that bit, sorry.” Harry couldn't resist the sarcasm. If he thought Tom could surprise him no further, however, he was mistaken.

“Before the night the Potters died, your body housed the soul of the infant Harry Potter. Since the moment the Killing Curse struck you, your body has held the soul of Tom Riddle. Harry Potter is dead.”

A chill began to creep into Harry's gut. This was a very dark joke indeed, and one that he did not appreciate. This was not true. He was Harry, he had always been. He was nobody else. This book was absurd. He would deal with this tomorrow.

He yawned. Too exhausted to dig more deeply, he clapped the book closed, tossed it to the end of his bed, pulled the embroidered covers up to his chin, and slept.


** There would be two things that make me hesitate.

Firstly, I'd feel like the very significant AU has been glossed over in a couple of paragraphs before jumping towards the diary plot. I think if you're going to be that dismissive of the AU then you might as well have Harry in Gryffindor as canon and have this conversation with the diary as a divergence from Harry and Tom's first conversation.

Secondly I'd be rather questioning how on earth the diary knew the background information required to come up with this story. Not only does the diary know information about Halloween 1981 that only Harry and Dumbledore are privy to, he also displays a greater understanding of horcruxes than in canon (where Voldemort never suspected that he could have made a horcrux accidentally). Hell, even knowing about the existence of the first war is beyond what the diary should know. While a talented author could pull off a memory loss backstory in which this is not Harry's first conversation with the diary, one's default assumption when reading FF is that the author is /not/ that talented.

That is indeed the backstory here. Whether I have the talent to pull it off is another matter. I'm just giving it a shot. It's valuable writing practice, in any case.

Thank you for the outside perspective. My reason for putting Harry in Slytherin was to distance him from all the things that made him reject the Dark Arts as a kneejerk-reaction. Namely, Hagrid and Ron. It seemed to me that canon Harry absorbed a lot of views just from hearing them before the alternatives, like most children do. Young Harry also struck me as equally Slytherin, and he only grew into Gryffindor as he matured. I will consider your idea, however. It could make for interesting tension.

*** Thanks for the feedback! All of the questions do get explained later in the story, but the problem is that unless I make a time jump, it will take a while. I don't really plan on Harry figuring this out until at least 5th or 6th year, after it's too late for him to go back. I'd rather not have to tell my readers important information in the author's notes just to keep them from getting frustrated, though.

And didn't Harry do the same thing in the book with the diary? He first felt a strange familiarity with it, then introduced himself right away as though it were a normal diary. With the feeling even stronger due to lost memories, I don't see why this Harry wouldn't do something similar.

Agreed on the ending.

***** Yeah, I had been considering adding a prologue for that reason. Since it will take Harry a few years, maybe I'd better.

** I've already got a general idea of where the fic will go and how it will end, and I've got several scenes written. If anybody is interested, I can tell them under a spoiler cover.

edit: Also, I can already tell that Harry needs to be more surprised by Tom writing back, but I'm not sure how to put that in...ugh.
