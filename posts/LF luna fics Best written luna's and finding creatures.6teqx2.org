What are the best written luna you have seen? What fic nailed her personality and speech best? Give me your best fics with a well written and fleshed out luna!

Additionally what fics are there where harry (randomly?) Finds one of lunas creatures? (Perfect if he presents "it" to luna in public!

Best Luna and Snape characterizations I've read. I adore this story.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** These four are all great Harry/Luna stories in which Luna's characterization is superb. The first two on the list are very recently published ones which I just recommended yesterday:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487457/1/A-Boy-a-Girl-an-Owl-and-a-Train-Compartment]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12499983/1/Somehow-You-ll-Just-Know]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3961411/1/Not-Right-For-Him]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9812705/1/Crescent-Moons]])

This story doesn't go into very much detail character-wise, but it does fulfill your request of Harry finding a creature for Luna:

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

** This story is superb. Given that it was written pre-HBP, there are some slip-ups (Xenophilius is called Samuel, for instance). But Luna is remarkably well-written. Her mind wanders and she often questions why things are the way they are--and her developing friendships with Ginny, and with Christine, a shy Ravenclaw dorm-mate who is far less willing to be cruel to Luna than the others, are very sweet.
