So I was thinking about all the fanfic where Harry treats goblins like equals or with respect, and the goblins are basically just like no wizard has ever treated us this way before, we are so honoured, Harry Potter, you're the coolest.

Okay, maybe not exactly like that, but something along those lines.

Anyway, I just thought it was kind of stupid. I mean, goblins operate on a very different set of principles, traditions and customs than wizards, and these fanfic authors seem to be disregarding that.

I don't think the goblins would see Harry's treatment of them as his equal as a token of respect at all. In fact, I think they'd be offended. The goblins of canon are a very proud race, often disdainful of wizards. Harry treating them as he would treat a wizard could just as easily be seen as offensive as goblins seem to consider themselves above wizards.

That's my take on it. Thoughts, anyone?


** Hagrid didn't like goblins, and there was no monster or creature he didn't like.

I assume goblins are vile creatures ready to trap wizards with contracts and lies.

*** A good point and might be perfectly true (no way of knowing from canon) but Hagrid certainly has his own biases. He's blind to Dumbledore's faults, as one example, and certainly nurses a grudge (however well-founded) against Slytherins which is unprofessional for a school staff member. His dislike of the goblins may also be class resentment. Given his pariah status as a expelled suspected murderer retained in his position only on an eccentric's sufferance Hagrid likely has financial problems and could be unlikely to feel warmly towards bankers of any race. Anyway no particular point here just rambling about Hagrid.

*** That's ... actually a damn good point. It's possible that Hagrid too is at least somewhat biased against them, but it's still a damn good point considering his like of everything.

** This is Britain, the country where people apologise to lamp posts and thank empty lifts and authors are trying to claim that Harry was the first and only person to ever be polite to a goblin? Sorry, that just doesn't work.

Not to also forget that the wizarding world is not made up solely of arrogant purebloods and that each and every year there are people arriving that have never seen a goblin before but are familiar with interacting with bank tellers - muggleborn parents.

** In the world of Harry Potter respect towards magical and nonmagical things is a basic theme. It is a portion of why the Death Eaters are the antagonists, and Harry has a muggleborn friend.

That being said, respect towards something is not what we have issues with. In the goblin world we only know two things. One that anything that theg protect they feel is theirs. This is referenced in the poem on gringotts entrance. Also of note is that they are particular about their deals. Gobins as Bill states view deals as literal interpretations. Meaning when Griphook agreed to take the trio to the vault, amd grab the cup, as soon as Griphook had the cup he demanded the sword, which was his payment the action. He then notified the rest of the goblin nation what was happening. This shows the goblins are more loyal to themselves than to anything else. Including that which they guard.

To claim that being polite will get anything from such a race is laughable. Based on these observations, the closest thing that will get you is a knife in the back at the best opportunity to benifit the Goblin Nation. The goblins seem to be more than willing to use humans to further their own agenda.

** So, the stories that do this well are the ones where the goblins realize that Harry doesnt have the same bias as the rest of the purebloods /and/ has the power to help the goblins so they respond to his politeness positively.

In that case it's not that no one has ever been polite, but that this is the first person who will hold substantial power to enact change in their world to treat them as equals, and they want to encourage this to their advantage.

That said, we get very little look at goblin culture in the novels, so we have no idea what their world is like, and what they consider polite or professional. It is unlikely that no one ever has treated goblins politely, nor that they are so starved for recognition that they will bend over backwards for whoever gives it. At the same time, children are indoctrinated into seeing goblins as savages that will rebel at the slightest provocation, barely under the control of the ministry so keep your dealings with them short, making it likely that no one talks to the lm more than neccessary.

*** That's interesting, I've never really thought about what the goblins stand to gain like that before. While that is true, the extent to which the goblins attempt to encourage the behaviour to their advantage is often exaggerated.

True, there is very little we see about goblin culture in canon. As far as I can tell, the only things we really know about them are that they like gold, they're cunning, hate wizards and are a proud race. Since they're such a proud race, though, I can't see them as willing to treat any wizard with more than stiff politeness unless a wizard treats a goblin with what counts as respect in goblin culture.

**** True, but then this the world of Harry Potter where everything is over exaggerated. The idea of goblins bending over backwards to help the wizards because they want to wield wants fits the setting and I'm not thrown out of the story by it.

As far as goblin culture goes I think a lot of your points are likely formed more from fanfiction than the stories themselves. We get to interact with goblins in book 1 for a chapter, and book 7 for a chapter, with a few references to goblin wars thrown in for comic effect with HoM. We legitimately know nothing about them beyond those few pieces of information.

***** That is a fair point, I can see them doing a lot of things in order to have the opportunity to learn wandlore. The thing is, though, many of these fanfiction don't really touch on that, and goblins usually gain nothing but respect and gold out of the relationship between them and the main character (usually Harry). And if they do, I can imagine something along the lines of what Griphook did in DH happening: the moment they get the knowledge of wandlore, backstab Harry. But in these fanfic, the goblins continue to remain loyal to Harry, which is nice and all, but not something I find keeping to the portrayal of goblins in canon.

Well, I tried to form my points on goblin culture from what I definitely known from canon and Pottermore. Initially, I thought they were a warrior race, too, but then I realised that was purely something fanfiction cooked up/assumed. Pottermore lists goblins as 'cunning and clever', and they are definitely a proud race that hate wizards, from what I can see in canon. You can see their pride in how they count Gringotts as being impenetrable to wizards. Their wizard hatred underlies the interaction between Harry and Griphook in DH, and the tension between races is in every scene between them. Although, I suppose their greed for gold is debatable. It's mainly characters with potential biases that call them greedy.
