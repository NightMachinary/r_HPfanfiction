As an act of goodwill towards, Granger and Potter one night A very drunk Draco Malfoy and Theo Nott Cast the Fidelius Charm over the sitting room ( wheee Granger was tortures) in Malfoy Manor. As the Manor has not allowed the destruction of the room, Malfoy was a secret keeper, But by the time the charm was cast. He and Nott were so smashed . He couldn't remember where the bloody room was.

And this is how 14 years later, Scorpius Malfoy found a Disappearing room in the manor. Where he built the most epic pillow fort the Magical world had ever seen. It became his secret hideout, where his mum could never make him clean.

Years later it was used again, to hide a Terrified Albus Potter For the wrath of his sister Lily.


** And to hide Albus from horrid Scorose fics (especially the ones that are just Dramione on crack)
