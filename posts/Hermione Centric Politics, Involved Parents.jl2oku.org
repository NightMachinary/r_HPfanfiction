Hello

So recently I've been wanting to read more politically inclined fics where Hermione use the Ministry ridiculously bigot laws against them.

I also wanted to read more about Hermione's parents being more involved in the magical world.

If there's one that has both the Grangers more involved in their daughter's life and is politically inclined I'd be very grateful.

Please no half-blood or pureblood Hermione. No Ron/Hermione, Draco/Hermione pairings, Ron Bashing or over powered Harry.

Thanks for the help.

P.S I have read White_Squirrel's fics.

  Things didn't entirely get swept aside after the conclusion of the TWT. Dumbledore doesn't get his way. Riddle or Fudge won't either. Some OCs have large roles.

** New Blood does it fantastically well, and her parents are amazing. It is updated 3 times a week.

******* Holy fuck yes, excuse my language, but it felt appropriate. You've managed to not only give a more involved Granger parents but powerful Slytherin Hermione. This is the gem I've been looking for.
