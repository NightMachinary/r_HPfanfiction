*** This story is so bad. I'm honestly surprised to see it get as much love as it does. It's very formulaic.

1) Harry does something with his uberpowers that put jedi to shame (it's essentially a magicwank fic)

2) Ahsoka spends a third a chapter reacting to it (she's accepting of it)

3) Aayla spends a third of a chapter reacting to it (she's confused of her feelings about it)

4) Others spend the last third of a chapter reacting to it (generally negative of it)

5) rinse and repeat for every single chapter.

**** I'm pretty sure it's just you having a very high standard for quality or a specific taste in content. For me the author of the story has a nice writing style and while the plot is a magicwank as you say it caters to people who specifically search for Master of Death OP Harry.

The story and it's characters are written well even if you dislike the frivolity and unlimited freedom the protagonist has to do whatever the fuck he wants to be crude. The emotionally stunted elder Jedi seem to fit and Ahsoka was an apprentice of Skywalker and just got her worldview of the order shattered so she's accepting because she was saved and given a chance to finally live.

Yes you might be right about the formula, but it feels like you're nitpicking on smaller details that are unpleasant particularly to you. I personally don't mind it.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** *Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942): Palpatine seriously messed him up. When he eventually returned to the HP universe, he really shook things up.

*The Stars Alone*, linkffn(12040341): It's the sequel and a Crossover with SG-1, but all three of them have Sith powers and magic. I don't think you will often see a Hermione blasting her enemies with force lightening.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

*** There's a fic called the jedi that couldn't die or something where she has force static which yoda has to evaluate because it could've been force lightning. I remember it as fairly okay.
