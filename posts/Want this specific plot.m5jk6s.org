I've just finished reading The Dark Price Triology for the umpteenth time and was imagining other characters in the place of Harry. That's when I landed upon Ginny. I mean she's one of the Weasleys, the only daughter, little Gin-Gin, the baby of the house. Now she's this huge villain and the Weasleys are supposed to hate her or worse kill her when time comes, but they can't.

So I would really appreciate a fic where Harry is still The-Boy-Who-Lived and the survival of the Potters is optional. Ginny obviously grows up with Voldemort and is used to his dark ways. You know the usual I have a sad past and now I have a new family and I'm confused thingy (not trying to offend someone) . Oh and please please NO Weasley bashing. I beg you!! I really want to see how the brothers try to get back into Ginny's good book in their own ways.

I've read this fic a while ago in which Ginny was taken from the grounds near The Burrow and her memory was erased by Voldy. She grew up as his daughter and has this fire manipulations power thingy (I cannot explain it). She gets taken back to the Wealseys by Dobby after being spotted by Dumbledore. She gets locked up there and everyone tries to convince her, but nothing really works. The twins got a little laugh out of her though. Harry breaks Ginny's nose and she almost burns him to death in return being the happy little couple they are. It was a good read and was certainly satisfying, but it's incomplete and stopped in the earlier chapters.

I couldn't find any fics like this. I don't know if I should be blaming my research skills. I really want the pairings to be canon, H/G and R/Hr being compulsory. So yeah. I think I covered most of it anyways. Would really aprreciate the help.


** What's the Dark Price Trilogy, where is it?

*** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][Here's the link]] And it's a series written by this author named Kurinoone. It is no romantic fluff filled fic, but rather has a considerable amount of angst and is filled with adventures. It made me feel like dumb numerous times. You could get the description easily through the link. Have a go!!

**** Oh I mean I won't convince you to change your opinion, but she certainly did give credit to the original author (It was DarknessOverload or something) and actually made her own books out of that plot. So yes she did borrow the main plot, but she didn't copy the whole trilogy or the other spin offs. But yeah I do agree she should've mentioned it a couple more times or tried contacting the original author.

****** I honestly didn't know that. I've read it after about 13 years and I thought that she was nice from the start. I guess I shouldn't have assumed. I'm sorry, I should've researched about it before promoting her. But is it wrong that I still like the series?
