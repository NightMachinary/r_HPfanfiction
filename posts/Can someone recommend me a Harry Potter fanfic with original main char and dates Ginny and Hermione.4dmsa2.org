I would love to read one like this and help is appreciated the longer the better thanks!


** Probably not /exactly/ what you're looking for, but linkffn(A Curse of Truth) has a male OC who basically falls in love with Hermione but there is this complicated love triangle between her, him, and Harry...

It's the best self-insertion story I've ever read, but I'm not sure that's saying much.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

**** Yeah it's definitely not exactly what you wanted, but I don't think there really exist a lot of Hermione/OC or Ginny/OC. Or at least, any that are halfway decent ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

** Ginny/OC is rare, and Hermione/OC is exceedingly rare.

In *Art of War*, linkffn(10179471), both were paired with OCs though, but they are not main characters.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
