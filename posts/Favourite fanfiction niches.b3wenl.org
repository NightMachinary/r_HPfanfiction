What are your favourite niche HP fanfic trope? I'm personally weak for stories like "MC's past is gone into with characters who don't know about it" or "loser kid from childhood grew up to be total hero". Just read a good one about Hermione at a family reunion, but it was abandoned before it got to any of the good stuff, so I thought I'd ask what people's own favourite niche tropes are (and also ask anyone with recommendations to post links!)

Edit: grammar mishap.

  I love Strength of Steel Wings, the Harry in that would be a perfect proto Dr. Manhattan

Could you pm me what why/how Harry is that way? I'm curious, but I lost interest in the fic pretty quickly so there's no chance that I'm reading ~700k words of it.

*** I like the Transcedent thing too. Where the MC becomes so powerful that they transcend in some aspect. My current favorite example is an original story where the MC quite literally become very similar to most monotheistic ideas of God. That's actually why I use the word transcendent.

My way of thinking about it is that character X is so beyond someone that it is analogous to a fictional character fighting a real person. It doesn't matter how strong Goku is because he exists in a state that can't rival someone who actually exists. It's less about a strongman against an infant because you could actually imagine the infant winning. It's more like a strongman trying to punch color or some other abstract concept.

In HP Blindness... Harry seems to transcend in his understanding of death. He sees it as a comfortable inevitability after becoming the master of death. He also doesn't go full genocide because he knows normal people could never understand that he was helping them. At least that was how I interpreted the ending. It's not as extreme, but I sort it in the same way.

*** It's been a while since I read a good fic with a twist but it's great when it happens. Similarly, a well done inventor!Harry story's always fun for me too but I tend not to see too many of them (unless it's an Iron Man crossover. There are tonnes of them).

** I like peggy sue/time travel , but not if they're presenting themselves as serious fics where Harry acts like a regular 11 year old, befriends 11 year olds, and does nothing except let canon come at him. I'm happy with that kind of stuff if it's a comedy, but if it's not then I generally want to read about a powerful and dangerously competent Harry actively making things happen.

 

I like the idea of Harry being transferred to a parallel universe, but I haven't found many that I really liked.

** Overthrow the corrupt, incompetent, and malicious British Ministry of Magic

Not many fics address that topic, but there are some very good ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Trio and their friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings against Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's death and offered to help Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travelled and killed off their enemies in droves. They even did the Goblins in, but failed to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901): One shot written by the author of NOFP. A gravelly injured Harry hires a super assassin SI from America to take out those responsible for a tyrannical marriage law.

Finally, I greatly enjoyed the scene in CoG where Grindelwald burned those Ministry goons to ashes.

**** Well, I'm not that pessimistic. The Epilogue is after all only a snapshot and only indicates that Harry and his friends SEEM to be doing fine.

I wrote an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][one shot]], linkffn(12925628), that is an interview of Harry for the Battle of Hogwarts's 20th anniversary. He's been playing totally hardball politics for decades and “very thorough with Voldemort remnants”.

I have written additional scenes that depict Harry & co no longer as innocent children and naive teenagers, but as hardened warriors with a big vindictive streak:

#+begin_quote
  [Ministry of Magic, August 27, 1998]

  Seamus: We can't do this? We can't do that?! What was that soulless motherfucker thinking? He thought he could hide behind that foul “I'm just following order, we have to follow procedures” excuse? You know what, if any of those Death Eaters got away because of that motherfucker and more innocents are harmed, I'm going to personally tear that motherfucker from limb to limb!

  Neville: Language, Seamus, Language.

  Seamus: Sorry, Neville. I shall rephrase it to “inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minion”! It's not just that little piece of shit, there are a whole bunch of those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions who still think they own this damn place. We fought, we bled, we suffered, and we died, and those shit think they can still order us around? It's about time we teach them a lesson!

  Ron (laughs out loud): That was bloody brilliant, Seamus. That felt so good! Sorry, Neville, I hope you take no offense?

  Neville: None at all, I and Seamus went all the way to hell and back. We understand each other perfectly well, although I certainly wouldn't express myself that way in front of Kingsley. But Seamus has a point, there are still too many from the old Ministry, with their arrogant and corrupt attitudes. Kingsley might have cleaned out the Auror office, but it's only a part of the DMLE. We need to change that, and soon.

  Harry: Which means more politics. I hate that. I thought we had it after the Wizengamot was purged, thanks to your gran and Molly of course. But the rot in Ministry goes far deeper than my worst imagination. They weren't just forced into serving Voldemort. They did it willingly!

  Dean: We can't be too reckless though, or else we might face a full-fledged rebellion.

  Seamus: I say bring them on, lure them into the open, and then we will deal with them like we did with the Carrows...

  Neville: Seamus!

  Seamus: Oh, sorry Neville. I'm really really sorry this time.

  Harry: What did you do with the Carrows?

  Ron and Dean both turning their attention on Neville and Seamus.

  Neville: I think this will sooner or later come out. Seamus, do you agree that we should tell them the truth?

  Seamus nodded.

  Neville: Good. After you three went to sleep, we remembered that the Carrows were still tied up in the Ravenclaw Tower. So I led scores of DA members and we tortured them into pieces of vegetables. Then we killed them and explained that they were killed trying to escape. I'm not proud of this action, but I have no regrets. For what they did to hundreds of my fellow students, they totally deserved it.

  Ron: Bloody Hell!

  Seamus: Neville, it's not only you! We all agreed, especially Ginny...

  Neville: Seamus, what Ginny did is not our right to tell. Harry can ask her directly.

  Dean: Why didn't you call me to join the party?

  Neville: You were asleep as well, and Luna said not to get you involved.

  Dean: Luna was part too? Why did she leave me out? I have every reason to get back at them!

  Neville: You have to ask her, Dean. Luna cares very much about you, and she certainly had her reasons.

  Ron: You have my support too. Those two totally deserved it. I'm glad Ginny had her revenge. It's a pity Mum got Bellatrix too quickly. Harry?

  Harry: I certainly can't blame you, since I crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on Professor McGonagall.

  Others: You did what?

  Ron: Wow, I never knew you had that in you, Harry! You got Cruciatus to work on your first try?

  Harry: No, that was my second attempt. I first tried to cast it on Bellatrix in the Department of Mysteries, after she had murdered Sirius. It didn't work, and she taunted me by saying that “I have to mean it!”.

  Harry: Now that I remember it, Ginny did feel somewhat off when I met her in the common room after waking up. Does anyone else know?

  Neville: Professor McGonagall knows. Although she disagrees, she understands us.

  Harry: We will need a full pardon on all of our actions against Death Eaters during the War, and we will need significant freedom of actions against them in the future.

  Ron: Does that mean you want us to use Unforgivables?

  Harry: Maybe not Unforgivables, but lethal force for sure. During the Final Battle, they were throwing every dark curses at us, while we mostly answered with Stunners. A simple Rennervate by their fellow murderers meant they were back in business. It was criminal. We would have lost far fewer if we had fought back more effectively.

  Harry: Remember, we had Doholov and Rowle down in that Cafe, and we let them go. God knows how many more Muggleborns, Muggles, and Hogwarts students they had murdered afterwards. Remus was killed by Doholov, and it was my misplaced mercy that Teddy lost both of his parents. I should have listened to you then, and killed them on the spot.

  Ron: No Harry, you can't blame yourself for that! Dolohov murdered them, not you! Besides, Voldemort had my whole family as hostages, and if we had killed them, he might have retaliated by killing my family!

  Harry: Maybe. Maybe it was the right decision on that night, for us. But then during the Final Battle, we also had Greyback down after he mauled Lavender. Why didn't we put him permanently out of business there? Why?

  Neville: Because we were students then, not trained killers. They failed us, so we had to step up to do the dirty work. The Ministry, the whole lot of them, they all failed us.

  Seamus: Damn right, Neville! So what are we going do about those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions?

** My favorite 'niche' is fics that portray Voldemort/Tom Riddle as more rational than in canon.

I can enjoy fics in which he is the villain or the protagonist, as long as his character is well written. Unfortunately, due to FFN's tagging system, the Voldemort-as-protagonist fics are easier to find.

The most common tropes I've encountered are time travel back to before Riddle became Voldemort, Voldemort as mentor/parental figure to Harry, and Tom Riddle grows up with a magical friend/sibling at the orphanage. There's often some overlap with other tropes, such as 'Master of Death'!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, or Heroine!Hermione. I love to find well written fics with plot ideas I haven't seen before.

I love how it gives the author an opportunity to write practically original stories in a very familiar world as well as show the story from other POVs -- who know much less than Harry and the gang, might not have believed Voldermort is back, etc. Similar to rare pairings, super minor characters also force the authors to do more character development work as opposed to falling back to old tropes like Leather Pants Draco or Death Eater Ron.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I'm a big fan of fanfics where a character is basically minding their own business somewhere else - like Canada or Australia - while on vacation, and they casually bump into Snape. He's somehow survived Nagini, and he's living life basically as a muggle.

I also really like fics where the author delves into the castle as a magically "alive" structure that's more aware of what's going on than most people realize.

**** Definitely imo. They are one of my favourite pieces of fiction and could imo be easily a very successful fantasy series if they were released as standalone books. Many people have issues with the main character, since she is a bit of an antithesis to the rational controlled hero that people in the fandom love so much. She can be quite the shithead but the books and other characters absolutely acknowledge that. Generally the first book is a bit standalone, but the other three that are currently out are pretty connected. The first one was definitely the hardest for me to get through, with the least complex story and the most repetition. It picks up a lot after that.
