It doesn't really have to bash anyone but I don't care if people are bashed. I just want a Harry that doesn't care that Hermione doesn't know about the troll, at most he tells a teacher, he doesn't care about the stone being stolen or even investigating what is hidden in the school, etc. Basically he wants to finish school and get the hell out of dodge. I hate Hermione so please no pairings with her if there's a pairing at all.

Thanks.

P.S. I'll also take fics where Harry has enough of england and leaves or simply doesn't get involved in the adults war. I probably read all the popular ones so less known fics would be great, even oneshots.


** I always upvote when I see someone else hating Hermione. It's so rare nowadays.

*** I didn't start hating Hermione until I saw that 60% of HP fics have her either as a major character or even as a main fucking character. Honestly I hate it even more when she's an automatic friend in every god damn fic no matter how different Harry is. They became friends because Harry is socially stunted and abused, craving for any friends, otherwise no normal kid will put up with all her shit unless they are alike.

**** Due to fanfiction I started to hate Daphne Greengrass. She is probably the worst character because she is always done in the same, boring way. And then she is added to other stories as a clickbait.

But most authors don't decide, they copy the ice princess trope which never makes sense since she always melts to Harry within 10 chapters. It's always the same story and quite a few stories took a turn for the worse when she was introduced (and it created a multi-pairing)

  Voldemort never killed Harry, instead he killed his parents and kidnapped Harry to raise as his own son against Dumbledore and the light. Dark/Slytherin Harry. Eventual M rating.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

School is a means to an end to him and he's perfectly willing to let the aurors fight the big battles while he sits back and profits.
