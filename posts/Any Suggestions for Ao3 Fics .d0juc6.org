Hi there ! Do u guys have any great fanfic recs that's can be found in Ao3 ?

I'm really looking for some great stories with some romance. Especially Hermione and harry ones or Harry and Daphne.

Just not a lot of Hinny :/

And extra point for Dumbledore bashing ones :)) I find them entertaining in a way ðŸ˜…

Thank you !!!

They also are sorted by kudos.

Hopefully you'll find something interesting.

** Uh. This is more evil!Dumbledore but does have bashing. But not much of anything else you asked for. Lol. I'd say about 25% what you asked for. I'm rereading it now. That's why I'm including it.

#+begin_quote
  After the War, there is a boom of marriage and divorce. Hermione finds herself among the statistics of war heroes who couldn't save their marriages. When she receives the invoice from her solicitor, she has no choice but to answer an ad in The Daily Prophet: Malfoy Heir Seeking Nanny. But, everything is not quite what it seems as Hermione navigates the waters of post-divorce life.
