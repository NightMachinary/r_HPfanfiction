** Uncle Vernon advanced on his nephew and with an outstretched arm, slammed Harry against the wall, "Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?!" Vernon asked politely.

** My response to my own prompt (my writing is pretty bad):

Vernon Dursley was having a nice day so far. The freak was at his school, the sun was shining and he just got a pay rise at Grunnings.

Until the doorbell rang.

He stood up, grumbling about stupid salesmen and how they should be arrested for intruding. When he opened the door, there was a rather short man, dressed in long robes even in the summer heat.

He recognized what they were immediately. “Go away” Vernon sneered. “I won't have you dirtying our house with your presence”.

He tried to slam the door in the wizards face, but found that the door wouldn't budge an inch. He looked up, about to yell at him, when a yellow beam of light slammed into his chest. He staggered backwards

When he looked up, he saw the man smirking at him. “What did you do to me?” He politely inquired. Stopping when he realized his tone.

He took a deep breath, ready to unload his anger onto this freak who dared to use magic at his doorstep. “What did you do, freak?” he asked in a quiet voice.

The wizard was shaking trying to suppress his mirth.

“I'll ask you again, what did you do to me?” Vernon tried to shout. It came out in a conversational tone, as if asking about the weather.

The robed man couldn't hold his laughter in any long. He started to cackle very loudly. Vernon watched as the man rolled on the floor, chortling so loudly, he wondered if the houses down the street could hear him.

Finally, the wizard is able contains his laughter. Though a giant grin is still on his face. Without saying a word, he apparated away with a loud crack.

Vernon looked around to see if his neighbours saw anything. When he saw that nobody was watching he went inside, thinking of how strange that encounter was.

/The next day/

He was walking down a street, when somebody bumped into his rather large body. He turned face already reddening, about to yell at the unsuspecting woman.

“Please watch where your going next time” he said with a smile, which the lady returned. He walked past her, getting to the end of the block before realizing what he said.

“What. The. FU-“

Vernon calmly entered the house, got his special key, and unlocked a closet which had stayed locked for many, many years.

He grabbed the shotgun, quickly and effectively loaded two shells into it, and strode back towards the door.

Grabbing the still chortling wizard by his robes, he dragged him inside, closed the door, and took the wand from his grip.

The wizard was slowly coming to his senses, but the wand was already in Vernon's blender being turned into kindling.

So when Vernon returned, hefted the shotgun and pointed it at his head while saying "I'm afraid you're going to die, now", the wizard was sadly unable to escape.

** Twist; at the end of book 5, Vernon's calm and polite demeanor manages to unnerve Moody.

#+begin_quote
  Vernon didn't seem offput by the words of Harry's 'reception committee'; in fact, he began to smile in a smug, insufferable manner.\\
  "Are you threatening me, sir?" he asked, beaming innocently.\\
  Mad-Eye Moody paused, before answering, "Yes, I am," wondering if he was making a mistake.\\
  Vernon's grin widened until he resembled a predatory shark, "And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?"\\
  "Well..." Moody's magical eye started spinning furiously, searching for the trap he was certain he had just fallen into.
