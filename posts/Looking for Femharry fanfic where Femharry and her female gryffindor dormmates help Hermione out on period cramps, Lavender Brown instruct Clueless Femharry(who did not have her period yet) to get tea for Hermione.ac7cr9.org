** I think you maybe meant this as a fic search rather than a request?

**** At the end of your original post there should be three dots (...). click on them and you'll get a list of options, one of which is edit flair.

** I bet witches either don't have them - or if they do: There's a potion for it! Seriously, they can grow back bones overnight, so some period cramps are probably dealt with by a potion a first year could make!

Seriously, do you think that Rowena Ravenclaw would accept something like that interrupting her time reading great books or performing astonishing feats of magic? Hell, not even Helga Hufflepuff would stand for it IMHO!

**** Not sure what the guy wrote, but puberty/periods feel weird in fiction because it is often needlessly (and sometimes unintentionally) sexualised. Just look at A Song of Ice and Fire, where everyone is obsessed with girls "flowering". Makes sense universe-wise, but is still very weird to read. In HP fanfiction, there is just one author I can think of who really brings this up, and his works do the whole "sexualise" thing. Not sure if intentional, but it comes across as very creepy (although that can be said about the entire series, the third part is literally subtitled "Age of Consent").

***** They said they needed bleach. And the fic OP describes doesn't sound even remotely sexualized.
