Slytherin was not a dark wizard but he was extremely hideous and spoke Parseltongue. Shun by society he became wary of humans, magical or muggle alike. He only accepts the company of people he trusts really well and refuses to teach anyone new, thus earning him a reputation for not trusting muggleborns. He however is a kind and gentle spirit who is like Hagrid on steroids when it comes to taking care of dangerous creatures. Especially those that get a bad reputation because he identifies with them. He built his headquarters under the lake to keep an eye on his first friend ever, the Giant Squid and built the Chamber of Secrets because he is worried someone might kill his pet snake for 'being a danger to society or whatever'.

Rowena Ravenclaw is a Dark Witch. Not evil in nature, but dark. She is intelligent and has an insatiable hunger for knowledge but sometimes to the detriment of her and those close to her's well being. She experiments with curses, necromancy and even makes a horcrux out of her diadem (that's why it was rumored to make anyone wearing it smarter). When Helena found out about it, she tried to destroy it but she enslaved her favorite pupil to hunt her down and kill her. When she realized what she had done, she was overcome with regrets, her soul healed but in a last act of despair she tried to resurrect Helena and the Bloody Baron only to accidentally bound forever to Hogwarts as ghosts.

Godric Gryffindor is pretty much the medieval version of Gilderoy Lockhart. He is a failed knight, incompetent in charms, transfiguration or martial magic, as well as in Muggle dueling. He will however tell everyone who'd listen all about his courageous deeds while serving the king. And to maintain that image, he only teaches to those he deems as having the ideal knight qualities. He is however an excellent potioneer, particularly when it comes to cosmetic potions (almost a thousand years later, one of his descendants broke bank by inheriting this skill and inventing the Sleekeasy Potion). He is also fascinated by astronomy and divination and that's why he set his headquarters in what was the tallest tower then (before the Astronomy tower was added).

Hufflepuff is the one whose image is the closest to her current version but her story is less romantic than that of the other three. When Hogwarts was set up it was an instant success with witches and wizards travelling from all corners of the country to learn how to manipulate their skills. However the first three were very stringent with whom they'd choose as apprentice and those that didn't get selected would be sent back home. Among them was Helga, who was plain, easy to forget and a mediocre witch at best although she was pretty decent with household charms. Those didn't impress any of the three other founders so they sent her away. In her despair she begged and pleaded to be allowed to stay, until Slytherin took pity of her and hired her as a maid. She would clean and cook for them and in return, she could listen in on their lectures. Thus Helga became a pretty decent witch and, remembering how she felt when she was rejected, she took pity of all those that would be rejected by the other three and taught them in secret in her chambers in the basement. When the three stumbled upon her teaching, they were so impressed with her didactic skills that they allowed her to join them.

Hogwarts itself was nothing like its series version. Initially it was just a small castle with two towers, a main area that contained rooms for practice and a dining hall, a basement for storage and Slytherin's dungeons. All the amazing things such as the moving staircases, the room of requirements, the enchanted great hall ceiling were additions made by future headmasters. The founders were decent wizards and witches in their respective areas but nothing out of the ordinary.

#+begin_quote
  The Founders Relics encountered by Harry Potter are NOT consistent with tenth century artefacts. Nor is the narrative of the Founders that he learns typical of how actual people behave. However, the STORY of the Founders is one that has obviously been put to political use, and is well-established by the time Harry encounters it. In this essay, I will argue that the Founders Relics were created to bolster personal and communal political objectives during periods of turmoil following the ultimate separation of Wizarding Britain from the Muggle world, as part of a wider cultural phenomenon which imagined the Hogwarts Four as the founders of a nation.(no seriously, I swear the argument makes sense)

*** I think people didn't like my approach to him because I didn't give him a cool story like the rest. So, here we go, just for you:

Goblins are partially right about the fact that Godric stole their sword but not entirely right. One night at a pub, Godric was bragging as usual about his deeds when a particularly aggressive goblin called him out on his bullshit. Godric verbally retaliated which did not fall well on the goblin. Knowing that the goblin was intending to assassinate him that night he decided to intimidate him with his wand, something goblin warriors didn't have. However his wand, as he was pointing it to the scared goblin, slipped through his fingers and upon hitting the ground, it destroyed the entire pub and he picked up the sword from the goblin dead under the collapsed roof. What goblins didn't know was that the sword, much like the later Elder Wand, switched its allegiance to the one who defeated its current master. Thus Godric Gryffindor got the nickname as "Godric the bane of the goblins" and the sword forever entered his possession.

**** Yeah, but you just made Gryffindor a charlatan, all the others are competent in their own areas, but you made Godric some weakling with delusions of grandeur, him being human would be something like he was way too brash and would belittle others that didn't fit his idea of bravery.

He had an extremely op sword, and his whole idea was martial I doubt if he was some weak coward his students wouldn't have realized it.
