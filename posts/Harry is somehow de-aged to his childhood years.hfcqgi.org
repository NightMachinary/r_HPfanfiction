This idea has been in my head for a while and is definately something that is light-hearted and not super serious. I hope that you take some time out of your day/night to give this a go.

Anyway, the general gist that I have so far is that;

1 - Harry is de-aged back to his childhood years (In Hogwarts, 4th, 5th year) - his memories are either locked away or simply forgotten.

2 - Some girls have some sort of affection to him and baby him and coddle him. E.G; Luna, Hermione, Ginny

3 - The power of 'maternal' love is the power that Voldemort does not know

4 - The main kink/trope in this is Gentle Momdom - I hope you know what that means - and Harry is not exactly paired with them, but technically is.

5 - Depending on what girls you bring into the fold - it can be any girl, I'm not too picky, hell it can even be Minerva or Narcissa - they have different 'roles' for the mother role. Hermione is strict and protective, Ginny will be coddling and smothering him with affection.

So, if this does interest you, I do hope that you give it a go and place it in the comments below.

If someone makes this a fanfic and uploads it, you are free to do so, just give everyone on this reddit some credit for it.

Thanks.
