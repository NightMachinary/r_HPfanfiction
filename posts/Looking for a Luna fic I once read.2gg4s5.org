I told a friend that I would link them to one of my favorite Luna character sketches, but I realized I have no idea where I read it or how I found it since I tend to read slash from rec lists.

What I remember it is a one-shot, epilogue compliant (she is married to Scamander), and it was focused around the dress she keeps in the back of her closet, from the ball she went to with Harry. Not because she is in love with Harry, but because it is the only time in her life, including her marriage, where she was someone's first choice.

It is clearly a bit angsty, but it was somehow kind of sad but still very Luna.

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

*** I remember it longer, I remember it being more "Luna," but yeah, I think it is. I must have read it a long, long time ago. Thank you

*** She really is, and I can't find Luna centric rec lists. When she is done properly it tends to be a really, really good read.
