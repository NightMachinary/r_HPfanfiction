It always bothered me in canon that Hermione got away scot-free for things like the magical contract in OOTP, bullying Harry into tutoring the school (and he's essentially the fall guy), and confunding McLaggen and attacking Ron with birds. Are there any fics where she has to deal with the consequences of these actions. Preferably with decent character growth.

**** I don't like out when she goes all "I know best and I make decisions for your own good". (Like the broom thing or the DA) But I do like the fact that she has the potential to be more radical and set aside rules and morals. Like second year when she was willing to steal and work for weeks to brew a restricted potion to get information on whoever wanted to MURDER her and people of her 'kind '.

But yea, not many fics give her a reality check without resorting to stupid bashing.

** There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/96i42t/hermione_critical_fanfiction/][a thread along these lines]] several months ago, and there were some recs there.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/96i42t/hermione_critical_fanfiction/e419p97?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][My take on that thread]] hasn't really changed: there are a plenty of fics forcing Hermione to confront her flaws, but they are usually the wrong flaws, derived from a very fanon-driven characterisation. Her canon flaws are complex, hard to write well, and are virtues half the time.

Also, even when a fic does get her flaws reasonably right, most of the time the one who confronts her with her flaws is Smart!Independent!Gray!Powerful!Harry, it's done in the most condescending manner possible, and the end result is Harry displaying all those things that are considered "flaws" when Hermione does them.

I'd say that linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) does a good job. While the traits that were flaws in Gryffindor were the very ones she had to turn up to 11 to survive and thrive in Slytherin, her friends /do/ call her out on her trying to run their lives for their own good.

*** What about her absolute tactlessness? Telling a grieving Lavender that Divination was illogical, or crowing about being right about the Potions book when Dumbledore had just died (and certainly not apologizing for being wrong about Draco)? I think this flaw could be shown quite simply. There could be a career or alliance Hermione was trying to make, and her social maladroitness makes her bomb this hard.

Her hypocrisy regarding herself breaking rules vs others breaking them (eg Harry pretending to dose Ron with Felix Felicis vs Hermione confunding Cormac) could be simply confronted by adding a scene to canon where Harry has to declare the tryout results invalid due to cheating.

**** Good examples, but writing those flaws requires setting up a fairly complex scenario, writing Hermione fumbling it without descending into bashing, then writing Hermione being called out without having the person doing it come off twice as bad, and then, finally, having some kind of a resolution where Hermione learns from the experience.

Not a big percent of fanfic writers can do that even moderately well.

************* Hermione needed him as the leader for the DA because she couldn't get as much sway with the students and she was less talented in defense against the dark arts. The speech he gave about fighting the dark arts ties into that charisma I was speaking of. Hermione might be logical, but Harry appealed to their emotions as well.

Harry was a leader of the trio. He convinced them to help save the philosophers stone.

He solved the mystery of the chamber.

He was a triwizard champion.

The led the DA.

He was the freaking symbol for the resistance.

Harry did not accomplish these things by himself. He had Hermione help with research and other friends for support. That's the thing. He had delegation and support and was a rallying point for various events. When was Hermione the same?

I'm not trying to bash her character. I just feel Rowling never gave her character development in the right direction because she wanted easy exposition.

If Harry was minister, then Hermione was his Senior Undersecretary.

************** Most of what you describe has nothing to do with charisma and everything to do with reputation, some of it earned (TWT Champion, confronting Voldemort, Quiddich seeker) some unearned (BWL). Even if Harry were mute and had a face only a mother could love, he'd still be a symboland a rallying point, because Trelawney made a prophecy and Voldemort chose Harry over Neville a decade and a half prior.

The two things that are actually relevant are the claims about Harry's speech about fighting Dark Arts---and you'll have to be a bit more specific about that, since I, for one, don't remember it---and the bit about Harry convincing his friends to go on adventures with him. Sure, Harry gets Ron and Hermione into things; Hermione gets Harry and Ron into things. Since stuff keeps happening to Harry, Harry has more things to get his friends into.

At this point, it's not about bashing or not bashing Hermione, since we agree that she is not very ministerial at 18. It's about some leadership ability and charisma that people insist on ascribing to Harry that he doesn't actually display much of either in canon.

*************** You're interpreting it wrong. Rowling is terrible at characterization, I'll give you that. But she pretty much has Harry as a leader in canon in his later years. The trio

It's not just the fame. While that was a draw, it is implied his personality kept them coming. They challenged him once at Hogs Head. They did not do so again, with the exception of Marietta ratting them out. Heck even Pottermore acknowledges him as the leader of the DA.

It's like arguing Neville didn't show leadership because most of it happened off screen in book seven. It still happened.

I do agree canon Harry is a bit of a disappointment though.

**************** Your first paragraph got cut off, it looks like. However, it seems to me that I am trying to read Harry as Rowling characterised him, whereas you are trying to read him as you /wish/ she'd characterised him.

I think that you are reading teaching DA as something a lot more leaderly than it was. All he did was get up in front of a bunch of students, show them a spell, then help them individually---with Hermione doing the organising behind the scenes. Sure, nobody challenged him for leadership. Why would they want to in the first place?

It's not like he was actually leading them into battle---and the one time he did, it was a disaster.

You also seem to be arguing that Rowling (who you also claim is bad at this sort of thing) implied that it was Harry's /personality/ that kept them coming. Not the utility of free DADA lessons with OWLs looming and Umbridge being useless. Not an opportunity to hang out with friends and engage in fun activities without the Inquisitorial Squad breathing down their necks. Not a sense of control in an increasingly scary world. His personality.

In the end, the whole DA arc is more evidence in favour of Hermione's leadership ability, not Harry's: she set out to start a student militia at Hogwarts and get herself and her friends as ready to fight as they can be (and pass OWLs). In order to do so, she found the right person to front it (both for reputation and combat ability) and convinced him to do it; she recruited the initial group; and she did what she could to safeguard the militia. In fact, her biggest leadership failure was not forcibly restraining Harry from going to the Department of Mysteries the moment his back was turned.

As for how to feel about canon Harry, I am sorry that he is a disappointment to you. I think he's fine as he is.

I'm not trying to take away from her. She did so much in the books. Who do people turn to in the DA if they have a question? Is it Hermione, or is it Harry? Who decides the curriculum? In the final battle who did the group give their loyalty and follow the instructions of?

The DA is her brainchild and she definitely did the most work, but she did not end up leading it.

******************** A better analogy would be that Hermione was the school principal/headmistress and Harry was a teacher.

Loosely, "teaching" can comprise some tasks that are about expertise (communicating material, answering questions, planning the curriculum, setting up activities) and some tasks that are associated with leadership (motivating, disciplining, managing assistants). The setting Harry taught in was all about "expertise" and not at all about "leadership": he didn't have to motivate anyone (his reputation, Hermione, OWL pressure, and peer pressure did it for him), Hermione took care of the disciplining (without telling anyone), and he didn't need to manage any assistants.

So, no, "teaching" doesn't automatically translate to "leadership". In DA, Harry did the "expertise" tasks, and Hermione all the "leadership" tasks.

If by "final battle", you mean DoM, that wasn't DA, that was only Harry's close friends; it was also a test of Harry's leadership at anything but the most basic, tactical level, and he failed utterly. If you mean Battle of Hogwarts, the defenders would have listened to any of the trio, because they knew that the trio were on a mission from Dumbledore and knew things the rest of the Order didn't, not any sort of personal charisma or political skill.
