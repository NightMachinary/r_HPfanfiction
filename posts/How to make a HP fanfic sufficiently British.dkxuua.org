For us non-British fanfic writers, what are some good ways to add nice touches of authentic British-ness to our HP fics?Anyone got good slang words, insults, words for everyday items etc?

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm from New Zealand, not the US. So just to make it more confusing I guess NZ language is roughly based on British English, but also influences from the US and our own made up words and slang. So sometimes I have no idea what is British or what is American English. All these specific examples have been really helpful, thanks.


** Sounding British isn't just a matter of getting the right vocabulary words. I've seen some authors Find + Replace specific words in their fics to be more British, and it doesn't always work. The end product comes across as really weird dialogue, and doesn't fit with sentence structures and speech patterns that are clearly American, with some random Brit-ified jargon scattered through to make it look "authentic".

Replace "shit" with "shite" and "ass" with "arse" looks weird when the rest of sentence sounds like American action movie speak.

#+begin_quote
  "This place is a shitehole! I swear to Christ I'm gonna kick his arse!"
#+end_quote

Getting that structure and syntax right is what makes British characters feel more British, and Hogwarts more like a timeless classic boarding school and not some TV high school with a Catholic uniform aesthetic. Good dialogue especially highlights certain characters - the well-educated, well-spoken, or the pompous wannabe intellectuals. Without the author having to drop it to the audience by straight-up saying, "Oh my god, Sansa, she's the smartest person I know!!!"

Here are some sentence structures that might help your dialogue sound more authentic.

Different use of contractions in UK and UK English.

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "You'll not be needing that wand today, Potter."

  - US: "You're not gonna need that wand today, Potter."
#+end_quote

Different use of conjunctions:

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "Deducting house points is my duty, as I am this year's Head Boy."

  - US: "Deducting house points is my duty, because I am this year's Head Boy."
#+end_quote

And some other things like "From whom"/"To which".

#+begin_quote

  - UK: "You received this information... from whom?" said Snape harshly, glaring at Hermione with beady eyes. To which Hermione could form no response.

  - US: "Where did you get this information from?" asked Snape, glaring at Hermione with beady eyes.

** I'm going to agree with other authors who've said the best idea is to concentrate on not sounding American rather than trying to sound British.

Imagine if the situation were reversed and Harry Potter was set in America. Now imagine your horror at every character from the North East sounding like a New York cab driver, with the occasional stereotype Jew in there for good measure; every Californian being ridiculously cool and tanned, and any character from south of the Mason-Dixon greeting people with "Hip diggety-dawg! It's rootin' tootin' good to see y'all".

If you try to do British slang and regional dialogue you will get it wrong. Judging by the commenter advising you to use "bruv", I'd say a lot of Brits would get it wrong too. [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] has already pointed out that slang is more complex and structured than you would expect. Add in regional variants and class variants and you're in a minefield. I've lived in NW England for 18 years, Edinburgh (central-belt Scotland) for nine and London for... the rest, and I like to think I know English pretty well, but if I were to write a story that tried to accurately portray the speech patterns in a school based in the Highlands of Scotland, with pupils from all parts of the UK (and nearby?), from all classes and across seven years, with teachers even more diverse than that... I'd spend a lot of time researching it.

Luckily, JKR pretty much skipped the problem and everyone sounds like the sort of middle to upper middle-class kid you'd find in a typical talent agency. Funny that.

** A couple of offhanded things:

I've seen people complain before about how easy firearms seem to be to get hold of in fic, which I'd definitely agree with. (although Vernon Dursley somehow does mysteriously get one in canon, in a scene that's always bugged me. What, respectable middle manager Vernon knows gun runners?)

One of my absolute pet peeves? People referring to "little league Quidditch". Maybe "under 11s quidditch team" might work better.

I do think it's worth bearing in mind that a few of the turns of phrase that some people might pick up on sounding pretty American ("I've gotta go do this") or some of the other comments talking about conjunctions or other broader things about phrasing) are probably okay under some circumstances. Many modern Brits would speak like that without a second thought; decades of cross pollination with American pop culture will do that for you! So especially for muggleborn characters who are more likely to see American films and tv, I really wouldn't bat an eyelid at that.

Also, if you're not sure about it... Never try to write out an accent. To be honest, I lean towards never writing one out full stop.

I agree with other posts that a) you'd do much better to avoid obvious americanisms than slapping what you think are arbitrary britishisms in - it can just read as /way/ too forced sometimes. A britpicker is also probably a good idea for anything longer, especially if you're worried about it. (PM me, I'd be open to it!) But I think it's also worth mentioning that as long as the rest of a fic is well written? I don't normally find myself really caring, to be honest. If it's particularly glaring I might take note, and I try to work out as I go whether an author is British or not, but it's never stopped me reading, and I'm pretty picky.

**** I'd always read that as Vernon borrowing it along with the shack and boat.

I think it also fits if Vernon had picked one up years ago for bird hunting which he'd acquired in hopes it'd help him rub elbows with important clients and executives, then never learned how to handle it and never ended up getting to make any connections of that sort, because it would be so very Vernon.

But I wasn't clear on gun ownership re: sport hunting between the US and UK at the time, and I've less idea how that'd work back in the 1980s when Vernon would've presumably bought the thing then left it abandoned in the attic behind a bunch of other crap he wasted money on in his mostly fruitless attempts to climb socially.

Slang is not just a "we use "X" instead of "Y" to mean "BLAH"

Slang studies are an entire Linguistic topic that people spend years studying. there is grammar and syntax rules that you need to follow. It's why you can tell when a parent is just parroting what they hear young kids say, vs an adult who has an actual connection with the culture.

So unless you can actually immerse yourself in the culture of where you're writing about, it's easier to get someone who has actual contact with that culture/sub-culture to nitpick the details.

**** Exactly. And many times the same word can have different connotations. For example, the word "quite". In British, when it is used to modify an adjective that has degrees to it (e.g. "quite good", "quite silly", "quite interesting"), it's usually analogous to the American, "pretty", as in "pretty good", "pretty fun", etc.\\
However, Americans use it analogously to "very". "Quite good" -> "very good", etc.\\
Since I use "quite" a lot as an American, I have to keep an eye out for it in my Harry Potter fics because I don't want British characters to use the word as an American would!

Friends are rude to each other, often really insultingly so. You're polite to people you don't know or actively dislike.

The weather here is the ultimate safe topic of conversation. If you're ever struggling to fill an awkward silence then plenty of people will ask if you think it might rain later.

Understatement, there is a (in)famous situation when a British military officer said they were in a bit of a sticky situation. To any Brit this means he's utterly fucked. The American on the end of the line thought that meant they would be fine. Americans come across as loud and energetic compared to a lot of Brits.

** The key to authenticity I think is a certain sense of down to earth touch. Many people looking from the outside-in see a culture's most obvious differences, or rather their stereotypes. As an example, many would focus on something like 'Britishisms' or the use of different slang because that would come up more often. And so they end up overtly throwing them into stories written by outsiders to the culture, making the whole thing clunky and inorganic.

But the real touches that make something 'authentic' are far more subtle. The different Christmas traditions, the activities children participate in or discuss, the views on different members of their own culture, etc. These are things Rowling honestly somewhat blows herself, particularly in GoF with how she stereotypes much of the European wizarding communities.

I guess the shorter way of parsing this is that its not about the big differences, but the synergy of all the differences that makes up the culture. You need to see how individuals simply live and act/react in their daily lives. Best way to do that, in the case of the British, is to watch some of their television programs.

Just my thoughts though.

** Really, rather than trying to add excessive or random "british-isms" to a story, I'd recommend avoiding "american-isms" instead.

Nothing is more jarring, even in a great story, than seeing Mrs Weasley called "mom". Than having Harry's fever described as "104 degrees". Than having Ginny wearing a "tank top". Than having Harry tripping over the "sidewalk". It pulls me out of the story, and I actually find changes the whole flavour of the story in my head.

So... get a Brit picker. I'm not British, but moved to Britain at 21 and lived there for several years. There are so, so many tiny random things they say differently that took me sometimes years to realise. Instead of "I've got heaps to do" they say "I've got loads to do". Instead of "I feel sick" it's "I feel ill". Honestly, some of them I didn't realise were different until I moved back home and got laughed at for saying "hiya" as a greeting.

Don't stress about little things. British people still say sick, just will commonly say “I feel ill” where that would never have naturally come out of my mouth prior to moving to the uk.

****** My American understanding of a tank top is as a mostly womens' garment, made of similar material as a t-shirt, worn in similar contexts as a t-shirt, consisting of a tube of fabric, sometimes form-fitting, sometimes made with molded cups or a "shelf bra", and held up by thin straps over the shoulders. Lose the straps, and the garment becomes a tube top. Obviously, women above a certain bra size can't wear tank tops, not without displaying their industrial strength boob harnesses. Such women usually go for t-shirts, or other sleeveless styles.

There are tank tops for men, but they are technically undershirts, and a man wearing a tank top instead of a t-shirt is dressing even more casually then a woman wearing a tank top.

Ultimately, though, what [[/u/FloreatCastellum][u/FloreatCastellum]] said elsewhere in this thread. Cultural differences like what we eat/drink and what our homes are like and what kinds of shops are available (very few British people, for example, have ever been near Harrods let alone shopped there) are just as important as remembering to use "tap" instead of "faucet", "street" instead of "block", "torch" instead of "flashlight", or "boot" instead of "trunk".

** I think it depends on what your goal is in it - the easiest approach, in my opinion, would be to start by smoothing out the larger cultural differences.

For instance, let's take the difference with the US. If you've got a UK with a ton of guns lying around, healthcare dynamics similar to the US, and everyone using $s, that'll be the most jarring. I would focus on those first - because getting them wrong it wouldn't matter if you got little details right.

After that is where you get more into the nitpicky aspects - words/sentences to change up slightly, and that's where it gets a bit harder to say. In a sense, it matters how important it is to people reading that Harry Potter is set in the UK - I've mentioned before that many of the britpicking doesn't really matter to me, because when I was reading it I kinda lumped in the UK/America into 'English' (I started the series in French first - it's only after book 6 that I really had a good grasp of english that I would have noticed those subtle differences).

So stuff like 'Mom vs mum', 'sweater vs jumper', 'trash vs rubbish' - that's all basically the same to me - whereas for others, they wouldn't be. What /does/ stand out more in the language of a fanfic is where it looks like it might have been taken from an action movie - so tons of normal/modern american curses, use of things like 'tank tops', or the like.

If you /are/ interested in switching up words after you've gone through the cultural smoothing, it might be worth doing some googling around. There's sites that love to list out/point out such wording differences - eg, [[https://www.spellzone.com/blog/Sixty_American_English_Words_and_their_British_English_Counterparts.htm][here's one]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_American_and_British_English][perhaps wikipedia]]. I wouldn't just copy/paste those in without some thought, but it'd be a way to not just pester someone british all the time ;)

** It's hard to think of words and things we use that no one else does...

•We dont use 'bloody' in every other sentence •Some spellings of words: arse instead of ass, colourful instead of colorful and things like that. •Insults: most insults we really use are curses (speaking as a seventeen year old) - "you're a C/nt/tw/t/w*nker)." •Something else is accents and similar: we'll sometimes pronounce things different and miss off 'h's and 't's : "Oi! That 'urt, mate!" Not all the time, and I'm not positive if this is particular to Manchester.

Hope that's enough :)

Edited to add:

Money! Personally, it gets to me when currency gets mixed up: £ not $/€ etc. pounds/pence or quid as slang for pound, and just p for pence. "I've only got 10 quid, sorry, do you have any change? I need 50p."

This one's good advice. The UK got currency decimalization in 1971, so in any fics set before that, Brits would be using the pounds/shilling/pence system. Young Pre-Hogwarts Lily and Snape living in Cokeworth would be using the old currency system, since their date of birth was 1960.

And it's also a good tip to watch for figurative language using currency. A wizard would not be saying "penny for your thoughts", because they use Knuts. A British muggleborn would not compare a wizarding Sickle as "the size of a nickel".

***** Tom Riddle's generation would also be using the £/s/d system, with the more exotic pre-decimalization coins like halfpence, tuppence, and sixpence.

And then you have to throw in historical inflation, because a random orphan kid like Tom would never have a cheeky £10 saved under his mattress for a rainy day. That's £600 in today's money.

*** Oh boy. I hadn't even thought about money.

"Quid" is not a synonym for "Pound". One quid might equal one pound but the circumstances where you'd say "quid" are very different to ones where you'd say "pound".

And there was one story I read where the author had obviously done a little research and used "monkey" and "pony" for £500 and £25 respectively. Yeeeess..... but that's very much Cockney slang (the terms comes from the symbols on the 500 rupee and 25 rupee notes during the latter days of empire if you're interested). You won't hear those words used outside TV soap operas.

We *do* use "a grand" for £1000, and "tenner" for £10 is pretty typical.

Another story has something like "Harry still had some Muggle pounds." No way would Harry be thinking that. "Harry still had some Muggle money" or "Muggle cash" would be better.

*** Sort of. For some things.

Weight can be in either Stone (not pounds) or kilos. For the 90's, use stone.

Milk and beer come in pints (though are labelled in ml), all other liquids come in litres. We pretty much never use gallons, except when buying cider straight from the farm (may have just been my childhood, not a standard thing)

Money is in pounds, but in the 90's older people would still remember the shilling and talk about how much better it was (they were of course wrong)

Length of most things is in meters, except for the human body which is in feet for height, and inches for circumstance. Fabric was sold in the 90's with the width in inches (45" or 60") and length in meters, but old patterns used yards for the length. Which all makes perfect sense of course...

Basically, the generation born in the 50's used imperial, and were having kids in the 70's and 80's, whom they taught the imperial system to, but by the 80's, schools had moved over to metric so the generation who went to Hogwarts at 11 in the 90's had about the worst of an utterly confusing mishmash of metric and imperial that is still dying out today. And of course wizards have their own mess of imperial, so muggleborn kids had a complete hodgepodge of random units. Muggle studies almost certainly had to have an entire module on conversions between the various systems.

Also, UK imperial measures are different from US measures. A US pint is less than half a litre (as in 473 ml), and a UK pint is 568 ml.\\
Make sure you use UK imperial if using imperial. The reason the original (as in UK version of the) books use imperial, it is because the magical side hasn't metrified at all, whereas in the muggle UK a lot is metric

** Not gonna lie its is a bonus for an non British writer to fully encapsulate the feeling of the UK.

Top tips from a born and bread Londoner:

1) Don't make your characters say 'Shite' Bruv Harry lived in Surry, which isnt far from London and plus I have been to Surrey many times we speak the same slang.

And we do make dark comedy. We say dark things for banter, there is a good word for you. Banter, it's what Ron and Harry do. And cuss each others families out. I know if HP was more realistic some mugglevorns Hufflepuff would have crossed out Harry's family and called him a c*n. I would say it but the mods have been watching me.

Oh and try to include Bruv, beef things like that. Now I ain't been to America since I was a kid so I dont know of you have this, but in the nineties sayings like Wagwan were popular especially in S/SE London which is where I'm from. Which is I assume where Dean Thomas is from so dont make him say cheerio.

2) Movements is important. For example kids dont high five, we spud each other or in simpler terms a judge with the fist tilted upwards and we do it with force ( I'm 16 I'm giving you minor details) and also teens particularly have sex. I'm not saying to describe it, God no but especially in public schools seeing a chavy girl get pregnant before her GCSE's was mad.

And dont underestimate chavs, they are in Hogwarts I know it.

4) Sports. I know you have Quidditch. But some of you Americans make NFL things which I have no idea on, and likewise with a lot of UK readers. We dont care about some NFL player who played for Minnesota Wolves or whatever, speak to is woth Football, not b tec Rugby, FOOTBALL. And at that time Harry might have liked Arsenal or Man U. Personally I lean more towards Liverpool but that's because I support them myself.

5) Please. Please dont say mom. It hurts me everytime reading Harry talk like a yank. For example:

Harry woke up and saw a strange woman with lo g red hair. "MOM? IS THAT YOU? MOM?"

Or a personal favourite of mine in a WBWL fic

"Mom, you left me alone for all those years. And now I'm back. Back to kick some ass!"

We dont say things like that. We just dont.

6) Who actually drinks coffe in England. Barely anyone. Even immigrants dont drink coffe. As an Albanian we drink Turkish coffe which is different from American coffe, or we drink the most popular drink TEA.

PG, Earl grey, some dutty Tesco brand. TEA IS OUR DRINK!

7) Finally dont over do it with British-isms. Be low key about it and if your stuck dont be afraid to ask.

How this helps and remember TEA!

*** Everything you have recommended has ignored the class realities of the UK and the environment Harry grew up in. He was in a middle class suburban area in the 80s and his cousin was being sent to a public school. They were not using inner city slang like wagwan and bruv. This is what I mean when I say slang is nuanced and structured - I have no doubt that this was your experience growing up, but if I came across it in a fic I would assume it was a non Brit trying too hard.

Plus... people definitely drink coffee here. I am baffled that you could grow up in London and not see the starbucks/Costa on every corner.

**** Ite to be fair you are right. And yh I do see alot of Starbicks and Costa but the thing is when o go in there most people get a Latte rather than an actual coffee. And it really depends how far in Surrey as there are some bits that overlap with London. And outskirts of London still use slang.

However you are right about slang in the nineties, I have no clue at all. And tbf it's not exactly common knowledge for some slang we use. However surely at that time there were a few Catholic schools, in my area growing up we had around 15.
