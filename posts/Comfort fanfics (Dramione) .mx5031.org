Hi, I'm looking for some of those I call "comfort fanfics" and since it's been a while, I'm searching for something about Dramione (pls don't come at me). What are "comfort fanfics" for me?

- IC characters
- Good writing
- A good number of chapters to actually develop the story so it's natural and plausible (not like "She noticed how handsome he was" on the 3rd line of chapter 1)
- Coherence with the HPuniverse rules (there can be some little "bending the rules" but not huge breaks). Here I'm talking more about details, important details, like the things we know about the use of magic, to give you an idea.
- Redemption and change for Draco, but in a plausible way. I prefer if the romance doesn't start from simple physical attraction that overcomes their huge differences so it's important that Draco's character understands his mistakes, changes his beliefs and evolves.
- Set during Hogwarts years, like a seventh alternate year where almost nothing bad (= Voldemort) happens or a year after the war where they go back to Hogwarts to complete their studies (I know fixing Hogwarts actually took 10 years but in this case it doesn't bother me if the fic says two years or even one). It is preferable that the story happens at Hogwarts mainly, but of course if there are some occasions where characters have to leave (like Christmas break) it's completely ok.
- I enjoy school life, routine, classes, studying and all this very fun stuff.
- No mysteries, or new dark magic issues they have to solve, no danger, just friendship/relationship related plot
- As long as there's the ship I'm looking for (Dramione in this case), other pairings don't have to be Canon. I actually love many non-canon parings.
- Props if the plot is original in terms of romantic situations and doesn't make a large use of clich√©s.

I guess that's all, I know such a request might sound weird but it's a kind of fanfic that really comforts me when I just need to relax. To my surprise I've read various fics like this through the years (not in English), some of them being actually good, but I've read them again and again and again and now I'm looking for something new. I hope you can help me, thank you very much!!!^{^}


** Linkao3(Tea with Mrs. Granger) fits your request. Draco has to undergo considerable changes before Hermione even considers a friendship with him. He apologizes to not just Hermione but everyone he has insulted over the years. Slow burn with the actual pairing in the sequel, after the redemption arc./Not Hogwarts/ unfortunately, but there are valid reasons for it.

** Isolation. To lazy to link but its near the top of the most reviewed list.

*** Uh. How could this be comforting? A relationship based on Stockholm and Reverse Stockholm syndrome where physical attraction overcomes prejudice for a specific individual rather than the other way around. Hermione in this one is either a Saint or some kind of masochist with how often she is hurt. Draco remains a nazi despite the Death Eaters gunning for him. Absolutely terrible.

**** You're talking about the fanfic proposed in the comment or my post? Because if it's about my post you're reminding me I should add a point regarding Draco's character. I don't like Dramione fanfics based on pure physical and sexual attraction, I actually enjoy those where Draco's character changes and redempts himself before the romance begins. I thought the points about good writing and plausible plot already involved that but maybe I should add a specific one.

***** I was talking about Isolation. It is an counter-example of sorts to your request even if the writing is technically sound.
