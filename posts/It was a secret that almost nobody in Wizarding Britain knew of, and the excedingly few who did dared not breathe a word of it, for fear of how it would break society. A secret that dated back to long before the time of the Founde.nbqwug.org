A secret that would shatter the worldview of Harry Potter, when he joined the exclusive number who knew of it.

Because I feel that there just aren't enough ancient conspiracy fics out there.

As for what the secret is, it could be anything. From the true fate of King Arthur, to wizards and witches being descendants of aliens that bred with humans, to House Elves being the secret masterminds of the world, go crazy.

** That the Ministry of Magic really is just a Ministry, albeit one that answers directly to the Queen due to Statute of Secrecy restrictions. She tends to be really hands off about the whole thing, but ultimately the Minister answers to her and her alone. The Wizengamot may table legislation, but it's the Queen that ultimately signs off on it, not them.

As for the Goblins, they're a financial institution and are allowed a massive amount of leeway because they're the ones keeping a lid on the return of the fae.

The ICW's main office is not in New York at all, but rather on a nice little planet circling a distant star.

Hogwarts actually /is/ the most secure building in England. It's the only one with a solid defence against metaphysical creatures and concepts that live off the souls of the unwary.

** I read a great one - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5423450/1/Empty-Classrooms][Empty Classrooms]]

It had the theory that magic was dying (and not just because theres been two wars killing the magical population).

Seen through the eyes of Remus Lupin (and written as a dissertation) and then in the future with Hermione continuing his research.

It was a brilliant concept and well written. Honestly I would love to read something along the lines of that again or a continuation or something.

** There is no real difference between wizards and muggles. Muggles are simply people who haven't ever displayed accidental magic, other than muggleborns, and have thus gone ignored. An average muggle could grow just as powerful as the average “wizard” of trained.

This obviously doesn't follow canon in many ways and would be more of an AU, but it's a secret that could break both wizard and muggle societies.

*** On that note, I liked one of the theories that appeared at some point. Both Muggles and wizards have a common +descendant+ ancestor. As Dumbledore puts it, there's magic in everything such as words, music, love so even Muggles are capable of mundane magic. The first forms of magic were personal charm/charisma where a person was able to bend others to their will by making them feel good and curses where someone would use words that would make other feel uncomfortable or wish them an ill-fate that would sometimes prove to be true. Soon people realized that with a desire strong enough they could bend nature to their will. Dances would cause rain, a combination of words would cause a sick person to feel better, they could draw paintings that would cause hunters to be lucky in their endeavors while gatherers could find proper resources of food. They could protect the loved ones through rituals and hold back an enemy. Some people were more practical and just relied on circumstances but some were more superstitious and practiced such rituals more often. And the more they practiced such rituals, the more sensitive they became to nature and how to harness its powers. Those people evolved into the modern-day wizards.

**** Hate on it all you want. I am normally not a big fan of mpreg either.

But Birth of a Dancing Star stands out to me bc it is a bona-fide mystery story. It is a big part of why I like Harry Potter - the books are (among other things) mystery books.

Birth of a Dancing Star is not without flaws, there are stretches where Snape reminds me of a youth pastor in the midwestern USA, but it does manages to capture that mystery story spirit, which is something a lot of fanfics fail to do.
