Hoping somebody will be able to help me find this as it popped into my head and wont leave me alone until i find it :(

- It was a crossover with lotr
- Harry Ron hermione and Ginny (i think) used the chamber of secrets and preformed power enhancing rituals on themselves. (pretty sure using captured death eaters, an effect of the ritual was a tattoo and the ritual could only be used twice)
- After leaving gringots theres a battle in diagon ally, theres something to do with a spell and 3 books which hermione brought with her that sends harry off to the lotr world.
- When he gets there he cant use magic for quite a while
- He was about to create a staff before he ended up in lotr world and i think he finishes it there.
- I think he did some weird occlumency ritual and some strange stuff ends up happening in it.

The only other thing i can remember is i found it through google as it wasn't on fanfiction.net any help finding this would be appreciated.
