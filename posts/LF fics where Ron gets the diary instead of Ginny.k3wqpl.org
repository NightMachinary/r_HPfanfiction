**** Hermione is even less likely to notice than Ginny, unless the plot decided differently of course. Ginny grew up with a father who dealt with malicious enchanted objects, Hermione has known about magic for one year. And as soon as she DID start to suspect something, like with Ginny, she'd be easily manipulated into hiding it. She lied to Dumbledore, Mcgonagall, and Snape so the boys wouldn't get into trouble over the troll, and was terrified of expulsion.

** "hmm, a diary?" Ron asked as he flipped the leather book in his hands, "how strange."

He traced the name with his index finger as he pondered on what was for lunch.

"I want fish and chips-" he said to himself, "I think I'll go tell mum."

And with that, he threw the diary out of his window, causing it to fall on the head of a very greedy garden gnome.

To this day, the diary has yet to be found.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

So I figure if he used it at all it would be like shit im out of notes oh cool extra notebook. And then is like wtf its eating my ink in class wait no its talking back and the teacher is like......uhhh....ya...im confiscating your notebook.

Unless the teacher is Trawleny. Then the class is just her talking to the talking notebook. And when word gets out about how that was class a different teacher goes and confiscates it.

Well, I think it would be similar to Luna option, except with less conversation. It might be a bit close to bashing... but I somehow do not see Ron using the notebook a lot, except as spare notebooks for the first draft essays, Binns-time doodles, etc. On top of that, he is not usually the most hygiene-focused individual, so the Diary would get a taste of mud, grime and the full selection of Hogwarts meals.

tom might be a bit.... irritated. Having no one to vent on would contribute too, I think. Also, it's possible he'd spend most of the time buried under expired candy on the bottom of Ron's trunk, a victim-poor environment as it were.

**** Fair enough.

I find an application of Ron being a "normal teenage boy in a dorm room with less stringent oversight" to advance plot to be humorous. I do not see it as explictly bad - Ron might be the most well-adjusted of the Trio IMHO. As for quote reponses...

This is extrapolated from extraction scene, where the Dursley household was considered abnormally clean, and the scenes in movie Burrow. Not filthy, but something being dirty not as an immediate concern due to wizard robustness and the existence of cleaning spells.

Either simple negligence, or even Scabbers' escape stash. Interpret it how you will, but from my experience with young males, these things sometimes happen. Though I do admit this one was not well thought out - House Elves would not tolerate something like that, so it would be probably quickly cleaned up.

*** I think you're forgetting it's not just a notebook, it's a very charismatic future dark lord who very much wants to talk to someone. The diary didn't need someone to write in it to be able to write. All it'd need to do is to offer to help with his homework, play chess, and slowly encourage him to complain about things like Snape, the twins, Lockhart, Malfoy, etc, and Ron would be hooked before he knew it. Trouble is, Harry would know all about the diary from the very start, and they'd probably share it.

** watch him not even use it as a diary in the beginning tho lol:

he first uses it when he's in class, and has to take notes, so he pulls it out and is pissed that ‘the twins gave him disappearing ink' Then when Tom starts answering, Ron would be like. ‘Oh, your a magic book? Do you know what the answer to problem 2 is?”'

He'd probably think that a book talking back is suspicious though.. so reasonably he'd give it to a teacher or something. But let's say that's not the case,

He'd probably mostly accidentally pull it out to write notes then get frustrated that the ink disappears. Then maybe at one point he's just fooling around seeing if he can doodle a full broom before the ink disappears. Then Tom would be like. ‘ So... You like Quiditch?' Ron would probably start writing about Quiditch and see if the book knows more about it than he does. ( and when Tom (who I feel like probably didn't spend his time at Hogwarts playing Quiditch) gets lost, maybe Ron would explain it to him more) In the process it slowly addicts him and he starts spacing out and being confused as to why he's covered in ‘red paint' and feathers. He's worried he's the Heir of Slytherin, when He, Harry and Hermione are playing detective. Maybe he doesn't voice it though, cuz “that's impossible”. Harry and Hermione do notice Ron disappears sometimes, but they trust him, and don't even think he could be a suspect. As Ron becomes more worried he's the Heir, maybe he takes Hermione route and try's to search up in the library If the weasleys had anything to do with Salazar Slytherin. He finds nothing. Time passes. He tries to see if he can play chess with Tom. Maybe he's a worthy opponent. Harry sees Ron playing chess with a book, and Maybe Ron assumes Harry would turn it to a teacher and he doesn't want to get in trouble to holding onto a Talking book that he doesn't know where the brain is, so he's all like “yeah, I found it in the hall, pretty cool, right?” So Harry tries it out and Tom shows him that memory to frame Hagrid. Ron keeps searching with Harry and Hermione not knowing he's really just going after himself Lol. He doesn't realize it but he was getting addicted to the book, so he went through Harry's Trunk and snatched it back. Polyjuice potion time. While working in there Harry talks to Moaning Myrtle a bit and finds that two yellow eyes killed her, right there on that sink. They drink the polyjuice. Cat Hermione . They find nothing from Malfoy. Then Ron finds himself in the early morning standing infront of a petrified Hermione, before blanking out again and waking up in the common room. He's worried he's the Heir of Slytherin again. They follow the spiders But the Weasleys have no connection to Salazar Slytherin... soo he concludes... with his insecurities of not being able to live up to his brothers... that.. -gasp What if he's Adopted! Him worried about this new thing, along with maybe being the heir of Slytherin, and his friend being petrified maybe because of him, he might start to actually write to Tom.. like a diary. This gives Tom the strength to control Ron and stuff. ‘His Skeleton Will Lie in the Chamber Forvever' Dun dun dunnnnnnnnn Meanwhile Harry was just checking on Hermione and found that paper. The monster is a Baskilisk! He's now looking for his bestie, and runs into the teachers talking about the missing student.

Harry crouched around the corner, seeing Professor McGonagall, Madame Pomfrey, Lockheart, and Professor Snape. “A boy has been snatched off by the monster, Lockheart your moment has come at last “M-my moment?” “Weren't you saying just last night that you have known where the entrance to the chamber to the secrets” Snape said sharply. “That's settled we'll leave you to deal with the monster Gilderoy, you're skills after all are legendary” Professor McGonagall decided. “Very well, I'll just uh be in my office getting uh getting ready” he ran off. “Who is that the monsters taken, Minerva?” Madame Pomfrey asked. “Ronald Weasley” Harry's eyes widened. Dun dunnn dunnnnn

Harry is obviously all shocked. Hermione is Petrified, and Ron has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets. His two best friends?! Poor Harry :(

So Harry being the true Hero he is, decides, he must save his Friend. So he gets Lockheart. He goes to Moaning Myrtels bathroom because he remembers how she told him about her death. Which was 50 years ago, just like Tom said. Rip Hagrid in Askaban at the moment tho. So they go down there.

This is the part where Ron's broken wand would save the day- but he's not here right now. Soooooo I don't know how to go about this part. Maybe Lockheart just doesn't manage to snatch Harry's wand. But how do they get seperated then? Maybe Lockheart will just have to face off with the Baskilisk too. There are a few routes this can go on. One, where Lockheart actually remembers something from some person he stole memories from and conjures a rock into a rooster killing the Baskilisk and becoming an actual Hero. Lol. Two, where Lockheart dies by the Baskilisk's stare, Harry does his stuff. Three, where he's petrified , Harry does his stuff. Four, Lockheart manages to steal Harry's wand and when he tries to do Oblivate the wand just doesn't like him. ‘the wand chooses the wizard' so it backfires and separates them. Harry's wand flys back to him tho, Cuz we need Tom to do his ‘I am Lord Voldemort' thing. So Harry finds Ron.......dead? And he meets Tom, Harry is all like Tom Whyyyy Aren't You Helping me!!! >:( Tom states that no, Ron isn't dead. He snatches Harry's wand.

“Give me my wand Tom” “You won't be needing it” “We've got to go! We've got to save Ron!” “Im afraid i can't do that, Harry, you see as poor Ron Weasley grows Weaker I go stronger” “Yes, Harry, it was Ronald Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets” “No he wouldn't, he couldn't!” “It was Ron who set the baskilisk on the mud bloods and Filch's Cat, Ron who wrote the threatening messages on the walls” “He would never.. Why would he do that?” “Because I told him to” “It was tough of course, he is very stubborn.. but I managed to use him, not that he knew what he was doing, he was in a kind a trance, he was very skeptical of the Diary, but soon the power of the dairy interested him, I had to listen to lengthy explanations of the role of a keeper and a seeker, then eventually how he was scared he was a the heir of Slytherin, how he thought he didn't fit in with his family and how he felt overshadowed by being friends with the Boy who Lived”

Harry is shocked by all this. And he's shocked how he and Hermione didn't even notice how Ron could've been the one doing all this. He would've never thought it'd be Ron. So anyways Harry does his cool stuff. Stabs the snake, gets venom in his arm. Stabs a book. Ron's awake yay. Ron's stoked when he finds out the Book was what made him act as ‘the Heir' and he's not adopted, so that's a plus! And the ending plays out the same. Fawkes flies them outta there. Harry frees Dobby. Hermione is revived. No exams. But for Ron, with his inferiority complex may always feel like he should've known better than to keep a book that can Talk back. Cuz his Dad taught him better than that. So he'd hold this against himself probably :(
