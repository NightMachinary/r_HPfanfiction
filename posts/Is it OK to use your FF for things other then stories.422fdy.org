** Your profile on FFN can be used as a blog, and I don't think anyone particularly cares what is on there, including the FFN admins.

Putting that stuff as a story though would be a big no-no in my eyes.

*** Enough to stop reading? I mean, I've seen this sort of thing before, especially in author notes, but this example seemed more strange to me.

**** Maybe. If I like the story enough, I'll ignore it and keep reading. If it's just some filler crap that I'm reading because I'm bored, then I'll just close the tab and move on. I usually skip/skim author's notes anyways, so I might not even take notice of it.

I don't think an author who did that would remain on my favorites list. To be frank, it seems like a juvenile thing to do and the better authors tend to be in an older age group. It's like authors holding stories "hostage" until they get a certain number of reviews.

No, I wouldn't consider doing it.

***** One of the best and worst things about FF is that an writer can interact with their audience during the process. This /can/ lead to better stories, which is why I think author notes can be really great. I'm not talking about those notes which go off topic, or do things like say "will Harry get out of trouble, review to find out!" but ones which talk about process or question themes they want to focus on etc. I also think readers can help writers, posting questions about story holes or asking about minor characters or plot points which could be expanded upon, acting as a beta or editor basically.

This example is the most extreme version I have come across, but I don't think the reasons behind it are necessarily bad. What do you consider unacceptable in an author note? Do you have a line that makes you immediately drop a story, even if you really liked it?

Sometime the author note may be very meta, in that it is related to the story, but is not something that should be in the main body (for example, maybe a change in theme and why, or pointing out a plot hole that was filled, or maybe fanart.)

**** It's put me off certain authors just when they add a new "chapter" to a story to promote/announce a new thing they're working on. That's what following an author is for. (e: and I do mean outright promotion, not like a sneak peek first chapter at the end of a story which I do find okay. More like 'hey guess what I'm writing something new go check it out')

Something like that can go in an author note, not as a standalone chapter/update. I follow some of my favorite authors on Tumblr, so something I might actually help them with would likely happen off of FFN.

And, god how I would love it if authors stripped author notes out of completed stories. If they're (blessedly) consistent in their formatting, I'll download and do a search-and-replace to get rid of them. They ruin the flow.

*** I write a little myself (and I've posted a handful of stories), but I am no where near popular enough that I have ever had to think about it (my reviews number in the dozen in total, not the hundreds some have per story). Writing for me, is very much a past time, so I would never contaminate it with something outside the story like this. But for many (especially young) writers, FF is very much about the interaction as well.

Its an interesting viewpoint, as many authors and readers expect a degree of back and forth, if only in posting and answering reviews. This example I think is the most extreme version of this. Do you ever interact with your readers beyond the most basic of 'thank yous' for reviews? Would such and interaction influence where you would go with a story? Would you consider building on such an interaction to such an extent to talk about non-story things? And how do you decide any of the above? Do you, as a writer, have a set of rules, or do you just do what feels right at the time?

**** I'm not popular, either, but I have thought about this subject a bit anyway. I don't have a formal set of rules, but in general, I don't talk about myself or my personal life, unless it's relevant to the story in some way - for example, discussing inspiration/writing methods. I do discuss the story with reviewers who express interest, but I don't let it influence me anymore - my first story suffered a great deal from my trying to please reviewers (mostly unconsciously, but some conscious decisions...). However, I still take legitimate constructive criticism, and in fact, I recently had a reviewer point out a /huge/ plot hole, which was /majorly/ helpful. But talking about the story is as far as it goes - the story is why they're here, not me. Honestly? I prefer it that way. I'm there for the story, too, not to talk about me.

But to answer your second question, I don't actually find myself missing the interaction. Occasionally, when I hit a really thorny plot point and I'm doubting the story choices I've made, I miss having someone to talk it out with, but the vast majority of the time, I don't want that. I write for pleasure and for time to myself, so for the most part, I really enjoy writing alone. However, I am aware that my work would probably benefit from a beta, as I have a tendency to be long-winded (obviously), and I think writers who desire high interaction /should/ seek a beta; it's a /much/ more appropriate outlet than giving away pairings and plot points as prizes....

** From the FFN Content Guidelines:

#+begin_quote
  The chapter system is not to be used as placeholder for non-story content such as author notes. You can add short author notes to the beginning or at the end of stories but never as individual chapters

  ...

  *Failure to comply with site rules will result in the removal of stories and/or suspension of account.*

Honestly, it reflects not too well on the author that they put in such a chapter. Everyone has bouts of bad judgment, but all the same... and it /is/ technically against the rules.

Edit: I'll quickly add that it technically would be OK if they had an actual chapter and then included this... /thing/ at the end. I still would stop reading, though.

**** Of course FFN rules aren't enforced, but they reserve the right and all. I think it's mostly so they can take down anything that looks too much like solicitation and monetization.

I need a definition of "acceptable." I would stop reading (had I even begun reading the fic, for that matter). I would probably never look twice at that writer again (if I would even remember the guy/girl's name). In that sense, and socially/according to netiquette, it is unacceptable.

Legal? Can be gotten away with? Sure, it's legal, and they can get away with it (albeit against FFN strictures). I mean, if they want to risk being taken down by FFN, risk alienating their fanbase, and to essentially give away their story for two ideas and a school camp, that's their call. They can do whatever they want, so long as they don't (and I don't think this really does) endanger fanfics (HP in particular) and as long as this doesn't adversely affect me.

Although, this is pretty dishonest, and possibly unfair to the other students attending his/her school. But hey, I'm not them.

One more thing - there's something similar one can often see (I think it's to subtly ask for reviews) where authors have a "poll" to decide a pairing. Good for them. That type of thing also makes me question the worth of a story, and barely skirts around FFN guidelines (being semi-interactive and all, but not to the point that the guidelines specify).

1. Yes, I do write, my author's profile can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1549688/Zeitgeist84][here]].

2. I would wager I like pretty conventionally-told stories, my own writing can be used as a measuring stick as to what type of fics I read, as well.

3. I probably read less fanfic than the average poster on this subreddit, because I'm more a writer than a reader, but I still read quite a bit of original fiction.

4. Probably older than most other posters, but not enough for it to truly matter.

** I don't like it for two reasons. First I think you have your profile page or other media (twitter, facebook, blogs) for stuff like this, and making an update just with non-story related matters is against the rules and just a huge disappointment to the readers following the story.

Second I don't like the reward system. That the author is willing to change a pairing and include random prompts doesn't speak for the quality of the story. How can the author be serious about the plot, characters and relationships, when he's willing to just change a pairing on the whim of a reader? Shouldn't there be chemistry between two characters, small moments etc. leading to a relationship? Changing a pairing in the middle of the story could ruin all the build-up and character development. Offers like this make me wary.

*** The first point doesn't annoy me as much, as no one reads the author's page for changes. You might read it once, if you really like the author, but beyond that... The other reason is that fanfiction blocks links, so authors can't easily link their twitter etc. so I can see authors wanting to use their stories to rant/post other things. I have no objections to doing so in an author note.

However, I do agree with your second point, it was the prizes themselves which annoyed me the most. If you are serious about a pair enough to feature them, there should be some sort of build up. What if the prompts are crap? The only prize I thought was reasonable was the pre read, but even that feels awfully like a beta without the two way input.

I was fine with that because it could have an impact on the story

what your example shows is an author who did it wrong. I think that if this were me, I would quit reading. for two reasons. ONE, his "rewards" PUNISHED other people. giving early access to random fans who happen to read that chapter? what about that one person who has reviewed every single chapter the day it was released, gave you feed back and wasnt a flame about it? or what about that one person who reads it, and then posts the chapter/events elsewhere?

Changing your story happens... but it should not be a reward. I have wrote several stories about various things, and when I include romance, NEVER have I wrote a bit of the story and been like... you know, I dont care about what I wrote, you unsuspecting on looker, tell me who do you want to pair up in this universe?
