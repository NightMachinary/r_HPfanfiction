Vampires are a thing in canon, although the details are deliberately vague. I plan to make use of a German vampire character* but was wondering what head-canons people have. This is my own head-canon, as told by one of my characters. As you can see, my style is to downplay the supernatural.

#+begin_quote
  The things is, Vampirism is far less interesting than you might think. Although like many people in small, exclusive groups, they are big ones for believing their own mythology, even if it is a mythology largely created by Muggle horror writers.

  Like werewolfism, it's essentially an incurable, chronic magical disease. The main symptoms are acute photophobia and the world's worst food intolerance -- so bad it leaves only one substance you can consume without throwing up (guess what). The bat thing is entirely down to one especially vicious psychopath in the 16th century who was coincidentally an anamagus. Mirrors and garlic don't trouble them, even if some pretend otherwise. A stake hammered through the heart works for much the same reason it works on anybody else.

* He styles himself /Deiter the Bloody/, although is generally referred to by Aurors as /Deiter the Bloody Nuisance/


** This is how I interpreted them from Canon.

They seem to be their own race of being in Harry Potter, not just some curse that spreads to others like werewolves.

We know that they are classified as beings like goblins and hags are(unlike werewolves who still count as wizards unless they're transformed, during which they are classified as beasts),

Percy also mentions that hunting them is illegal under laws about the treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans. They seem to have their own culture considering the author in Slughorns party was writing a book about them. They also seem to be able to breed with humans, Rowling mentioned a wizard singer being part vampire on her old website.

Otherwise I assume they're more like vampires from folklore, rather than modern ones, meaning they're nocturnal, but would not burn in the sun, I also doubt religious symbols would do anything to them(mainly because it doesn't fit the themes of the books). I'd also assume they would favor self-transfiguration since that is a power commonly associated with them and is also a form of magic which can be learned without wands.

** I just want to say ‘werewolfism' as a real name already, it's Lycanthropy. On another hand, I see vampires quite differently. I imagine them more like truly Higher-Vampires from the Witcher (with some lesser kinds, because you still want some reasons for your good ol' racism).

** This is what I wrote somewhere before:

#+begin_quote
  I don't like vampires in the HP universe. I think it was one of small jokes by JKR which cannot be developed fully, because it really doesn't work with the rest of the universe. To the realistic bourgeoisie world of more or less rationalist down-to-earch craftsmen, shopowners, ministry officials, you suddenly get a creature which works in completely different world: much more mythical, unearthly, etc. Every fanfic story which tries to involve vampires more fully ends with disaster (Northumbrian has his Auror Camelia Tepes, but I think she doesn't exactly fit into what proper vampire should be).

** Vampires really like order, in that obsessive compulsive organisational neatness sort of a way. Everything has its place and everything should be in its place. It's part of why I see them as avid gardeners - imposing order on the chaos of nature and appreciation of the well organised beauty that is a good garden.

It's from the old European legend of counting-obsessed vampires (the 'Count' on Sesame Street isn't just a pun, y'know). They'd throw down a handful of rice to keep the vampire occupied with counting it in order for them to run the hell away.

** Headcanon is for me, like you said, that its basically a magical disease leaving you with photophobia and other symptoms. Among them however is the lack of aging, so if you‘re bitten at 10 thats just how you‘re going to be until you get killed in some way.

This limited immortality results in two kinds of vampires, you got the more adventureous ones that go out and life their unlife to the fullest, but croak sooner or later. They make it a few centuries, maybe.

The other kind for me are the isolationist, cautious vampires. Living on their own or in small covens for thousands of years with sporadic contact to the outside world, acumulating knowledge, money, magical power and a distinct culture of their own. For me its also headcannon that one such coven rules magical russia, idk where that comes from. They use mortals either employed or enthralled to act in their stead and avoid direct confrontations wherever they can.

Working that into cannon is fairly simple, he-who-must-not-be-named got a couple of the first kind of vampires into his army, either as mercenaries or by making promises of power. One of them turned someone, instant freshly-turned vampire oc to play around with. The second kind would never join into the conflict, but I think they make for nice worldbuilding.

I also prefer my vampires dependend on blood, but not unable to consume other food. I think anyone cursed to life off of a single fooditem for decades would just end it. Any other supernatural aspects, like turning into fog or bats or even the need to be invited into someones home are just quirks of individual vampires, embellished over the centuries.

A muggle wouldn‘t survive the curse, so all vampires are wizards/witches and can use magic, though the older ones have been around longer than wands and so have developed other talents more, runes, wards, wandless magic, potions etc.

** />Deiter the Bloody/

Dieter, not Deiter.

Dieter was a name common for boys born in the 1940s to late 1950s.

So any vampires with this name would be born in this timeframe, making him relatively young for a vampire.

Unless you give him a north German background and being born in a larger city, then you might get away with a vampire that was born in the 1890s to 1910s if you want Dieter as a first name.

The name is derived from the old German "diet", meaning "folk" or "community". (Yes, it is also connected to the English word diet meaning parliament). It is two parts, Diet- and -(h)er, with the modern version missing an "h". -her indicates lordship or ruler, see German Herr as a form of adress. So in total Dieter means "the one ruling the common folk".

Would be fun to turn that on its head. :D

***** That story is still in the early stages..... but but I have completed others with the same main character and I'd love feedback if you're willing to look them over. I should warn you the trio are minor characters and they focus on an OC, as I know some people are less keen on those - a Slytherin girl older than the trio, who's the same age as the Twins.

****** Sounds good. :D One of my favourite HP fics is the Darkness and Light series by R.J. Anderson. This story features Maud Moody, an OC and older Slytherin girl, so no worries there.

About the only thing refuse to read is gore for gore's sake though.

** If you want an interesting take on vampires from which to borrow ideas, read Peter Watts's [[https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]. In some [[https://rifters.com/blindsight/vampires.htm][supporting material]] he explains why crosses affect vampires - it's a glitch in their retinas and visual cortex triggered by seeing intersecting horizontal and vertical straight lines and which causes a seizure. That's a pattern that hardly ever occurs in the natural world so was not selected against until it was too late.

*** Randomly touching grass. Or sticks. Or a really bushy Bush, which manages to have a lot of spaces where a horizontal and vertical line cross. I think that's a bit wrong. So, in that universe, I could defeat a vampire by making a hand pose?

** Personally I don't see JK deviating much from classic folklore when it comes to Vampires.

Her werewolfs are pretty faithful to folklore depictions after all, unlike the bipedal lycan version in the films.

** Vampires have a big base of sorts in Albania. That's why Voldemort was there in the first place, he was seeking information about how they become immortal. He tried some shit, but it didn't totally work, though it left him with the pale skin and red eyes.

A kind of crack addition but I love it nonetheless: at this base they run a sort of underground magical pawn shop with a payday loan kinda vibe: they're figurative vampires as well. That's why Voldy feels like he can go there and ask for some immortality shit in the first place, it's not like wandering into a fortified castle or something. They make a bargain for whatever he wants to try and get immortality, vampire blood to make a potion or something (not sure what he'd trade, maybe give them a claim to his firstborn child or something, knowing he wouldn't have one).

** I always like to take a sort of Dresden files take on them with vampires being organized into different groups (courts) with each having different strengths/weaknesses/way of doing things and the reason why wizards hate vampires so much is because they are legitimate threats to wizards since one trait they share is being highly magically resistant, fast, strong and durable.

*** I've never read those books. But that does sound an awful lot like vampires World of Darkness roll playing games.

I'm envisaging them as extremely dangerous to muggles. Somewhat dangerous to the average witch or wizard, but not taken very seriously by Auriors. An analogy would be a street mugger - dangerous to a regular person, but hardly so to a trained special-forces soldier.

** My idea about vampires is that when one is turned via a vampire feeding upon them before the vampire feeds them blood, they become a new vampires. New vampires are bloodthirsty creatures, completely unable to do much thinking beyond that to sate their hunger. Vampires have augmented bodies, faster and stronger (though not fast enough to do some stupid blurring around thing). Though they can still perform some magic (though the ability is now blunted) as a result of their hunger and limited thinking abilities, new vampires cannot cast magic. As a result of their hunger, new vampires are violent and attack almost everything, including other vampires. They rarely survive as a result. Vampires gain more of an ability to think and the potency of the hunger loses strength as the vampire ages. As a result, old vampires even gain access to magic once more. Because of the brutal nature of being a new vampire, only the strongest vampires survive to an age where they have human levels of intelligence again, making them especially competent.
