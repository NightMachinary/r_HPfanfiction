Essentially what the title says. I am in a sour mood and as a horrible person I wish to read some truly horrible fics. Nothing is too depraved, violent, sexual or graphic, anything goes! All websites are wlecome.

*** Damn, and I though my rec for Hermione being brutally raped by the whole DA under Umbridge's supervision was the worst... (For the Greater Good, by Inell - I don't want to have to search for it to link it)
