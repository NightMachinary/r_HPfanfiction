What i mean by this is a fic in which he isn't powerful or special or even extremely booksmart. He just uses his wit and sometimes a spell in a nontypical fashion. A guy that doesnt fight with over the top spells but instead outsmarts others in a manner similar to our favourite time lord. In summary a Doctor Who'esque Harry.

*** "A dragon, Hermione, is the deadliest, most powerful, most ferocious beast Mother Magic has seen fit to 'bless' us with and in a few days time there's going to be one staring me down over a clutch of eggs. My jobs is going to be to crawl in against it with just my wand. Assuming it doesn't smite me from above with it's claws or tail, and assuming I'm not just burnt to a crisp on sight, do something incredibly clever to it that I haven't actually thought of yet."

** "So basically Professor, I had some issues procuring something to let me survive underwater for an hour. I DID think about the Bubblehead Charm, but how Fleur ended up nearly drowning from a few Grindylow popping it I obviously had the right idea."

"And your right idea was-"

"Not finished Professor." Harry all but snapped at his Head of House as he flicked a silent Drying Charm at the fluffy towel in hand and then attacked his hair with said towel again, his mile a minute diatribe beginning anew,

"So then I was introduced to Gillyweed. A far more palatable option to explore than partial Transfiguration, which I'd of course considered next," He winked at McGonagall who spluttered and tried to get a word in edgeways. Tried, "But that came with it's own issues. First, it's expensive and second, not native to the country. Even if I could snatch some, there were also doubts it would last an hour. And the only feasible place to get some would be via raiding Snape's stores, and I'm not doing THAT again."

"Mr Potter!"

"Professor! I don't interrupt you." Hand on hip and pouting, Harry had the gall (as all baffled onlookers and his target mentally concurred) to glare up at her with a pointing finger. The whole pose and pout melting back into an insufferable gleeful grin once again, "Besides, I'm nearly done. Behold my master stroke!"

His wand snapped out to some point in the South, and barely a second later, on the far bank of Lake a green light burst into life. Several metres away, on either side of the initial jade light, others burst into life also. More and more bloomed into being until the entire waterfront was encircled in a ring of green,

"Like em?" He didn't wait for an answer, "Brilliant thing, Runes. You know what else, well... actually who else. Weasley's! Particularly that Bill. Tall, easy on the eyes, pity Padfoot says I'm too young for him. But NOT a pity that he's a Cursebreaker. Left a bunch of his notes where anyone could find them, so obvs I snuck a peak and committed it to memory. Eww, do I say obvs now? I though Laveder was cute when she said it, but now I've tried it... anyway! The scheme's a fairly modern one, used to amplify the magic of a castor, I think it's for brute forcing your way past traps..."

"Mr Potter." McGonagall fought to keep as much of her infuriated exasperation from her voice as possible, coming across as massively strained as her most troublesome Gryffindor to date (hilarious considering who his father was) rambled to himself about god knows what, "I honestly do not care how you managed it-"

"But it's brilliant! And it didn't even take me that long. Just had to spend a few days writing out the scheme on a piece of paper, so much better than parchment you know, then an afternoon putting them out in the right places around the lake. Buried them under the mud so they wouldn't be disturbed." Smug, he was smug in the face of the Gryffindor Head of House rapidly losing her patience, "With that many around I could have fired a hex that would have killed us all, but one Wingardium Leviosa later and I didn't even need to swim!"

"PUT THE LAKE BACK WHERE IT WAS, MR POTTER, OR SO HELP ME!" And Albus Dumbledore himself, alongside a trio of the braver Hogwarts Professors, had to drag the incensed Scotswoman away from the giggling Harry as he encouraged Colin and Dennis Creevey to take another picture of the Black Lake.

The Black Lake that had, with a single swish and flick of Harry Potter's wand, been left suspenced roughly 20 feet above those who had intended to watch the Second Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

In which Harry Potter had won by default, rescuing all four hostages whilst leaving his competitors flailing in the floating lake.

  He was someone else once, and fought an unwinnable war against an uncaring enemy. The regret of the sacrifices he made along the way, and the patterns of history repeating itself for new heroes drive the Mediwizard to bring compassion, wisdom, and sass to the wizarding world.

** Ooh I've got a few, not all of them are Harry acting like the Doctor, but are all really good.

Visited by a Doctor, linkffn(4922483) The Doctor's various incarnations visit him throughout his life, starting with the 1st Doctor setting Ian and Barbara up as his teachers. Harry doesn't become exactly like the Doctor but his role in his life does shape who Harry grows up to be. Warning, this is a very long fic, and while the start does focus on Harry meeting the various Doctors, it does eventually become more about Harry and the effect the Doctor has had on his life. It also contains the only version of redeemed Draco that I like.

This next one also isn't Harry acting like the Doctor, but is to this day one of the best fanfics I have ever read. That Which Holds the Image, linkffn(7156582) and I'll just give the Authors summary to sell you on it. "Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel". The only warning I will give about this is it has an equally good sequel linkffn(9180168) that hasn't been updated in almost two years.

This one is probably one of my favourites, but isn't focused on Harry. Hermione's Song, linkffn(7102418) It was first written after A Good Man goes to War but before Let's Kill Hitler, and as you probably tell from the title, goes with the idea that Hermione is actually a major character from the Doctor Who universe. However like That Which Holds the Image, it also has an unfinished sequel, linkffn(7572453).

And this final one is again not focused on Harry, but is still really good. This one goes with the fact that Mark Williams played Rory's dad in Doctor Who to establish that Charlie Weasley is actually a squib living in the Muggle world as Rory. Why Charlie Weasley Isn't in the Movies, linkffn(8978887).

A bit different from what you were asking for, But I couldn't resist sharing these.

  SEQUEL TO THAT WHICH HOLDS THE IMAGE. Life. All normal and stuff. With jobs and houses and boring-y, woring-y things like that.
