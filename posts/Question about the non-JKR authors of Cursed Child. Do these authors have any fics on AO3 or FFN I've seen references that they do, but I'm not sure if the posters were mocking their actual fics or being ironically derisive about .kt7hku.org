#+TITLE: Question about the non-JKR authors of Cursed Child. Do these authors have any fics on AO3 or FFN? I've seen references that they do, but I'm not sure if the posters were mocking their actual fics or being ironically derisive about CC.

** I think it is just a joke. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thorne][Jack Thorne]] is a celebrated screenwriter and playwright. I don't think he is very steeped in sci-fi literature (so he screwed up whole time-travelling part of the story) and he knows nothing about Harry Potter universe, but otherwise he is very experienced and celebrated author. Who of us is a multiple BAFTA winner?

*** Thanks for clearing that up. I assumed it was a joke, but had to know for sure.

Yes, even multiple BAFTA winners make mistakes :)

**** Did you ever see the TV ads a while ago (might have been Australia only) with a succession of kids talking about beating Susie O'Neill (in various sports that she hasn't trained in)? I can't recall the actual point of them, probably something about education programs building kids' confidence or something like that. The relevance here is, outside his speciality, he's not necessarily the expert.
