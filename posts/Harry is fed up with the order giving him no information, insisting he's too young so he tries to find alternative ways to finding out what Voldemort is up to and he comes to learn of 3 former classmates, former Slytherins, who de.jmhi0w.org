**** just a head's up it's as yet unfinished, but I like the idea of a team of a not useless Order of the Phoenix who actually aren't restricting themselves to Gryffindors, and older Slytherins such including some of the names you brought up, who had decided Voldemort is terrible for their world but as you say, they don't really have much choice to be involved so they fight from where they are in the ways that they can

  After a tumultuous Fifth Year for the Golden Trio, Dumbledore agrees to give them access to Order information. With that, Hermione is given an assignment---to be the handler for a secret faction of the Order that is comprised completely of Slytherins. This is the story of how---instead of blindly rejecting all Slytherins as a lost cause---Dumbledore went out of his way to bring them in from the dark, and how the brightest witch of her age took them to new heights. Full disclosure, I still don't know who's ending up with who. Sorry in advance.
