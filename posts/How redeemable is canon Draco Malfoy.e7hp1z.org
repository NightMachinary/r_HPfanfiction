What is says on the tin. Do you think that CANON Draco Malfoy is in any way redeemable? (For the sake of this discussion, let's forget the epilogue, when he's at least cordial with Harry).

He spouted Death Eater propaganda since he was 11 years old.

He bullied, stole from, humiliated and attacked other students during his entire stay at Hogwarts.

He was at his wits end during HBP not because what he did was wrong, but because he was presented with an impossible task and didn't think he would accomplish it, which would have terrible consequences.

He didn't identify Harry Potter at Malfoy Manor.

He went after Harry and the gang in the RoR because he wanted to find out what was going on.

Taking all this in. Is it plausible he was reformed at the end of DH? I mean not in the sense of being a decent person. But in not being a psychopath who wants other people dead for flimsy reasons (like he claimed several times before).

**** A lot depends on his postwar behavior and actions. 20 years is a long time.

Canon Draco never passed the point of no return in the Books, so if he truly repudiates his parents's ideology, voluntarily compensates his own and the regime's victims, and actively works for the cause of the Trio, I don't see why they shouldn't at least accept him.

Draco in my head canon is a capable business person and investor. Therefore, despite paying out most of old Malfoy fortune as reparations, his fortune bounces back quickly and the new Ministry needs his money making skills.

** My issue with stories featuring a redeemed!Draco is that he is very rarely actually redeemed. In most of these fics (which are, coincidentally or not, always either Draco/Hermione or Draco/Harry) the Draco never actually acknowledges the shit he did. Instead, the writer just chooses to shift blame onto Lucius and Dumbledore, say that Draco was just a kid, and BOOM, suddenly he loves watching television and drives cars and whatnot.

I would love to read a story where he actually acknowledges all the horrible things he did, but I've yet to see one done right. Although I understand that this would be very hard (and boring) to write.

** I think he's a nice parallel to Regulus, honestly. Raised by parents who upheld pureblood ideology, followed their example mindlessly but then later showed that he was beginning to second-guess what he was taught. Difference is that he didn't have a Sirius-like figure, someone that he cared about, to show him an opposing idea, and he didn't have the same opportunity to really turn against Voldemort in the same way that Regulus did.

So yeah, I guess I think he's redeemable, but still not off the hook for what he did. Although he may have become a Death Eater under his father's direction (we don't know he didn't want to initially and then just came to regret it), he's still responsible for his own actions. His redemption would come several years after the war, in my opinion, because he would need to demonstrate, repeatedly and publicly, that he genuinely disagrees with the ideology that allowed Voldemort to become so successful in the first place.

But that is not canon Malfoy. Canonically, he only couldn't kill an old, frail man when he was unarmed in front of him. He had no issues carrying countless war crimes in his plots to kill Dumbledore, using unforgivables and disregarding civilians (Katie, Rosmerta) or people unrelated to his objective (Ron, Slughorn). Malfoy never rejected the ideology, he just couldn't kill someone while looking into their eyes.

If you think canon Malfoy is redeemable, then we are not. He never questioned the ideology or even the methods (he never considered that killing Dumbledore was wrong), he only couldn't put his money where his mouth was.

The only way I can buy a Malfoy redemption is if you diverge before year two and have him SLOWLY reject pureblood supremacy (and keep Lucius and Snape as awful as they are in canon rather than whitewash them along the way).

** I think it is hard for me to say I know canon Malfoy well enough to strongly make this distinction. There are a ton of questions that, if we had the answers, would make his morality much clearer to me. For example, what did Malfoy experience during the seventh year up until the Manor scene at Easter? How did he feel after Snape killed Dumbledore? How did he feel about his actions during 6th year once the threat of being killed wasn't hanging over him? The answers to these questions makes a big difference (to me, anyway), but canon doesn't provide clear answers.

I think the reason we argue so much about Draco is that Deathly Hallows does not provide enough info about Draco's experiences, so we are forced into making a lot of assumptions. I personally tend to lean on the redeemable side of things because of his indoctrination as a child, and because the worst acts he committed (Rosmerta, Katie, Ron, and the cabinet) were when he was sixteen years old. And I generally believe most sixteen year olds can be redeemed.

** Depends on when in Cannon.

If your story is set during first or second year, and you have a teacher come in who was, you know, better at identifying, diffusing, and escalating issues, cannon draco was probably redeemable.

​

If you are starting at DH, probably not. At the very least, his redemption is going to have to come at a high cost.

** That heavily depends on what you want him to redeem for.

If it's about joining the death eaters and being on Voldemort's side and whether or not he's an absolute monster who's a danger to the public, then yes. I think he's very much redeemable.

If it's about him being a singularly unpleasant individual with discriminating views and you want him to suddenly become a friend to the trio etc, then I think it's much more difficult from what we know of the wizarding worlds.

He's not a psychopath like Bellatrix or Greyback and their ilk, but he's nowhere near a good person.

** While he was a spoiled brat for the first years in his life, I think he really grew up. I think his turning point was when his father was sent to Azkaban after the failed mission in the Department of Mysteries. The mission to kill Dumbledore was clearly set up to fail, but at that point he still believed in this cause. But the war also took its toll on him. Life hit him in his face.

He had Voldemort basically living in his home as well as other Death Eaters, he was in contact with Greyback and I think at that point the whole pureblood superiority didn't matter to him that much any more. He saw that it wasn't that glorious at that point. He was only 16 and saw how a teacher of his school was being killed and eaten in front of him, on a table in his home. As you mentioned he didn't identify Harry when he clearly would have been able to. If he had identified Harry, his honor would've been reinstated in the dark Lords eyes, but Draco chose to protect Harry instead. The only hope of the Wizarding world to get rid of the dark Lord. And if the news got out, he would be clearly objected to Voldemorts wrath. So while it was certain that he had acted for selfish reasons it was a pretty selfless act to lie. By that point I think he did no longer believe in anything that had something to do with the "purebloods are better attitude" And during the battle of Hogwarts he wasn't the one to cast a killing curse on Harry. I think he was very desperate and very scared. At that point he just wanted to survive. He might still be a little arrogant but he lived through his own hell and I think that he is pretty redeemed even if we ignore the ending of the books "19 years later"

**** Well but while it is his fault we also have to mention that Draco did not outright try to kill Katie or Ron. These were accidents that happened while he - a 16 year old boy - was tasked with the murder of an accomplished wizard (who even Voldemort himself feared) I think Draco would have been quite disturbed if Katie or Ron had died even if the people surrounding him would've probably told him that it's a bloodtraitor anyways and that it made no difference if one of them was gone. Draco was at a breaking point at that point in time. These were mistakes that can be attributed to being pressured into something he didn't even know what the outcome would be if he succeeded. Draco was very blind and naive at that point, but I think that this part in his life was essential to his character growth. I think he redeemed himself over the course of the books and I think we have to consider his age with these actions. He was a teenager at this time. Just like Harry he was forced to fight in a war. We can not fault him for following his parents and thinking that they were right. He wanted to redeem his father by killing Dumbledore. As he grew up and time went on we see him making different decisions as he starts to question what he is really fighting for. In the end I think Draco was selfish but he was also loyal to his family. Just like his mother he just wanted his family to be alright.

** Well if you compare him to other characters in the past you can easily redeem him. If you look at people like Snape or even Sirius Draco is no worse. Sirius was a bully on the other end of the spectrum, he attacked purebloods and Slytherins simple for being so. He was a dick for a long time until sixth year when he screws up the Remus and realises what he is doing is not so great, the only reason it isn't questioned was because he was on the light side. Draco was a bully trying to follow his parents rather than get away from them and didn't see the problem with what he did until sixth year when he realises he can't kill someone and he has to live with Voldemort in his home and he starts to be a little less of a bully but he is still stuck in the war amd couldn't do a lot other than being completely useless to the war effort. You could say he has learnt from his mistakes and changed to be a better person and now that the war is over, can do that without risking his life and could be redeemed like Sirius.

** Yes, everybody is redeemable. I believe redemption stories of some former SSmen (and SSwomen), guards in the Nazi concentration camps, etc. Redemption (or let's use the old-fashioned term “conversion” or “penance”) however doesn't mean to somehow excuse previous deeds. It requires true acknowledgement that these deeds happened, to own them, and to admit that they were evil. It requires honest asking for forgiveness. I don't want to get any political, but it requires at least on the personal level, something like what Germany did after the Second World War (see for example recent visit of [[https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-50690669/auschwitz-visit-responsibility-for-nazi-crimes-part-of-german-identity-says-merkel][Angela Merkel in Auschwitz]]).

What we see in most so called redemption stories of Draco Malfoy (or Severus Snape, or Petunia Dursley)? Excuses that those deeds were not so bad, excuses that they were crippled by their past, excuses by some good deeds they have done as well (“Your honor, why we are still talking about those twenty minutes when I was stealing from the bank, and not about my all my life when I was a good law-abiding citizen?”). Yes, there could be an interesting story how the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and how somebody can persuade herself, that being a Death Eater is The Right Thing to do, but that's a different type of literature and I think it would do better for everybody involved if they were kept separate. What I would be more interested, and what I mostly still wait for is the story how the main heroes stand in the wreckage of their lives, they are disgusted in themselves, and they try to build up their lives back.

Perhaps the closest I got to it was linkffn(6432055), but even that was more story of a pureblood trying to find his way in the strange world of Muggles then true redemption story of dealing with guilt. Nevertheless, it is still a very good story.

Or perhaps linkffn(6142629;6329597) for the Dudley character, not so much for Snape who is more in the excuses territory. The same author wrote linkffn(6782408), which is one of the best attempts to do the redemption for Snape/Severitus, but still I think it mixes too much of the path-to-hell-pavement with the redemption and it sometimes balances quite close to making excuses for his behaviour (BTW, I *love* Molly Weasley in this story).
