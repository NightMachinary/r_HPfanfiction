:END:
Ok, so I just finished a little more world building for a potential story and want imput on what sounds more engaging.

The Premise is Harry goes to Gringots with Hagrid and finds he has almost no gold waiting for him. To save on school shopping Hagrid suggests asking after a family vault with possessions in it, finding lots of his parents stuff from school but MORE importantly getting access to a Grimoire or Book of Shadows and finding in it advanced Magics as a first year.

Now I don't want to have it be a simple spellbook, but dealing with either Black or White Magic. In the story these magics are dependent on Sacrifice of different sorts; Unwilling for Black Magic and Willing or self Sacrifice for White Magic. In each catagory there are seven types of magic.

For Black Magic, or the Black Arts: Necromancy, Voodoo, Infernalism, Glamour, Soul Magic, Skin Walking, and Blood Magic

1. Necromancy is the Black Art of the Undead Flesh and bringing back the dead to serve in physical form. This art is fueled by sacrifice via desecration: of a person, a place, a thing, or even a word or concept.
2. Voodoo is the Black Art of affecting the large by doing unto the small. You use sacrifices to fuel rituals to do something on the small scale to cause effect on the large scale.
3. Infernalism is the Black Art of summoning and bargaining with the forces of hell. Using sacrifices to make offerings and bargains to command otherworldly forces, gain knowledge, or simply to increase ones magical power.
4. Glamour is the Black Art of Illusions and Enchantments of the mind. The 'Lightest' of the Black Arts, one must make a deal similar to those of the Infernalists, save with a Fae, athough only those evil Fae of the Unseelie Court will answer such calls.
5. Soul Magic is the Black Art of changing, effecting, damaging, destroying, and moving of the Soul. The Price of this magic is that it requires the destruction of another Soul as Sacrifice.
6. Skin Walking is the Black Art of Changing ones form through the sacrifice of the form one wishes to take. Skin Walkers must ritualistically skin the victim. The results of such magics are nearly identical to the Animagus and Metamorphmagus transformations, resulting in much fear and legalese regarding these legitimate and neutral magics.
7. Hemomancy, or Blood Magic, is the Black Art of using the magic in the Blood of others or affecting the blood of others and yourself. Blood Mages often use many sacrifices of others to strengthen the magic of their own blood to preform great feats with but a small letting of their own blood rather than long rituals.

For White Magic, or the White Arts: Alchemy, True Divination, Coventry, Martyrdom, Somatism (body magic), Temporalmancy, and Angelism

1. Alchemy is the White Art that relies on equal exchange. While such magics CAN be twisted to mimic a Black Art, the true essence and power of Alchemy revolves around willing transference, as a willing sacrifice of a person or thing is more potent or Full than that of an unwilling sacrifice.
2. Divination, or True Divination, is the White Art of pulling in Ambient Magic to the mind to promote visions of the future, present, and past. Such an act however sacrifices the sanctity of the mind, making it so the seer or prophet cannot properly organize their own thoughts without intense effort and strict measures.
3. Coventry, or the Creation of a Coven, is the White Art of binding the magic of three or more Witches or Wizards together. This allows the group to perform great magics while sacrificing the Self. In time such Covens can invade the privacy of the mind and the body as the binding grows stronger with time.
4. Martyrdom is the White Art of Self Sacrifice. An individual may give of themselves to fuel their own magics, either through ritualist self mutilation, damaging their own soul, giving up portions of their magic permanently, or even by giving their own life for single powerful spell. (oh hi Lily)
5. Somatism is the White Art of sacrificing part of yourself temporarily, or permanently, to later gain and equivalent amount of magically enhanced strength at a later time. Spend a day or a week sick for a supernatural constitution, a week unable to even lift your own head for a hour of super strength, etcetera.
6. Temporalmancy is the White Art of Sacrificing your own time to gain some control over time at a later point. This time can be taken from the end of your life, from the here and now, or another period. Practitioners have sacrificed weeks, only to have apparently lived it and had no recollection the time given up, while others have disappeared off the face of the earth for the given time.
7. Angelism is the White Art opposite of Infernalism, sacrificing of your own self or services to the Kingdom of Heaven in echange for services or goods of the Angels. One might bargain a great deed or their own memories for a tome or a weapon of incredible magical power.\\

So which ONE of these types of Black or White Magics sounds the most engaging to a reader? What idea's do you like? Or Hate? Or think I missed?


** Well done on trying an interesting take on the HP magic. I'm a big fan of power with consequences, No power boost without cost to the user.

*** Thanks! I've pulled a little bit from all over the place to make it make sense to me.

Simple Dark and Light Magic I see as just pouring emotions into spells, acting as fuel that works with the magic to help shape it, with certain spells NEEDING those emotions to work. The only 'cost' is to your mental health, positive or negative, by immersing and opening yourself to those emotions. But that also explains why so called 'Dark' magic is easier, because even a slightly stressful situation opens you up to negative emotions. Under ideal, stress free conditions, pouring positive emotions into a spell would be JUST as easy or powerful. But in combat or during a medical emergency? Suddenly its alot easier to channel Dark Magic.

**** I'm also super sick of reading stuff with this kind of magic though and some old wise person is like ‘be wary about this decision, the cost is great' or whatever and the Mary Sue MC is like ‘I don't care, just save them' and then break the magical system because they want their best friend back from the dead or whatever. I think if you're going to have a cost for magic it should be like...respected? I'm sorry I'm on the back of very little sleeps so o don't know if that's clear, but I find a lot of magical systems are so cool and powerful because they have a certain weight to it, but then the writer rips that weight to shreds by fucking it up, which sucks

I do very much like your differentiation between white and black magic though OP I sort of have a similar idea of the basic definition of sacrifice/willingly gifted and taken/ripped from so that's super solid

** I like your ideas a lot. Actually there was a cool theory about magic that I've once read that it was not a matter of skill or magical core or whatever you call it but it was rather something given by nature in exchange for a payment. We observe that in canon with Horcruxes and Lily/Harry's sacrifice but in fact every spell comes at a price. Sure the price of casting a Lumos is not the same as creating a Horcrux but if you overuse a certain spell, nature will make sure you eventually pay for it. Like Gilderoy's case where he ended up with mashed brains after stealing other people's work through obliviation or Voldemort killed by his own wand after killing so many.

** I think there's a lot of different ways your different concepts could be engaging based on what you'd like your story to be. I'm going to be assuming defeating Voldemort is an end goal of your story for these answers.

I really like the idea of using necromancy to obtain information, for example. Imagine a scenario where you call back a person to tell you about Voldemort. Perhaps they're even magically bound to obey your orders. In such a scenario, they would not actually have to tell you anything, let alone the truth. For example: they are ordered to "tell me about Voldemort." In response, they say "about Voldemort." This could lead to a lot of potentially interesting story lines wherein Harry has to try and convince the resurrected to work with him, and has to try and parse if what they're saying is the truth, a lie, or a partial-truth. Also a lot of interesting wordplay with resurrected enemies deliberately misinterpreting as many of Harry's orders as possible. Maybe some resurrected are resentful of being brought back, and want to get Harry killed so they can rest, or maybe some have their own goals and agendas they want to see achieved, irrespective of Harry or Voldemort.

Voodoo (aka Hoodoo) is a real religion, and it would probably be respectful to change to name of that branch. Imagine if you'd called this "islam" or "judaism"; it just feels wrong. I'm assuming you based your idea for this branch on the concept of a voodoo doll, which is not from voodoo and was actually invented by Europeans. I would like to humbly suggest the name "poppetry", which sounds a bit like "puppetry" and is based off a poppet, which is a similar concept to a voodoo doll. I like the idea of this branch, but I'm not sure how it would best fit into a story. You can certainly put in a story, of course, but if it's not tied to the plot in some way it just seems like being there just to be cool. I'd need more time to think on this one.

Infernalism almost seems a bit too broad. What's stopping Harry from simply asking for Voldemort's death, or the knowledge needed to kill him? That, or any other similar demands that could potentially end the story early? If those limits are worked out, I could see this running down a similar path to my necromancy suggestion, with Harry needing to figure out which entity will screw him over the least and help him the most.

The glamour branch could lend itself to some very interesting spy work. Imagine being able to create a perfect disguise of anyone. In such a scenario I'd imagine a reasonable limit being that you cannot turn yourself into an inanimate object, or else it might be too overpowered. This could lead to some tense scenes; for instance: Harry needs to escape, but the area he is in is being shut down and systematically swept. Perhaps the Death Eaters have found out about his disguise skills and are checking everyone's identity.

Soul magic would be useful if you'd like to go the route of horcruxes. How better to defeat bits of Voldemort's soul than by using soul magic? I'd imagine you'd have to make it fairly complicated to avoid being too easy though. It'd be boring for a reader if Harry was able to just cast "track horcrux" followed by "destroy horcrux." As I'm writing this, I'm warming to the idea of perhaps Harry seeking to reunite all of Voldemort's horcruxes. Apparently the pain of remorse needed to put yourself back together can destroy you, so perhaps this could be a route to defeat Voldemort. Perhaps play with ideas/themes of mercy and justice: Voldemort's soul being in pieces prevent him from moving beyond limbo. Does he deserve to be able to move on? Is there anything gained from preventing him from moving on? Presumably Voldemort'd be stuck there for eternity, is there a point in time where you could say "he's suffered enough and should be allowed to move on now"?

Skin walking again runs into similar problems as voodoo, in that this is a real world real belief. In this case, the skin-walker beliefs of the Navajo culture. However, the idea of a person using the skin of an animal to transform into that animal is not unique to Navajo, and is actually a common trope in werewolf myths. The idea is perfectly fine to use, but the name should probably be changed; I suggest "skin shifting" instead. I could see this going a similar path to the glamour branch. Spy work would be significantly easier with this power. While glamour could have some more obvious tradeoffs (ie you may be disguised but you still have to convince the other person you're not an imposter), this would be a bit more tricky. How are the death eaters supposed to know the bird hiding in the rafters is actually a person? Some time limits could be well used here. Or perhaps the secret could get out, and the death eaters could find a way to determine if an animal was actually an animal.

Hemomancy has a similar problem to infernalism in that there's not a clear idea of what can and can't be done. Strengthening your own magic is a bit vague and could potentially lead to boring brute force contests.

Alchemy sounds interesting and could lead to some FMA-esque type magic. However, much like your voodoo idea, I'm not sure how well this would fit into a story.

Divination could lead to some fun scenes of Harry seeing conflicting futures and scenarios, and trying to navigate it all. On top of that, are the people in that future saying things that are true, or are they telling lies? For example, Harry could see a vision of character "A" telling character "B" one thing, only for "A" to tell Harry something completely different. Was "A" telling "B" the truth? Were they trying to manipulate "B" with a lie? Are both somehow true? Was it simply that new information was obtained, thus making what "A" told Harry an honest mistake?

I actually really like the idea of coventry, because it would be really interesting to see this turned on its head. What if the death eaters were the coven? Voldemort would have unprecedented control over his followers, able to (over time) tell if his followers were actually loyal to him. This could further make occlumency more vital than ever, with it being one of the only ways to block voldemort from followers' mind. I am also a bit of a fan of the idea that "good" magic can be used for evil, and this could play right into it. Perhaps it's even a bait and switch, with Harry and the readers believing that light magic is used for good, only for it to go "nope! gotcha!" Coventry could be introduced early on, mentioned in the grimoire, only for him to pass on the idea and pick something else.

I am starting to run thin on creative juices and don't have much to say about martyrdom. I think at the very least it could be mentioned and discussed as an explanation to how Lily did what she did.

Somatism also potentially runs into issues of "what does it mean to be 'stronger?'" and brute force showdowns. I am again unsure of how best to work it into the overarching story beside it simply being there.

Temporalmancy has a lot of interesting potential. A new user could lack control over where the time was taken, and could lead to interesting scenarios wherein Harry finds himself in danger without any idea of how he got there. Maybe someone gave him some vital information while he was 'absent' and now it's gone. Maybe Harry develops a note taking system to keep track of what he does while absent, only to one day wake up and find out his notes were destroyed/taken/lost. Maybe he finds a hidden note from himself revealing some game changing information. Could someone imitate his handwriting to trick him?

I feel my infernalism notes could double for angelism.

In terms of what I, specifically, would find most interesting from each list, I would pick necromancy and divination, with a death eater coven running in the background.

*** Thanks for the feedback! I am of the personal belief that ANY magic could be twisted against it's intended use. Infernalism can be used to save lives, Coventry can be used to cast dark rituals, a person can be a Martyr for an evil or unjust cause.

So Somatism would literally be equivalent exchange. You get out what you give in, but more condensed. I mean, it IS magic.

Hemomancy is not meant for brute force, at least not up close. The idea is that magical beings and creatures don't have a traditional 'core', but they do have magic within their own bodies that they draw on, this being ambient magic that has gathered in the organs and more specifically, in the blood. Hemomancy is meant to use OTHER peoples magic through bloodletting and sacrifice of another's blood. Oddly, magically enhancing your own blood, while Black, would allow you to use Hemomancy through Self Sacrifice, which is TECHNICALLY White Magic.

Infernalism is meant to be open ended. And the thing stopping Harry from asking for Voldemorts death are severalfold: They can't kill him since he has Horcrux's, the cost of sending a demon or devil strong enough to FIGHT a Black Magi like Voldemort would be astronomical, and lastly, it would require Harry to essentially loose an infernal being on the world with few fetters beyond 'Kill Voldemort and return to hell'.

As for Necromancy (saving the first for last), I think the means you are thinking of would be more closely tied to Soul Magic, as this version of Necromancy is just reanimating the flesh, not the mind or the spirit. A necromancer wouldn't be able to command the spirit, but a Soul Mage could.

So as a blanket statement, I will say that I disagree on the naming things, because ALL magic in fiction is based on real world religious practices of some kind. Magic itself could be seen as being taken from Wiccanism, or the practice of Witchcraft. The practices are simply handpicked pieces of the very esoteric parts of those religious practices, not a representation of the religion as a whole. I am utilizing these as magics, NOT as religious examples.

I view it more in the Dresden Files sort of way, that all of of the legends and stories are true in some manner. And even there we see heaven and hell and skin walking side by side with Celtic Fae and Nordic gods. This is just me boiling the magic of the Potterverse, with a flair of Dresdenverse mixed in and a bit of other stuff I like or thought of.
