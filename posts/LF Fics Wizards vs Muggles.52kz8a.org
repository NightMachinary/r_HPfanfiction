Since a lot of purebloods look down on Muggles, are there any fics of Magical Britain declaring war against the Muggles, or something similar? As mentioned in quite a few fics, Muggles outnumber the magical community by a huge number and have created destructive weapons, that spells can't match. At the same time, wizards still benefit from charms/spells like Notice-me-not, invisibility, Imperio, etc.

Are there any fics out there, that feature such a conflict/war between them?


** linkffn(Abraxas by Brennus) I think has one of the more realistic versions of this. [[/spoiler][Since the magical community is so ignorant of muggle anything, the first several attacks go well, then the magicals begin to curbstomp]].

*** For that fic after first chapter skip next ones and start reading at ch15-16. In first five chapters dialogues made me wish that Tom took over Harry and AK Ron. He had pretty annoying lines that bring nothing to story. Quality of dialogues at early chapters made me dislike most characters so I started skimming story, plot at first part was weakish (Harry gives DD horcrux list and tries to convince him not to make Snape DA teacher and not go to Slughorn. Three days later Harry gets to Slughorn with canon copypasta except that Harry at end reveals that Slughorn is pedo-gay(with bit of Tom's personality he should keep that as blackmail.)

Only when Voldemort is killed a real story begins and fic becomes good. That part is well done and strategically looks like what would happen in that scenario.

Except of pacifist wizard mentality. Wizards there don't fight at fraction of their capabilities to keep a moral high ground. Even when attacking airplane base Harry tries not to kill soldiers that are shooting at him, Fleur gives sailors at nuclear submarine time to escape... Also their attacks are quite ineffective. While they say that nukes are high priority in reality its instantwin for wizards or if they don't want to use them to preserve ecosystem they are useless. Normal bombs could also destroy wizard settlement so using nuke would only gain 10000+ muggles killed as collateral damage. Also why just destroy airplanes when its easier to get pilots from one base under imperius/confondus/memory charm and let them bombard rest of military bases.

** Muggleborns' stance would be critical in such a conflict. If they joined the Muggles, Purebloods would have almost no chance to win. The combination of magic and technology, with Muggles' superior numbers, would make mincemeat out of Purebloods very quickly.

However, if it was some crazy Muggle Voldemorts deciding to eradicate all Magicals, then the war might actually be won by Magicals, or the Muggles might decide to destroy the world with nukes in desperation, [[/spoiler][as it was the case in Abraxas]].

The only one fic I know of in which the Muggles truly won was *The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971).

*** Mostly agree with op except with voyage as its pretty bad fanfic. It's plot makes little sense so I wouldn't give it much weight.

My main criticism with TVOTSH is ton of deux-ex-machinas. For example Nicolas Flamel coming there for no reason and that in second wizard invasion it wasn't muggles that defeated it. It was because whole earth was controlled by skynet (coming obviously from machina.) who won by lauching vtol that carried nukes which exploded to power lasers to destroy wizard starships.

That bring second problem that it doesn't deserve sci in sci-fi. While around half of fiction is technobabble like from bad hollywood movies. Lot of time is spend on uninteresting problems (oxygen in spaceship) that reader doesn't care. Then with tools presented here wizards could do lot better. I cannot believe to say that end would be more believable by wizards doing star wars plot and sending billion of HP clones to subjugate earth.

** Here you have problem that lot of writers identify themself with muggles in hpverse with muggle-fanboy attitude: Muggles are gonna to win because there are too many of them and they have gunz. Which is naive as ants are big threat to humanity. They outnumber us million to one. Stories that realistically portlray both sides are rare. I discussed these situations with friends and there are several AU rulesets.

1. One gets magic by replacing brain center for logical reasoning by spellcasting center. That makes every wizard insane and incapable of logical thinking (including Hermione with delusions that she is sane as using analog of Discworld frog pills.)

Sadly this is best theory to explain canon events (Dumbledore's insanity is mainly his obsession to save Draco,Snape+death eaters instead actually doing something about them. With sane DD Lucius Malfoy would die resisting arrest at end of first war and there wouldn't be DE left for Voldemort to start second one. Voldemort: obsessed in death note style plots. His year-long plots could be done in three days. Let Snape prove his loyalty and bring Harry to DoM for prophecy as special lesson. Wizards in general: believe in everything from daily prophet due lack of logical center)

I could elaborate more why this AU fixes canon plotholes by saying thats because all wizards are insane. With these AU muggles can win because wizards couldn't come with any plan and they are sitting ducks.

If one doesn't use previous excuse then it tells lot about muggle war as you could trim some possibilities:

2a) Wizards could be hit by guns. This needs wizard insanity excuse or world in HP canon doesn't make any sense. By natural selection if some wizard nation used them he would defeat the rest. Wizard combat would be decided who could shoot who as there wouldn't be spellslinging aurors but combat wizards that kill enemies in seconds with miniguns/DOLD crossbows/dart guns for nonlethal combat That would make Voldemort weak enemy who needs to avoid fights or minor problem as combat wizards kill him each month. Wizards need enchanted robes that are completely bulletproof or first war didn't make sense as any squib with gun could take down Voldemort.

2b) Muggles couldn't win because of nukes. These are biggest weakness of muggles. Voldemort style response to muggles attacking would be just to nuke Oxford, then apparate to parliament with nuke and state terms of surrender: You have one hour to accept. Every person responsible will be executed. Britain will be with my rule. Not accepting these conditions or killing more wizard by muggles will be punished by destruction of another city until there is nothing left.

This is main plothole that muggle-fanboy fics miss that wizards could use muggle weapons too and more effectively than muggles. With legilemency/imperius wizards likely control nukes and in some AU could make them by transfiguring something into plutonium.

2c) Muggles couldn't win because of centralized command. That generalizes weakness with nukes as wizards need to control few people for big effect. Preventing that would need 1984 style dystopia as everybody needs to be watched at homes, nobody could be trusted...)

With imperius/memory charm wizards could take control of army commanders that to fight coup d'etat masked by riddicous story about magic. Depending on strength of imperius/MC wizards could use muggles to fight for them so in that scenario anybody important needs to be protected from rest of muggles as well.

2d) Muggles win because of killer flu on wizards... Basically only way how muggles could win versus competent wizards is to use biological weapon/nanobots/citywide antimagic fields. While good its bit problematic with story as it would be time-travel to prevent that/postapo and its hard to write actual muggle/wizard conflict there.

These scenarios show that its hard to write pure wizard/muggle war that would make good story. One could write plenty of oneshot where one side dominates another but prolonged conflict is unnecessary.

3) Muggleborn/purebloods

Most of fics with war involving muggles should be of this type as they with wizards on both sides its relatively balanced conflict.
