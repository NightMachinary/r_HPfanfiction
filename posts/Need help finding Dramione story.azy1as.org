Hi All! I'm trying to remember a story I read a long time ago, and I need help! It was DracoxHermione, and I remember that it was a parenting class story. In the story, something happens where they wake up in the future and are married with a family, and they have to try to figure out how to get back to their present day. I also think that the class teacher was a new character the Author introduced. Any help would be really appreciated!! Thanks!

Edit: I remember that one of the kids they had had a name that started with an A. Something like Adrianna or Arianna!
