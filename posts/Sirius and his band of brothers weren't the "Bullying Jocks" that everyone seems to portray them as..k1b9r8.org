Edit: I find it absolutely ridiculous that people can accept that Riddle can be a paragon of goodness in some AUs, that Snape can be a wonderful father to HARRY POTTER in some AUs, that Dumbledore can be the evilist manipulator in some fics, and all kinds of other AUs.

But the very idea that James and company aren't bullies in some AU fics is OHMAHGAWD, YOU'RE EVIL! I'M NOT EVEN GONNA READ YOUR BULLSHIT, BECAUSE YOU'RE SO WRONG!!!!!! HOW DARE YOU NOT JUMP ON THE ANTI-BULLY BANDWAGON!!??

XX

First of all, James, Sirius, and Remus went to Hogwarts when Tom Riddle was making his bid to control the wizarding world. Judging by how Snape and Malfoy acted in canon, the Death Eater spawn of the 1970s were mocking the light and grey sided family's for their dead family. Which showed what kind of asses they were.

Malfoy told Harry how he would go the way of his parents if he didn't pick right.

Really? That little bastard is what everyone is defending? That little Nazi bastard that was making death threats at age 11? And Snape taught him how to do that, and defended him in Hogwarts? And those are the people they are defending? What a load of bullshit.

XX

Sirius was raised Slytherin and he rebelled against that. That shows that Sirius wanted to come out of the darkness. Sirius wasn't the stereotypical Gryffindor, he was trying to fake it until he maked it.

But, okay, lets take that night with Snape showing up suddenly when Lupin was transforming into a werewolf. Let's assume that Snape actually did listen to some provocation? Really? Is it really Sirius' fault that Snape listened to him say some random jokes? How many years of random words has Snape been subjectd to by this point? Why is THIS the seminal judgment? Why is THIS point the one point that Sirius should be judged by, over Snape?

Or is it Snape's fault for being such an imbecil as to show up at a fucken werewolf's transformation? Why did Snape suddenly show up and blame Sirius for it? Isn't Snape trying to get Sirius in trouble? Isn't Snape a sneaky snake that has more than one plan to enact in order to get his way? Doesn't Snape think of himself as the consumate Slytherin?

Then you need to think about a werewolf. What about a werewolf terrifies the random wizards and witches?

What is it? An industructable weapon of destruction, right? Magic can't stop them, so they are terrifying. THAT'S MUTHER...THAT'S RIGHT!

"THAT'S RIGHT! Snape experienced that so we should feel sorry for him!"

That's the concessus, right?

Bullshit.

Werewolves will attack any humans, regardless of affiliation. That's the nature of Werewolves.

Why did the Mauraders learn to become animorphmagus? Because the engine of destruction that was a werewolf only cared about HUMAN targets. If they were animals, they could be around him and distract him and be fine, but otherwise, he wouldn't care.

An indestructable engine of destruction that is focused on the HUMAN boy that is outside in the corridor! Moony ignored the three animals in the room with him, to attack the secret door that led to the corridor outside.

"It's so close, its so tasty! All he has to do is destroy a wall and chase it!" *Moony, Engine of Destruction.

Now imagine that there is a boy outside in the corridor, enticing that engine of destruction to attack. Snape is horrified at just how powerful that beast is! It's horrifying! Why did he ever decide it was a good idea to come here!? He thought he could cast a few spells and destroy that bastard Lupin, but it turns out his plans to kill him were upturned!

And suddenly James appears in front of Severus!

"You fucking retard! Run!" James yells as he grabs Severus and pulls him along the passageway, saving his life from Moony, Engine of Destruction.

James pulls Severus along the pathway, crouching and yelling about what an idiot Severus is, dragging him along as they stumble, fall, get up, and most importantly RUN!

James yells at the greasy boy to run! "Hurry, you damned bastard! Run! Run, you fool! If we don't get out of here, he'll eat us!"

James could always transform into his Stag form at any minute! Even if he was tangled up in the roots of the low hanging cave and immobile, Moony wouldn't attack him. Even if he was crouched into the ground with nowhere to go, Moony wouldn't care about him as an animal and would continue chasing Snape as a human boy! So James wasn't in any danger as long as he transformed into a Stag!

But James never changed into that stag, he continued to run with Snape in his human form to motivate Snape in running away. And because of that act, James drew a life debt to Severus for such an action!

Padfoot and Wormtail had obviously failed in their hard fought attempts to corral the monster that Moony was away from the tunnel. The human scent was too great that they couldn't distract him from tasting actual human thigh!

(Even when Padfoot wanted to keep Moony away from HARRY FUCKING POTTER in the third year confusion, who was his nephew and godson, Padfoot had been less than successful, because MOONY WAS A FUCKING FORCE OF MUTHERFUCKERING WEREWOLF NATURE!

So I don't want to hear any complaints about how "Sirius didn't care to keep Moony away from Snape". Bullshit. Sirius knew that James was in human form, running with Snape to save him, so you are damned sure that he wanted to keep Moony away from them! He failed because Moony was just too damed powerful!)

Back to the action.

James didn't blame his friends for the fact that he was about to die for that rat-fink-bastard, Snape. He knew the moment he scented Snape in the corridor outside Moony's transfrormation chamber, that the chances of them all living was slim. He had to do something to make sure Snape didn't die, so Moony wouldn't be implicated!

He might die as the last Potter because he chose to help Snape escape from a cursed man Snape had tormented for the past three years. But, by god, he was going to make it worth it!

And so there you go. The idea that Sirius and James weren't there with Remus on his transformation day for some reason is retarded. The idea that they were rushing over to help save Snape because of Sirius is dumb. They were already there in the chamber with Moony, but they hoped to save Snape so that Moony wouldn't be implicated by the little shit.

Why did they become animorphmagus in the first place? To help Remus. Why would they not be there to help? They wouldn't. They would have been there. Snape fucked everything up, like usual.

So blaming Sirius for Snape's bullshit is just retarded, like usual.

Snape was a death eater scum before he became a Death Eater scum. Making him a school teacher was the dumbest thing around.

Secondly, it was Lucius & Narcissa Malfoy who raised Draco & he inherited his bigotry from them.

Thirdly, Sirius did encourage him to go and indirectly led him to the Shrieking Shack which makes him culpable for any injuries that Snape may have suffered.

** I didn't read all this lol. But I want to nitpick one thing: Sirius wasn't raised Slytherin, he was raised to be a bigot. That's what he actually rebelled against. Honestly, as much as I love this series, the fact that more of the bad guys were practically in Slytherin and most of the good guys are anywhere else is annoying. Even the main exception of Wormtail tends to be treated as "oh, he just didn't have as much courage as was needed/he was getting revenge for being the fourth wheel" vs "I'm choosing to tell a bigoted meglomaniac that wants to kill muggleborns and their families where he can find my best friend, his muggleborn wife, and their baby."

In real life, who supports what side in a civil war tends to be more complicated, and the behaviors/characteristics you value don't always align with your views about groups of people. I wish we saw that with HP, or at least more often in fanfic. Give me Slytherins that don't care about blood, only talent or ambition, or that abhor conversations groups that want to stick to the status quo. Give me Hufflepuffs that value loyalty and are hesitant to act against a friend, or even get radicalized by them. Give me Hufflepuffs that hate how Muggleborns get a "free pass" at school and work for being new to magic in general while hardworking purebloods don't. Give me Ravenclaws that come up with the equivalent of scientific racism, or are so concerned with "staying objective" that they don't act, or are so withdrawn in their ivory towers that they don't care or know at all. Give me Gryffindors or hell even Wormtail who think Voldemort is right and that they need to be "bold and courageous" in supporting the cause.

Just give me nuanced characters with motives that don't boil down to "green bad, red/blue/yellow good" for fuck's sake.

** They were bullies, though. When Harry serves detention in HBP he has to go through a lot of papers about the detentions that the Marauders served for cursing random innocent persons that were never mentioned among the Death Eaters, so they clearly went around cursing others for the fun of it. Not to mention that turning someone upside down, and threaten to expose their genitals to the whole school is never acceptable.

** Look, while I personally like reading Snape-centric fics where he turns his life around and thus am somewhat biased, there is no denying that Marauders /were/ bullies. Not just to Snape either, there is canon proof that they treated others horribly as well even if Snape was a favorite target. See the detention slips Harry had to go through of his father. In fact, inflating someone's head (one example of what they did to someone that wasn't Snape) is something that can be outright lethal, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was done using "lesser" Dark Magic.

There is a difference between considering Snape a horrible person for everything he did (which I can totally understand), and outright victim blaming, which I feel like you are doing here.

How is Snape responsible for Draco's behavior (Snape taught him death threats, you say)? /Maybe/ --- & hear me out --- he learned that sort of behavior from his parents, the people who raised him, specifically Lucius Malfoy?

** I think that Snape was a particular target of the Marauders because he was friends with Lily. When faced with being outnumbered four to one, he was pushed into the arms of the other big bloc of students, ie the proto-DE of the time.

I do think that the HBP book shows that Snape wasn't as much of a victim as a lot of pro-Severus fics like to portray. It's likely that Snape was immersed into getting an eye for an eye, and that he did this at the backing of the DE movement.

I agree that there's culpability on the part of Snape in regards to the werewolf prank. He absolutely should have known that it was a con at best, and a life-dangering situation otherwise. Still, the fact that it was even proposed is terrifying

Let's assume that Snape actually did listen to some provocation? Really? Is it really Sirius' fault that Snape listened to him say some random jokes? How many years of random words has Snape been subjectd to by this point? Why is THIS the seminal judgment? Why is THIS point the one point that Sirius should be judged by, over Snape?"

Anyway, the answer is absolutely yes we should judge Sirius for this. I don't remember in canon if we ever got told what specifically Sirius said to Snape, but we do know that Sirius told Snape how to get past the willow and that he would find out what was up with Remus if he did. Which if nothing else, and there is a lot else, is a clear and drastic violation of Remus' trust; it also puts Snape on a collision course with a werewolf.

If James Potter hadn't intervened Snape would be dead and/or infected with lycanthropy and Remus would've been executed for killing and/or infecting Snape.

TL: DR Sirius nearly committed a double murder by being at best willfully negligent and at worst in a manner both deliberate and malicious, so yes I will absolutely judge him.
