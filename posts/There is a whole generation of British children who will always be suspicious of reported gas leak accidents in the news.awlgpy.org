*** *Irish rebel song*

In Ireland, a rebel song is a folk song whose lyrics extol the deeds of actual or fictional participants in any of the various armed rebellions against English, and later British, rule in Ireland. Songs about older rebellions were long popular with most Irish nationalists; more recent songs are associated with supporters of physical force Irish republicanism.

*** Well with Brexit about to happen and whats gonna happen between northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland still in flux (not to mention the huge economic hit possible which tends to grow discontent) this generation of children may once again hear them songs.
