I've now told my sister my username and password to fanfiction.net so she can put up one last update should I ever die.

***** That's a very charitable outlook you have there!

It's a combination of a few things really. Certainly really life has gotten in the way, but I've also had some difficulty reconciling my plans for the story with my desires for a pleasing narrative flow.

Basically, my plans as they were would have necessarily involved a very... bitty and broken narrative, or a less bitty narrative only because it was padded with irrelevance. Had it been just one of those issues (real life or story woes) I think the delay would have been much reduced.

However, since Christmas I've had a long sit down and given the story a lot of thought. I have a plan, and I've started writing again.

So watch this space!

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

**** Empty Chairs at Empty Tables isn't completed yet but it's got some pretty intense emotional moments and some sappy romantic moments. I think that the author really does a good job showing the panic that someone would feel going back in time and the effect that would have on someone's mind. The main pairing is Remus/Hermione. It's one of those stories I get sucked in and it can take my mind off of my real life.

  Empty Chairs at Empty Tables I Have no idea what that is. Regarding Black Bond. Well, are you a fan of Sirius, a Sirius where he's an actual human being and not a fandom "prankster daredevil" ? Where his time in Azkaban and the atrocities in his life shape his personality and emotions? Also, its a Harry/OC (Acquila Black, Sirius and Athena's daughter) and most ppl don't seem to enjoy this type of pairing. I loved the story, found it both compeling and realistic with the characters emotions and reactions. It has angst in quite an amount in some parts but also has lighthearted moments. The only issue for me is the fact that the writes haven't updated in a long while. There's a sequel Black Bond II, but it only has 2 chapters so far. Also, this is a really slow pace story, this 1.25m only gets till the summer before year 4. So if that's not your thing, i'm sorry. You also have to remember that the Summers aren't just glossed over, because they have a life outside of Hogwarts. In all honesty, it was this story that made me love OCs and Sirius in general. So, your question, is it worth it ? Well, for me it was, and i'd read 3m more if it took to finish the story. Hope that answers your question.
