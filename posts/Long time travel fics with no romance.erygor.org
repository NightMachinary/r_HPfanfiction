Please recommend me fics that fit this criteria: 1. Over 70k words if a WIP, over 100k words if complete 2. Not abandoned 3. Main character is either Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Fleur, or Lily Evans 4. Gen (no romance or very background romance, het/slash/femslash is fine) 5. Not a super dark fic 6. No Evil!Harry or Evil!Hermione or whatever 7. Third person only

Edit: No Harry/Voldemort or Hermione/Snape or weird ships like that


** The second string has romance towards the end but is a very good fic.

** Hey I forgot to link this one when I commented earlier. I loved this fic. Harry is MOD but not OP. It is extremely well written and pays a lot of attention on the particulars of the era. It is going to be slash but there is no romance yet. It is only updated on ao3 though.
