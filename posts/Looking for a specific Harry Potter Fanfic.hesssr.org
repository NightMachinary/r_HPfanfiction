:END:
I am looking for this Harry Potter fanfic that I read a month or so ago on Wattpad. In it Harry had mastered ancient tunes and had them written on practically everything. He had also started using a training room that if I remember correctly Salazar Slytherin set up for Godric Gryffindor as an anniversary present. During Christmas break almost all of the students leave but Harry remains at the castle. Fenrir Greyback gets in the castle and under ancient tunes that make Harry invisible soundless and make him unable to be smelled he kills Greyback. Eventually the story reveals itself to have multiple ships including Harry such as Snarry, Drarry, Blarry, and NevillexHarry. They all end up getting married preventing Ginny from forcibly Marrying Harry.
