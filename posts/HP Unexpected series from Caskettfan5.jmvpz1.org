Hoping that I just suck at searching and someone can help. Just read these two fics:

- Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend
- Harry Potter and the Unexpected Dogfather

And looked for book three... nothing. Any chance there are more of these hiding somewhere? Such good work worldbuilding to quit after two.

Thanks!


** There's no book three because book two isn't complete yet. And book two just updated three days ago, so the author hasn't quit yet.

*** Shit. I swear the date on those was 2018.

Thanks for the pointer though. I'm willing to take the shame for the good(ish) news. Not a big fan of waiting, and so I stick mostly with complete stories if I can help it.

Thanks again!
