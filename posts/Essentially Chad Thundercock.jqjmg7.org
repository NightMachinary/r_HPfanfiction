I love realistic fics, I love the romantic ones, I love dark and evil harry fics and everything in between. But right now I'm really in the mood for one where Harry is just a Chad. Absolutely runs everything, has little to no faults and is generally the next merlin.

If anyone has any recommendations for these that would be very appreciated. Especially if they deal with magic not very well explored in canon. As well as harry being magically powerful, if he was also powerful politically and disgustingly rich too that would be a plus.

Sometimes I don't want to read a piece of art, sometimes I just want to relax and read some outlandish and ridiculous content. So if anyone gets what I'm trying to get across I would love some suggestions. IDC if there are relationships or harems, or if there's smut or not.

** posting a comment here that i will edit later, does it need to focus on smut or is it okay if smut is just a side thing?

fic 1: overpowered harry, no smut but cool fic: linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches - revenge is best served raw by leadvone)

fic 2: decently powered harry, basically only smut fic: linkffn(harry potter's personal toy tester by kenriot1214)

***** As long as it's written in a semi coherent manner I don't see an issue. If it sounds like I slammed my face against a keyboard to type it out than I'm not interested

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why. HP/TR

** This got me looking for Virgin Vs. Chad memes involving Harry Potter. Tragically, it appears that every single one out there makes Harry Potter (both the character and the franchise) the Virgin.
