I forgot the name but Hermione cheats on Ron, and leaves Ron to take care of Rose and Hugo. Years later Ron dies during a mission and Rose bans Hermione from the funeral. Next chapter Hermione is dead and rekindles with Ron in Kings across to board the train to the afterlife, driven by snape. There they reconnect and talk through everything.
