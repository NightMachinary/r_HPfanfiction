*** bulbasaur is actually the best. it's leech seeds are so powerful, and it can also learn sleep power/toxic and giga drain.

** my favorite pokemon... hmm a tricky question you ask. Do I the elegant yet forceful trainer answer with versatility or pure destructive power? For the latter my favorite pokemon is Metagross. Yet for versatility one is hard pressed to find a pokemon with as many uses as mew... If legendaries were banned from contention that spot would go to Sylveon due to its dual tanking capabilities.

*** Metagross. A great choice, although I prefer 1st gen the most.
