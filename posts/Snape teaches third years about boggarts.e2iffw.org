*** Hmm...something to contemplate, there. Third year was the year when Sirius Black broke out of Azkaban, proving that it's not inescapable.\\
Neville knows about the Lestrange family, and how they tortured his parents into insanity, and the Dementors around Hogwarts are a constant reminder that Sirius Black is on the loose...so why isn't Neville's greatest fear that Bellatrix or one of the other Lestranges would follow in Sirius Black's footsteps and escape, or else that Sirius Black might take a leaf out of his cousin's book?
