I was recently reading ‚ÄúKicking Gotham‚Äù by steel badger on ffn and found it to be a really good read.. And was wondering why aren't there more fix's like that I feel like most of the Harry Potter & DC crossovers become too cringe too fast especially those self gratifying harem stories ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


** I'm glad you enjoyed it. The state of Harry Potter/DC crossovers is a particular bugbear of mine. I don't understand how there can be so many stories, but every single one is either:

1. Blood Brandy Vegas Challenge. These are always abandoned within the first 3 chapters, and those three chapters is basically identical for every single one of the stories, only with the names of the lady/ladies changed. I do dislike it when a crossover is included for the singular reason of giving the main character more ladies to have sex with.
2. Harry is actually Superman (or some other flying brick) WITH MAGIC! Because the only way to have fun in DC is to be the most powerful character around.
3. Filled with terrible Indy!Harry tropes (evil Dumbledore, Deus ex Goblina, etc)
4. Just smut (See 1, 2 & 3, for the most part)
5. By Megamatt (which usually involves 2, 3 & 4)

I guess the good news is that it got me annoyed enough while looking for stuff that it actually prompted me to start writing again. Also, I'm 12k words through pre-writing the sequel.

*** I think part of it is that magic is a pretty big part in DC, and basically everybody included in the category is more powerful than anyone in HP. I think it's a bit difficult to slot in Harry and have it feel right unless you're explicitly limiting it to Bat-family titles or maybe the Arrowverse.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4953046][Wizard Among Bats]] by somefantasytosurvivereality) is a really good one! It takes place at the beginning of book 5 and has Dick Grayson as a previously unknown nephew of Vernon who the Dursleys want to impress because he's the son of a billionaire. It does a great job of integrating Harry into the DC world.

#+begin_quote
  Harry comes back to Privet Drive after another tiring year of school, but there is another unexpected guest there. It turns out Vernon Dursley has a nephew as well, and 19 year old Dick Grayson seems to be nothing like the Dursleys that Harry has grown to hate. Maybe this Summer will be a little bit better with some company.

** I second both of the above and would like to add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13003733/1/Deadly-Nightshade][Deadly Nightshade]]. Harry's the son of Poison Ivy, who is a third Evans sister. Starts before Hogwarts and currently about to start 2nd year.
