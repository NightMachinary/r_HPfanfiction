:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This was the first and most touching Drarry fic i read, and it made me fall in love with the idea of HPDM but now that i want to recommend it to someone i simply can't remember the name.

The story had Draco stuck between timelines or universes or something and had been pronounced missing. Harry was assigned the case to find him and for that, he studied his life. He found sad secrets about Draco's life as to how he was pressured, manipulated and forced to do the things he did. found that he had become a rebel later and had bought a car that he loved. no one has touched the car ever since he went missing but harry took it out and about. every now and then he would see glimpses of Draco, a translucent image. later we find that Draco was stuck between dimensions (?) and was actually trying to project himself near Harry trying to ask him for help.

Has anyone else read this? please share the name if you can! my best friend just read the books for the first time and i need her to fall in love with Drarry too so that we can fangirl together :')
