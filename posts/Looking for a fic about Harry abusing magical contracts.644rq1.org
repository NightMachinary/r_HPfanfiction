It was posted on Fanfiction.net

the story started in Goblet of Fire after Harry's name came out of the cup

it was complete

I remember a scene where Harry traps the guest entrance to the MoM so that anyone who went through it would agree to a contract. He did the same thing at St. Mungos

** I remeber one were Harry made the punishments for breaking a magical contract something good and then deliberately broke the contract. I have forgotten which story it was by now.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.
