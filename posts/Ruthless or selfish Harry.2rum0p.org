Are there any good stories where Harry is ruthless and/or behaving selfishly (at least to a certain degree)?

Don't really care if he's on Dumbledore's or Voldemort's side or neither.

I'm thinking of a Harry like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][swimdraconian's Circular Reasoning]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][Marshall Angmar's The Dark's Rise]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8082923/1/Give-It-Your-Best-Shot][Zenathea's Give It Your Best Shot]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][OhYeah100's Welcome to Hogwarts in 1949]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Anonymous 58's Control]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9735652/1/Salvation-in-Shadow][odev's Salvation in Shadow]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][leave this world's Only Enemies]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2817585/1/Malignant-Objects][Charlie -dashdot- Blue's Malignant Objects]] or even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][Mira Mirth's On the Way to Greatness]]. Harry is characterized differently in each of these stories, but in all of them does seem to be more concerned with his own well being / is more ruthless than canon!Harry. So... any recs?

*** Highly recommend Too Young to Die, one of my all-time favorite fics. The beginning chapter isn't all that well-written, but the writing and the plot picks up toward the middle.

*** Too Young To Die is awesome. The end was a bit of a let down, but I suppose it fits anyways. Definitely gives a much better reason for going downright evil then "Boo I was ignored as a kid."

*** Thanks! I read Too Young to Die, it was a nice read. I think I started Princess of the Blacks once but didn't like it.

** No one mentioned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] yet! The first one is nice. However, the sequel isn't up to par for me.

*** Thanks! I'll take a look at it. Saw this a few times already, but never got around reading it. Does Sirius play a role in these stories?

** Just read Zenatha's Give it Your Best Shot. Very good. Too bad that it is most likely abadoned. Thanks for the rec.
