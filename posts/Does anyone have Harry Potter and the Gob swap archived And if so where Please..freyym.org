So I've been looking for a fanfic I once read, called Harry Potter and the Gob Swap, It's a Fleur and Harry body swap written by Writen09. Unfortunately they seemed to have removed it. I really want to read it because of the nostalgia feels. So if anyone can send me a link or a file for the fanfic I would really appreciate it.


** That sounds very entertaining, I would also like to read it
