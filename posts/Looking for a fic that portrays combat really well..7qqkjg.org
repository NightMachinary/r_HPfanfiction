It seems combat is where a lot of authors kinda just say meh and skip it in this universe. Probably because there's so much variety, yet it's all overshadowed by overpowered one shot wonder spells... Any recommendations?

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Here's a story I wrote many years ago that includes several long combat scenes. Like you, I've always been kind of bothered about how most authors wrote them. Hope you enjoy.

Once you get pass the dry philosophical chapters from the start of the fic you get into the interesting parts of the story. It then continues to have impressive when the author writes the combat and battle scenes. This author somehow makes the characters' actions come to life. It is almost like watching a action pack movie. The spells and movements also vary so you never know what to expect.

linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

Actually, I'll give you my favorite scene. Considering the fic is so long, this does not spoil much in terms of plot:

(Chapter 3: The Great Black Hunter) - Regulus POV

#+begin_quote
  Then he gasped and clumsily turned when Sirius made another one of those reality-defying swerves and entered a side-alley that finished in a dead end. Cursing under his breath, he was about to mutter something about Sirius apparently not knowing muggle London as well as he seemed to when he got first first real reason to panic.

  His brother wasn't slowing down.

  It was like watching a train wreck. Horrifying, mind-numbingly shocking and yet somehow impossible to tear your eyes [a]way from it. Sirius drove forward, accelerated to the maximum and then hit the breaks, leaning backwards and pulling the front of the bike along, looking every bit as though he was going to start riding up the wall.

  With a cracking blast of raw magic, the motorbike left the pavement. Sirius pushed the accelerator all the way through, just as his bike slammed into the wall wheels-first...

  ...and then proceeded to ride up the wall as if it had always been meant to do that.

  The roar of the engine got cleared the higher the bike came, like a dragon rising from the depths of a volcanic lair. The bike picked up speed with every meter it ascended and then the 20-story building suddenly came to an end.

  The death eater broomstick pursuit squad broke ranks when Sirius shot up from below like a cannonball, right into their midst. One of them lost his hold on his broom and fell with a muffled scream. Regulus didn't pay attention, nor did he care if he would remember to apparate or cast a Arresto Momentum before completing the process of plummeting to his death. More interesting was the sight of Sirius Orion Black righting himself and spinning on his two wheels as though he were on the highway, outlined perfectly against the half-moon. It was like the sky had chosen to be miraculously clear of London's normal pollution on that particular night just so the scene would be possible.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
