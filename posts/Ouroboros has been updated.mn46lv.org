And it's a chapter from Voldemort's POV.

It's amazing.

** Man this fic is absolutely phenomenal, the writing style and characterization of both Voldemort's is top tier.

Definitely one of the best fics i've read recently.

The Fanfiction(.)net summary didn't have M/M warning otherwise I would have skipped past it, but its not too heavy so far. May stop reading if Tom/Marvolo's relationship gets too deep.

*** I found it by accident and it just sucked me in! It's amazing!

The author has a real talent for gut punches, there's this one line in an early chapter, where baby Tom asks if Marvolo will still want to adopt him if he gets to know him. God... I teared up.

**** I love the Ruthlessness(among other characteristics) the author brings out in Voldemort:

“Won't Grindelwald's men talk?”

#+begin_example
  “They’re dead.” Marvolo sneers, displeased about it.  

  There is only one reason Marvolo would ever be unhappy with the news of someone dying. 

  Because he hadn’t killed them himself.
#+end_example

- its the subtle hints like this and then the madness of killing 31 muggles for sport that really add to the mix

Also my favourite part so far has to be when Marvolo just walked into Hogwarts and absolutely verbally flamed Dumblefore speachless using future(/past?) knowledge. It seemed so sudden and impctful. One of those ‘oh shit' moments.

Yeah in the last chapter(I think) he brings up a very vulnerable side to Marvolo when describing his life and reason for creating more and more horcrux's.

Personally I would rather Marvolo not have such glaring and transparent(despite him not showing it outwardly) vulnerabilities and be the more cold efficient leader. But i'm sure this will add to Tom/Marvolo's relationship later on as a way for Tom to help ‘fix' Marvolo.

****** It's pretty good although it wasn't exactly my style. Basically Slytherin is reincarnated into Harry's body, it has some really amazing worldbuilding, some of the best/most unique interpretations I've seen in some places, but falls into some over used cliches in others.
