In which Harry has a sibling who gets confused as the Child-Who-Lived. Harry doesn't get sent away but instead is loved by his parents. Later in the story Harry must find out that he is the true Boy-Who-Lived, but he is content to tell no one because he adores his sibling. In the end Harry reveals himself and help to defeat whoever the main antagonist is.

Compliment with Dark!Potters and Dumbles Bashing as well as regular cannon
