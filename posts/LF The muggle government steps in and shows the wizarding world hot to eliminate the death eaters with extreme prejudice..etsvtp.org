**** Ten thousand regular mortals against what is essentially a demigod.

-Wizarding settlements are imperceptible by Muggles -Wizards can teleport into any muggle settlement, throw down some fiendfyre, teleport away, and just like that a city or military base is razed. -Wizards have invisibility. -Wizards have like a dozen different methods of mind control.
