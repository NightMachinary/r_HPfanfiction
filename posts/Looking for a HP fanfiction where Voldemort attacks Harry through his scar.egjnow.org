:END:
Hi all! I'm hoping this isn't a double post. I tried to post earlier but it said that it couldn't reach reddit then locked up. So here we go (hopefully not again). I read a fanfiction where Sirius and Remus rescue Harry from the Dursley's and take him to the Burrow. Harry is sick because Voldemort is attacking his mind through the scar. Snape comes to observe to see if he can help. And learns a bit more about Harry. Snape's (blonde) wife ends up making an ointment using Harry's blood to protect him from the attacks. So Voldemort hires a spy whose animagus form is a hummingbird. The spy notifies Voldemort by ringing a flower (bell) when Harry comes out of the shower and isn't wearing the ointment. Can anyone help me find it? Please and Thanks.

ETA: Added direct link. Hope it works as I'm on mobile.
