I'm looking for any fics where Harry goes back in time and becomes a professor at Hogwarts, but specifically where he would be teaching himself. Teaching in Riddle's or the Marauder's era is okay, too.

Any pairings, including slash, are okay. Would prefer them to be completed, but will take what I can get. Thanks!

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair?the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  This has been sitting on my hard drive for years, but it wasn't until I read the above story that I finally decided to get it finished.

**** I put off reading it for a long time because the thought of Harry and Bella was... wrong. However once I finally gave it a shot I loved it. The timetravel in the story is the best I've ever seen in a fanfiction.

--------------

Spoilerish bit here, though it happens at the beginning of the story so it isn't a huge deal.

Bella has this old family heirloom hairpin, she probably doesn't understand how it works or what it will actually do. She is being detained in a cell with Harry, and they bond a bit, mostly by giving verbal jabs at each other. She then activates the heirloom, her intent is probably to give herself a better life among everything else. Harry then 'wakes up' in the past when Bella first pinched the pin from the Black vault in Gringotts. She is still in Hogwarts, she isn't a complete wack, they do a good job explaining and hinting at how she became who she is.

**** It's definitely one of the better-written time-travel stories I've read. And I guess it kind of depends on why you don't like Bellatrix. The young Bellatrix Black in this story is very different from canon Bellatrix Lestrange.
