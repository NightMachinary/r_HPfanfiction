Is it just me or are almost all of the stories i read that all the other magical communities across the world find the British Wizarding community are a bunch of idiots and backwards and dont want nothing to do with them and hogwarts is behind the times


** Aside from mugglewank and wizardwank, there is quite large group of yankeewank stories written by patriotic Americans (I believe).

*** Strange, I actually see very little set in the States. Usually France with the Delacours is the one laughing at Britain.

**** Right, I avoid Harry/Fleur and Harry/Gabrielle as a plague, so I haven't read any of those.

**** As someone who's done that before, it's because there's no real show of the US in the books. I'm aware of some other sources, but still.

Fleur and Krum provide two sources for Harry to leave for if he gets the heck out of Britain.

** It's hard not to see that, with how Rowling paints Britain in the books.

I mean, they could be as bad or worse, but if that were the case...the statute would be broken by now.

** Because Magical Britain is kind of awful in a lot of ways, and it's hard to change that without going full AU. But plenty of people want their magical escapist fantasy world to actually be a nice place to live. The easiest way to reconcile those two ideas is to just say that the rest of the world is much better.

** Magical Britain is also the only magical society we know of that went from Grindelwald to LV to LV again and went from having Dumbledore to have to rely on a kid. From what we know of Dumstrang, I couldn't see this part of the magical world being very impressed by a society on the brink of collapse every decade.

*** The books make it clear that most of Britain's issues arise from two sources that are often linked: traditionalism and purebloods.

My own view is it's likely Grindelwald killed a LOT of purebloods on the continent, so it's unlikely they have as much of an issue with them, which probably helped out a ton compared to Britain.

** In canon, it's rather unlikely as Dumbledore, a British wizard, was elected as the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, so the rest of the world is either no different or even worse than Britain. In fanfiction, it really depends on the story being told. My preference is ones where the rest of the world isn't too different (and more sane than canon).
