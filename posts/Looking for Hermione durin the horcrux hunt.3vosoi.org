Are you looking for a Hermione centric fic with Hermione - Ron pairing? Or a fic where Hermione and Ron go on the Horcrux hunt (alone)?

Also, what kind of divergence would you like? Because your request, as of now, can be easily answered with [[http://www.amazon.de/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows/dp/0747591059][the original books]].

Maybe this thread got what you'Re looking for?
