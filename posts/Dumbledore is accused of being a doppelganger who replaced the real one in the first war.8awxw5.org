Just a random thought I had when reading These Grim Bones; so far in that fic, Dumbledore's been pretty adamant about thinking Sirius guilty, and I was wondering what kind of hypothesis Sirius would come up with regarding the whole situation...

And then I had an idea; what if Sirius believed that Dumbledore was in fact a fake? Killed/captured and replaced (almost like Crouch Jr. and Moody) earlier in the war, the doppelganger uses his disguise as Dumbledore to get members of the Order of the Phoenix killed, undermine the Ministry, while at the same time maintaining the deception that the 'good guys' are still on top and that other magical nations don't need to intervene to stop Voldemort? Then after Voldemort fell, fake-Dumbledore helped to conceal evidence and get Death Eaters acquitted and into power for next time.

I probably wouldn't be that interested in a fic where this is actually the case, but what about a story where someone believes it to be true? Sirius 'Azkaban Without Trial' Black for instance?

** In Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool By: The Mad Mad Reviewer linkffn(8175132), the elder wand is actually a horcrux of Grindewald and he took over Dumbledore's body. In another fic, it was Abeforth who replaced dead Dubledore. Actually there are many fics like that.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** There is this one WBWL where fake Dumbledore convinces the potters that Harry is useless and believes it himself since Harry hides his magic in a way when he's near due to him being a fake. Can't remember which fic it was though.
