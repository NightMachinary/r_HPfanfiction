"What about all the murder?" said Luna. "You gave a guy the power to kill people undetectably and then filmed it for your entertainment? Crucio!"

Of course nothing happened. Luna shrugged. "Didn't think that would work. Is mummy here?"

"What about Crumple Horned Snorkacks?"

"Those were coded messages, Xeno, I can't believe you didn't catch them."

Now there was only one thing left to do. "Can I help?" said Luna. "I want to make Draco Malfoy's life into a tragic farce."

Pandora smiled. "Of course you can, darling."
