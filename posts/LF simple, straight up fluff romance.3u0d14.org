I'm in one of those moods. I don't want any drama or angst or action, just pure fluff.

I will read any story that isn't slash, although I would prefer Harry-centric with someone who isn't Ginny or Hermione. I welcome any story that is well written, though.


** If you are okay with one that is currently in works and not quite in the lovie dovey part yet, I highly recommend linkffn(11111990). The author is creating a very nice fluff story and I love it.

Also my go to fluff story is linkffn(6862426). The author is not the best, there are four chapters before any romance even happens, and you have to put up with previous relationship. But the scenes with luna and the friendship Harry has with the two other players make it totally worth it in my mind.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

*** I second "Grow Young With Me". It's more angst right now, but still very sweet.

**** I wouldn't really call it angsty, it was just that one chapter that went into the past and even then we sorta knew what happened just didn't know the specifics.

***** True, I'm trying to think of a better word. It really makes you feel empathetic towards Harry. Sad?

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.
