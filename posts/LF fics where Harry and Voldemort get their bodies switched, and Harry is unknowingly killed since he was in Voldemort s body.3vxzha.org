** Hmm. Have you read Seventh Horcrux? When Voldemort goes to kill Harry, everything happens like in canon, except he accidentally implants himself in the baby's mind, turning Harry Potter into a baby Voldemort.

It's really good. Very funny.

*** Oh have I ever?

Seventh is like the best Voldemort in Harry fic.

Due to the lack of other fics, I have already read it twice.
