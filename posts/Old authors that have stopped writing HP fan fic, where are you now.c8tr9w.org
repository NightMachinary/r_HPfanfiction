** Not quite old (current profile is from 2013, first one from 2006), but I'm still around.

I have many ideas, most of them post-Hogwarts or Founder-Era (which wasn't an era I used to write), but I'm disappointed at the fan base, if it makes sense.

I get the /write for yourself, and if the rest enjoy it, good/, but there's not much motivation to write for a fandom that enjoys different things from what I want to write 🤷🏻‍♀️

Instead, I'm active in the ASOIAF fandom.

*** I have always been excited by Founders Era. It's just that there's not one fic in that Era that I can look at and say "That was acceptable"

Like the recent thread emphasized, a 1000 years or 12000 months or 365000 days is a /lot/ of time. All founder Era fics I have seen end up feeling /too/ modern.

Post-Hogwarts I admit I don't give much thought to but I think that's also because of the lack of plot-driven fics in that Era. They focus a bit too much on the characters for my liking. There is a serious lack of a balance. Whatever antagonist comes after Voldemort is always no match for the protagonist. People just seem too afraid to put the characters through any more hardships after having gone through Canon.

What I am trying to say is maybe if you wanted to write those things that I criticised, you may get a clearer idea of what goes through people's mind. If you wanted to write the things I praised then I for one will support you wholeheartedly. Perhaps you will feel encouraged and not disappointed.

**** Currently, I write character centric fics for HP because that's what gets me the reviews and hits. Some romance here and there, and angst. People like that formula, and I do enjoy writing them and like the finished piece. I also like slice of life a lot, so light hearted things like that.

But the things I want to write are character-driven plots. As each character grows and gets a life beyond Hogwarts, they discover new things that affect them and others. My favorite /plot bunny/ right now is Harry discovering, while in the middle of a particularly dire Auror case, that he really doesn't enjoy or like his work and only got there because it seemed the only option.

I've read fics like that one before, but as with you and the Founders' Era fics, they don't feel realistic. I want to write Harry conflicted at knowing he's doing something good with his life and wanting to do something good /for/ his life. I want to write about the case itself, about Percy Weasley and Kingsley Shaklebolt trying to convince Harry that the Auror Department is really the place for him (because it will give a wrong image to have the Chosen One bow out of it). I want Harry to be struggling to tell Ginny, who is going through her own “I could go back to Quidditch but is it really what I want to do?”.

At the end of the day, the ideas stay like that because of lack of motivation. I know fics like that have an audience, and even if it ends up being two or three people it will be great, so perhaps I'll give it a try.

Besides, I think it's time I stop complaining about the lack of plot-filled content and do something about it.

EDIT: and, now that I think of it, it might also be that I'm scared to try and write something like that because I'll have to /plan/ and dedicate myself to it instead of just writing a quick one-shot.

***** I understand that sentiment a bit too well. I love Ron Weasley. Would I ever be friends or even acquaintances with Ron Weasley, the person? Probably not given my current batch of cynic friends.

But week after week I am tempted by one situation or another to put that overshadowed friendly character in to /show/ the world what Ron would do.

#+begin_quote
  [Yeah, I decided on "show the world" instead of "see for myself" because I always think long enough to know what he would do]
#+end_quote

I think I suffer a syndrome similar to the "And then we'll be okay" syndrome which is "And then I will do it"

My English degree exams will be over and then I'll do it. My computer diploma exams will be over and then I'll do it. I'll take a break and then I'll do it....

Reality is that I too am afraid. I know there are people who will read it. I know there are people who appreciate the few chapters I write. But when I start thinking of /really/ writing then it gets too daunting too quickly.

****** A fic about Ron Weasley sounds really wonderful. It's, as you say, an overlooked friend and character with loads of potential and he almost never gets interesting plots (or plots in general).

As George Martin says in Arya's voice, /Fear cuts deeper than swords/. In this case, fear types better. We really should be able to overcome those fears of writing and leave all excuses behind.

Daunting is exactly the word I'd use. Or maybe overwhelming.

** I occasionally pop-up here and there with something, but my career and other half basically killed any spare time I have to write.

I do, however, run a good line in shitposting on the HPFF discord here and there.

** I wrote what can only be described as a terrible piece of hot garbage a couple months back, that doesn't make me a real author but I'm planning on sitting down and writin a well planned, hopefully much better piece of work now that I am no longer an angst ridden teenager.

** I write original fiction. I'd like to try and get something published but given my lacklustre performance with fanfiction I suspect I'm not good enough. I check in here and on the ffn forums now and then because I don't write HP fics anymore but they're still posted and people still read them from time to time. Every few weeks I even get a favourite or a follow which gives me a few seconds of excitement. My feelings about it all are a bit ambivalent these days though; I'll probably delete them eventually.

** Back, I guess? I started writing at least a decade ago, but I was young and foolish then so my fics weren't very good at all. I remember having a fic posted in Portkey back when it was still active. I took a long break from fanfiction writing, tried out original writing for a bit, and then came back into the world of HP fanfiction last year when I wasn't able to find fics I wanted to read.

Now here I am trying to juggle multiple WIPs. It's been a fun year of writing though!

** I updated a story from 2011 last year. After seven years. >_< At least it has some sort of feeling of closure now.

I'm kind of around. I read HP fanfic still, but I don't really write it anymore. I'm writing an ATLA fic now, and that's all sorts of fun. It's making me want to get back into writing HP stories, though. I have a bunch of partly written stories in google docs that I could probably work on next, 100% of which were started before 2010, though, so probably no one would want to read them anymore since the fandom has evolved a lot since then.
