I've been reading fanfiction for over 12 years now. I haven't read the original books since Deathly Hallows came out. Got into a debate with a co-worker about different characters. I tried explaining my viewpoint of many of them but he didn't seem to understand. I perceived it as me just being more knowledgeable about the story, but now i'm reconsidering.

Does anyone else have obvious perceptions outside of what is considered canon typically? Like, Molly Weasley for example. Fans of the books/movies love her as a character because that is how she's intended to be viewed. A motherly, if overbearing character type. I'd say most avid fanfiction readers no matter your genre or tropes have a vastly different viewpoint of the character.

I love fanfiction and doubt i'll ever stop reading. I do wonder if it has diminished my enjoyment of the original series if I were to read it again. I certainly have a hard time watching the movies without critiquing their every move.


** Because I almost exclusively read and write canon compliant stuff I don't think my perceptions have been skewed at all. But you only have to look at the differences between this sub and the main HP sub to see that you're right; there are a lot of very different perceptions of the characters and plots. I think people here appreciate a more adult, dark version of events.

**** I believe the movies had a huge negative impact on people's perception of Ron and Ginny. Steve Klose shit on them pretty badly, and then a bunch of these viewers continued to shit on them in fanfics.

On the other end of spectrum, Tom Felton and Alan Rickman did well in their characters, and Steve Klose cut out lots of their meanest scenes in the Books. As a result, fandom (mostly girls) literally worshipped Draco and Snape.

Oh definitely. Snape would never be as well-liked as he is now if he wasn't played by Alan Rickman. The books paint him pretty unfavorably (stereotypical evil potions master and creep turned traitor) but the movies much less so (funny asshole teacher who turns into charismatic villain).

To be fair, I remember both of these perceptions existing in the fan community long before the movies started coming out. My opinion of Ron took a pretty steep nose dive when I read GoF (2000), which came out before the first movie (2001), and I know I'm not the only one that happened to. I also think Ginny is an extremely weak character in both the books and the movies and never really "bought" the Harry/Ginny romance. JKR really wasted her potential by not giving her enough page time to properly develop her.

Though I have never seen the appeal of Snape or school-aged Draco.

******** Some people think that Harry and Ginny could not have stayed together because high school couples rarely last long. Well, let's take a look at some facts from the books:

- Both were possessed by a dark power once and survived

- Both fought against evil terrorists bent on killing them since they were 11

- The guy went on guerrilla warfare, while the girl stayed behind enemy lines as underground resistance leader

- The girl was tortured several times for supporting her guy, the guy went willingly to his death to save his girl (and other loved ones)

- Finally, after a brief glimpse of the 'heaven', the guy still decided to come back to join his girl, what would the girl think of that?

- On top of that, they shared a common interest (quidditch) and many personality traits (wicked sense of humor).

Are Harry and Ginny your average high school couple?

In fact, none of the couples who fought at Battle of Hogwarts should be considered 'average high school teenagers'.

But yeah, I agree the epilogue makes the things look kind of weird. The first few books were a light-ish fairy tale, then the last few were dark, and the epilogue went fairy tale again which tastes like a sandwich with jam and pickles and oatmeal and chorizo (in other words, weird).

** I'm sure these are fanfic creations:

- 'Greater Good' Dumbledore: he only believed in it until Ariana was killed.

- Pacifist, stunners only Dumbledore: at least there is no conclusive evidence of that in canon.

- Prophecy believing Dumbledore: he repeatedly explained to Harry in Book 6 that prophecy was a self-fulfilling thing.

- Purebloods were villains: in fact, the three biggest jerks in the Series were all half-bloods (Tom, Snape, Umbridge). Large portion, if not majority, of Voldemort's rank and file were half-bloods. The DA, ironically, had more than 50% purebloods which was quite higher than their demographic representation in magical Britain implied by JKR (30%). The Order also seemed to be pureblood heavy.

- Magical Britain was a patriarchal society: not true, they had female Minister as early as 1717. Magic was also the great power equalizer. They still had to take care of children though, which was perhaps the main reason why many stayed at home. But that didn't mean they would defer to their men, Narcissa and Molly definitely showed how much influence they wielded in their households.

- Ron was abusive: he complained more, but Hermione was definitely the far more violent one when upset. Some railed about Ron making Hermione cry after the 'Wingadium Leviosa' episode. But if you take an objective view, you will notice how arrogant and tactless Hermione behaved toward Ron. Afterwards, Ron only lashed out with bitter truth, which Hermione knew was true, or else she would have hexed him.

*** I have a different perspective on some of these.

- Greater Good Dumbledore: he rejected the philosophy, yes, but we still very much have Chessmaster!Dumbledore. His whole plan in HBP and DH shows that. It's just that he now considers the consequences of his actions to others (even though he still makes mistakes).

- Pacifist Dumbledore: I've come to the conclusion that this is actually "pacifist" JKR. Note that Molly killing Bellatrix is the only time in the books where a good character is confirmed to kill an evil character (well, besides Nagini), despite ample opportunities and motivation in a real war. I suspect JKR didn't want her teen protagonists killing people in a YA series.

- Bad Ron: I agree that Ron is a good guy, but immature, while Hermione is definitely the most vindictive of the Trio, something I've tried to play up in my fics. However, I think the biggest reason people hate Ron is when he leaves Harry and Hermione in DH. When I reread the books, even I was surprised by how much it hurt when he left. It's really easy to hate him then, even if you normally don't.

First of all, it was Harry's INSANE INSPIRATION to wear a Horcrux around their necks. What was he thinking?! He had as much to blame for Ron's leaving as Ron himself, IMO. Why the other two didn't object to that insanity was also beyond me.

I always imagined that as one hell of an overreaction. Hermione heard Ron make that statement right after charms, so roughly 2:15 in the afternoon. Regular dinner schedule is from 6-8, and I will assume the Halloween feast fell in that timeframe. So Hermione was in that bathroom crying for somewhere between 4-5 hours because some kid she didn't even like pointed out that she didn't have friends because of her habit of rubbing her accomplishments in others' faces.

Crying is freaking exhausting. At the very least she should have been dehydrated after all that.

I think that is his entire philosophy on life and magical existence, to be perfectly honest with you. So we can happily resume our fundamental disagreements on Dumbledore again!

No conclusive evidence in canon.

I agree with [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] that JKR is a pacifist or she just didn't want to get too realistic about wars in an YA story. Fighting a war against the likes of Death Eaters would be just as rough as fighting against Nazis or ISIS. I can perfectly understand her motivation, but as an adult reader, I'm not satisfied. That's why I enjoy fanfics such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] far more than canon Books.

The Dumbledore in both fics truly lived up to his reputation as a vanquisher of Grindelwald.

***** I definitely agree with the first part, and I think it goes beyond it being a YA novel, and I realize it probably makes it worse in your book, but that's what I think is canon, not what I think is the most enjoyable thing to read. Basically, I don't think Dumbledore is killing people unbeknownst to Harry. I do think Dumbledore can be.... a difficult enemy however (whatever he did to Kreacher to get him to talk is probably the tip of the iceburg), but wouldn't /kill/. And my reasoning for that is less to do about young readers and more to do with my belief that magic and death are intertwined in this series and understanding death is necessary to understand the sort of magic involved between Harry and Voldemort and someone with that understanding would not be so willy nilly with ending lives, even, and perhaps especially, his enemies. Again, I understand if that sounds childish and/or making the world seem too perfect, and you're probably right, but that is what I see in the canon.

I don't, however, think this particular type of magic matters with the Order vs Death Eaters, only between Voldemort vs Harry, and have always considered the Order's purpose to be the army that needs to be willing to kill - like Lupin says after escaping Privet Drive. I assume he and many of his fellow Order members (maybe excluding the Weasleys) did kill, or at least were perfectly ready to.

I know you tend to think ending your enemy's life is always the best course of action (I think you've said that anyway, correct me if I'm wrong), but I don't think it's /always/ strategically useful, and Dumbledore staying his hand is often just as much about strategy as it is about pacifism.

Basically, I think Dumbledore's pacifism is just one contributing factor to his avoidance of killing.

edit: okay, I know I'm rambling, but I mean - I think he is aware and approves of what his Order needs to do to win, and he would do it to if he weren't so bleeding powerful, meaning he doesn't need to kill in order to over-power his enemies. If he did resort to killing, he would know, in his heart, that it was avoidable, meaning /he/ would know he did it because he wanted to, and not because it was necessary.

****** Still, Hermione is usually portrayed as being the victim in that example, when it was just people reacting negatively to someone who was quite honestly an unlikable person. You can't blame Ron for venting over her attitude a bit. (and remember Harry also disliked her at that point but was a just bit more diplomatic about it)

Not saying she deserved to be attacked by a troll, and I can see why she'd be upset by their comments. What I mean though is she was plenty old enough to know to temper a few of her more abrasive traits if people liking her was a big deal. By that age, most kids know better.

If you want people to like you, you need to be a likeable person. Hermione was not a likeable person at that phase. Ron for all his faults was at least personable at times.

To be fair, both Ron and Hermione were some of my least favorite characters. Both of them are so riddled with personality traits that I downright loathe in people. Hermione even after all her character development is still a nag, and Ron for all his desire to stand out is too much of a passive follower. I don't like stories where they're bashed, but I also dislike how their fans tend to sanctify both of them.

So authors stand up for her. And I think at 12 you definitely don't know how to temper yourself.

And the way the books and movies portrayed it (particularly the movies) she didn't want to help her classmates learn, she was an insufferable know-it-all who was just showing off (Snape probably shouldn't have told her in that manner, but he was spot-on). It's not that she was smart, it was her constant /need/ to show everyone else that she was smart that made her unlikeable.

It goes both ways, though. If you think about it, really think, then what Ron said wasn't really that much of a deal. It was, if I remember correctly, “she's a nightmare, really, it's no wonder she doesn't have any friends”; not the most polite thing to say, but he isn't insulting her or anything but simply commenting on the truth.

And really, any person with the ability to read the intent can tell you that Hermione was not trying to /help/ others, but to show off the fact that she can do stuff. That's the kind of thing you do with someone who already is your friend, not to random people whose reactions you do not know. If Hermione didn't know that by then then either she was very sheltered or the kids she'd been interacting with were seething inside but did not do anything because their parents told them not to reject Hermione for whatever reason (likely because of her parents, though this very idea is unlikely to be true).

***** Actually, he does. It's just that many of the darker things introduced later and shown to the readers do hit his weakest points. The 11-year-old Ron wouldn't have gone with Harry and Hermione for their camping trip, for example. And as for “failing” at his “role”, sure, but those were things with extenuating circumstances; Ron's deepest desire is to be /acknowledged/ by those around him as someone who isn't just a part of the background and for something that would be of his own making, which does not excuse his jealousy in book 4 but does actually justify his behaviour; likewise, the visions presented to him by the horcrux also make sense---by then, much of what he accomplished ties with Harry and Hermione, so if they were to live and denounce him he'd again be left with nothing---and he would have been right back had it not been for the snatchers.

The movies do him a great disservice by skipping around the issue of /that/ being his particular problem and by giving some of his better moments to Hermione. The perception of him as an utter failure of a human being is something that a lot of people carried from the movies and placed in fanfics, leading to the self-perpetuation of such an image of Ron. Is he immature? Sure, he is, he is just a kid after all. But he very much is capable of bettering himself and above all he is not above apologising for being an arse, something that for some bizarre reason many real-life people cannot do.

PS. I do not particularly /like/ Ron, I will add, for reasons related to my upbringing and other stuff, but I do find him at least tolerable and I am defending him here because I see it as what should be done.

  “Scarlet woman?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.

  “It's what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going red.

You're leaving out the context in the third one. Skeeter's article accused Hermione of using /Love Potions/ to seduce multiple men. "Scarlet woman" seems a fine, if crude description.

The second one, yes, does not speak well of Ron. But do note that Ron's issue with Ginny dating is because his younger sibling has a love life and he doesn't, which adds to his "overshadowed by siblings" story. So while the way he frames it does sound sexist (and is rightfully slapped down for it), his thought process isn't. Also note (for additional context) that Harry also inwardly supports Ron's statement, but for an entirely different reason.

** An aside, but one thing that's really interesting is that due to the nature of fandom and size of respective countries, I would wager that most fanfic writers are American; an audience that JKR would never have written the original three or four books with the intention of reaching.

One thing I find really interesting is that fandom view, as a hivemind, shaping major points accepted by the fandom and fanon points, is now American-dominated, or at least has a very sizeable chunk of influence. Partly because I myself am not American, and never read the original series from that cultural background and perspective, so it's interesting seeing what logical leaps American fans made and which direction their minds went in, which has now made it's way into baseline fanon.

Some things like the patriarchal society and witches being subservient, that another commenter remarks on not really being in the source text is one example; a lot of the ways gender is treated in fanon has its roots in a very, I feel, American perspective on stereotypical male and female characters. Another would be the attitude to government, or to crime and punishment.

I also feel that as the fandom has become more and more proportionally American, the prevalence of certain early ships like Wolfstar has gone down. I can't help but wonder if there's a link there.

You just need to take a look at prevalence of female executives at major American corporations to know that when it comes to gender equality, America is pretty close to Europe.

Yes, as to your first point, that's a good one too that I didn't think of at first. Capital punishment is another one; legal in the US, not so in the UK. As well as the relationship between everyone carrying wands and everyone carrying guns; probably not a parallel JKR would immediately have thought of when first writing, since public gun ownership is completely illegal in the UK except for land caretakers in areas with wild animals and the like.

Certain things which for JKR would have only been in the province of fantasy are, for American readers, very real.

(US) fanon views of certain characters is also interesting to consider. I've heard before that Harry's British cheekiness and snark doesn't translate that well to US readers.

#+end_quote

You hit on an interesting point here.

I hate to say it (because even here some people seem to worship canon), but JKR was really clumsy with her characters... in each case it is incredibly obvious what she was trying to do, but often it doesn't come across when taking the text for itself. I'm not particularly fond of requiring outside explanations or meta-knowledge to interpret the words.

A good example of this is Dumbledore... I think in the last subreddit survey opinions on that character were a 50:50 split, but whatever camp you fall in, if one of the main "good guys" in your series is seen in such a cynical light by 50% of your readers you kinda failed. Again - of course - her intentions were great here, she wanted to add nuance...

I think it's fine when Fanfiction explores the consequences of taking the books at their word instead of going for the most beneficial author/pottermore-guided interpretation. I just wish there'd be more uniqueness (I don't need a millionth edition of evil!incompetent!worst-dark-lord-ever!Dumbledore). As long as it's still recognizable as "Harry Potter" I'm fine (JKR did some incredible worldbuilding and theming).

Harry has already prove to be a hero and to corner him into a position in which he has to sacrifice himself seems unnecessary and cruel. In a lot of ways Harry is Dumbledore's ward and saying that a cancer patient shouldn't be told by his doctor that they have cancer so that they can live more happily seems wrong to me on every level.

I really think that this is just the way it is as a plot convenience (to make the resolution of book 7 more exciting...). To me it seems like a pattern that JKR often bent her characters in order to make the plot more dramatic (Hermione in book 6; Ron in book 4 and 7).

Authors that I really respect say things like "I wanted x to happen in my outline, but my characters didn't allow me to do that". Rowling didn't have any scruples there I think.

Sure. What's your point? It could also have been her raping and enslaving Arthur and telling it in a fun/innocent way for children. The only way we know for sure that this is not what she is supposed to be is from a meta-perspective (JKR surely wouldn't want Harry's surrogate mother to be a rapist).

When looking at the text there is actually very little characterizing scenes for her... mostly stuff like bustling around the household and shouting after her children - reinforcing her archetype. Because that's what Molly essentially is, a character archetype and we immediately put her into that "motherly" slot when reading and we drive our assumptions from that baseline. Really doesn't tell us anything about whether she's a good person or not (even the worst people on earth usually loved [their] children).

Molly loves more than just her children. She took care of Harry because he was an orphan, when she'd nothing to gain from it. She demonstrates care for Remus and Tonks when they were struggling with their feelings.

There are plenty of characterizing scenes for Molly. Infact, very few other characters have complex dynamics with as many characters as Molly does - Molly/Harry, Molly/Sirius and Molly/Fleur are three of the best relationship dynamics there are. She takes her archetype and completely owns it, and the Molly/Fleur feud is about Molly learning to grow out of faults traditionally associated with her archetype (hasty judgement of foreigners with foreign traditions). As is Molly killing Bellatrix, which breaks through the passivity traditionally associated with homemakers.

  “Harry! Oh Harry!”

  She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.

  “Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.”

  Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He needs quiet!”

Urgz. Horrible, presumptive... no wonder that all her children can't seem to wait to get away from her. It makes me incredibly angry that this woman - who interacts with Harry a few weeks per year - dares to tell his friends, who faced live and death situations with him, how to properly take care of him, while just a few seconds earlier almost assaulting someone who just had a traumatic experience. That's consistently her modus operandi: Barging into a situation and presuming to know what is best.

I can't disagree with that. It seems to me like we shouldn't be limiting ourselves to an "emotional range of a teaspoon", where there is just enough room for either loving or hating someone. I said it before somewhere in here: I don't particularly like Molly, but that doesn't mean that I hate her. IMHO there's a very simple explanation that I don't particularly like most of the adults in Harry Potter: The protagonists in those books are all children. If the adults were competent there wouldn't be anything for them to do... so JKR had to contrive all kinds of reasons to make adults useless or worse hindrances.

That's why I have a big problem with fics who try to make the adults more competent/likeable but remain Harry Potter centric. I've recently been trying to read "Home" and Harry is just a useless child most of the time who messes with shit that he doesn't understand. Yes, this is realistic, but why do I want to read a story about a child bumbling around and screwing up all the perfect plans of the adults?

Going to the reply proper, yeah, the treatment of most adults in the series is weird. and ... not really good. I'd say it stems from the fact that it all begun as a fairy tale with children and for children and when it became darker and more adult Madame Rowling did not want to take the focus from the characters it all by that point was about, which made some things really weird; I'm just guessing, though.

In fact, it's probably the same reason as the one for why Tom is just sitting around and doing nothing and being incompetent. He should have recruited some first-year slytherins.

And I agree about the “emotional range of a teaspoon” comment. I'm really unsure why some people can only love or hate characters, it seems ... simple-minded.

Of course. Hermione is *a child* (for most of the series). Even worse: She's a single child who barely got to socialize with other children her age before Hogwarts. Her overcoming these character flaws is a major part of her character arc and they are acknowledged as /flaws/ every time they come up.

Molly on the other hand is a grown woman with 7 children. When she completely oversteps any lines of normal social conduct (like in Grimmauld place) we are just supposed to accept it, because she's motherly or something like that and that's that. I dare say if Rowling had allowed other characters to confront Molly, Dumbledore or others that are often bashed and allowed them to voice such concerns we'd see less of that in Fanfiction. Basically the whole genre of "independent" Harry fics is born from the idea that if Harry doesn't do it himself, no-one will. Honestly, even in the most-flattering interpretation of Dumbledore it is ridiculous that he takes on a Guardian role for Harry while also being the de-facto leader of a War in which Harry is one of the most important chess pieces. Even a three year old should see the obvious conflict of interest. Is Molly bothered by this? Or is she just virtue-signaling "children shouldn't be involved in a war!" while secretly being happy that the-boy-who-lived is going to save them all? I know for a fact that any *real* parent who puts the welfare of their child first would get Harry the fuck out of Britain at some point no matter the cost/consequences.

Really? Go back and read the scene in OotP. No one supports Molly. Not Sirius, nor Remus, not even Arthur. She doesn't get her way and Harry sits in the war council thing. She's clearly meant to be seen in the wrong in the feud with Fleur, given that she ultimately changes her mind. She is meant to be seen as wrong when she is against Fred and George's joke shop - given how successful they are. I've no idea where you're getting this "supposed to accept it" from. They're shown to be flaws far, far more often in Molly's case than Hermione's, who almost always ends up in the right on a technicality.

This is ironic because this is pretty much what Molly wanted. She did her best to prevent Harry from getting involved in the war as much as she could - but everyone, including Harry himself, opposed her fiercely. If it were up to Molly she would've put Harry and her kids under a fidelius until the war was over.

Also, the Molly and Hermione comparison: Molly is perfectly within her rights to oversee her kids' involvement in the war, because they're her kids (this includes Harry). Parents always have rights on their kids, at least until they come of age.

I'll do that. Maybe I'm projecting because of the more fervorous of Molly apologists.

  This is ironic because this is pretty much what Molly wanted.

I've always seen this more as posturing than anything else. Harry sitting in the war council and being more informed certainly doesn't put him into more danger than he already is. For that matter I can't see her being so cozy with Dumbledore if Harry were a huge priority. I think there's a reason why there's so many fics with Harry having a parent and that parent yelling at Dumbledore... even if that Dumbledore in the fic is wizard-Jesus otherwise. Just putting on all the bells and whistles isn't anywhere close to enough ("Think of the children!!!"). Serious question: Is there even a scene between Molly or Harry where she asks him how she can help him instead of ordering him around? Like, an actual conversation that someone trying to take care of an orphan would have? Like... instead of "You need to eat some more child"... "Hey, weird, why do you always seem so scrawny after summer break. Maybe we can smuggle some food to the Dursleys for you? What do you need? How can I help?"

She does plenty more to prevent Harry's and her kids' involvement in the war. She desperately tries to keep Harry, Ron and Hermione apart in DH so as to prevent them from making up plans and leaving, for instance.

#+end_quote

Why? Molly had no knowledge that Dumbledore had marked Harry as a sacrifice. To all visible signs, Dumbledore himself was trying to minimise Harry's role in the war until the end of OotP. When Molly learns in DH that Dumbledore had left him with the Horcrux mission, she opposes it fiercely and tells Harry than someone else from the order could do it instead.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not explicitly, no. But neither does anyone else. There are certainly many scenes where she shows to care for Harry - the previously quoted GoF scene, meeting with Dumbledore to have Harry stay at the Burrow, gifting him her dead brother's watch on Harry's seventeenth birthday. In contrast, there's /one/ scene where she tries "ordering him around".

*shrugs* You seem determined to hate Molly. You hate her for trying to impose her opinion on Harry, and you hate her not imposing her opinion on Harry strongly enough to keep him out of the war. This is disregarding the fact that the only time she tries to impose her view on Harry is when she wants him uninvolved in the war. You hate her because you think her flaws are not meant to be seen as flaws, which is blatantly incorrect. You hate her because she is close to Dumbledore, because you think she shouldn't be close to Dumbledore for reasons I cannot understand. You (presumably) do not hate other characters, despite them being close to Dumbledore /and/ supporting Harry's involvement in the war (Sirius, Remus) or being just as bad in imposing their opinions as Molly (Hermione, and she's 17 by the end. Not a child. And many of her flaws are infact, not seen as flaws). You do not seem to be particularly well versed in canon, and often use fanfiction to defend your stance on canon. Your views are bizarre and hypocritical to me, and while I do not grudge you your opinion, I cannot respect it either. This is all I can say in the time I can afford for now.

Uhm she doesn't need to know that though. Dumbledore is the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Harry has brushes with death multiple times a year... Maybe it's an age thing, I don't yet have children, but if my child would go to the school of that guy I'd have a hard time being civil around him. Not to mention he's also the person responsible for letting Harry starve at the Dursleys (for the sake of argument I'll accept that the Dursley Household is the safest place for Harry... doesn't mean he has to live like a house elf with bars around his window and a cat flap for food. There's a million things that a great wizard like Dumbledore could have done to improve his living conditions).

That's the thing... I don't hate her. I get into the same argument with people who say I hate Ron. I'm just not very fond of her - and yes - there's a big difference. Lucius Malfoy or Pettigrew are people worthy of hate, Molly Weasly is quite far away from that...

#+begin_quote

Have another scene directly from canon then:

#+begin_quote
  “Beds empty! No note! Car gone --- could have crashed --- out of my mind with worry --- did you care? --- never, as long as I've lived --- you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy ---”

  “Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.

  “YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. “You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job ---”

  It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.
#+end_quote

This is from Book 2... Fred, George and Ron have just rescued Harry from *being starved* behind bars (some people seem to have desensitized over the years about the incredible abuse Harry suffers at the Dursleys) and what is Molly's reaction? She wishes they were more like *Percy*! This by the way is one of the reasons why people actually like the twins, because they do stuff to help. For Molly it's all about her, she doesn't want to worry, she wants to hug Harry to ensure herself that he is fine, she wants to order everyone around because it makes her safe and secure.

Her posturing becomes even more blatantly obvious later:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying an illegal car halfway across the country --- anyone could have seen you ---”
#+end_quote

Isn't that convenient? Not for a second do I buy this crap. She would have done nothing. That's why Ron, Fred and George did it in secret... if they had asked her she'd have said something like "Oh don't worry, I'm sure he's fine, after all Dumbledore told me...". *At best* she would have flooed Dumbledore to ask about Harry.

****** To be fair, though, people forget that some love potions aren't very strong in their effect. For all we know, the kind of love potion she brewed might have caused the one dosed with it to see the brewer as if they were prettied up with some well-applied make-up.

The issue, of course, lies in the fact that we've seen a character dose another character with no real consequences (the Romilda incident), and we have no idea whatsoever what kind of love potion Molly is talking about so people assume and those who want to put the character in a bad light assume the worst possibilities because that helps their case.

Not everyone creates straw-men. But some people do, for whatever bizarre reason, feel strongly enough that they need to bash. I do not get it emotionally, but I can at least pretend to understand their train of thoughts.

** I'm with you, I have not read the canon in years (I find the info for my fic either on Pottermore / wiki). And I think my idea of head-canon got warped with the amount of fanfiction I read. (I genuinely thought Severus Snape was Draco's godfather, even though it makes no sense, and Dorea and Charlus Potter will always be Harry's grandparents in my head)

I think, with the amount of writers and tropes out there, it is impossible for anyone to remain with the starting ideas of characters, if only because some of them were HIGHLY archetyped and they are not plausible.\\
In fact, the Dursleys appears to me as nicer in cannon after the fest of ExtremeAbuse!Dursleys I stumbled into.\\
Also, the fanfictions have read spend more time elaborating on groups or characters (ministry, Death Eaters, Malfoy Family, Snape, Slytherins in general) that, as they are depicted from the biased Hero Standpoint, appear with seemingly no redeeming point or other reason than "being bad" to act as they do. Can I still hate them with a fierce passion? Oh yess. Do I still believe that Slytherin house is full of bigoted bully? No.

But it is not about being more knowledgeable, since you base your perception on a non-existing canon. Fanon cannot justify acts or psyche. It may give you idea on how to construct your characters in your own fiction, but the fact remains that canon is the only source that can make someone more "knowledgeable."

** Oh, I'm definitely skewed. The gap between GoF and OttP led me to reading a ton of fanfiction. And when I read OttP I realised I enjoyed some of those fanfics a lot more than the fifth book.

JK's statement that Sirius died because "Harry doing things alone is more interesting" just put the nail in the coffin.

For me, definite canon is books 1-4, maybe book 5. HBP and DH only offer gimmicks (horcruxes, hallows, spells, new people). Characterization and character development I ignore completely on the last two books.

*EDIT*: A rebuttal in Rowling's favor.

We talk about enjoying FF more than the last books - without perhaps considering that JK also read a lot of it. I know I would never be able to resist reading stuff based on my work.

My hypothesis is that, after reading so much of it, JK had a minor existential crisis - perhaps a lot of the ideas she was considering had already been written and fleshed out (a few even in excellent quality). I think, fueled somewhat by panic, she decided it was mandatory to put out content that no fanfic writer had thought of - and that's why the later books sometimes feel as if they came out of nowhere.

#+end_quote

Pretty much the entirety of character development in the series comes from the last 2-3 books. Of the six main characters in the series (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape), 4 of them (the last four) owe at least 80% of their development to the last two books. The next most important character, Draco, owes 100% of his development to book 6. Slughorn is 100% book 6-7. Fleur was nothing more than a stereotype before book 6. 70% of Sirius is from book 5. Neville, Ginny, Luna, Molly, Bellatrix, Umbridge, Petunia, Fred/George, Kreacher are from the last 3, heavily leaning last two in Molly's case. Hell, most of Harry is book 5-7.

What characterisation for you is "definite canon"? Because I'm seeing almost none of it. Most characters were caricatures before then.

My hypothesis is that by the fourth book the series had become so popular that her publishers cared more about getting the book out than they cared about getting a good book. It is obvious just from the size of the books that the latter half of the series was sparingly edited. Horcruxes and hallows had been built into the story from the beginning, and I think they would work well if the rest of the book were reduced by half.

** Hrm, I'm a bit half and half with this. I feel more like FanFiction has expanded my perceptions, rather than changing them. Which has actually made reading the canon books more enjoyable for me. The Dark Lord is a perfect example. When just reading the canon books, the Dark Lord is a very one sided character. He is pure evil, a murdering madman that tortures his followers and kills babies. Yes, they show a bit of his back story in HBP, the orphanage and whatnot. But really, you never see his motivations, what made him into the monster he became. But FanFiction has done so much with him that has made the Dark Lord into a truly sympathetic villain for me. I've read about a confused boy that grew up with powers he couldn't explain, picked on and unwanted until he found a way to make the bullies fear him. Constantly forced to hide what he can do for fear of ending up in an asylum for the mentally deranged, dealing with the ongoing muggle war and all the fears that came with that, his childhood was frankly miserable. Then Dumbledore shows up and he thinks that his world is going to change for the better, only to be disappointed once again. He goes to Hogwarts as an orphan mudblood Slytherin, the beggar surrounded by the elite. Sorry, that started to become a rant. My point is that FanFiction has flushed out some of the more one dimensional character, but for me, it hasn't changed how I view those character (in most senses) but more answered a lot of the "why"s.

There is one thing that has completely changed for me because of FanFiction. Several of the character's sexualities. It is my absolute headcanon that Harry is a closet gay man that stayed with Ginny for the kids. There are a few others that I had put in the "straight" box growing up that have changed to gay or bi in my head. Admittedly, my mom was a bit of a homophobe, so it wasn't something we talked about.
