Hey, all. There was a fic that used to be on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. It was called "Catch Me If You Can" and it involved Ron and Hermione et al looking for Harry after he disappeared after the war. I remember that he was married at one point, but his wife was put under a spell to betray him.

It wasn't a great fic, but it was cute enough so if anyone knows if it's anywhere else, please let me know.
