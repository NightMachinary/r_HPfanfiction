I do not know exactly what chapter this is in, but I think Ludo Bagman says this while in the top box. Obviously in Goblet of Fire.

This takes place in 1994, according to google the soccer world cup had 3.57 million in attendance. This took place in the USA. In France 1998 2.86 million attended.

For the sake of argument and simplicity I will be using 3 million people. that is a 1 to 30 ratio of Magicals to Muggles. If there is a better representative let me know.

The World Population in 1994 was 5,663,150,427 around 5.5 billion. Dividing that by 30 equals around 180 million magicals in the world.

The british isles hold about 1% of the total world population. so that is about 1.8 million magicals in the isles.

One of the failings of the books is that they feel so small and I do not think JK Rolling thought about population that much. this even led to the common fanfiction trope of the two wars knocking out the youth and thus only 280ish kids (5 malesX 2 Genders X 4 Houses X 7 age groups) going to hogwarts.

About 35 percent of the real world population is children. 35% of 1.8 million is 630,000 children below the age of 18. 38 percent of 630,000 (ages 11 through 17) = 245,000.

Are their better representatives of population in the books. What do you think about my numbers? Is there a book where they try to cram that many kids into hogwarts, lol imagine that.

EDIT: going the other way. 280 kids between 11-17 plus 20 for homeschool to get to 300. 300 kids = 2,255 magicals total in the british isles that means 225,500 magicals world wide.


** Since wizards can travel, that 100,000 seat stadium is for the entire world, not just people in the country and the wealthy who can afford to travel. Assuming that increases attendance 10 fold, that's .18m people, even less than the number you'd get extrapolation from the class size.

*** the problem with that is that 100,000 seats means that only the wealthy or obsessed could go. Even at 3.0 million the seats had to be expensive. so it still limits the pool of people willing to go. Wizarding Wireless does exist so the seats are only for the people who think the price is worth it.

The number of obsessed wizards could be very high tbf lol. Also keep in mind that it's a lot easier for wizards to get to the quidditch world cup than it is for us to get to the FIFA world cup.

Tbh I don't believe there is any possible way for magic to be kept secret if there is 180 million magicals in the world + non-human magical beings.

And if there are 1.8 million in the isles alone, that has /huge/ implications for the number of people working in the Ministry or going to Hogwarts or Diagon Alley or whatever. Just doesn't add up.

Given instantaneous, possibly FTL travel is practically free (portkeys) and magic can solve a lot of problems without money, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that construction, logistics and administrative costs aren't that high and hence ticket prices wouldn't be exorbitant as well. The only reason to price QWC tickets expensively would be to earn money.

Also, could there be smaller wizarding private schools throughout the UK? Or even like neighbourhood or community schools? Hogwarts would only be the most prominent one.

** Interesting, but I'd think the adult:child ratio would differ, as wizards and witches have a life expectancy well above 100 years, so it should be less than 35% ðŸ¤”

*** Could be but we are never given that definitive of an answer on the age differences either. With how shitty Muggle studies were it could be that wizards still believe that this is true from before the industrial revelation.

Either way my numbers should work for below age 100.

** It's also been said by other fans that Harry's year was right at the war. And people aren't having as many kids during a war. That by his third or fourth year, those kids would have been born after the war was over, and there might start to be a boom of students.

** I have no clue where your getting your numbers (since there is not a stadium in the world that can hold a million people let alone three)but attendance at a single event is a stadium capacity issue not a population issue.

The largest single attendance at an event is probably the indy 500 which has like 250k seats. By your logic since Indianapolis can host the biggest attendance the that would mean it is the biggest city in America and it would mean America would have the highest population in the world.

There's plenty of college stadiums like Alabama and clemson that could fit their city's population in their stadium multiple times over.

Let's do a real world example. The Los Angeles rams averaged 25 thousand in attendance with a city population of 4 million. Green bay averaged 75 thousand. Using that ratio, green bay must have a population of 12 million. (It's actual population is 100 thousand btw)

*** I just looked it up online I am not a specialist so I will not have the best data. I have no idea where that website got that number it made it seem that it was the attendees... so idk my point was more about trying to calculate the population

** Maybe a lot of wizarding kids are homeschooled. Add up the blood purists who don't want their children associating with filth, and the halfbloods who don't want to deal with bullying, and there might be a big homeschooled population.

*** I think the "Reality" of it is that there are multiple schools and the potters set the will to allow harry to go to Hogwarts while Dumbledore wanted to protect him. rich people also go to Hogwarts and muggleborns get in on some sort of government subside.

But then you look at pottermore and what I said is false... so who ,knows.

** I thought it was stated in the books that parents have the option to send their child to whatever school they wanted but most British parents sent their kids to Hogwarts which means that all the kids at Hogwarts represent all of the 11-17 year olds in Britain. (GOF?)

Is well known that JKR isn't a numbers person ðŸ˜‚

My head canon is that Hogwarts was much larger than we ever see in canon because we only see what's important to the immediate story of Harry. So there were more students and more teachers than the books show.

** It's an interesting comparison but the strength of it suffers when you consider 3 other aspects.

1. While soccer is certainly the world's most popular sport, as far as we know quidditch is the ONLY major sport in the wizarding world. As such, quidditch is arguably more popular than soccer by a large margin on a per capita basis.

2. Wizards/witches can travel instantly via apparition and portkeys and the floo network and so on... Which means it's far easier for wizarding kind to attend the world cup of quidditch than muggles to attend the world cup of soccer.

3. Wizarding population is not going to be spread in the same manor across the globe as muggles for multiple reasons, including the forementioned instant travel ability.

All these things lead to the implication that the wizarding world IS smaller than your estimates you can up with. No other sport competition in terms of popularity. Much easier travel, regardless of money. And a population spread that really plays no role in the matter.

**** Yes there are other sports but Quadpot is a realatively minor sport compared to quidditch from what is known about it really only being well known in the U.S. And Dueling is well known world-wide but also is quite different being it's primary one on one and fairly limited in scope. The point remains that the Wizarding world's sporting variety in terms of sports with vast global reach seems significantly more limited and really only Quidditch could be considered a world-wide major sport.
