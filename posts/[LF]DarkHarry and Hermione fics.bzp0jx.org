Do these exist?

A fic where both Harry and Hermione are dark without one trying to save the other?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** While they say they'll be together as a trio, it's definitely more a Hermione/Ron fic than a Hermione/Harry or trio. They share a mind link or whatever, but the only time intimacy is hinted at, it's Ron and Hermione going upstairs to bang with Harry's super quick thought on that.

**** +1

The whole premise is, in my opinion, pretty flawed:

"There are discriminatory anti-creatures and anti-half-humans laws, and in general things and attitudes are the same as before the war, so my godson might be discriminated against in the future. The only way to fix it is to become a Dark (with a really large capital D) Lord, and that's what I am going to be doing right now. K THX BYE!"

***** After extensive analysis of the history of the past 5 decades in this tiny community we concluded that based on two examples becoming a Dark Lord is the only viable option...

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8132578/chapters/18642415][The Anti-Heroine]] is a Diary!Tom/Harry/Hermione fic- very Hermione-centric at first. there's a lot of smut later on, but the plot is enjoyable and i like the writing style and larger implications. it hasn't been updated since February, but hopefully the author will get back to it soon
