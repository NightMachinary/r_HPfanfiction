  HBP - the Cave
#+end_quote

--------------

I got to say much of the cave was excellent, but I would change something. Harry, as competent a wizard in Defence as you're ever likely to meet at his age, repeatedly uses ineffective spells.

- petrificus totalus- useful. Single target, and technically temporary but it is very likely to last long enough for his needs.

- impendimenta- near useless. Single target, lasts seconds. The fact that he switched to this spell from a more effective spell is baffling.

- incarcerous- another useful if single target spell. However it allows the victim wiggle and struggle, and when dealing with the magical undead I wouldn't put my confidence in anything that allowed movement, strength, or self damage to promote escape to be worthwhile.

- sectumsempra- single target deadly spell. He's at least getting his priorities straight now. Who knows when/if inferi are covered in DADA but cutting/blood loss has NO effect on the /undead/.

Then Dumbledore saves the day. Awesomely. And then Harry says he forgot about fire and panicked. This is an understandable reaction- except this is Harry freakin Potter.

He destroyed his professor with something approximating the effects of heat/fire in his first year. He killed a basilisk with a sword second year. He sent flying over a hundred dementors in third year. He faced dragons and the Dark Lord returned, greater and more terrible than ever before fourth year. He faced a squad of Death Eaters against whom he had no special protection fifth year. And more besides. And he forgot about fire? He panicked? An O.W.L graduate with an O in DADA not only couldn't put up a decent if losing battle, but his effectiveness actually reduced throughout his encounter.

Rowling always used magic for plot, and did it wonderfully, but sometimes it feels like she reduced Harry's growth and effectiveness from the early books to reinforce his regular joe in over his head-ness. I suppose my preferred course would have been to up the ante and make him more capable with the years /and/ make his threats more... er, threatening.

** Reposting this since it disappeared

- The Goblet of Fire is the tournament trophy. It has unique divining properties valued by all three schools. Throughout the fourth book Harry has nightmares of the Cup, always feeling its presence threatening his future.

- (and from the earlier thread...) Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.

- Lily invented the Wolfsbane draught for Remus and published the formula anonymously at James' suggestion (and Sirius' protestations)- because Lily was awesome, and that would be evidence of it.

- The Order of the Phoenix is heard to implement several operations of mixed outcome; they're there when Voldemort opens up Azkaban and are involved with tracking recruited Death Eaters based upon Harry's memories of the graveyard.

- During Half-Blood Prince, Harry goes out of Hogwarts on day-trips with Order members, particularly Albus as he hunts for evidence of Riddle's method for immortality. Sometimes it's Harry's lonely upbringing which helps him identify with Riddle and find key clues; other times it just proves painfully educational

- Use the real-world calendar- 1st September isn't always Sunday. Or dump the use of weekdays as a reference- perhaps the wizarding world operates on moon cycles: "See you Sunday!" "What?" "She means second Gibbous descending."

** I would change Hermione's phobia of using a telephone.

At the end of PS, Harry gave his phone number to /both/ Ron and Hermione. In CS, JKR had Ron ring up the Dursley residence because it was funny. The notion that wizards are utterly clueless as to the rather straightforward use of such a common household item is a brilliant bit of worldbuilding.

In OOtP, Harry rightfully blew his stack at his friends for their purposefully oblique letters throughout the summer. I understand the need for secrecy, but there's very little reason to believe that Hermione couldn't have used the Royal Mail or phoned up Harry to fill him in on some details. JKR cheated her narrative because she wanted Harry to be emotionally volatile in a particular scene.

I would argue that she is merely pointing out the eventual consequence of breaking a rule, not expressing regret. Her fanon love of rules is rarely borne out in the original series.

No, my original statement was about /telephones/, but since you're hung up (haha) on the fleeting reference to the Royal Mail, I can address that too. As early as CS, Hedwig was attacked by a house elf. Owls: not secure.

There are no anecdotes of any wizards attacking mail carriers, mail lorries, or any other part of the Royal Mail. Ergo: secure. In fact, the /only/ example we have of wizards using the mail is when Molly sends Vernon & Petunia a letter, where we can deduce several things:

- Molly considers Muggle Post abnormal
- Muggle postman for Ottery St. Catchpole and the surrounding area doesn't know where the Burrow is, has never made deliveries
- Does not understand how much postage would be required to get a letter from Exeter to Surrey

Molly & Arthur are two of the most Muggle-loving wizards in the series. Indeed, Arthur's job has made him keenly aware of the Muggle world. If the Weasleys are this incompetent at even /using/ the Royal Mail, why would you expect wizards who despise Muggles - and have no interest in their non-magical culture - to be able to intercept letters?

Um, no. There aren't any anecdotes of wizards attacking clown cars either, but broom-riders were attacked in DH, so does that mean that if you wanted to travel from A to B with Voldemort and/or the Ministry after you, a clown car would be harder to intercept than a broom?

You need to compare apples to apples: the reason no wizard has been seen bothering Muggle post is that no wizard who had any need to intercept Muggle post in Harry's presence. Whereas Dobby wanted to isolate Harry to keep him from returning to Hogwarts, how many people even knew about the letter the Weasleys had sent to the Dursleys?

Two reasons:

1. Forget rank-and-file Death Eaters. /Voldemort/ grew up in a Muggle orphanage. He is quite aware of telephones and Royal Mail.
2. The Ministry, which runs a bus service and a train, owns a fleet of enchanted cars, and keeps tabs on Muggle communications as a part of enforcing the Statute of Secrecy with enough celerity to make a giant invasion look like a hurricane to the military chain of command, probably do have ways to monitor undesirables' Muggle communications as well.

Dumbledore later expressed regret ("weakness" Harry calls it in OOtP Chapter Thirty-Seven) at having locked Harry away from any information that summer. In his final speech in OOtP, he makes many references to 'an old man's mistakes.' Clearly, Albus made that decision /not/ because of Voldemort's abilities, but because:

#+begin_quote
  "I cared about you too much," said Dumbledore simply. "I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your piece of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act." [...] "I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any other student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another[.]
#+end_quote

Let's look at the strange relationship of 'actionable intelligence' as you put it versus what Ron and Hermione really know. From their letters:

#+begin_quote
  "We've been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray..." "We're quite busy but I can't give you details here..." "There's a fair amount going on, we'll tell you everything when we see you...."
#+end_quote

Harry assumes they're at the Burrow and has every reason to think so. Now what happens when Harry finally arrives at Grimmauld?

#+begin_quote
  "I know our letters were useless - but we couldn't tell you anything [...] we've got so much to tell you [...]

  "I wanted answers, you know...."

  "We wanted to give them to you, mate," said Ron. [...]

  "How come you two are allowed to know everything that's going on - ?"

  "We're not!" Ron interrupted. "Mum won't let us near the meetings, she says we're too young - "
#+end_quote

Sure sounds to me like they don't /actually/ have anything interesting to say that could compromise the Order's operations. More likely a case of Ron and Hermione rather immaturely implying that they know a lot more than they do.

What /could/ they have communicated to Voldemort in a worst case scenario?

- That the Order is active again? Voldmort could have guessed that easily.

- The location of Headquarters? Covered by Fidelius; they wouldn't have been able to write it down in any case as neither of them are the Secret Keeper.

- Membership roster? Ron doesn't have any idea of how many there are, let alone any identities that aren't readily apparent to any Dark Lord.

- That Order members "are standing guard over something?" Voldemort already knows about the Prophecy orb!

- Percy working for Fudge? That's public knowledge.

  Dumbledore later expressed regret ("weakness" Harry calls it in OOtP Chapter Thirty-Seven) at having locked Harry away from any information that summer. In his final speech in OOtP, he makes many references to 'an old man's mistakes.' Clearly, Albus made that decision not because of Voldemort's abilities, but because:

The passage you quoted refers to the whole 5 years at Hogwarts, perhaps the preceding decade as well, not the summer before OotP; and it was spoken with a benefit of hindsight, when Dumbledore had a much better idea of what Voldemort could and couldn't do through the link. To quote Snape during the Occlumency lessons, "The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return --"

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I disagree. This passage is meant to counter Harry's anger at not being told more about TMR, despite having successfully survived encounters with him in the past. Specifically after CS. I don't think it's a stretch at all to apply this same anger - and weak, overly emotional rebuttal - to the summer after GoF as well.

On the contrary, I think it's feasible that Hermione (at the very least, and quite possibly Ron as well) could have worked out all of the points I bulleted above, save for the Prophecy Orb or any intrigue regarding Severus (seeing as how she had no idea as to the existence of the former or the contested status of the latter).

#+begin_quote

  Ministry, which has been shown to be able to mess with Muggle communications whenever and however they wanted (including the military and a foreign President), couldn't tap a phone line on 4 Privet Drive, that's reaching.
#+end_quote

Let me start by saying that I don't like Muggle wank. That being said, the passage that is so often quoted to instantly dispel the notion that Muggles would ever have a chance in any engagement against the magical community is often misunderstood.

The quote from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Er, said the Prime Minister, "listen.... It's not a very good time for me.... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of - "

  "That *can be* rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine. So, despite Kingsley Shacklebolt being /very/ close to the Muggle Prime Minister, the Ministry for Magic doesn't even know his schedule. There was no indication that the portrait had /any/ idea that the PM was about to speak with another head of state. How effective can the magical response be if they don't have the PM's schedule down? Either Kingsley isn't very good at his job, or the magical counter to the Muggle government is overblown. If the quote had been:

#+begin_quote
  "That *has already been* rearranged,"
#+end_quote

then I would have more confidence in the Ministry's ability to keep tabs on the Muggle PM.

Continuing:

#+begin_quote
  "But I really was rather hoping to speak -"

  "We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead," said the little man.
#+end_quote

So far I see evidence of a Confundus Charm, an Obliviation, or a false memory implantation (a la Hermione's parents in DH). Nothing at all about the knowledge of how to tap a phone. Not a single word about having the ability to do so.

I don't think it's reaching to say that those are two very different skills.

**** As lovers of fan fiction, we're all speculators and wonderers. I remember that in the weeks preceding a new books release, my family and I had a piece of paper taped to the refrigerator door that we would write our ideas about the next book on, from the silly (Dumbledore is a dragon animagus) to the sentimental (Hermione and Ron finally get together) to the hotly debated (Snape is a good guy).

While the end of the series was inevitably going to bring an end to some paths of speculation (how will Harry beat Voldemort? is Harry going to live?), the epilogue killed off any chance of things ever changing. You could want Hermione and Neville to end up together, let's say, and while they're not after Voldemort is finally defeated, there's still the rest of eternity for their relationship to play out. What the epilogue does is say that, twenty years on, they're still not together, it's not going to happen, that's not something that you get to speculate about. Dig? Along with pottermore and her various interviews, its one of the main ways I think JK mishandled her fandom-- she should be leaving Harry Potter in the hands and minds and hearts of her fans, and the epilogue she does the opposite. She says: you don't get to speculate about this. You don't get to wonder. You're wrong.

And so while I think the epilogue serves a narrative function in showing Harry's progression from having no family to having a huge one, that's ultimately why I don't like it. To me, it's a symbol of how JK wasn't willing to let go.

There's many bits and pieces in the epilogue, the one with confounding the examiner included, that together all scream “nope, not a single damn bit of character development for anyone, hah!” to the reader. And considering that this series can be construed as a “coming of age” story, that kind of epilogue to it is ... kind of pathetic, to be honest, and probably left many a reader thinking “J.K.Rowling could have done /a lot/ better”.

So, I guess it all boils down to the words “wasted potential”. I won't touch the issue of pairings since I don't particularly care about those in stories and it's not like people writing pairing-centred stories care about sticking to canon (for the most part), but it's probably similar for that one.

For me I think it's just the lack of transition. An epilogue could've been maybe at the one year mark, showing that they're healing, recovering, rebuilding, and moving toward that epilogue that she had put in. 19 years is a hell of a jump considering where we had left off.

no.3 Nothing changes: I'm really not sure what would make you think that: I'm fairly certain JK has said before a lot changed after the war, and even if she hadn't there's /nothing/ in the epilogue to make you think otherwise. SO that's not a problem the epilogue has.

no.4 undeserved auror-ship : Again, this is not a problem with the Epilogue since nowhere in it this is mentioned. But I'll point out that Harry didn't use his fame to become an auror: He, ROn, and I believe some more talented people were /invited/ by Kingsley (who's the minister) as an effort to have as many aurors as possible to raly up all the dark lord supporters.

I don't think so. From /Deathly Hallows/, page 754; “As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”

I'm not seeing how this translates to wizards > muggles, /especially/ given the Weasley reputation as an anti-supremacy family. Sure, it's not the best thing to do, but you can't tell me that even comes close to Draco and company's constant use of Mudblood and other slurs - don't forget who defended Hermione in second year and spent the afternoon burping up slugs.

I think Ron and Hermione work because they're so drastically different. Where Ron is hot-headed and quick to act, Hermione is cool and logical, and while she struggles to separate herself from the books she loves so much, Ron is nearly the opposite, always waiting until it can't be put off any further, trying to come up with anything to evade work, and that's a good balance.

My brother and I are very similar people (not in the romantic aspect, we're not from Alabama), rather in that we're yin and yang, yet it works so well. He's very much like Ron, the extroverted ball of fun that's also kinda dopey but loyal to a fault, struggling to make his own path yet never seeing the admiration of the people who watch him blaze that trial. Meanwhile, I'm much more like Hermione, the quiet bookworm with a constant nagging fear that I'll never fit in to the places I go. He pulls me out of that fog, sets me straight, while I keep him tethered to the ground just so that he doesn't inflate himself too much and float away. I'm the thinker, he's the doer - he's brawn and I'm brains, but when it comes down to it, we'll be okay if we've gotta switch things up, too.

Don't tell me that relationship doesn't work, because the two of us are living proof that it does.

Full disclosure: Ron/Hermione is my single favorite pairing from this series, so I've got a bias in this argument.

******* With regard to house-elf slavery and the SPEW movement, I think that it's important to remember that Ron had very little interaction with house-elves before this - the Weasleys never owned one, and those he did know seemed, in his opinion, to be happy where they were. Whether that was true or not, I think that was a large part of his teasing - in his eyes, she was fighting to help a marginalized group that didn't really want to be helped. I'm not saying that's anywhere near correct, but that's how he had always seen it, and it's difficult to change part of your worldview.

As for learning, I don't really think that those are fundamental differences in beliefs, though maybe it's just me. I'm not trying to excuse Ron's actions, because those really aren't okay, but Hermione could have definitely put her foot down with regard to the copying/help, and she did need to be pulled away from the books every once in a while. As for the troll incident, that was on Ron, yes, but it was also an unfortunate coincidence that she happened to be in the bathroom where the troll decided to camp out, so I don't know that you can totally put that blame on Ron.

I don't know that Ron feels superior to muggles as much as he's still looking for someone that he's better than. We know he's got a lot of insecurities, the byproduct of being the sixth son, the king of hand-me-downs, the sidekick, and the second choice. I think that probably still plays into his worldview as an adult. It doesn't make his actions acceptable at all, but I honestly don't think he has any bias towards muggles - not once can I recall him making fun of someone because of their blood status, and that speaks volumes to me.

*** Hey so I agree with you on most of those but just want to add my two cents on a couple of them!

-Molly killing Bellatrix: the purpose of this was to go with the whole theme of love. If Neville killed her, it would have been revenge for what she did to his parents. Molly kills her out of love for her daughter, and only aimed to kill when her child 'missed death by inches.'

-I think when they first researched and found the Fidelius Charm, they didn't know you could be your own secret keeper. I always interpreted as 'Peter is the secret keeper for the /Potter family./' So since the family is the secret (since Flitwick mentions in PoA that Voldemort could have seen the /house/ and pressed his nose up against the sitting room window, but still wouldn't have been able to see the /family/), nobody in the family can be the Keeper. On the other hand, by the mid-90s, they're making the /houses/ the secret: Grimmauld Place is the secret, Shell Cottage is the secret. So any person could potentially be the secret keeper. Another reason they mightn't have made Lily nor James the Keeper is because then they would have to leave the safety of the house if they wanted to tell others the secret. If Sirius/Dumbledore/Peter is the Keeper, they can let Lupin or Bathilda or whomever know where to go if the Potters ever wanted visitors. But this bit is mostly my theory based on book evidence; the charm can be interpreted in other ways too.

**** I don't really think it gave them plot armor. Maybe the illusion of it? Anyone could have killed Harry. Anyone (armed with the right information and tools for destroying horcruxes) could have killed Voldemort. The prophecy just set a specific series of events into motion.

Were Harry to end up getting killed (say in GoF for fun) that's one chunk of his soul gone, Dumbledore was already suspicious and suspecting horcruxes for a while, the last Horcrux had already been created (Nagini). Harry getting killed in GoF would technically be at Voldemort's hand, even if it was before the graveyard, because Barty was acting as an instrument of Voldemort. Thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Looking for different interpretations gets rid of the tiny little box the prophecy ended up creating, because it certainly /did/ do so in canon.

I'd probably modify the 'big reveal' to make it clear that Harry was still very mortal, and that prophecies are up for interpretation. Maybe give an example of one that was fulfilled by a very loose interpretation.

Had all the items worked more visibly, like the diary, the story itself could have been much better. Also, don't have Harry be a horcrux, because it doesn't make that much sense (make him a faux horcrux and play it for the red herring stamp); I mean, considering the whole “sacrifice” thing Harry does, for as long as Rowling though to foreshadow that Harry could survive at least a book back (yeah, I know, she didn't), there would be no need for him to have been a horcrux there.

In one interview, she actually implied that she thinks H/Hr shipping is 'delusional' (the interviewers' word, although Rowling didn't contradict it).

If you actually look at the books carefully it would be very difficult to try canonically pairing H/Hr over H/G with the way they're written; people were able to accurately predict the H/G pairing in OotP and R/Hr by GoF (with surprising amounts of evidence from the first three books actually). The movies on the other hand, definitely insinuated H/Hr throughout, and combined with the hero-gets-the-female-lead cliche, many people ended up thinking H/Hr was going to happen (including me!).

HHr shippers misquote JKR and take it as gospel that Harry and Hermione should have gotten together, and RHr shippers clamp their hands over their ears shouting about how JKR was misquoted, and, in doing so, /also/ misquote her to make her comments on RHr look more mild.

All JKR said about HHr is that in some ways they work together better than RHr. Other than that, she studiously avoided any HHr questions and later clarified that Ginny was still the best choice for Harry. The major crux of the Wonderland interview, from what I recall, was that JKR said something to the effect of RHr being fundamentally incompatible, which means that they likely wouldn't have worked out in the long run (or, at least, not without counseling). But there's no real endorsement of HHr over RHr, nor an admission that she should have put Harry and Hermione together, but it was an admission that RHr is an unrealistic pairing that Jo chose for her own personal wish-fulfillment.

Harry convinced himself he just had overprotective brotherly feelings for Ginny. That was a falsehood.

Ron/Lavender and Ginny/Dean broke up the same night Harry was getting the true memory from Slughorn. Harry finds out what his task is (horcruxes,) and he and Ginny get together in the very next chapter. Love potions were a falsehood, while Harry/Ginny was the uncovered truth.

******* Just because both have red hair, doesn't mean they look the same. Lily's hair is more auburn/dark red, Ginny's is more orange. In addition there is indication to Ginny having freckles, when Lily doesn't.

So implying that red hair = look the same is really grasping for straws.

******** Close enough? ;) (still, maybe it's my dislike of her that's coloring my perception!)

** I really wish Sirius didn't die. I get so sad when I think of all the shit Sirius ended up going through in his life.

- Horrible family life/abuse
- The complete annihilation of his choose family in a single night
- 12 years in the most horrifying prison you can possibly imagine
- Spending ~two years on the run from the ministry in horrible conditions.
- Being imprisoned in his childhood home that he vowed never to return to.
- Falling through the veil.

Pretty everything that wasn't his life at Hogwarts was shit. At least Harry ended up happy after the war, Sirius never had that luxury.

** I'd undo JKR's decision in saving Mr.Weasley in book 5, it would be interesting to see how it would affect the Weasley family and other characters.

** I'd replace books 4-7 completely, and either keep the children's book tone, or replace the plot with something more plausible, and less "everyone gets the idiot ball, the plot needs this" stuff.

At the very least though: A real Happy Ending. With far, far more Evil scumbags dead, and more good guys alive. All the shit that made Harry's life hell in the series should be dealt with.

** I'd add more muggle representation. I thought the muggle minister POV at the beginning of HBP did a lot to flesh out the world and how big the issues were. So did the mention of protecting muggle houses in DH. I wish that stuff hadn't been off-page.
