For example, what if [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marius_Black][*Marius Black*]] and another pureblood squib had a magic capable child?

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley%27s_second_cousin][Even families that are accepting of muggleborns, like the *Weasley family*, appear ashamed of their squib cousin.]]

Is it possible that a witch/wizard of two pureblood squibs would be treated even worse than muggleborns? Or do you think such a child would be welcomed into pureblood wizarding society? Or would they be treated like a muggleborn?


** This answer is a bit of a cop out, but I think they'd probably be on the same level as a halfblood.

He/she would still have all the prestige of their last name, but everyone would know their embarrassing family circumstances.

** By the technical "all your grandparents are wizards" definition I suppose they are still technically pure-blood.

But we should remember that for the group of people who really care about blood status, the technical definition doesn't really matter much. The Weasleys are pure-blood but because they don't support the ideology, they are considered blood-traitors and thus of equally low status. Meanwhile many supposedly "pure" families in fact have various connections to Muggles in their family trees, but they all perform a lot of editing to pretend that they're completely pure.

So I doubt a pureblood born of two squibs would be welcomed by those who value blood status, regardless of what they technically count as -- unless, of course, they disown their squib parents and embrace the ideology, in which case they will be welcomed with open arms.

Yeah, isn't it possible that one of the pureblood families involved (the one otherwise without magical heir, one presumes) would be enthused about how "true blood never lies", obfuscate the Squib generation on the family tree, and carry on?

** JK actually cleared the cousin thing up, they weren't ashamed of him, they had had a falling out with him that was apparently fairly nasty. Ron wasn't saying "we don't want to be associated with accountants", he was saying "this is the closest link to knowing Muggles that I have, but it's closed".

His daughter Mafalda was apparently intended to be Hermione's Slytherin rival, with similar cleverness. It obviously never happened, alongside Hermione's sister.

**** Definitely not even remotely close to canon, but the sequel to linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House) features Mafalda Prewett in Slytherin.

Didn't know until now that it was (presumably) based off what JK said

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

**** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) features Lily Moon (removed) and Sally-Anne Perks (maybe removed, maybe left in but unnamed) as two of Hermione's roommates. They feature heavily in the first two years and have a significant cameo in the fourth, but I think they were pretty much backhround dressing in year 3. I think WhiteSquirrel draws a lot from the removed details.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Somewhere between a halfblood and a pureblood, although closer to a halfblood than a pureblood.

They'd be held in much greater regard than a mudblood, clearly, since they have only magical ancestry, and probably more than a halfblood, since their ancestry isn't tainted with muggles, but definitely less than purebloods, since neither of their parents can actually do anything magical.
