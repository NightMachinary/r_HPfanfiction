I wrote this Drinny one-shot called You're who I like. Ginny just broke up with Dean and needs time to think, the room of requirement, but she isn't the only one that needs it. Draco x Ginny. It's my first romance fan fic but I'm really proud of it and think it's really good. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=342923&showRestricted]]. I would appreciate if you read it.
