So the author himself recently promoted a fic here, I thought I had saved the post but can't seem to find it back.

Video game world harry over 100000 words and as far as I know year 2 was just finished?

Does it ring any bells for anyone?

Thanks in advance!

Conneron [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5j73f6/all_the_world_is_a_game/][deleted the thread]]. We disagree on whether copy/pasting other fanfic authors' work into your own fanfic is simply being "inspired" by them.

In chapter 6 they have an entire article copy/pasted [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-quill-of-acceptance-and-the-book-of-admittance][from Pottermore]]. Originally they had credited it to "E.R.Midgen" as if they had written it themselves as a fictional passage from a fictional character. Thankfully they've now credited the real author (Rowling), though copying the entire article still isn't great (I can handle fanfic authors copying the occasional "iconic" line from the canon books even without explicitly crediting them, but copying entire articles doesn't seem right to me -- and it simply isn't necessary for the story).

It seems like people are enjoying Conneron/Concept101's work. Unfortunately, until the plagiarism is fixed, it's hard to know what /is/ their work.

**** I'm not sure - I just remember seeing that fic recommended here recently, but I can't find the post/comment that recommended it so not sure if it was self promo.
