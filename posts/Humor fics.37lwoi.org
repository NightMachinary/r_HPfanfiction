I love me some dramatic fics, but lately I've been in a Humor Mood. I've read Nonjon's stuff, jeconais', and a few others, but there has to be more out there that I haven't gotten to yet. Any ideas?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is great, and while I've only ever seen it here once (actually how I found the fic), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]] was absolutely hilarious.

*** Seventh Horcrux has been recommended in almost every relevant thread for the past six months! For good reason as well, it's hilarious. And old and new world doesn't get recommended all that often but it's my favourite fic.

** Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/674180/Sarah1281][Sarah1281's]] works. Specifically 'when in doubt obliviate' and 'oh god not again'

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/BajaB][BajaB's]] Harry in Hufflepuff and various one shots such as day of spoons are also good fun.

Switch is a good story, but I forget what site its on. The twin confundus the Sorting Hat, and everyone gets shuffled around. Harry and Draco are friends in Hufflepuff. Greg and Vince find a new tiny blond leader in Hannah Abbott when they all end up in Gryffindor and bond over chicken... that kind of thing.

*** I have read 'oh god not again' and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll have to check out the other two and try to find Switch. Thanks!

**** Yeah, when in doubt obliviate is similar in tone. Lockhart raising Harry is hilarious... but also distressing effective.

**** Your google-fu hasn't failed, live journal failed us all. [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/tag/switchverse][Here is a link]] to the tag on the author's LJ.

Edit: typo.

** Lily and the art of being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin is really good. So is Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB. Also Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram, Escapologist Harry by Racke, and Twins by fringeperson.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/][Harry Potter Becomes a Communist]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/][Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles]] are neat satires.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/][In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life]] is a fun oneshot: Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

*** Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles goes hard, but HardcoreCommie took (EDIT: Harry Potter Becomes A Communist) too far with the crack after a while.
