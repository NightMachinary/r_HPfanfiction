** Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealin Witches) features a teenage Voldemort who has been reincarnated by using the diary to possess a girl.

The second request is too broad. Most fics are canon-compliant and then diverge at one point.

** I want harry to be possessed by the diary, but gets help in his classes from it, a la Half Blood Prince.

It would be early enough in the story that I don't really think anyone would notice. Like maybe Harry was falling behind in his first year was due to the 3rd floor corridor stuff.
