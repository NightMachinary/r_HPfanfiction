I've read a few Harry/Bella, but the only 2 that I read that were worth mentioning, "Delenda Est" and "Stepping Back".

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Passageways seems interesting, at least from the summary.

Wind Shear - He stomps everything in the same way like in "Angry Harry and the Seven" ? Or like in "Honour Thy blood' ?

What's a Little Death - Is it as slow going as kathryn's other works ? like "I'm Still here" ?

**** WInd Shear - Starts off in a very interesting manner, has excellent Volderort, rampages - shows what Voldermort can be capable of, but begin to drag after some chapters, I haven't read Angry Harry completely, but it more resembles Honor thy blood. Little Death - Slow going - as in slow updates - or story if slow paced. It has slow updates, sometimes taking months. Its reasonably fast paced - in that he faces Voldemort in a very short time.

***** I meant with the pacing. Slow updates is a given with kathrin's works, so its ok, they are usually worth it. But i'm actually dumb and didn't explained what i meant. Slow pace in the sense of romance, actually. Not necessarily battles and story development.

******* Lol. Yeah, I'd say its just a bit faster... But tbh, I don't mind slow pace as long as the story is either finished or not abandoned. I hate when its slow paced and the dude just up and leave just as it was about to get good. Like Black Bond or HP and 5th Element (both are over 1.3m words, but BB only covers the first 3 years, with BB II being just the start of the 4th year, and 5th Element in ONLY for Harry's 6th year. 1.3m words for only 1 year. Sometimes I'm still impressed that I actually read it through all that. Although its really really good, if you have the patience.)
