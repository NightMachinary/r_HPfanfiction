:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
(EDIT: Found it! It's: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697767/1/Founders-Heirs]]

Sorry for some of the possible inconsistencies between the story and my description of what I though it might've been like.)

Looking for specific fic I can't find again, where Harry was either Salazar, via either time travel or reincarnated or magical heirs. (Again, can't remember.) Also, I'm pretty sure Ron was Godric, and the other founders were involved as some of Harry's friends - either Luna, Hermione, or Ginny were Rowena and Helga. The cool thing about this fic was that there was time travel/alternate universe things, as well. The founders versions of Harry, Ron, and the other two travel to a past where Harry Potter didn't live through Voldemort and because of that Neville was the BWL, and quite different than canon. Also, Hermione may have been dead as well, in the past where Harry died.

A highlight I do remember is that at one point, Harry and the others ended up at a meal with the Weasleys, and younger Ron was very, very arrogant, because his older/alternate self was Godric Gryffindor. I believe at one point he took a dish of food from younger Ginny to serve himself before her. Godric/Ron ended up berating him, I think.

I hope someone knows the fic I'm searching for! I don't mind if you link other stories where Harry is Salazar, either!

Thanks.

(EDIT: Also - should this be marked as “Request” or “What's That Fic?” or what?)

(EDIT: I can't quite remember, but it might have been a one where Harry's parents are alive in this universe where he is dead.

If I find it, I'll link it here. Otherwise, I'm just going to add more things I remember.)

** Oh I read this one within the last six months I'll see if I can find it again.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8317364/1/The-Founders-Four]]

Is it this one? I love the ones where he's Slytherin reborn somehow.

Edit 2: Ah sorry not the correct story but still cool.

**** It's a good one. I love the fics where they mess with history and make it more of a “victors interpretation”.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
