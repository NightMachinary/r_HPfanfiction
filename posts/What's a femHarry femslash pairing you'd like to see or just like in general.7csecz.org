** If I try to imagine who a fem!harry might genuinely be attracted to, given how I imagine her personality to be, the only one I can come up wit is Tonks to be honest.

Tonks would be the kind of fun that might get Harry to be less serious and focused, while also sharing her goals and desires and, you know, I could totally see Tonks not really caring about gender as much as personality.

Tonks, in turn, went for Remus in Canon. Remus is kind-hearted, serious and the exact kind of thing Tonks might see as her rock /and/ someone who's life she might brighten in turn. Fem!Harry would potentially be all of those things, plus someone who might get Tonks into new and thrilling situations. If probably a little more high-maintenance due to the angst. Which is just an excuse for drama.

They'd be a total power team.

  A child of the Rich One rises. Wielding a smile masking a plotting mind. Carving a righteous but dark path through a world more vast and mysterious than ever imagined. In this game of gods and men, it's her time to shine. Fem!Harry.

** Fem!Harry/Luna. The best pairing. Ever. But really, Luna stories are fluffy, and sometimes I feel so tired of the world that I need to cheer myself up, and Luna does the trick. I also just like fem!Harry in general, so together, it's like my OTP.

** Fem!harry/Fleur. The contrast between Fleur's well-groomed badass and Harry's feral-child badass would be hilarious. Plus I don't think Fleur would encourage Harry's reactivity.

Also I really want to see people's heads explode when they go to the Ball together.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** Like in general: with Tonks, Ginny, &/or Fleur

Ideas for others:

I had a one shot started with Laurel Potter being seduced by Narcissa Malfoy, for the sake of a magical hairbrush that was part of the Black estate left to Laurel by Sirius.

Then there's the Flowergirl summit: wherein a less confident Violet Potter chooses to use the Felix during Yule of 6th year to aid her in summoning help from other worlds. She ends up drawing six other girl!Harry's to her cause, though not all of them come in order to help.

For the sake of a crossover: Holly/Dana Scully in the 25th century; because neither one of them is going to die.

** fem!Harry/Luna, because to my knowledge it hasn´t been done in great detail or in a complete story, then almost every other pairing that would interest me has been done, Hermione was done more than I can count, to the point that other fem!harry/femslash pairings are a niche inside of a niche. Ginny was done two or three times, I know of two stories with Susan Bones, one with Tonks, one with Fleur, some pairings with Ladies from other universes, but seriously this genre has a diversity problem.

**** Is there a fic, or is it just your preference. On an unrelated sidenote, isn´t it weird that there are relatively few fics were Harry dates Parvati, even though they kinda had a date in the story? I mean, there are probably more Harry/Daphne fics than, Harry/Parvati fics.
