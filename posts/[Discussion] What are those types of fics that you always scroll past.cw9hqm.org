For me, it's the Harry in prison fics. The only one that I've ever attempted to read and enjoy was The Child Of Azkaban by The LonelyHarvest on ao3.

I also avoid harem fics like the plaque. Never read one, not sure if I want to bring myself to read one. Nor have I ever read the really weird parings like Snape/Hat or whatever. Like? What are you doing? Why are you writing that?

** I'm getting very picky nowadays, I no longer read:

- Canon rehashes, especially in time travels and “Harry raised by X” fics
- Blatant shipping fics, especially those that need to bash other characters
- Voldemort and Death Eater apologies, although I don't mind reading Voldemort centric fics that don't try to justify his actions.
- Anytime Hadrian or Ice Princess is mentioned
- Any fics that ship Harry or Hermione with Death Eater scums
- WBWL fics, with a couple exceptions
- Fics that manufacture lots of angst and drama

Due to the large number of fics in this fandom, I'm still following about 12 that are being updated regularly, and I can find 1-2 good completed ones per month.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history.

** - Bad spelling and/or grammar. I hate things that disturb the flow of my reading.

- Terrible or very simplistic use of adjectives, or lots of word repetitions (i.e. he said he said he said)

- Stories with idiot plots, meaning those that only work because of the idiocy of its main characters

- Drarry in general, but on the other hand there are some that are really good

- MPreg

- Author Insert (and to a lesser extent some OCs, though some are okay).

- HP stories told from the first person POV. This one is strange, because I don't mind some othet types of stories having the first person POV. I'm not quite sure why it doesn't quite work for me for HP universe stories.

I'm actually fine with most pairing fics, as long as the relationship (and I don't just mean romantic relationships) is plausible, is actually built up over time, and has a solid grounding in the original character psyches. So Hermione/Voldemort would be (to me) a terrible idea, but Hermione/Tom Riddle may work. Snarry is close to poison (it better be done well and reasonably), but Severitus may be ok. Hermione/George was done pretty well in White Squirrel's Arithmancer-verse. There needs to be internal consistency, and preferably universe consistency.

I don't hate harem fics on principle; IMO there is a proper way to build it. Polygamy and/or open relationships and/or other nontraditional relationship types do exist in the real world, after all.

** Anything with the faintest whiff of rape and children having sex is a big yikes, a hard pass and a report to the FBI from me. I know it happens IRL but if I wanted a taste of that I'd be reading the news, not a Harry Potter fanfic you fucking psychos lmao.

*** There are ones that I see the summary about how Harry like "daddy's milk" at the age of 11 and it makes me want to vomit while scooping my eyes out.

**** That was hyperbole for comedic purposes, and I agree that no real harm is being done by writing a scene of a werewolf giving little Harry fissures, but I will say this: If I knew someone in person who wrote/enjoyed such material, and I had children, I would not let them anywhere near that person.

**** There are a few 'authors' I've seen on FFN that sexualize children that I've discussed on this subreddit before, and thought that was as weird as it got, but then I was recommended a fic on Ao3, and having never been there, went exploring. Oh my god. I never really understood why FFN banned explict sex scenes until I read through some fics on there. I assume it's just children writing them, but holy god, the amount of stories with children fucking Snape or some other Death Eater/Voldemort is ridiculous.

** Any fics where you know the author won'teven try not to make Hayy not OOC even from the beginning(I don't mind if Harry starts in character bur then changes from his canon self through the plot if it feels like a realistic shift). This would be stuff like WBWL, Harry raised by someone else, or if I can tell that the author will make him super edgy (most Indy!Harrys but I'm always looking for realistic Indy!Harrys). I also hate Harmony, Dramione...most fanon hermione ships make no sense. I could see her getting with one of the other Weasleys if the author dislikes Romione(and I really don't see why the fan community hates romione so much) but I think it would take a special balance of passive/nonpassive to date hermione.

** Hermione Time travel where she Just sits around and do nothing because timeline should not be changed which is a joke in itself.

Hermione time travel where every nale character Falls in love with her...and she goes around shagging everything- and yeah I AM talking about Very famous time turners fics that people love and I despise because of ultra Mary Sue factor.

Dark!Harry as a code for Racist!Harry

Harry/Voldemort

And yes, now I am fairly good in spotting such fics Just by Reading summary ir First chapters.

** To everyone who wrote they scroll down when they see OCs or OC as a consistent part of the plot. You are honestly being judgemental just because some people wrote Mary Sue characters. It doesn't mean every single one is badly written, skipping summary and all seems harsh to me. Especially when there's so many absurd fanfiction that are IMMENSEALY popular, it seems hypocritical to me. Not that I'm surprised. People usually are, anyway.
