:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for an old fic that I probably read on Checkmated or SugarQuill. Ron has been presumed dead during the war but is found as a POW in a dungeon by a sibling of a minor character (maybe a Patil brother?). Other things I remember about the fic: Both Ron and Charlie are called General Weasley, Ron and Hermione have a daughter that Ron doesn't know about, Hermione finds out about Ron being alive during a press conference, Harry is in it, there's a lot of military camps/tents.
