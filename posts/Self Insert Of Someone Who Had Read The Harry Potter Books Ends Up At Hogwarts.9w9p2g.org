Basically this character is a harry potter fan who somehow ends up in the harry potter world and befriends the golden trio, though I don't remember to what extent Ron was in the fic. I believe the whole fic takes place over fourth year and he uses his foreknowledge to try to prevent bad things from happening. Memory serves mc can cast wandlessly though isn't that magically powerful. Also he's very honest about his feelings and tells his friends how much he loves them.


** Ah! I just found it. It's A Curse of Truth. Thanks everyone.
