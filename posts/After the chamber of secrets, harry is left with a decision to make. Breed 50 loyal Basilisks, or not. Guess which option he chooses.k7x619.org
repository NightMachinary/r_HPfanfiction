  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

** Idea: Basilisk wardrones.

Breed a ton of baby Basilisks, train them in recognizing foes, not harming friends. Build a tube that one can slide in with various buttons and levers that can be moved by the snake. Add flight charms, maybe find some physics exploit that provides a physical force (I can think of a dozen ways to do that) to provide fighter jet like acceleration. Give each a way to communicate with others. Teach the snakes to use their new vehicles.

End result: Drone sized flying intelligent snakes with instant death beam that attack in swarms. Anyone that looks at one zooming towards them? Dead. Anyone who doesn't look at it? Doesn't see the bomb dropped from it, also dead. Anyone who survived that? Good luck aiming at something that fast and maneuverable. And the Basilisk leader can just sit at home in another country, view the progress on a magic mirror whose counterpart is being carried by a snake-drone, and issue commands. No need for an expensive army of henchmen. World domination, here I come.
