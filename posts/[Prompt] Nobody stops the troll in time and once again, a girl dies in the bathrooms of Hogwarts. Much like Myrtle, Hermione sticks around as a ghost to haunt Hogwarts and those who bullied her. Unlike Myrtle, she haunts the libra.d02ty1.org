** Hermione Granger, tragically bludgeoned to death in a bathroom in an incident from which Hogwarts was rather rapidly recovering from. Indeed, there were even Ministry dispensed pamphlets handed out, attempting to soothe the student body about the dangers of bathrooms. In the weeks after Hermione had died, no one went anywhere alone, fearing that another troll would somehow make its way into the castle. No one actually thought much of Hermione herself, just that a poor, dear, first year had died.

Given that it was so early in the year when Hermione died, no one knew her as anything other than a bushy head of hair. And so, when a silvery head of bushy hair began to peek out from behind bookcases, Madam Pince began to wonder.

"Miss Granger? I can see you, you know." No answer was forthcoming. "Miss Granger? Come out, if you please." Nothing.

Madam Pince began to call out quietly every time she saw Miss Granger, cautiously, as gently as she could make her voice, hoping that the ghost would come to her. Eventually, Madam Pince was successful, finally coaxing the ghost out with a copy of Moste Potente Potions. "I don't suppose you would have had a chance to see this, would you, it's not actually in the curriculum anywhere, and Professor Snape doesn't usually hand out passes to the restricted section. Come and have a look, I'll turn the pages for you."

The girl, silent and shimmering faintly, hovered over her shoulder for almost two hours that evening. Every so often, she would reach out a hand to stroke the pages.

Just a one-shot. I like the idea of Madam Pince having a library ghost.

** The Gryffindor Common room was full of nervous chatter.

“Will the teachers be alright.”

“How'd the troll get in here?”

“Great way to ruin a feast, that was.”

“Did you see Professor Quirrell? How pathetic can you get?”

Harry was sitting on a sofa with Ron, idly wondering if the sort of commotion the troll in the dungeons brought happened every Halloween at Hogwarts.

“It's kind of funny, really.” Ron said suddenly.

“What is?” Harry replied.

“Well, I told you before the sorting, didn't I? Fred joked about how we had to wrestle a troll.”

“Yeah, you're right. Maybe your brothers can see the future.”

“Fred and George? Seers?” Ron asked incredulously. “Nah, if that were the case, they'd have destroyed the school by now.” He popped a piece of chocolate from the Halloween feast into her mouth. “Remember how nervous we were about it? And then it turns out we were only worried about a talking hat.”

“I think I remember Hermione muttering spells under her breath. She probably thought it was a test or something.”

“Yeah that sounds about right.” Suddenly his face fell. “Harry?”

“What is it?” he frowned.

Ron began frantically looking around the common room. “Where's Hermione?”

Harry's stomach dropped. The last they heard; she was crying in one of the girl's toilets. He couldn't see her anywhere in the common room. She was still there. “She doesn't know about the troll!”

At once, Harry and Ron leapt out of the sofa and ran out of the common room. Harry could hear the distant shouts of Percy as he ran as fast as he could down the stairs with Ron hot on his heels.

When they reached the second floor, they could hear down the corridors McGonagall shouting the names of spells, followed by low guttural roars.

“Wasn't it supposed to be in the dungeons!?” Ron shouted as they ran down another flight of stairs away from the battle.

“I don't know!” He shouted back.

When they turned down another corridor on the first floor, they were hit by a vile stench. A mixture of rotten eggs and decaying flesh. Harry grimaced, but kept running towards the girl's toilets.

When they turned another corner, Harry sold to a stop. The door to the toilets had cracked in half, with one piece hanging limply on its hinges and the other buried in a pile of rubble. Stench was even more powerful.

Ron whispered breathlessly “Oh, Merlin,” and ran towards the ruined doorway. Harry followed but come to an immediate stop when he saw the inside.

It looked as if a hurricane had blown through the bathroom. All of the stalls had been blasted down, large chunks of the sinks where missing, and a pipe had busted open somewhere, flooding the room with red water.

And there was reason that the water was blood red. In the middle of the room was a pile of ruined and bloodied robes among a head of brunette, wild hair. Lying face down on the ground was Hermione Granger, dead.

(I might start writing a full fic of this, how Ghost!Hermione becomes part of the Golden Trio, and the rest of the story happens.)
