I was originally gonna rant about all these evil Dumbledore fics I've been reading but ^{^{^{for}}} ^{^{^{the}}} ^{^{^{greater}}} ^{^{^{good}}} I've decided to write my own worthy addition to the genre and give you a nice recipe for how to make one yourselves.

First ingredients: general power wank and condescension. Toss in an arrogant brother and some abusive parents for good measure:

With the teachings of the kind and loving Basilisk Plahteevice added to his 9000 times larger than normal magical core through ancient ritual magic called Dark by the inept ministry, Harisadrian Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Uzumaki-Slytherin-Aozaki-Gryffindor-le Fey, his custom made basilisk venom, thestral hair and Godzilla scale wand firmly in his hand, strode onwards to the waste of his time that was NEWT level Transfiguration, taught by none other than his biological father James Potter.

When he'd woken up that morning surrounded by the members of his harem in the fideliused dormitories of Hogwart's secret fifth house, all he'd wanted to do was have a normal day, not to deal with that batty old man's manipulations, with his arrogant brother Saytahn's pathetic attempts to stab him in the back, and especially his idiot biological parent's pathetic attempts to prostrate themselves and beg for his forgiveness. Really he thought intelligently (as he always does), what was with those? It's not like they cared back in first year when they'd sent him a howler disowning him for getting better grades than his brother, or in his 3rd year when they left him locked in a room with Remus during a full moon. If he hadn't invented a cure for lycanthropy before Remus had fully changed he could have been killed! He referring to Remus, of course. Even wandless, Harrisadrian was more than a match for the strongest werewolf, particularly given the innate metaphormagus and double-jumping talents that Dumbledore had blocked to make him subservient to his brother. Had they not shown up on the inheritance test at Gringotts he might never even have realized that he had them in place considering how much more powerful his magic was than the average wizard.

--------------

Next up: Evil!Dumbledore, but not competent though, because that would require creativity and effort that the author needs to come up with more powers for Harry:

Dumbledore sat in his office surrounded by the stolen contents of a thousand orphans' vaults. What he was thinking, not even he himself could claim to know. He had become such a master of occlumancy that he had hidden the logic of his thoughts from even the narrator. It was probably to do with the greater good of shoving Amorentia into Harry's drink or something though. Everyone knows that Dumbledore is quite fond of repeating the ideologies of deposed Nazis to justify rapes. Particularly when he's within earshot of of important political figures or their children.

"Perhaps I should Crucio some kittens today," he mumbled incompetently to himself, "that always gets me in the mood for some child obliviating." Leaning back in his chair with a bulge rising in his robes, "Ah, yes, the wonders of the imperius curse."

--------------

And of course, it wouldn't be complete without a one-sided confrontation in the headmaster's office to finish things off:

ABWD: My dear bo-

HPBREUSAGLF: Don't call me your boy you pedophile.

ABWD: Lemon drop?

HPBREUSAGLF: Nice try, those are Amorentia laced Imperius Draughts of Living Death trust charms!

ABWD: But you must understand, it's for the greater good!

HPBREUSAGLF: Whose greater good?

Minerva breaks in: Now look here Mr. Potter, I'm sure the Headmaster has a perfec-

HPBREUSAGLF: I will be addressed as Lord Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Uzumaki-Slytherin-Aozaki-Gryffindor-le Fey, thank you very much. You lost my respect when you supported this doddering old fool's attempt to love potion me. I'm owling the aurors because Amelia Bones is the honestest person in the Ministry and she makes everything perfect.

ABWD: I'm sure we can com- URK!

Dies of a heart attack because of HPBREUSAGLF's immensely powerful accidental magical aura.

And thus the school's staff broke free of the Dark Lord Albus's imperius curse, Tom Riddle was accepted back into society after it was revealed that Dumbledore had used an ancient soul binding to control him, and the other three Potter's were put to death because nobody really liked them anyway.

Damn that's a great line. Could I use it if I ever wrote an evil Dumbledore fic? Actually, this makes wl me want to read a fic where Dumbledore is just a dictator, but outspoken about it. Like "Fuck y'all, you can't do anything right, just let me handle this."

Or maybe Grindelwald and Dumbledore are actually the same person with a time turner and Dumbledore engineered the war to remove his political opponents and get his hands on the headmaster's office so he could inure the younger generation to his grandfatherly advice, giving him new inroads in the government when they eventually graduate.

Is it bad that I can see a really awesome story there (assuming he lives as Albus, then goes back all the way to the start and lives as Grindelwald)? With all the classic twisty paradox headache inducing time tropes? About the nature of humanity in the face of adversity, maybe a comment on determinism. Maybe even Aberforth is also the same person (Aberforth being after Grindelwald, bitter at not being able to change anything, surviving but not living)! Puts a whole other spin on to no one knowing who exactly killed Ariana.
