** Harry/Ron, for a start. We could also play "let's pair up the tremendously nice guys" and ship Neville with Cedric. Not quite sure who Hermione might end up with: there's always Ginny, if we assume she keeps a thing for rash but good-hearted redheads; but if you want to move away from that, Cho or Fleur are our best pics sticking to semimportant characters. Luna would still probably end up with Newt Scamander's granddaughter or something: let's preserve the one example of a major character who /doesn't/ get married to one of their schoolfellows.

Among the adults, I consider it a given that Remus and Sirius would hook up in such a scenario. If "crazed to-the-end sycophant with a talent for Dark Magic" is what he's into, a gay Voldemort might trade Bellatrix for Barty Crouch Jr.; I'll admit to not having many ideas who /Bellatrix/ could develop a crush on. Also, I know the title said "everyone", but for the sake of symmetry it's only fair that Dumbledore would secretly have a /straight/ crush on some horribly evil figure. I dunno. Umbridge.

Ew!

Not because of the cross-species part, to be clear. I'm not judging. But Hagrid /raised/ Aragog; for all intents and purposes Aragog is his /son/, or at the very least a ward/younger sibling. To me Hagrid/Aragog feels no different from Hagrid/Grawp.

*** Tonks/Fleur? That cannot possibly end well. Fleur doesn't have a high opinion of Tonks, and the feeling is probably mutual.

I could imagine Fleur with Angelina Johnson. Tonks is really tough though, because we don't see many women of her generation. A random barely mentioned order member would feel like a cop out.

*** I read a Harry x Draco fanfic, where they did pair together Luna and Ginny, and honestly it was awesome. It was set years after graduation. I believe Draco was an antiques dealer, or repair guy or something or other. The dynamic between Ginny's personality and Luna's is very fun to read.

** I'm gonna throw my hats into the ring and say that either Ron/Harry or Harry/Draco happens, the later maybe due to the whole "foil" thing. However, I don't think it's as likely as Harry/Ron.

Like Achille said, Hermione/Ginny /might/ happen (and I agree), but I could definitely see Hermione going out with a Ravenclaw like Padma Patil. If you wanted to go more fanon you might pair her up with Daphne, as she's currently a fan-favourite and a bit of a blank slate, though that later part could be said of Padma---or anyone else, for that matter.

Luna...idk. I'm not sure about her. I'm tempted to say someone like Hannah Abbott, but I really don't know. Perhaps she and Ginny, should Hermione/Ginny not happen? I think they'd be better off friends, but in this AU dating between them would probably happen.

If he doesn't end up with Harry, Ron might be a good match with either Seamus or Dean, though I think those two would be a good couple in and of themselves. I'm thinking Ron and Seamus, as they both like Quidditch (I think?) and then Dean/Neville could happen. I don't know---literally any of these /could/ happen, though now that I'm thinking about it I doubt they would last long...

To get (even further) away from main characters, I think Vincent/Gregory would be a thing in this, and you can't convince me otherwise. They're too stupid for anyone but each other. Cho and Fluer might be bit cute couple, though I'm not sure how that would happen---regardless, it would probably just be from 1994-95. Maybe Cedric/Victor Krum, also just for the year, though I think a Victor/Neville situation might make for an interesting turn of events... Lavender/Parvati for the win.

Professor McGonagall might do well with one of the other teachers, or if you want to stretch things a little maybe Amelia Bones. Maybe in this verse Minerva and Sybill Trelawney dated for a bit and broke up in a less-than-amicable way. It could add fuel to the fire for McGonagall's intense dislike for Divination.

I know everyone immediately thinks of Wolfstar when it comes to the Marauders, but to mix things up a bit I'm going to go with James/Remus and Peter/Sirius; James ended up with a strong, intelligent woman in canon, which Remus (debatealy) mirrors, and a previous Peter/Sirius would only make the betrayal more brutal. Maybe Remus/Sirius could occur later.

Alice (Longbottom in Canon, though obviously not here) maybe would have gotten along well with Lily, romantically; not that we know either of their characters well... And just for no particular reason...perhaps /Bellatrix/ was the one with a crush on a certain red-headed Gryffindor? The timeline doesn't quite match up (~9 year difference), so they wouldn't have met in school, but still. The idea is there. I think it could've come from some sort of twisted admiration on Bellatrix's end after fighting her and losing? I'm not sure. Just playing with ideas here.

Myrtle crushes on Ginny when the later gets a little older.

Percy/Oliver Wood /could/ happen, as they shared a dorm for seven years and had some basic ideals (ambition, resolve, et cetera.) though I doubt it would work out long-term. Actually, Oliver would more likely end up with someone from the Quidditch Team and therefore end up becoming Oliver /Weasley-Wood,/ or something (Oliver Potter-Wood? Ugh his name does /not/ hyphenate well).

Gilderoy/Gilderoy...the narcissist.

Fred or George Weasley with Lee Jordan. Presumably George.

Assuming he's not gay already, Grindelwald would've definitely gone for Dumbledore, if the other was also still gay.

Dumbledore might've also had a short thing with Slughorn, but just thinking about that makes me shiver so how about we forget /that/ mental image...

I don't know about Tonks, but lets assume she still falls for an older member of the Order of the Phoenix; maybe an unknown, like Hestia Jones. If not, and if we're sticking to known characters, then perhaps Katie Bell? She's friendly and gentle, loves Quidditch and has been through enough trauma to relate to her. But if we want someone closer to her age then Penelope Clearwater appears to be rather similar to Katie.

AND

And I had better stop now before I add anything else. But in my defence, OP /did/ say "everyone"...

I could definitely get behind a Minerva/Amelia pairing. They seem to have compatible personalities, and they are both some of the strongest adult female witches in the books.

I think it would be fun if Oliver Wood falls for someone on an opposing team. I've read a fic with an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint pairing that worked surprisingly well, but Oliver/Cedric could be cute.

**** Oh, you make a very good point about Oliver. A player from another house might work just as well if not better---just so long as they're as fanatic about the sport as he is. Though, best of luck finding someone like /that/.

** Harry... I think Harry would end up with Fred or George, because those two have quite a bit in common with Ginny.

I'm struggling to come up with a good idea for Ron.

I quite like the couple of Hermione and Ginny in fanfic, so I'm going with that. They complement each other really well.

I think Draco would probably end up with Zabini, because Blaise is shallow enough to overlook Draco's terrible character.

Snape would still be forever alone, but instead of Lily he would have a crush on Regulus, and defect from the Death Eaters after Regulus' death in the cave.

** Harry/Fred - Fred was a funny, firey quidditch player who can get mean when he needs to. Harry was rebellious enough without being too alike and supportive of Fred's ambition.

Past Harry/Cedric - I can see that being Harry's first relationship.

Ginny/Tonks - Ginny would like the goofy but still badass auror.

Ron/Oliver Wood - They would live and breathe Quidditch together. Ron's love of the Chudley Canons would always hanging over their heads, and people would joke that it would be what ends their relationship.

Hermione/Fleur - Both smart and strong-willed. Contrasting outside appearances. They grow on each other and challenge each other. When they get married, they live in France.

James/Sirius - I know Wolfstar is popular, but I've just never gotten behind it. I see James/Sirius and even James/Remus working out better.

Sirius/Shacklebolt - If James is still dead, I think Shacklebolt's calm and stay demeanor would be good for Sirius. Sirius would also be amused that he's sleeping with the auror that's supposed to be hunting him.

Leta/Tina - Meeting under different circumstances, I can see Tina being intrigued and Leta just liking her.
