Deep breath, MDW, deep breath.

I have sat here for months, debating whether I should share a story with you guys. Now, before I even link it, please note that the first (and maybe second) are riddles with errors. I am slowly fixing them, but half of them I just don't see. I don't mind if you point them out, but please go easy on me with them. I /know/ they're there and I am working on fixing them.

Again, before I link it... sigh. I started this as a way to learn writing and creating/building onto a world. When I first started it, I never expected anyone to read it and there was a vast amount of issues. I have since improved in my writing and thus touched up the story.

In case bot doesn't work (it hates me): [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4070950/chapters/9165277]]

The tags are self-explanatory, but I'll go into a little more detail, just for you guys. The first few years follow canon, pretty much to the dot. It may be Harry/Draco, but the slash isn't a primary focus. Just letting you know now. You're not going to see them getting it on, nor anyone, at that point. Anyway, I need feedback... people have been nice, too nice, in comments and it has got me curious.

I am a big boy and I can handle feedback. Please, please be honest and don't sugar-coat things. I'm open to suggestions as well. In case you're curious. Year 5 is when it starts to get AU.

Really hope I don't regret posting this before diving for the polish and making it perfect for you guys.

  Due to unexplainable circumstances, James and Lily Potter, along with their son, survive the attack on their home in Godric's Hollow. Lily does what Albus Dumbledore told her not to do and makes a deal with the most powerful Dark Lord the wizarding world has ever seen. Little Harry, who was born with an incurable disease, fights for his life at every twist and turn. He makes unlikely friends and foes and turns the wizarding world completely on its head.Warning: the tags span across most of the entire series (7 planned parts) and are subject to be altered and/or changed. This story also closely follows canon, with a lot of the dialog slightly changed and situations made different. I have also taken some inspiration from J.K and added in a lot of foreshadowing. If you find it, congrats!Part 1 of 7.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone rewrite.Rewritten: 29/March/2016 --- revised: in progress (13/August/2016)
