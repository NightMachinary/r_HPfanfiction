I read it a while ago, so the details are a little fuzzy, but here's what I can remember

Light and dark magic are sentient, dark is wild, don't remember light

People declare towards one or the other, and bind their allegiance to the magic, giving ‚Äúlight lord‚Äù and ‚Äúdark lord‚Äù meaning

Harry declares towards neither, which is very rare, and seeks to unite them.

Pansy's dad is necromancer, dies during Voldemorts resurrection, pansy becomes necromancer

Thats all I remember, if I remember more I'll add it in comments.

Thanks y'all!


** Saving Connor series! Free Will vs. Compulsion, Truth vs. Subterfuge, and Tame vs. Wild.

I see the story is already linked here, so I won't mention it. If you were asking about all that jazz specifically the author gets into the meat of that lore in book 3 after Walpurgis Night.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
