I'm planning to write a fic where Harry's kind of adopted by Voldemort the night his parents are killed (well I dunno completely yet, I might have to change some things about Voldemort's past to be able to sort it out, and maybe some things about the prophecy? I dunno but it's gonna be very not canon) but I don't think he can be Harry Potter when he goes to Hogwarts, but I can't think of a name to give him.

Like if he should be Harry Riddle? Which I don't think sounds quite right. But I am so bad at thinking of names ðŸ˜… does anyone have any suggestions? (He doesn't Have to be Harry something, I just thought maybe it would be easier for if people were to read it they would know who it is, but it doesn't have to be Harry something


** Something like Adrian maybe if you want to make it sound a little like Harry or if not something from a different Pureblood family maybe if he is raised as a Lestrange or a Black the Stars because of Bellatrix?

** In a good family situation mortifer/letifer assuming harry being loved by voldemort as a child you know, bringer of death in context to flight of death but I never assumed voldemort to be the loving kind.

** Assuming Voldemort is more caring of harry, then he'll likely keep harry and give him riddle as a surname. Or perhaps gaunt.

Assuming it's a power move, it'll likely be something more wizardly, i.e. Arcturius.

**** Voldemort despises his riddle name. It's far more likely he would either give him gaunt OR, now i think about it, not even change harry's name.

** Well canon Voldemort didn't like his given name, supposedly because he thought it was too common and mundane. If that carries over to your story then he won't be using such a lowly name for his adopted son/apprentice (If we're going by sith rule of two logic).

Henry/Harold are technically regal names but they've probably become too common. Ironically Hadrian would be grandiose enough for him, but I'll tell you now there's probably a lot of people that will drop your story immediately if you use it. Maybe Ambrosius, in reference to immortality as well as arthurian legend.

It'd be even easier with a fem!Harry because there's a few more dark(ish) witch names to choose from; Morrigan if we stick to the death theme, Aradia/Circe as the Queen of Witches, Diana/Hecate for godesses of magic, etc.
