Recently read a crossover where Harry squats in an abandoned temple and is basically nursed back to health by Hestia. As a result, I am now hooked on Harry Potter/Percy Jackson crossovers. Please, kind people of Reddit, help me feed my addiction by posting recs (FFN preferred)! Completed works are top preference.


** I quite like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/32/Harry-Potter-Squatter][Harry Pottter Squatter]], it's funny, it's interesting, but way pre Hogwarts and messes with the timeline a lot (ie. Percy Jackson happens earlier or HP happens late)

  Voldemort didn't know the powers he was messing with the night he attacked the Potters. Lily Potter was much more than she seemed. Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.

** linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze) has Harry turning into a gorgon after CoS. I loved the premise, but the story doesn't do a lot with it, or anything related to Harry Potter, before focusing almost entirely on Harry building a new home for demigods. And it seems to have been abandoned right as the plot of The Lightning Thief was starting and the author promised some Harry Potter plot coming soon. Still, I found it an interesting enough read, and there aren't many other good HP/PJO crossovers. Or PJO fics in general, in my experience.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** I haven't enjoyed any of the others that've come up myself, so I'm afraid I don't have the links, but there have been requests for this made before.

Have you done a subsearch? Typed in the reddit search bar, limited to this sub, then searched through the lists of posts? If not, I recommend you do. There have been requests for PJO/HP crossovers a few times before in the few months I've been here.

  A Twice-Blessed demigoddess is born, and she's got a lot of work to do. Operating under multiple prophecies and fighting two wars, Helen Potter rises to the challenge with enough time left over to destroy her enemies and fall in love. Of course, nothing less could be expected from the Daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. Fem!Harry.
