I'm looking to find more HP fic communities -- more as a writer than a reader -- and I don't really know know where to go. I'm not sure if it's just me, but as large as the HP community is, finding active ones is kind of hard. It seems like most archives are deadish and I'm not a big fan of ff.net other than for reading fics. I'm looking for a place that would welcome next gen preferably (I know it can be an eyerolled sort of thing at some places).


** HPFF is far from dead, but I agree that the rules and policies are pretty heavy-handed. The site has been around for so long that a lot of its members have grown up from being school-age to twenty-somethings and the site hasn't really grown up with them. That said, it's still a huge, active community.

*** Doh, I forgot to say that I'm already a member of HPFF. I guess I'm just curious about what else might lying out there, wondering if there's a community I'm missing. Peeking out the window, in a way.

** You might try joining [[http://www.livejournal.com/][livejournal]] (if you haven't already), and then signing in with the [[http://hp-nextgen-fest.livejournal.com/][HP Next Gen Fest]]. This looks like a busy Next Gen community!

** [[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/][Fiction Alley?]] I'm not sure how active it is in terms of writers but there are some great fics there. Other than that I can't think of any non-ship centric sites besides ff.net and HPFF.

*** It always seemed like one of those dead ones to me :( Or maybe the navigation was just super confusing. The forums looked kind of dead too.

HPFF is just too confusing to me. I'd spend more time on HPFF, but for how tough it is to navigate between pages, do a search, update one's own account, etc. I visited last night and found some sort of ad for a free Kindle book. The ad appeared on /every single solitary page/. What's worse, the Kindle promotion expired days ago.

***** Huh, maybe I just got used to it. HPFF, I use a different skin (the blue one. It's a lot more minimal than the default, so I like it), so that promo actually doesn't show up for me. Looks like someone edited the wrong php file :P

What I don't like about fictionalley is how they divide up the fic sections into novel, romance, humor, etc... do fics appear in multiple sections? Because they seem to be different sites. What if I want to read a novel-romance-humor story?

** [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]] is a thriving community, with a fair number of Next Gen writers contributing.

** I like livejournal as a writer (though I've never written only read on that site) because of the closeness of everyone. At least with the stories I've read, once you get a steady flow of readers it's like a nice system to have discussions about chapters and talk to the readers. Problem is, it's of course not completely dedicated to Harry Potter but there are a lot of groups dedicated - and you can even find a more specific group to join.

*** I love livejournal and actually I've been REALLY wanting to find a good lj comm, but I haven't been able to find a good HP one. I lurk for other fandoms, and those tend to be primarily ship based, but I hit a problem for HP because I'm looking for non-ship based. Do you have any specific suggestions?

**** No, all the HP communities I lurk in on lj are ship-based. Unless kink-based counts as non-ship? :DDD

***** Aha! Unfortunately not. HP's always been kind of weird for me, because it is the only fandom where I -don't- look for specific ships. I wasn't even very involved until I started writing it -- on a pure whim too.

Asking for non-ship based is probably too much, now that I'm thinking about it. Are there by any chance good ljs for Post-Hogwarts or Next-Gen, even if it is directed toward a specific ship (what's the most popular on lj)? Excluding those with primarily the trio (it seems like the glut of comms are Harry-ships).
