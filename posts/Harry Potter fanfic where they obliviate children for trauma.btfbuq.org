:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find a fanfic were Harry and Hermione discover that the purebloods are obliviating their children whenever they experience pain or trauma. This causes the purebloods to never learn lessons related to the incident. (I.E. fell out of tree and broke their leg. Leg is healed and memory of broken bone removed, then the child climbs the tree again.)

They also do this if they have a fight with their friends.

I think it was a humor fic.


** I don't recall the name but it was a harmony story during 4th year with a super violent Harry

  Harry gets picked for the Triwizard Tournament. He does not like this. Mayhem, destruction, and HHR. OOC Harry. M for violence and frequent profanity.

*** I didn't see a direct reference to the use of the Memory Charm in chapter 3 of that story. However, after browsing chapters randomly, I did see a reference matching OP's description in chapter 14.

Warning: the story is a bash-fic that exaggerates the stupidity and aggressiveness of the bashed characters.

** I remember reading it at least twice. He pulls one of Draco's teeth out with pliers, and the next day the tooth is back and Draco doesn't remember the incident.

(reading other posts) Yep, it's "One Wizard Too Many". Slightly cracky.

I don't remember if it's the same fic, but there's one where Harry takes the golden egg and hammers it flat as a pancake with a large blunt instrument. I don't think he bothered to open it first.
