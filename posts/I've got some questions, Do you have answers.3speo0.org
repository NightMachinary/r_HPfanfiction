While I may not be an avid reader of this sub I am not new to HPFF. I started reading oh I think almost 6 years ago and have only recently started again

Why do you guys not talk about story's on HarryPotterFanfiction.com as much as fanfiction.net

What are you Thoughts on The Delicate stories by padfoot4ever?

What do you think of Living Life by Singing? I think it was one of my favorite stories when i was reading

What about How to tame a Marauder?

I enjoy Marauder era stores as well as some other Next gen storys do you have any good ones that I may like based on the other stories I talked about?

Thanks guys I appreciate it This sub has kept me reading even now

I don't read angst, which I'd define as unnecessary drama resulting from purposefully obtuse miscommunication or unrealistic personality traits. Mysteries and action/adventure rate higher with me, but it's just a personal preference.

Never heard of the stories you mentioned, but I tend to stick with either no pairing fics or H/Hr. Thanks for the list though. Hopefully someone else will find something they really enjoy.

*** It's not that there aren't mysteries or action fics on HPFF, but they're generally less appreciated. I think fics that aren't centered around a popular ship or aren't aimed at their younger demographic tend to fade into obscurity.

I don't frequent the site anymore, but there are a few I remember enjoying. I could dig them up if anyone wants them.

*** I find you definition of 'angst' rather unfair. I've read great fics which definitely belonged to the genre of angst, and didn't have those flaws you describe in your definition. I agree on disliking fics that create artificial angst through such means, but angst can be done right too. You can't just redefine a genre as just the flaws that are (unfortunately) common in it.

** I think the fact that they read all submissions for inappropriate content turned me off from the site. I hadn't gotten any recommendations for fics exclusively posted there, and their awards listing seemed to suggest a certain insular quality.

Most any great fic I've seen that would pass their review board would also be posted on ff.net if the author really wanted exposure. Any fic not suitable to them could be posted to Ao3 without drama.

If you do have a story or stories to recommend, I'd suggest including the easy details at least: Name; Author; tags; Summary; length; and one would hope you'd include a link if you think it worthy.

For ff.net stuff it's very easy to collect that info. Ao3 nearly so.

**** While the /average/ HPFF fic may be about the same quality as the average FFN fic, the /best/ HPFF fic is worse than the best FFN fic. And the best fics from each archive is what matters, places like [[/r/hpfanfiction]] and DLP exist to find the best fics of the fandom so they look on archives where the best fics exist and HPFF is not one of them.

HPFF houses mostly bad fics and the ocassional good one (but I've noticed that many of those are not exclusive to HPFF), but FFN houses mostly bad fics along with the occasional good one /and/ the occasional /great/ one. And it is only the great ones that matter.

****** I cannot reply to the first sentence as it is opinion and I have no desire to get into a debate about that. But to the second sentence:

It doesn't matter which site a story started on. Your question is why people don't talk about HPFF as much as FFN, and so if FFN has all the great stories that started there but also has many great stories that started on other archives then people will use FFN for convienence. No one wants to be checking a dozen plus archives just because stories /started/ there. Therefore for an archive to stand out among the Juggernaut that is FFN it must have many great /exclusive/ fics.

** I used to frequent HPFF a lot back in the day. My account says that I joined in 2005 (10 years ago!!). While I did enjoy making the banners, I hated their approval system and admin staff. My friend and I had a thing going where we would literally hold conversations in the reviews of our stories so that it would raise the review count. But that wasn't allowed. We got fussed at a lot for stupid reasons (I was 13 when I joined, so you can imagine the level of maturity). I'm a decent writer, and I always have been even as a kid, but there was always something stupid that got mine rejected. Like I used one too many cuss words for my rating, or my formatting was not right, or I mentioned something that was off limits for the site, or my author's notes were five characters too long...stupid things that I could literally change in five seconds, but I had to wait upwards of 10 ADDITIONAL days for it to get approved. To be honest, I don't know why I put up with it. I like the simplicity of FFN now because there's very little bullshit. The only people responsible for proof-reading my story is ME, MYSELF, AND I (...and my beta).

Yes, I've read Delicate, Still Delicate, and How to Tame a Marauder. The most popular stories were usually full of romance and chick-flick drama (which I like sometimes!), but I can see why some people don't like it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/][*/Hogwarts Houses Divided/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][/Inverarity/]]

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** Yea I made my account 7 years ago and stopped reading o maybe 3 years agao? idk it was just a question because as a reader the site seemed good it had suggested stories and the stories that people liked on their profiles so it was easy to find stuff to me i never thought about the back end of it and the hassle that they had.e

** It's not on HPFF, but it's a marauder fic I can't recommend enough.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/la_reine_noire/BAMSR00a.html][Be All My Secrets Remembered by La Reine Noire]]

I rarely read marauder-era fiction because the good ones just end up making me cry, haha. But this was recommended so many times I eventually gave in.

If you don't mind AU's, I also recommend Unbroken Universe by Robin 4. It's a 4-part series, loved it so much I read it 3 times to date. The bromance is strong in this one.

Edit: I linked the /last/ book in the series, instead of the first, my bad. The correct order is: linkffn(4881348) Promises Honored (Prequel) linkffn(1248431) Promises Unbroken linkffn(1567001) Promises Remembered linkffn(2204188) Promises Defended

** I hadn't heard of HPFF before. I quit reading fanfiction in like 2005 and just started again this last spring. I've been reading what people recommend from this sub mostly, since that's already a way to get to some of the best stories out there.

Offhand, I would say one reason that FFN is discussed more is because it has something like 700k Harry Potter stories, whereas looking at HPFF, they have 84k stories. So there are just more chances of having a good story on a site with more stories?

Also on this sub an awesome person invented the fanfiction bot, which is an easy way to link stories from ffn and Ao3 and get epub versions of them, so we tend to use that a lot.
