I'm debating a plotline for DA in regards to keys where they're basically bearer items: the owner is whomever bears it.


** I like the idea where if you have a persons key, you're allowed into the vaults, which are essentially safety deposit boxes. I think goblins see the keys as the owners responsibility so if someone gets your key and takes all your money, it's not the goblins problem.

** I think its a bit too unreliable. The Goblins most likely have a way to figure out if the key you present is really yours or not, pretty much the moment you hand it to them.

*** Except in the fourth book Mrs Weasley was able to get gold out of Harry's vault with just his key.

I'm too lazy to find more quotes this early in a Sunday but I know there were more.
