So write a response centered from Ron's view, where all fanon Hermione's responses are adjusted to fit Ron's tone.

An example: "Muggles have no imagination. They'd be stuck here forever." To parody the wizards have no logic.

Or "We need to start using our wands more. Practice using magic until it becomes second nature." To parody all those bad exercise fics.


** I'd actually love this, I get sick of muggle wank and goddess Hermione fics

** As much as I hate the tropes like martial arts, fitness, and swol!Quidditch players, some of them make good points working out would be good for hogwarts students the same way it is for normal people your physical AND mental heath as well as cardio would probably help in duels. Swol!Quidditch players should be canon 100% tbh like if you look at the dynamics of a broomstick that shits kinda insane. You would need just some fucking massive arms and legs to even hang onto the broom doing any sort of maneuvers. But brooms probably have a charm that reduces forces on the rider or scrawny little 11 year old Harry Potter would be like a splat on the ground of the pitch.

*** Let's not bring physics into magical brooms.

I'll admit keeping healthy is important, but rather than reading a bunch of crap about how it makes them better duelists or improves their magic, just have it as a background activity.
