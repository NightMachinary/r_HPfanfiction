A post war drarry fanfic where they meet up again, relationship and it's so fucking toxic and awful but the pain feels good to read, they move in together, they move to a bad part of muggle London so they can have their unhealthy eating disorder habits together without their friends interfering, draco leaves to recover, he comes back, harry gets better too. I read this once like a year ago and haven't been able to find it since, if anyone knows the name please hmu

  For a moment, she's almost giddy. Because Draco Malfoy's been ruined by this war and he's as out of place as she is and --- yes, he has scars too. He's got an even bigger one. She wonders whether one day they'll compare sizes.
