The experience of reading fanfiction is filtered through a pretty big contextual lens - what you've read before, and when you got into the game can have a pretty huge effect on your perception of a given work.

With that in mind, have you ever revisited a story and done a pretty big reversal on it, in either direction? I'll give two examples:

/Opinion going drastically down/: One of the first fics I read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]. I was simply blown away. The idea that Harry could be in Slytherin had literally never occurred to me. The way it took canon events and cleverly reshaped them seemed fascinating and novel. I couldn't get enough. I think I powered through the first 100K words in, like, one night.

On a whim, I started re-reading it a few days ago, and I just couldn't get through it. The way it kept railroading Harry back onto the canon path was really annoying, and I kept wanting Harry to do something, anything to break the mold. Of course, that's not what the fic is about. There's nothing objectively /wrong/ with canon rehash, and that story is a pretty sterling example of it. But once you've read a few good ones, at least for me, the bloom comes off the rose pretty quickly.

/Opinion going drastically up/: I was annoyed with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] when I started reading it. The first few chapters were compelling and nicely paced, but the author seemed to really fixate on angst, just hammering down his protagonists with misery right at the beginning. I felt it was only hitting one note, and hitting it inconsistently. I think I stopped midway through chapter 3.

When I picked it back up, months later, and read the whole thing, I realized that the first few chapters make a lot more sense in the context of the greater whole. I thought the writing got better, the characters got more dynamic, and the plot got more interesting. On the whole, it was a case of a writer really finding his/her stride. I went from thinking "meh, this isn't for me," to really respecting what the author was trying to do and really enjoying the story.

What about y'all?


** Opinion going down:

Everything by robst.

I have vivid memories of a holiday park in France. There wasn't much to do, but in the main building there were a few pc's with internet you had to pay for. A few times a day I'd go there and buy 15 minutes of internet. In those 15 minutes I'd open as many pages of a story as I could so I could read for quite a bit longer. There were three things I read this way: Make A Wish, Poison Pen and a fuckload of robst.

I couldn't but feeling awed by him, his characters were great, his stories formulaic but novel, his writing superb. It was also my first experience with HHr, an ingenious new concept for me.

And now I can't help but look back and see a big steaming pile of shit.

** On lowering my opinion: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors never die]], the first time I read it I really liked the idea of old veteran styled Harry and Ron being forced into a time travel situation and not taking shit from anyone. The second read through revealed that the writing didn't really hold up like I thought it had. Harry was more of a whiny little kid that let Dumbledore walk all over him which really annoyed me considering the premise.

On raising my opinion: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]]. If it wasn't for the fact that I was stuck in the middle of traveling without Internet for a few days and nothing but this story to read, I probably would have never finished it. About a year previously I had started the story and ended up dropping it because I just couldn't get into it. It took me at least the first 150k words to finally start enjoying the story and I did end up really liking it.

** Opinion going down: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]]. I think this was the second or third fic I ever read and I loved the Harry and Hermione aspect and how they went together, as well as the time travel, and then the really cool triwizard tournament. The new powers or skills they slowly developed were awesome as well. But then maybe the second and third times I read it the cutesy romance just threw me off and I couldn't handle that aspect. Harry and Hermione's interactions were simply cringeworthy. I couldn't imagine reading this fic at this point.

I can't think of a single fic that my opinion has improved upon but I would say that DarkLordPotter the website fits. At first I stayed away from the site and coudln't handle seeing their harsh criticism and what seemed like almost formulaic requirements but after a while I found quite a few good fics from searching their site. It's good at weeding out the bottom quality fics and the library and almost recommended threads have good fics in them. From there I've gotten and read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]], A[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][pplied Cultural Anthropology]], T[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][he Last Avata]]r, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], which I all like a lot.

** On going down: pretty much anything I read as it rarely meets your initial expectations. I think it is similar to the honeymoon rationale after a wedding where everything is splendid. Then a few eeks later you wake up.

On going up: the mad scientist of azkaban had me turned away initially, but the night after Halloween, I gave it another read, and it was indeed great.

Time Mr potter, was also another one I left as I couldn't stand the though of Ron existing after all of the Ron bashing that I recently read. Never fear though, the author eventually bashes Ron.

In all honesty, I have yet to revisit my favorites such as a stranger in unholy land, a year like none other, Harry potter thingy that is violent and a trilogy containing deamons... You know which I mean I just can't recall. I never revisited them because either they were abandoned or I never had the urge to return.

The beauty of fan fiction is that there is an almost infinite amount to choose from, why reread a story when you can get a fresh new one?

** /Opinion going drastically down/: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][Partially Kissed Hero]]. One of the first /long/ stories I've read, I thought it was genius at the time. In my defense I was also like 16. I still like it, because it's quirky and nostalgic, but no longer do I harbor delusions that it's a well-written story.

/Opinion going drastically up/: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]]. fem!Harry and Snape was too weird for me... or so I thought. Actually I've done a general turn-around in most Snape's pedophilic relationships. No idea why, but it's working for me right now and there's a lot of good stories of the genre, so I'm not complaining.

As a bonus, Slytherin-nette once had a story called An Alternate Adventure: The Goblet of Fire or something, and I really liked it. But as with all Slytherin-nette's stories, it was pretty trashy. Slytherin!Harry and Hermione is just too good, though. Any other stories like that?

**** I'm afraid not. The author states that she lost the original copy when she deleted it, and I doubt that statement would be still up there if someone found it for her.

Sad thing is, I had it saved on my old HDD. But that's long gone now.

*** I too, surprisingly, enjoyed Never-ending Road so just a small point - if 'Snape's pedophilic relationships' turns anyone off IMO that isn't this story.

I am a handful of chapters behind but the author has played it slow and I think it might be 4th year now and femHarry is only just sort of realizing her type of man is not a good guy pretty boy like Cedric (and may in fact be 'interesting' and older and /gasp/ Snape of all people). So I could be wrong but I am pretty sure they aren't going to recognize/show any feelings for one another until 5th year. For actually going the full distance I wouldn't expect it until she is at least late 16-17(adult witch).

** "Written In The Body". I loved it the first time around (about 18 months ago or so?), but I tried rereading it recently, and I couldn't make it past the first couple chapters because it was so poorly written.
