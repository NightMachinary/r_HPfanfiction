I just wish for a few answers to my questions, first how powerful is he in relation to the other characters in the story, second what, if any, is his progression in power like can he take snape by the beginning of fifth or albus or riddle, lastly, and most important how good is the character development, and who is the main focus on.

** My impression is that it was a good story when it was written, but for those of us who have read many fanfics, some of its tropes do get old. One thing I strongly dislike is that overused portkey abduction scheme.

This series is finished. Although its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4924075/1/Free-Life][Free Life]] is abandoned, GHL finished the rest as [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][Prevailing Counterpoint]] on SIYE.

** Looong time since I read it, but I think Voldemort still curb stomped Harry in the end. It was one of the few redeeming aspects of the story.

**** ...evidently not.

I take my previous comment back. There are no redeeming aspects to this fic.

** Lets see. Manipulating Dumbledore. Richer than God HP (and the manadatory shopping trip). Kinda old hat. Kind of annoying.

** From what I remember my issue with the fic, along with similar redo fics, was that making Harry so awesome just made the story boring and without any conflict. I get the desire to give Harry more autonomy and be more proactive. But there was simply no real growth for the character and everything seemed too easy, from thwarting his enemies to one-upping Dumbledore to getting with Ginny. The whole thing just bored me.
