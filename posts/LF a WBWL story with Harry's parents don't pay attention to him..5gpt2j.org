Basically I want his parent to ignore him but not intentionally. It would be nice if he and his brother have a good relationship growing up but at Hogwarts they get split up (Harry to any house but Gryffindor and his brother to Gryffindor) and that causes their relationship to strain or anything similar to that.


** Im sure youve at least seen it, and It doesn't tick all your boxes but this is easily the best WBWL at the moment. linkffn(11574569)

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(2580283) fits that pretty well. Harry's parents don't exactly /ignore/ him (well, Lily doesn't but James kind of does), but he definitely plays second fiddle to his brother. They get along fine until Harry isn't sorted into Gryffindor with his brother, etc. etc.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  COMPLETED Harry Potter enters his 7th year at Hogwarts ignored and friendless because his brother Daniel is the Boy Who Lived. *** Badass Horcruxes. *** Read the author note on profile before you start. Thanks!

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
