I have thought this idea to be interesting, though I know there are fanfics that probably will have the exact premise; there are probably more than a million hp fanfics after all.

Anyway, what do you think? It would be funny as hell to have Snape reincarnate in Harry's body too ðŸ˜‚


** /Manipulative old goat/, he thought to himself, as the headmaster walked away.

Harry Dumbledore froze in a moment of horrified self-realization. /So this is what it's like./

*** Hahahaha I mean wouldn't it be so ironic, the old goat tasting his own medicine what a nice thing â˜ºðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

****** I don't know, it's been a few tough years. I'm working on a novel now and that's kinda taking all my energy away from fanfiction. I have an outline for the story to the very end, and it was supposed to be some 120k words.... Actually, after seeing this I went back and read some of the reviews and wow, people actually quite liked it. Maybe I'll reread it an manage to get back into it... thank you either way!

** There's a story where Dumbledore's Afterlife is to be reincarnated as Harry Potter starting at when he was left on the doorstep. A sort of karmic retribution for the shit he put Harry through.

Can't remember the name, but it's also is just mentioned in the epilogue.
