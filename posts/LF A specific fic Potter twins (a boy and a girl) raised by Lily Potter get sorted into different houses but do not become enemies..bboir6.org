I read this about a month ago and I can't find it.

What I remember. Instead of just Harry, Lily and James had twins - a boy and a girl. They were raised by Lily ( I don't remember if James was alive or not) and a bit isolated before coming to Hogwarts. I think Lily was trying to curb Dumbledore's influence over them.

They made it into different houses. One of them was sorted into Slytherin but the family was fine with it and I think it was Harry (or however the male twin was named). I don't remember where the other twin was sorted but it could have been Gryffindor and she could have become friends with Hermione Granger possibly?

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
