** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise) is pretty AU (the only fic I've ever read with a deatheater!James), but it's basically what you're asking for. It's also one of the few full-life AU fics I've seen that are actually complete.

Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
