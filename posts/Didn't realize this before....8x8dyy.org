So I hadn't read the full Harry Potter books in YEARS! However, I'm listening to the Jim Dale Audiobooks and I'm on book five. I knew I hated Umbridge, but I didn't realize how much I utterly despise her character! She is worse than Snape, Hell, I sometimes find myself hating her more than Voldemort! Jesus Christ almighty Jo did such a magnificent job creating a detestable character!

edit...

Sorry I just had to vent. I found myself gripping my power tools way too hard while at work when I was at the detention scene.


** It's more relatable. You're far more likely to come across someone like her in real life than you are a genocidal maniac. Well, at least one who actually has power. You probably already have. I know I've come across an Umbridge.

** I dislike Umbridge enough that I actually find it hard to reread that book. It's just like, why the fuck won't anyone do anything about the situation? It's frustrating to read.

** That's cause JKR based her off of someone she hated in real life. Umbridge has no redeemable qualities or positive sides.

** Yeah an interesting thing from the annual surveys shows that Umbridge is by far the most commonly least favourite character despite Voldemort being far more destructive and various other characters being much more stereotypically evil. Maybe it's just that people have encountered that sort of malicious behaviour from authority figures which they've felt powerless to do anything against, whereas relatively few can relate to the whole murdered parents and war-torn society thingy.

*** I'd argue against many others being more evil, Umbridge ran the muggleborn registration and oversaw the trials and facilities. Even without being a death eater who knows how many people she had killed or traumatized for life with her sham trials. It always made me really mad that there was no real resolution there in the books.

** Dolores Umbridge is the Joffrey "Baratheon" of Harry Potter. You simply can not like her. There is absolutely no info given about her that anyone could relate to in a way that would make him or her like them. Her character is completely polished to shine as unlikeable as possible.
