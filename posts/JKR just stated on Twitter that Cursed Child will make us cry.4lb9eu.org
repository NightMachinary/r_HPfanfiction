I think at least one of the main four characters will die.

My worst case scenario: Al kills Harry, Ginny kills Al, before killing herself and joining Harry in afterlife.

Hermione uses the Stone for one final time, and sees Harry and Ginny waiting for them at the station.

What is your take on that?

*** I agree. I'm fine with spin-offs like Fantastic Beasts, but I really wish Harry's story could just end with the 7th book. Some things are better left to the imagination.

*** You're not alone.

I don't care about the crappy epilogue, let alone anything released after it like the inconsistent Pottermore stuff, the prequel movies, or this play.

*** Yeah, I don't really care about plays to begin with...and tbh I feel like this is a way to either make more money or just to keep the series fresh in people's mind.

I love the original 7 Harry Potter series, but I think it is time for things to just...stop. The series has ended...don't keep milking it. Spin offs (like Fantastic Beasts) are fine.

I agree. I've been living in the world of fanfiction for so long that this just doesn't matter to me.

*** I have my own head canon, but what I consider to be HP canon is the books and the spinoffs. Not Pottermore, or any Twitter related messages. I get what you're saying, fan fiction is probably the main reason why I'm still crazy about this fandom. The epilogue was fine, but I wish it could be more vague (nameless spouses of HHrR, but still have the part with Albus Severus).

*** Considering how godawful the last two books were, I'm dreading the release of this thing. I can't believe she actually looked at the epilogue and felt that it was an appropriate ending to the series, so I can't bring myself to be excited over something else she's written recently. I mean, if it's bad, people probably won't even notice over the sound of fandom hype, so what's the use? I don't care, but I'm also not super keen on the next-gen stuff either, so I guess I'll just have to spew bile over you guys instead.

Fanfiction is more interesting now, anyway, and dares to do things that JKR couldn't/wouldn't write herself. This isn't necessarily a good thing (because some 'daring' fanfic ideas are awful too), but it's an interesting thing... way more interesting than canon managed to be, in the end.

** I fevently pray that the emotional heart of this addition to cannon won't involve any old characters. To me it would be a cheap ploy unworthy of the fans. If it does make us cry i want it to be for new characters who just happen to be in the HP universe. It could also be happy tears!

** Do you really think Al will turn out evil? It doesn't sound like Rowling's style to make Harry's kid bad. He will probably have some issues though.

What would be really hilarious is if she made him a Slytherin and also evil just to continue our beloved stereotype.

** I don't think a main character has to die for people to cry over the story. Pop culture these days has tears synonymous with death (I'm looking at you, Game of Thrones). Personally, I think Al is going to get into some serious trouble/kidnapped/threat to life...and Harry is just going to lose it. Like, he's supposed to be this big tough hero, and he crumbles over it and has to rely on Ron and Hermione to help him save his son. I would cry ugly tears over Harry's plight. Think Mr. Incredible's "I'm not strong enough!" speech in the Incredibles. Hell, just imagining Harry embracing his son and crying "I thought I lost you!" makes me teary-eyed right now. I think Jo is going to tap into that family theme.

But then again, I feel irrationally protective over James, Al, and Lily. Also, hell, if Harry cried over spilt milk, I'd probably sympathetically cry with him.

Here's some more reasons why I'm still skeptical:

A) It would really piss off the fandom.

B) It closes doors to future stories - something she is OBVIOUSLY open to continuing.

C) We don't know the plot yet, but Jo seems to have evolved past the point of killing a character just for the sake of killing a character.

Her follow up tweet was something along the lines of "It's my job as a writer to make you feel emotions."

*** I think people think someone is going to die because JKR's approach to attempting angst in HP canon was almost entirely ham-handed death scenes for side characters. They've linked 'SAD -> Death' when it comes to the Potterverse because this is a demonstrable and obvious theme in Jo's writing.

Imagine JKR pelted with rotten eggs and tomatoes after the opening night.

** What if JKR pulls something completely out of left field?

We find out that Harry actually did pass on at Kings Cross, and that the epilogue was completely fake.

It's terrible and it completely ruins Harry Potter for me, but I would probably see it.
