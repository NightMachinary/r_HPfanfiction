I flaired this as request because I want ff recommendations.

Basically, I'm a fan of darkfics (please don't judge me; I like darkfics because they help me get through my own traumas) and I've been trying to look for good Draco darkfics but it feels like there's just so many that I'm overwhelmed. Could you rec me some?

Conditions: Can't be ooc

Thanks!!!


** Define dark. Psychological thrillers and horrors? Just violence? Rape? Classic Torture? Things authors call dark but are really off white?

** Breath Mints and Battle Scars is a pretty famous angsty Draco one.. So you've probably heard of it ðŸ˜‚ Other than that, idk.. I love dark Draco too. I live my depressive side through him..
