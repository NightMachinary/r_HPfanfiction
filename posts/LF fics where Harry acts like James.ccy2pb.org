I'm looking for any fics where Harry James Potter truly is the son of James Potter. He's got the same cockiness/arrogance about him, aces his classes with ease, and charms everyone around him. Maybe he was raised by James and/or Lily, but he doesn't have to be.


** This is one I remember.

  AU. Harry, just another normal Hogwarts student with no evil whatsoever plaguing his life, really likes Hermione Granger, who won't even give him the time of day. How is he going to win her heart? By being a complete tosser, of course. Boys are idiots.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989/chapters/41157146]]) Dumbledore raises Harry. I can't remember if anyone compares Harry to young James, but Harry is pretty similar to the way you described in the summary.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.
