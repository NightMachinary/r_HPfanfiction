** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

Dnd 3.5e wizard is transported to Harry potter universe, 10/10. If you didn't understand any of that, don't worry, practicly everything gets explained that you need to know, unfortunately unfisnishrd, but there's an unnoffocal ending of acceptable quality, albeit falls into the trope of making MC completely OP, and getting rid of flaws that defined the charact, still better than nothing.

Linkffn(Harry potter, squatter) Harry potter/Percy Jackson crossover, mainly focused on Harry relation with greek gods, learning magic and survival skills, and food porn, lots and lots of food porn.

The first part of the story is all HP, but later it becomes mostly KHR, and there are a lot of things that aren't from HP you come across. I kept hoping that I'd start understanding a lot of the background and references, but it never came together for me.

Crossover is with Anita Blake. The original novels have a reputation of being poorly written vampire porn (and they are) but they also introduce some neat worldbuilding ideas. This fic is better written than those novels and does a good job actually explaining all of the worldbuilding. Personally, I'm only in that fandom because I've read a few fics that lean heavily on the worldbuilding of the series. When I tried to read the actual books I hated them. This fic works better as an entrance to the fandom than any of the books do.

** Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider; Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis)

Only borrows the vague theme of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones. Raiding ancient tombs, evading traps and discovering treasure. There's an OC called Lara Kraft but her name is more of an easter egg. The first one is focused on Petunia's adventures in Egypt while the Trio is at Hogwarts, the sequel is focused on Harry, Ron, Hermione traveling around the world hunting for traces of ancient Atlantis. Set in the same worldbuilding as the rest of the Starfox5-verse, so Jamaican zombies and the magical Ottoman empire make a comeback.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** linkffn(The Traveler in Black Meets Harry Potter by meteoricshipyards). One-shot, and it explains enough of the background that you don't need more.

linkffn(Big Trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards). Another one-shot, crossed with Big Trouble in Little China and Magician Out Of Manchuria.

  A crossover between John Brunner's The Traveler in Black and Harry Potter. What happens when a being with many names, but only one nature, encounters the chaos that is the Wizarding world? For some, tragedy, for others....

** Snakeskins by Sunruner Linkffn(9659426) Harry Potter x Hetalia crossover. No Hetalia knowledge required but does require the reader to wrap their head around personified nations, luckily you'll only get to know 2 in depth and the rest are Hp cast (albeit next-gen).

Plot Summary: Two Italian sibling students are killed in Hogwarts, suspected as a suicide. An investigation occurs in Hogwarts to investigate the deaths of these children's. Shockingly, the school doesn't seem to care. Why? They're Slytherin students. Post-war, Slytherin has a broken rep with diminishing numbers due to bullying from the other 3 houses. (Role reverse) Our duo protagonist, Italy and England, are tasked to go under cover as children to figure out the mystery to their deaths or forever close down Hogwarts school for good. (Best part - they keep the charade going the whole fic)

It's set in Next-Gen Hogwarts but incorporates so much Hp book lore with the complexity of personified Nations. Like Hp books this fic gets darker over time with dead paintings, accidental splinches and hauntings. But it also explores world building of Wizarding Italy, lives of OG hp characters as adults, and a teacher you'll hate more than Umbridge. It is absolutely addicting.

I challenge you to read up to ch 7: “The Sorting Hat” to decide if you would like to continue or not. I liked writing this post :D

  Pottertalia. Twenty years after the end of the Second Wizarding War, tragedy at the world's safest school prompts a clash between two Magical Ministries and an inquiry of a different kind. If the students and staff of Hogwarts School can't earn back the world's trust, then one Nation may do what the Dark Lord could not and close its doors forever. Long-term fic. Hiatus.

** Only a Boy by Riddell Lee linkffn(8016336) Hp and Merlin (TV series) crossover. Doesn't require knowledge of Merlin tv show.

Plot Summary: In an AU world where Harry Potter doesn't exist Merlin is sent to the future after fulfilling his role in helping King Arthur restore magic. There he attends Hogwarts as Merlin Evans, and is given a lot of crap for his name, and basically Merlin fulfils the role as the Boy-Who-Lived without the Dumbledore meddling. Featuring awesome Twins, good (fatherly) Snape and has amazing writing!
