So I was just doing some reading, and realised that while a basilisk is afraid of roosters, a cockatrice is a serpent-y monster who /also/ happens to petrify people, and apparently their weakness is a /weasel/

That...has some potential. Seeing as the cockatrice is apparently incubated similarly to a basilisk (‘A cockatrice resembles a large rooster with a lizard-like tail. It was born from an egg laid by a cock and incubated by a toad or snake'), it seems possible Slytherin's monster could also be one, and if someone was writing Ron or another Weasley as a more heroic figure it could be really fun.

Or alternatively, imagine if Tom brings Ginny down to visit...+ok that's a /horrible/ innuendo waiting to happen+...but anyway, he brings a Weasley into the lair and the animal dies or freaks out or something, like are you trying to /kill me/? You leave me alone for years and then you bring me a /Weasley/?!

At least I think this info is from the monster manual, I was reading it [[https://worldsofimagination.co.uk/monster%20cockarice.htm][here]]


** Alternatively, it would also be hilarious if Draco somehow saves the day by getting turned into a weasel in 2nd year instead of a ferret in 4th year

** This reminds me of the plot line in Teen Wolf where the idea of silver killing werewolves was a mistranslation arising from the fact that the Argent family are werewolf hunters. Are you saying that something similar happens in HP where the Weasley family are actually historic cockatrice hunters/naturally deadly to cockatrices and the idea that /weasels/ kill a cockatrice is a mistranslation?

*** That wasn't what I was saying but that's a fucking cool idea. They're broke because dark lords stopped making basilisks and cockatrices so they're out of work lmao. Charlie's a total rebel because works with dragons and lmao /he's actually trying to keep the dragons he works with alive/

*** The cockatrice's nails clacked against the flagstones as it prowled the corridor just ahead. Ron halted in his tracks and glanced back at Harry and Hermione.

"This is a bad idea," he said, swallowing.

"We've been over this, mate," Harry said. "Just go hunt it down, and we'll still make it on time to dinner."

"Hunt it down /how/?" A hysterical note entered Ron's voice. "It's five times my size and has deadly poison!"

Harry rolled his eyes. "What do I know? You're the Weasley."

"It will come to you, I'm sure," Hermione said. "All the books agree that hunting cockatrices is in your blood."

Ron just shook his head and backtracked, pale-faced. The horrible clacking drew ever closer. Exchanging a nod, Harry and Hermione shoved him out into the open.

** I believe in mythology that's correct. Weasels eat basiliks and are immune to its poison. But mythology also depicts basiliks as small snakes which makes them even deadlier because you could just stare at a patch of grass and die. However it would be cool if you had a Chuck Norris joke: the basilisk bit Ron/Ginny and after hours of agonizing pain, the basilisk died.

*** Or like a honey badger she goes down but then all the sudden she's back up and trying to bite it's head off it's like ‘this isn't how this is supposed to go!'

*** One theory was that it was stories of snakes an mongooses (mongeese?) that got restated in terms of European animals. Basilisks are also lizards in some versions and I am pretty sure the stories of basilisks/cockatrices got mixed up multiple times throughout history.

** I vaguely remember reading something where a cockatrice was the juvenile form of a basilisk (essentially a tadpole/frog thing), that might be interesting to explore. (also its just a funny concept, having the one thing that can kill you look very much like yourself as a child)

*** That's interesting, so they go through some kind of metamorphosis?

I'm just imaging this super creepy cockatrice cocoon now, which frankly is the stuff of nightmares.

** The one I remember (but I don't remember which fic) had an anecdote about the world's only successful cockatrice breeding. It fought it's way free from the egg, murdered its parent, and then promptly committed accidental suicide when the rooster half'fs cry turned out to be fatal to the basilisk half. I damn near killed myself laughing at that.
