** [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sentient%20Hogwarts/works][Here's]] fics with a sentient Hogwarts on AO3. I know I've found examples of the Harry/Hogwarts pairing in the past, but honestly they are rarely any good so I don't have any of them saved. Another search term you can use is "Lady Hogwarts" as that seems to result in pairings as well, although there will be some cases where Hogwarts' feelings run more along the lines of maternal affection.

** Does it need to be a romantic pairing? Does it need to be an actual pairing or just a partnership?

Ive read quite a few stories that have a sentient Hogwarts or one that develops anyway, but only 1 or 2 that have a physical manifestation of Hogwarts and neither were romantic.
