Whether he got that power in the story, or he's already powerful somehow. One of my personal favorites is “Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is” by Tsume Yuki, and he gained that power after living countless lives as the MoD.

What's your favorite?

** *That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
It's a mixer of OPness AND Potter luck. He's a MOD that's almost godlike. He can outduel practically anyone. People fall over themselves to do what he asks both politically and socially.

Then you throw in this universe's version of him: Ivy Potter. She is OP too. Putting aside the fact that she absorbs magical knowledge to the point that she makes Hermione look bad, she has this charisma that gets everybody to do what she wants.

Warning: This fic was actually quite semi-serious, and then slowly turned into crack.

I'm honestly a bit surprised the war ends in fourth year. Most authors I've seen typically make Harry hold the idiot ball even if he knows the ambush is coming so that Voldemort still gets his body back, as if that's a better scenario than researching ways to capture and exorcise a malicious spirit. This particularly pisses me off in time travel stories. The only one that did it right in my opinion was Wind Shear.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

** 1) October The_Carnivorous_Muffin

Summary:

It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321]]

2) When Harry Met Tom The_Carnivorous_Muffin

Summary:

When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

3) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus The_Carnivorous_Muffin Summary: As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

4) Jonquils and Lightning Lomonaaeren

Summary:

Harry Potter found peace after the war in another world where a large number of Potters live. He makes his living as an animal healer in Godric's Hollow, surrounded by family and away from all wars. But his peace shatters with the arrival of a Tom Riddle from another dimension, who seeks a Potter who can be his foretold weapon in his own war. Slash

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14178429/chapters/32682234]]

5) His Twenty-Eighth Life Lomonaaeren

Summary:

Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
