"What were Harry Potter's parents like?"

The university professor challenged his students with this question. "Were Harry Potter's parents good people?"

A student eagerly replied, "Yes, they were!"

"Were they great wizards?" The professor asked.

"Yes sir", the student replied.

The professor answered, "Harry Potter's parents were the most best wizards ever and they got murdered, but Harry Potter survived and he is really cool."

Another student raised her hand and said, "That's not right, professor."

"What?!" exclaimed the professor.

The student stood up and asked, "Professor, Harry Potter is not cool and his parents were really bad."

"What kind of talk is this? How dare you! Why do you say this?" The students snickered.

The student replied, "In fact sir, they went and got themselves killed in a car crash, you nasty little liar."

The professor simply responded with, "Well um... I, uh..."

The student continued, "Harry Potter's father was a drunk and an unemployed wastrel"

Visibly uncomfortable, the professor responded, "Well... but... his mum was ok though!"

To this the student replied, "No, his mother was a bitch."

The professor sat down, pale and shaking. After a short silence, he looked up at the student and then ran out of the lecture hall, barely able to conceal his tears.

The student's name? Aunt Marge

** i didnt get the context at the beginning so i thought it was some kind of Harry pre-letter parroting what the Dursleys said to him or something. and then the professor would discover that it was him. Oops
