Imagine a fanfiction where every problem in various books is solved by some magical accident.

Example : Someone tripped and spilled a cure for boils potion on Quirrel , and the potion classified Voldy-Parasite as a boil.


** I think the lazy Hufflepuff story is kind of like that, where Harry lives through Hogwarts largely by accident.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
