...because of suicide, but the fight continues and people realize that Dumbledore is not a god (hell, at best: Dumbledore himself finally takes off the kid gloves, treats this fight like a real war (and no some mix of a social engineering experiment and a game of (political) chess) and cleaves through the deatheater ranks like death's scythe!) and that the world (including Hogwarts!) needs to change! Like stamping out bullying (Draco and Snape especially!) etc.

I'd also like the people involved to realize that they are partially at fault for Harry killing himself - and I would love it if they also took of the kid gloves (seriously: Redeeming terrorists? Nope, the only good terrorist is one that is cold and dead!)

As always: Please no slash!


** Well, I dunno what you mean by 'taking off the kid gloves', unless you mean Dumbledore going after acquitted Death Eaters and everyone else with a Dark Mark, Imperius-Curse or not, instead of waiting to catch them in the act or otherwise get evidence proving them guilty of specific crimes.

I do have one 'Harry commits suicide' story I know of, a one-shot in this collection: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10383313/14/From-the-Mind-of-Dunuelos-Plot-Bunnies]]

*** Not bad, but sadly it doesn't show anything happening after Harry takes his own life (ok: McGonagall shouts at Snape, but that is one sentence! Dumbledore isn't even mentioned etc.)

Acquitted my ass! Bribing your way out of jail (note: Shouldn't have been sent to jail in the first place! Treason is a death sentences IMHO and attempting a coup is treason by default!) doesn't make you innocent!

As for what I mean:

- Yeah, killing the DEs before they can bring Voldemort back is one option, but sadly Dumbledore doesn't make for a great assassin (unless he's forced into it!)

- The other option is killing them while fighting (Harry's suicide would derail everything, so no ministry fight but I bet there would be attacks on Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, the ministry, Hogwarts etc. and there the good guys would have the chance to do more than stun deatheaters - especially since Voldemort himself seldom seems to accompany his DEs (thus Dumbledore can kill them by the boat load, he is the better fighter!))

*** That was pretty alright, I wish it had showed more of people's reactions though
