I've read one where at the very end, Draco gives a speech to all his friends, thanking them for protecting him from his father who abandons him. Later on the professors all look to Harry, Hermione, Ron and Draco and say that "those four have a very special friendship". Does anyone know where I can read this fanfiction please? It would mean a lot!


** Linkffn(Impose) is one in a series, I can't remember the ones that were before this one but if you look at the author page you'll find his/her other stories

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

*** Isn't that one a story where Draco has a twin brother who's a Slytherin through and through (but doesn't that pretty much spoils the entire point of having a Gryffindor!Draco in the first place)?

**** Irish twin, less than twelve months older. Pretty sure it was eight months difference, because she induced Draco early to avoid the troubles Hydrus had - she nearly lost him. I find it quite odd she'd get pregnant so soon after a traumatic birth, and with a sickly baby, but I suppose magic would have healed her easily.

** If you don't mind Peggy Sue fics, this one is pretty good--though unfinished, and admittedly a little Tumblr-y.

  Through a dark ritual, Draco Malfoy is sent back in time, from his seventeenth year to his eleventh. Now he has the chance to use his superior knowledge and skill to change everything and save all his friends and family, but there's a terrible complication: it turns out that not even time travel can cure a case of lycanthropy.
