*** That is a long read and I'm barely a quarter way through it. But what I read does bring up some great points.

I think the reason I like reading and writing Dumbledore/Weasley bashing fics is because of the plotholes and inconsistencies they bring up and turn into storylines. They're really fun if you don't take it too seriously. For example, I usually write these because I like to parody inconsistencies.

*** I can't imagine the time and effort it would've taken to write all that. Some of the points, like the extra missing day with Harry on the doorstep were admitted by JKR to be mistakes. I think his/her Favorites List is hilarious, but after the long essay I kinda was expecting something different.
