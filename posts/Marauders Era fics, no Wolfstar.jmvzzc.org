So, I recently read quite some of Pengiwen's Marauders series on Wattpad, but I got annoyed with the all-consuming Wolfstar. I like Marauders-Era fics though, and am looking to read more. Any recommendations?


** I know a short film that takes place RIGHT AFTER the Mauraders graduate. It's called Severus Snape and the Mauraders. It might not be what you're looking for, but I think it's really cool.

**** When Professor Snape was a first year, he knew more curses than the 7th years. He created his own powerful spells like Sectumsempra. I don't think we ever got to see the full extent of his power in the series, as he had no intentions to hurt Professor in Deathly Hallows. So considering everything he's done, I think that was an accurate representation of his abilities. And he did seem to be struggling during parts of it.

****** He was visibly struggling with it, he may have actually gotten by on pure adrenaline. Besides, they all had their strengths but Professor Snape's proficiency in combat magic is topped by very few. Also, he has quick reflexes which helped out a lot.

********** In the books, it says he was a Seeker, but you can believe everything JK. Rowling says if you want even if it's inconsistent. Both parties managed to block nearly every spell fired so wizards, in general, have fast reflexes I guess. But it was a little insane what Professor Snape did. It's impressive that he managed to block spells from 4 different people. But my point remains.

Severus Snape had extraordinary power ever since he was young. He knew many different combat spells, had even mastered unforgivable curses and had good reflexes when defending himself. This was also demonstrated in Half-Blood Prince when Harry fires curses at him. We have seen a duel between Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall, but he probably didn't try his best as she was secretly an ally to him. Professor McGonagall is a highly talented duelist who did duel Voldemort along with Kingsley Shacklebolt and Horace Slughorn. But he despised the Mauraders wholeheartedly and was even about to kill James Potter. He was also high on adrenaline because the Mauraders were not easy foes.

You're probably right though, I may just be defending him because I fucking hate James Potter.

************ After reading Order of the Phoenix I grew extreme hatred for James Potter for bullying someone just because of their house. And his little "prank" on Severus could've not only killed him but ruined his friend's future for any sort of a normal life. What the hell did James do that made him so appealing to Lily? He bullied her friends and was just a pretentious jerk. The kid ruffled his hair to make it look like he was playing Quidditch and even stole the snitch from the previous game. I can acknowledge his heroic actions but I still hate him. But we all have something kind to say about everyone.

************* he bullied snape. someone who hung out with Jnr death eaters and constantly used slurs.

James had no part in sirius prank, and once he knew ran to stop it.

he was also a dumb teenager who grow into a heroic man who joined the fight against wizard hitler even though he was not one of the targets of wizard hitler

snape joined wizard hitler willingly and was a loyal little nazi till his crush got targeted

** Okay I don't want to shamelessly plug my own fics but all my fics are Marauders era and aren't Wolfstar so they are definitely what you're looking for.
