:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello. I know this is something of an odd request, but hear me out.

I remember reading a fic which would occasionally remind you that it may be 4 a.m., you should really go to sleep and this point in the story would be a good one to end the reading session on. Does anyone know its name?

I am afraid that this is pretty much all the characterisation I can give you. It might have been Haphne? It was probably at least decent and fairly long? Does anyone have a tip which fic it could be?

Thanks for your help. Also a reminder to go to sleep if it's 4 a.m. where you are and you are browsing reddit.


** That's hilarious. Also, probably, quite necessary.

*** He just moved to updating twice a week from 3 times a week and I want to cry. New Blood has gotten me through the past few months, knowing an update would come like clockwork.

*** That's most likely it! Thanks a lot. I think I stopped reading it when I reached the end of the part complete at the time.

** One I read - I think the secret language of plants series? - had that and I thought it was very cool but it probably isn't the one you're looking for as it didn't mention 4am

** I've read one that did that, and I laughed as I read it in the notes. Then totally kept reading. But I swear the one I'm thinking of was Drarry so it probably wasn't the same one.

** Idk the fic but if you need sleep reminders I use moon reader on my phpne and download everything because authors will delete with no warning. The app has a sleep reminder feature, it's free and adjustable
