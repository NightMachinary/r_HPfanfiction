** I'm getting a real kick out of her other "story", [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3659740/1/In_a_Nutshell][In a Nutshell]], which parodies most Marauder fanfics. Seems pretty spot on.

** Note - it's incomplete, 34 chapters long, and my housemates literally didn't see me for two weeks after I discovered it

Dying for more updates to the story

** It takes A LONG time for her to update. I love this fanfic though, I haven't read anything else because I know it won't match this story

** This is a great fic. I love Marauder stories, and this is one of only two that I'd seriously recommend. It's mostly a James-Lily ship, and Sirius is a main character along with most of the other Gryffindors of their year. Remus and Peter are not as involved as I'd like, but with as many main characters as the story contains, this fic really gives a rounded-out view of their life at Hogwarts. But most of all, this author has the best characterization of both James and Lily that I've ever read, and it seems the closest to what JKR has revealed about them both.

** Never found fan fiction this well-written before! I enjoy it. Seems to reach right into your chest, grab your heart, and /make/ you feel empathy for them.

** I think this is beautifully written. I haven't read a lot of fan fiction,but this seems to set the bar pretty high and I'm still only in chapter 1...
