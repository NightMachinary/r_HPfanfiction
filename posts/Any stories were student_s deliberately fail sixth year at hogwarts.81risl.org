After graduating hogwarts apart from becoming a teacher there doesn't seem to be any way to access the hogwarts library which is said to be the second best library in the wizarding world.

So are there any story were a student realises this and then looks up how many times they can repeat a year at Hogwarts only to find that there is no limit. So they just never turn up to the sixth year exams so they constantly fail and just go and study in the library forever ?

Being a hogwarts student seems to be a pretty good life you get free food and board and access to the hogwarts library so why would you ever want to graduate?

One of the reasons I though of this is that the seven years of schooling seems like a modern thing. when hogwarts first started over 1000 years ago you could probably stay a student there for as long as you wanted to.


** I just realized that JKR said that Hogwarts has no tuition because the Ministry subsidizes all costs. That's quite amazing.

*** And I took state-funded education for granted for all my life. From primary school to my (still work in progress) Master's degree, I've never paid a single Euro in tuition fees. The surprise that many people express about this concept always reminds me how lucky and privileged I am.

***** They're rare. Even though studying is free, daily life in a German city is not exactly cheap. So most people prefer to find themselves a full-time job once they're done with studying.

*** Yep and I doubt they would ever be able to stop doing it because the main purpose of the ministry at its very core is to hide magic from muggles and haveing all magicals trained in how to control there magic is a very important part of that.

** Brilliant idea --- may I borrow it for a story? Although I think that after five years or so, unless Dumbledore tacitly endorsed the project, he'd create a new rule that set a limit. Or maybe he'd forcibly graduate the student /honoris causa/ from their awesome work in the library, and subsequently kick them out.

*** Feel free to use it.

And I was more thinking of it as unchangeable rule that the founders made that a student could study at hogwarts for as long as they want as long as they helped defend the school during times of crisis.

They probably also added a magical enforced rule that all magical children were allowed an education at hogwarts after the fight with slytherin over muggles borns.

Once the person had been there long enough I think it likely that Dumbeldore would offer them a job as the head of there hogwarts house.

*** linkffn(Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense) the Traveler has the "Masters Library" built for use by those seeking Masteries and who require potentially forbidden texts in their profession, like healers or curse-breakers.
