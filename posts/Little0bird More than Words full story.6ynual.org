Does anybody know where I can find the rest of More than Words by Little0bird? I've only been able to read up to chapter 14.

Thanks.


** I don't think she finished it. What's on fanfiction.net is all she's posted, as far as I know. Which is a real shame. Little0bird is guilty of engaging in my absolute biggest pet peeve, which is not finishing stories within a universe yet writing sequels within that same universe. Clearly, she is still writing so it's not just a matter of her not having any time. Finish your stories!!

**** No problem. I'm disappointed too as she is one of my favorite authors and More Than Words explored a topic few other stories have touched on, yet would be 100% in canon with Ginny after the war.
