It's one of the less common pairings but not so uncommon that there's almost no stories for it, and I haven't actually heard of an outstanding Harry/Luna before so I thought I'd come here to ask.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** I'm a Harry/Luna fan, so here's a few. Most are one-shots or short stories, but they're quite nice.

Seconding Contemplating Clouds.

linkffn(Innocence and Roses) isn't a romance pairing really, but it's still lots of fun.

linkffn(7385711) short and bittersweet.

linkffn(6862426) decent length, quite cute post-Hogwarts story with cool quidditch.

linkffn(3576036) another sappy oneshot

linkffn(1991624) more sap

linkffn(3077131) Mystery/drama is definitely the right category for this one.
