** -*The 'gotta catch 'em all' model of polyamorous relationships*: Seriously, H/Multi is a cancerous mass of terrible in every case I've seen it used. If someone is actually attempting a serious poly romance (with any characters, not just Harry), rather than this dreck, please link me before I bite off my own tongue out of sheer frustration.

-*Bashing*. It is godawful, and if you do it consciously, you should be ashamed of yourself.

-*Soul bonds* are, generally speaking, a cheap cop-out to avoid having to write an actual romance fic where there are setbacks, and conflict, and general weirdness due to the characters being uniquely flawed people. Seriously, if you're going to write an improbable pairing (Bellamione springs to mind), at least have the genitalia to attempt to /write/ it, with all of its unhealthiness and idiosyncrasies intact, rather than this... thing masquerading as 'love', but reads more like codependency in many cases. I could not stomach Twin Dragon Heartstrings because it was basically this trope.

-*Magical Cores*: In principle I don't have so much of a problem with these, because having /some/ magic system is better than the big fat nothing we got out of canon. Seriously, in canon, magic works because it does, because it does. Point that stick, fool. But generally magical cores are used to justify DBZ style stupidity where some people just intrinsically have a higher power level than you, and there's really nothing you can do about that. Usually a cheap plot device to get people to #gasp at Harry's power and worship him like some sort of bratty god.

-*Adoption plots*: I could see this being done well, but I haven't actually seen it done well /yet/, if that makes any sense. Usually used to set up really cheap and unconvincing angst in which Harry finds out he's the butt-baby son of Voldemort and Grindelwald or some other poorly-conceived tripe. Very rarely used to any worthwhile effect, imo.

-*Power-up Rituals/'releasing magical blocks'/Easy wandless magic*: Yeah, this is some DBZ bullshit right here. Unless there is serious and prolonged conflict involved, and the effects are more interesting than 'moar powah', this comes across as handing a character power on a silver platter. Can seriously undermine your setting, as you end up wondering why every wizard/witch ever isn't travelling the stars as some sort of shirtless demigod of all things magic, Highlander style. (Btw, I would totally read that, just saying.)

-*Creaturefic*: I don't mean 'Lavender Brown was bitten by Greyback' sort of fics. I mean 'Harry Potter is secretly an X and this is used as an excuse for poorly conceived slash'. Most of the time it's used in the same way a soul bond is, in order to remove obstacles from a relationship, and can come across as very rapey due to creature urges not really counting as consent. Only worthwhile when it's portrayed in an unhealthy light, because if such a thing were real, it would be a /horrifying/ experience for a rational person.

**** It's not really a coherent system by itself, because without there being more to it, there's no reason why 'Kill that rat' (Avada Kedavra) should be more tiring than 'Lift this heavy thing' (Wingardium Leviosa). They're both reasonably trivial in those circumstances, and there's no real rhyme or reason beyond 'plot' why one should be more difficult than the other. And if one /is/, then you need to be able to explain why. Otherwise how tiring something is will generally have a direct correlation to how important it is to the current plot. So 'Teleport to Mars' will always return a result of 'too tiring', or maybe 'syntax error' under this system, because it would wreck the author's plot.

TL;DR I have no problem with it as a concept, but I've seen far too many fics that just use the current Potterverse 'lol point stick' magic model and just tacked on 'lol, naptime' as a side effect of said stick pointing.

****** That's how it was implied to work in canon, yes, but magical exhaustion isn't canonical, and isn't intrinsically linked to the psychological corruption thing. I'm just saying that there needs to be some justification for some spells being more difficult/tiring than others outside of the needs of the plot, using the Killing Curse as an example. If someone is sprinting, we can get a good idea of how fit they are by how far they can sprint, and how quickly. Nobody has any idea what the fuck 'Avada Kedavra' does to one's stamina versus 'Lumos', or 'Wingardium Leviosa'. How tiring is it to turn a desk into a pig? What about a pig into a human? Would it knock McGonagall out if she tried to turn her desk into a functioning copy of the Mariner I probe, or would that return a big fat 'ERROR' message for trying to transfigure a muggle tech object into existence? In both cases... why?

There is no frame of reference to work with beyond (for example) 'I, the author, want killing to be more difficult/tiring than lifting a heavy thing, because reasons', unless you posit a larger system at work. In order for magical strain to be a coherent concept, it needs to be a subsystem for a larger magical theory that dictates /why/ some things are more tiring than others, what constitutes a 'more powerful' spell, and what happens when people attempt something stupid/impossible.

******* What about the magical core being like a muscle? That's how I've always envisioned it. First years start out with simple things like levitating a feather and transfiguring a match into a needle because they aren't strong enough to levitate a desk or transfigured a table to a goat or whatnot.

I'm actually very curious about this because I've been playing around with the idea of a time travel fic (one of my favourite tropes) and I've been wondering how to feel with 20+ years of magical knowledge crammed into an 11year old body. The way I've seen it handled most often is equivalent to having a super-powered child (in comparison to their peers) and I always felt this was a bit of a cop out. If you get thrown into your younger body with extensive martial arts knowledge, you wouldn't instantly be a great fighter. You would still need to retrain your muscles, and adjust to your physical limitations.

******** My main point was that such a system doesn't make much sense by itself. For example, some martial arts moves are more tiring than others, due to the physical forces that govern our world, and depending on your physical fitness, you can predict how much doing something will tire you out. That's not the case with Harry Potter's context-free magic system where there is little rhyme or reason to spell effects, and we have no idea what kind of forces govern what is possible to accomplish with a magical spell. Is it possible to turn a hunk of wood into a functional mobile phone? Can I apparate to the moon? Nobody knows how difficult that is, because there are no laws governing Potterverse magic canonically.

With magic, you might make the very reasonable assumption that the mass of the object you are affecting has some impact on how tiring the resulting spell will be. This idea is not actually part of the whole 'magical cores' concept, but it might lay overtop as one of the laws governing magic. A consequence of deciding that this is a law of magic would be that, transfiguring something into gold is a lot harder than transfiguring it into coal, for example. And levitating a table is, indeed, harder than levitating a feather.

However, that has nothing to do with the concept of magical cores. It's a law that you've decided governs magic (completely reasonably, I might add), that is independent from the 'magical core = muscle' concept, which may also be part of your magic system. The problem is that the 'magic = muscle' clause is that it requires something to govern it, like physical laws do in martial arts, otherwise you end up with what I was talking about above. As in, without some underlying physics to magic, the 'magic core = muscle' thing doesn't make any sense.

If the magic isn't a huge focus of the story, I wouldn't bother, but having some idea of how magic works in a series that is basically 'Magic School: The Learnening' is probably a good idea in any case :P

*********** I find stories flow better when the character's frustrations match my own. I guess it makes it feel more reasonable, if even the students we are following get confused by the magicalness (magicality?) of magic, before they delve deeper into the underlying principles. How do you feel about a magic system where there are a few base tenants (such as 'power is proportional to structure and inversely proportional to versatility' and 'only natural materials may be transfigured'), compared to systems that are strongly structured (all spells are arithmantically described by a set of equations that direct the flow of magic)?

I am quite fond of the 'Magic School: The Learnening' archetype. Any fic suggestions?

************ I don't mind having a few basic tenets to the magic system, provided those give some sort of coherent limit/themes on what the magic can do. Preferably, they cause magic to have some complex interactions (e.g. Inverse law of utility and lethality combined with the idea that spells of the same type can merge, becoming stronger. So if you use large, high power effects, they're bound to be indiscriminate by nature, and spell spam can /lead/ to a large, high power effect manifesting). Otherwise, you've basically got a wand that is made out of 'PlotDevicium', and it can do 'magical stuff'. The only reason canon didn't go crazy stupid in that regard was that it went crazy stupid on the magic artifacts front instead, so wands basically became a very crude tool with a few simple effects rather than a universal plot device. For me, so long as there's some kind of theme to magic, rather than a vague 'it can do stuff when you point stick', I'll probably be okay with it.

As for recommendations... well, obviously there's The Arithmancer, and Applied Cultural Anthropology, which I linked a little further down, but I honestly haven't found too many good ones that I remember in this vein. It's kind of sad, but I think it has to do with the majority of fanfic being about shipping, and these fics we're looking for are often genfic, or light shipping at most. Probably doesn't help that I've mostly been reading SwanQueen stuff over on the OUAT archives lately, sorry.

Thinking about it, though, there's an original fic, linkfp(Mother of Learning), which is a complex multi-groundhog-loop story that focuses a great deal on one man's ability to learn, both in and out of magic school.

******** Hate to say it, but it doesn't actually solve the problem. It just formalises the 'magical tiredness' into an in-universe mana bar. They still generally don't say why a spell is more draining to someone's magical core, just that it is, because reasons. Personally, I think such a system works fine for videogames, where your list of magical effects is fairly limited (and stupid effects like desk-to-space-probe cannot be attempted), because you can actually see the mana bar tick up/down. For written stuff, if you're going to get that crunchy, I'd probably scrap the mana system and just work out what makes a spell difficult to cast in the first place. And not every story needs to be this crunchy, but some people try to do it, or shoehorn in magical tiredness where it makes no sense.

linkffn(The Arithmancer) had some cool mathematical justifications for spell complexity, for instance, and linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) touched on it with its Transfiguration Basics system.

Canon, a number of spells are difficult to cast because they're not just about words and wand movements, but about putting yourself into the correct state of mind (seriously, have you ever tried to induce in yourself a specific emotional state?). The patronus requires happiness, the crucio requires that you want to hurt, etc. Voldemort is scary because he can cast killing curses all day (because really he wants to kill /everyone/ so no one can challenge him) whereas other death eaters just want power/money/etc. and have to induce a murderous rage each time (I'm just guessing here).

********** Yeah, seems legit, although it wasn't really used to much effect in canon, sadly. Like, the spellcasting got less interesting and varied as the series went on, so part of Voldie spamming AKs everywhere was at least partly because it seemed like Rowling couldn't think of anything more interesting/effective for him to do in scene. Applied Cultural Anthropology went into this idea though, somewhat, with Hermione's ability to cast a Stunner during... first or second year, forget which, is mentioned as a sign that she could easily become a dark witch. Basically, because in that fic, using the Stunning Charm requires forcing your will onto another ('I will /make/ you unconscious.') and is therefore thematically linked to similar spells... a category which happens to include the Imperius. Shielding charms are linked to the strong visceral need to protect things (usually yourself), and therefore come most easily to Harry out of the trio, for instance.

Interesting, either way, if you apply it to the magic system as a whole rather than specific 'special' spells like the Patronus. Wish JKR had taken the time to do this.

Harry/Multi is just a very shorthand way of saying 'Harry has more than one or two intimate relationships during the span of the story'. Polyamory is where the relationship happens between all three (or more) at the same time in equal measure.

***** The way I understood it, from reading the books, was this:

The legilimencer is suspicious of his victim. Suspicious of something that would be associated with the emotion of guilt or fear (or even happiness). The guilt or fear emotion is tied to a memory. The legilimencer traces the emotion to the memory. He sees the memory and knows why the person is guilty or fearful.

The occlumencer, in order to evade the legilimency, clears his mind, "emptying himself of emotions" because the emotion is the breadcrumb to the memory. It would probably require a strong will.

#+begin_quote
  I told you to empty yourself of emotion! ... Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter! -- /Snape, OotP/

******* No, it doesn't. But don't blame me because that use of legilimency is inconsistent with /OotP/'s description of it. Nowhere in Snape's "lessons" did it mention divining what someone is /about/ to do. It's about accessing their memory (and in at least Harry's case, influencing their behavior).

*Edit:* Though it is consistent if you consider this: Harry was angry. He was thinking of hurting Snape. He was remembering the page with the incantation, "sectumsempra, for enemies". In this manner, Snape could trace the anger to the memory of the the page and then know what he should defend against.

** Magical Cores and Wizard Oaths.

I always liked the idea that the only limit to magic is your knowledge of it (with the exception of some spells that require emotions as fuel). Magical Cores try to explain magic, which is unnecessary. Magic just is, period (at least in this universe).

Wizard Oaths are boring writing, lazy character development and I always feel cheated out of a great trust-building dialogue between two characters when its used. It also makes no sense. If a Wizards Oath takes your magic if broken, why not use it /constantly/ for court? The sheer concept of a Wizards Oath makes any court system invalid, since you only need one dude who listens to your oath and if you're guilty you lost your magic.

Speaking about whitewashing: I do like it if, for example, Bellatrix turns out to be a victim of total control. Those kind of ideas are entertaining to read, because they mix up some power structures. What I do not like is if the author tries to defend actions like the murder of civilians, rape, genocide,... with some speech about how the bad bad mudbloods don't care about our magical society.

Bashing... well, yea. It has the potential to be funny if its completely over the top and the fic is crack anyway. But it is and will always be abysmal writing the moment its meant seriously.

** *Soul bonding:* Can't stand the idea of it. It's a crouch for the writer to avoid actually have to have to write out two people falling for each other... which is the best part!

*Harems:* If you're writing a harem fic, chances are you don't have the ability to characterise for an ensemble cast to begin with. The head of the harem is invariably meant to be perfection in all thins and the girls are interchangeable hairstyles and little else.

*Harry/Hermione:* I just don't get it and I think that stems from my rejection of the movies. In them, Hermione is presented as this all round kick ass chick free of any weakness or rough edge and consequently uninteresting. Ron is demonized in the movies to an all most crackfic level. Seriously, fuck those movies. The whole point of Harry and Hermione's friendship is that it's just that, they value each other for something other than their respective bits.

*Friendly Goblins* I've seen this term used a number of times but for me it's inaccurate to say that the problem is that they are specifically friendly. The problem is that they have no agenda other than to be impressed by Harry/Insert. All Harry has to do is say "my your gold always flow/death to your enemies" and the goblins just completely forget about a millennia of inter-species conflict!

Apart from that its the usual: cores, basalisk wand, parselmagic, harry-perveral-gryffindor-black-merlin-jesus-kilmister..... Harry you're a(n) [shadowmage/pheonix wolf/Incubus/necromancer] oh and martial arts training!

*[EDIT] I forgot Greater-Good Dumbledore*. The whole concept is something that Albus had been running from and ashamed of for about a century when the books start. The idea that he would use the ideology of the man who was partly responsible for his sisters death is ridiculous and the popularity of the trope is probably due in large part to Micheal Gambon playing Dumbledore as a complete arsehole in the movie.

**** Combat in the HP universe doesn't function particularly well on a mechanical level, that's not a bad thing, and JK seemed to understand this and designed her encounters appropriately. I'll give a counter example first:

*The Stormlight Archive* by Brandon Sanderson has a very well defined 'supernatural system' that adheres to strict rules and limitations. He can therefor write a sequence about one of his characters coming into conflict with those limitations and achieve a level of drama, which is what we're all here for in the end. He is then free to layer on other story elements to bolster the scene.

The Harry Potter system has very few rules and even those are vaguely defined. From my experience a lot of writers ignore this and think that simply writing /'Harry drew his supercool wand and shot this spell that I've just pulled out of my ass and it hit the baddy and it was awesome, trust me!"/ This I think is the wrong way to go about things. One should focus on what you are fighting over, not the fight itself. Every major conflict is presented this way in cannon. When Harry faces Quirrell, JK doesn't start wasting words on stuff like "/The power of his mothers sacrifice burnt white hot within his soul, stoking his magic into a towering tempest of power, he turned to Quirrell and unleashed everything he had..../" Instead she focuses on the characters desires. Same thing in the graveyard, Cedric is dropped to let you know the stakes have been raised, then its about Voldie playing with Harry and Harry's *desire* to return to Hogwarts to sound the alarm.

To many writers add blood and viscera straying all over the place without considering the impact on the narrative.

***** I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I find that vagueness to be a major weakness of the Potterverse. Things just happen because 'Lol whimsy', and there's no system to fall back on, so of course you get people doing the 'pull-a-spell-from-my-arse' thing. It's the only thing you /can/ do if you're trying to portray a fight that's more technical than two children throwing rocks at each other in the middle of a field. Unless you're willing to go the extra mile, make it an AU, and come up with a coherent magical system in your own time like Rowling could have done when she wrote canon, I guess. 'I want something to happen' isn't a coherent magic system either, and it only worked for the Quirrell scene because Harry had no idea what he was doing. If you want to write a scene between two competent fighters (Dumbledore and Voldemort from Dumbledore's perspective, perhaps), you need some sort of framework for the magic they're slinging around (and both characters should /know/ what's generally possible under said framework), otherwise they're basically playing Cops and Robbers.

Sometimes the emotional angle works, but not everyone wants to write like that, and some people want the Potterverse to have some internal consistency to its magic. Just... not everyone is /good/ at it :P

****** Yes, those two options (vaugery and systemised) seem diametrically opposed. It basically comes down to the central flaw/quirk of the series; the evolution from children's fiction into young adult blockbuster. Paradoxically though, I doubt we would be having this conversation if that flaw did not exist. HP fanfiction is SO much more popular than anything else and I believe it's due to the disconnect between the first and last book. It tempts the reader to find a rational, teases them with a hope of some grand unifying theory!

Even [[http://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson's_Laws_of_Magic][Sanderson's rules of magic]] cannot properly denote were exactly HP should stand. You should really take a look at it if you haven't read any of his works.

My prior critique was perhaps to broad. I personally enjoy the fannon concept of 'spell strain', of it working just like a muscle and I'm surprised that never seeped into the original series. But in an effort to be more narrow in my focus, I think you've hit the nail on the head, too few writers who clearly desire a rules based magic system put in the effort of building it into their fic. I read one regrettable bit of fantasy once about Prick!Harry flying around on a Thestral and casting a spell that stopped peoples hearts, that was also invisible and unblockable...

To re-imagine the universe through a 'Hard magic' lens while still taking into account what actually happened in cannon would be a laborious task that few are up to.

Damn it, now I'm tempted!

******* Do it. I would read it so hard :D

I've been wanting to do something where magic was based off of late medieval astrology, but the workload is daunting. I would have to come up with suites of spells that are associated with the various astrological bodies, and how those spells were affected by the movements of the planets. Potions would need to be completely overhauled to make some kind of coherent system. But you would have more 'crap, we don't know the right spell, <tension ensues>' situations like in the early books, where people get into serious trouble because Mercury is rising and they only remember a Saturn-aligned spell that barely works right now, etc.

Basically, I want Dumbledore's funky planet watch from Philosopher's Stone to actually have a reason to exist. I want Astronomy to be a class choice for a reason, and not because Wizards are often portrayed with a random telescope in their towers. Odds are, I will never have the wherewithal to write this monster, because reading old astrology texts is exhausting, but... a guy can dream, right?

I don't think it's possible to make a 'Hard Magic' setting that's completely canon compliant, though, because canon runs on the rule of whimsy. There are parts of Philosopher's Stone that are completely at odds with later books. There's so much stuff that's just thrown in to be wacky... it doesn't make any sense, and it was never meant to. It was lazy of JKR to make a series about kids going to magic school and never teach us anything coherent about magic, but most people I've spoken to in the fandom don't care.

******** Have you ever heard of *World Of Darkness*? Its a tabletop roll-playing system like D&D but a whole bunch weirder! One of the editions is called '*Mage: The Ascension*' and ultimately all magic is applied will, 'I want, so it is'. But Humans are not equipped to think like that so mages come up with a rational for why and how their magic works. Some cast long rituals and wave staffs around while others believe they are divinely blessed and they are a conduit for some deity. Compounding this is that reality in *WOD* is what people expect it to be, ei: Seven billiion people expect the sun to rise in the east tomorrow, and that belief is that causes it to happen!

So you have all the normal people, who don't believe in magic making it harder for mages to perform magic because the mage now has to believe in himself more than all the 'muggles' that surround him. To cast a spell you have to defy the *consensus belief* of everyone else on the planet, and this explains why there are so few mages.

There's a whole bunch of other systems that sit on top of that and its a wonderful mess that actually kind of makes sense in the end, and the latest edition came out rather recently and is chock full of in world examples and explanations and philosophies.

********* I've seen that system, and played Mage: The Awakening briefly, but oWoD seemed way too fiddly and incoherent to actually play. There was the whole metaplot thing going on, and the maths behind the system was broken, but the idea of magic being based on consensus reality was crazy awesome. And by that I mean mostly crazy, but also kind of awe inspiring. It's the kind of thing I'm interested to read, but would probably never play. The Technocracy never seemed that terrible, to me, because at least they didn't want the world to go back to the times of crazy wizard kings with armies of goat-men, where you may or may not get raped to death by centaurs this week, etc. Consensus reality cuts both ways, unfortunately, and the Mages were kinda dickish too. It would be an interesting system to write about, certainly, but it would probably have worked better for novels than for a tabletop game. At least, when your writers are the White Wolf creative team :/

Don't bother with New WoD (Vampire:The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, etc) though... it's terribad. I could go on an exhaustive, rambling tangent on exactly why, if you want, but that's somewhat outside of the purview of the thread.

** One I haven't seen mentioned, and it's a minor thing but it'll make me drop a fic really fast, is Sorting Hat/House Shenanigans. The Sorting Hat sorts students into one of the four houses, not two of them. not a fifth house it makes up, but one of the four. Anytime something else happens at the Sorting ceremony it's a good sign the fic is about to turn for the worse.

** Oh man, where do I start? You listed some, other people listed more but that's a tip of the iceberg. Too many to remember. I can offer more general advice: many of those tropes aren't inherently bad ideas, usually they're just not executed well. One category I would advise to steer clear off are things that result from misunderstanding (or misremembering) canon: stuff like magical cores, magical exhaustion, all kinds of inheritance, nice goblins, etc.

But really, don't ask what you should include or not in your story unless you're specifically looking to challenge yourself like that. Tell the story you want to tell and use the tropes you need to do it. Expect your fic to be judged on its own merits.

Of course, if you include magical cores I probably won't read it. :P

** A few from a list I'm working on to write an article of what ruins a fic(for me):

(asterisks mean not a total dealbreaker dependent upon use)

Slash(almost always seems to go straight to anatomically impossible sex and mpreg).

Anime based crossover.

LoTR/HP save a couple I've read where Harry was a horny elfkid trying to hook up or another story of him hooking up with Eowyn. Come across a few good ones recently but the majority seem to be Harry-solves-everything fics or gay!Harry/hot!elf mpreg.

Draco as a main character/friend unless there's been a realistic butterfly.

Snape being a mentor.

*Harry being a lord (sirius was being sarcastic and facetious)(sometimes okay if not a significant plot element where Harry is all of a sudden below). [see A Black Comedy by Nonjon]

Harry being some kind of political genius without even reading The Prince.

*Manipulative Old Bastard Dumbledore (though hated cliche, sometimes interesting if follows the 'harry is a walking dead man anyway, i've weighed one person against society and society wins')

That Dumbledore is too stupid to ask others who might know about Horcruxes.

That goblins can easily remove horcruxes.

Dumbledore robbing Harry blind.

The majority of Dark!Harry stories. These ignore the mirror image harry|tom element.

This is absolutely despised: EVEN A SIMPLE LUMOS CAUSING A CITYWIDE BLACKOUT.

Harem fics. Fucking annoying as shit. A good polygamy story, though? Those are often fun.

When people completely disregard canon without explaining why. Even if it's just a foreword saying what's different. It causes mental whiplash to say x happens even though in canon it doesn't. Give a reason why!

*Harry being insanely smart and faking it due to Dursleys (though admittedly I've used this once). He can be smart but having him be some sort of philosopher king is annoying. Some stories pull it off but they're full on AUs.

Dursleys being physically abusive. While mental abuse is often worse, too many stories go off with Vernon being a psycho abuser. (Admittedly, i've used this too but only when Harry is removed from Dursleys quickly).

TIme compression. Usually annoying as hell. One story had them going to a Japanese school and finishing seven years worth of education in two summers. Terrible idea done interestingly. All of a sudden you have 'adults' who've never been through puberty. What're they supposed to do until they're of working age? There was one story though that used it to deal with Hogwarts pregnancies and people found out 'muggleborns' were in fact placed purebloods. That was interesting. That was probably the japanese school story too now that I think about it.

Riddle being 'misunderstood' and Dumbledore projecting his own dark tendencies.

Avada Kedavra being a spell invented by healers to compassionately end a life and dark wizards perverted it. That shit pisses me off so much. If your hero needs to kill easily, he can use the severing charm on a throat and/or spine.

Harry learning hundreds of spells, becoming multiple form animagus, being a metamorphmagus, yet none of these talents are plot necessary. It becomes an absolute fan wank. Your story should be a rucksack, only what you plan to use should be included, otherwise it weighs down the story.

Yeah, I feel you, dude. I'm the same way about het fic. Only for mpreg, substitute fpreg. With bonus gender essentialism. And Harry being an idiot macho bad-ass, which he never is in canon.

It comes down to the writer. I'm very picky about the authors whose het fic I'll read. Lots of fannish writers, whatever pairings they ship, don't know how to write sex scenes. Most het fics either put me to sleep, piss me off, or leave me rolling my eyes.

In itself that concept isn't that bad really but the framing for it employed in HP fanfics buggers it up. Just after the final battle against Voldemort, Harry won but the price was too high and all his friends are dead. So what does he do? Go back in time for a do-over.

Instead of dealing with his loss and learning to cope he runs away. Instead of building a better world out of the ashes of the old one he hides in the bitter comforts of the-mess-that-was.

And instead of acknowledging these issues of the character by the second chapter it is as if nothing of this ever happened.

** I don't mind manipulative dumbledore so long as the author makes a moderate attempt to make Dumbledore something other than a caricature, which is probably my biggest hate of any trope.

One thing I just came across was writing an abused child. Now, I will be the first person to admit I have zero experience with abused kids in any capacity, but I /highly/ doubt that when they meet a new person, the first words out of their mouth are some variation of "I'm sorry, please don't hurt me! I'll do anything!" when all that happened was they were caught staring.

It's like this in almost every abuse fic. The author writes them as completely and utterly broken in body and spirit, and while I don't doubt that happens in real life, probably more often than I'd ever guess, it just doesn't make for a good story. It's nothing but Wangst.

To add to that, abused children don't easily talk about their abuse. You have an endless number of fics where Harry just tells about his abuse to anyone he meets, whether that person is trustworthy or not. Abused children are usually ashamed of their abuse and want to appear strong. I can't read a story where they just talk about it to everyone, not to mention yell about it to Dumbledore in the /middle of the Great Hall/.

** Character bashing, especially over the top character bashing, like they aren't just bad, they are the Worst Evil To Come From the Earth, especially when someone is only bashed in order to set up some other pairing (a lot of Harry/Hermione fics do this with Ron, I've noticed).

Extremely out of character, with no reasoning or plot development behind why.

Rape/abuse/suicide that just seems gratuitous and thrown into the story. I don't mind stories that focus on abuse or have abuse or suicide themes, but I hate the really graphic ones, especially when whoever it happened to is perfectly fine a chapter later.

Super over powered Harry, especially if it comes with 200 extra titles and every seat in the Wizengamot, which of course he can easily handle, because he's a political genius at 11. ...No.

  I want to avoid topics or subjects that may turn off some readers.
#+end_quote

I think you're going to have a pretty hard time with this. People have radically different tastes. As for things I go out of my way to avoid:\\
*Explicit het*: And its close cousin 'everyone is straight because I said so.' I don't care how superb your fic may otherwise be, but I'm just not interested in reading that.\\
*Tends too heavily towards action or romance*: Keep the two balanced. In gen fics, mix social/comedic scenes with faster-paced battle ones. Let the tension rise and fall.\\
*Snape apologetics*: Unless it's AU (and you've set it up well) or you have some other reason and it's well-explained. Don't just use canon to say he's a hero: I didn't buy it there, and I won't buy it here.\\
*Shallow characters*: Most bashing fics fall into this trap, which is WHY I find them unconvincing. If you want to make someone evil, get into their head, give them a convincing reason for it; don't just say 'oh, they were evil all along.' No character should be built around a single action or idea. A pet peeve on certain characters, and instant regret for the life choices that led me here on others.\\
*Fem!Harry*: One of my favourite pairings is over-run with these. It's usually done as a literary no-homo, which makes it twice as awful. Appears to be a (relatively) recent trope, so may be a case of 'Get off my lawn!'?

I will read mediocre mpreg over explicit het any day of the week. I avoid anything that's been recced by a certain very popular website (at least around here), as one of their 'must-nots' is one of my absolute requirements. Some of my favourite authors are named here only with disdain.

Sometimes, tackling the tough subjects is what makes you and your work memorable. One of my favourite fics of all time is an old (OLD, 10+ years) one-shot centered on if Tom Riddle had been hired to teach at Hogwarts when he applied for the position. Nothing truly evil happened in the fic, but there was an overall sense of malice and foreboding. I go back to it every so often and reread. I've never seen it recced here, and I don't believe it's ever won any sort of 'fandom award.'

So, yeah. Tastes vary, widely. If you're trying not to put anyone at all off, you're probably going to end up with something extremely bland.

** Main focus is absolutely that of a competent dualist lol so definitely something I've been thinking about for a while. Though I've been fox using more of what makes dark magic "dark", how it is defined, how it is used, what effects it has, etc. This just broadens my research and plotting lol.

** the only one i really dislike is harry is mature enough to master every conversation and get everything he wants with those skills. 'hermione listened to what harry said, thought about it a few seconds, and then agreed 100%'. it's usually accompanied by, all my friends become awesome and pair up in way to compliment my relationship perfectly..

** Since no one else has said them:

*Stations of the Canon* Seriously, if your going to make Harry super powerful, or set the story in an AU, change what harry encounters. We all know how Canon goes.

*Dark!Harry going "light"* When you see a Harry who is being ruthless, and killing people, and hates all muggleborns, and is loyal to Voldemort, and gets everything he could ever want, and was abandoned by his family/ "the light" who then turns to "the light" because Dumbledore/ a family member shows the slightest bit of affection to him, and he is now the best, most innocent character with some desire to make amends for what he has done.

*** It gives people a chance to let out their frustrations with the HP community. So... yes, yes it is. It's kinda important to let people vent, imo.
