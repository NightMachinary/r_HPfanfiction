** There is no master list per say, though [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] has a megathread on decent canon pairing stories. I'll give you a few highlights though.

Linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince) is an HBP from GW POV. Fits well with the canon style, of a bit too fluffy for me.

Linkffn(Not From Others): DH from GW POV as well, the author has a few other canon compliant fics that are worth a read, particularly The Aurors.

Linkffn(questions and answers): a long running post-canon work, ignoring CC, and has recently started up again.

Linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation): could have been canon, prior to CC, and is a decent set of seven books following Albus through Hogwarts.

Linkffn(Gone was any trace of you): the best Harry loses his memories story out there, from the wordsmith annerb.

Also, look up the other works by Northumbrian. Not all are great, but they do fit with he request.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** Cheating a bit and half copying from another comment I wrote (canon compliant is my favourite):

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]]: Minor Dumbledore/Grindelwald. The story from Kendra's death to Ariana's death. Plays with canon a bit, but is still very much canon compliant-even works surprisingly well with Fantastic Beasts.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]: Slytherin (Original Characters) group of friends during the series. It's part of a series (Anguis), but this one is primarily to set up the characters-oneshot style, the later ones are full novels.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12330043/1/Tell-Brave-Deeds-of-War][Tell Brave Deeds of War]]: Terry Boot, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein during Deathly Hallows (at Hogwarts).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]]: Professor Binns' backstory. It's unexpectedly amazing.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Minds Eye, Souls Reflection]]: Luna's perspective of Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]: Neville in the summer before Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: Sequel series to Anguis, but not necessary to read Anguis. Next-gen story with Scorpius, Albus and Rose.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662%22][Muggle Studies]]: Comedy series. During Harry's kids time, about a Muggle Studies teacher and his (hilarious) experience trying to teach wizards/witches Muggle Studies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]]: Scorpius/Albus, it's a very sweet and funny story (post-cursed child) that has excellent interactions between Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny. The slash is minor and it has sequels.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]: Set long after the epilogue, a Harry, Ron and Hermione adventure when they're much older.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][Scarlet Pimpernal]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4007457/1/The-Sleeper-Awakes][The Sleeper Awakes]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]]: Ron/Hermione post-war. A bit angsty, but it's my favourite of this type. (Also I never mention this but as someone that is Australian this has my tick of approval-mostly because the author doesn't go overboard on the slang (most people don't even use the slang in the first place) and I have met Hugos).

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]]: Luna's perspective on Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8103339/1/Seven-Simple-Years][Seven Simple Years]]: Ron/Hermione during the series. Author has written other works.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11145058/1/][Daphne Greengrass, Side Character]]: Very funny, Daphne Greengrass and her friends during the series from Order of the Phoenix onwards (currently incomplete). Since you're just starting you probably don't know the whole tropes surrounding Daphne Greengrass in fanfiction (who was just barely mentioned in the series)-this is a real breath of fresh air.

Oneshots:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard]]: Absolutely hilarious. Harry at Ron and Hermione's wedding-hiding in a cupboard. The author has a lot of great oneshots/stories (such as Seven Simple Years) series but this one is my favourite.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4008738/1/Red-Ink-Remains][Red Ink Remains]]: Author also wrote Cauterize (and many other great oneshots), but this one is my favourite-conveys so much in so little words.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]: Considered one of the best stories. It's pretty amazing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12998948/1/The-Curious-Case-of-the-Kitchen-Scissors][The Curious Case of the Kitchen Scissors]]: Harry's regrowing hair.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts You Won't Find in "Hogwarts, A History"]]: Five oneshots during the series-very funny and sweet

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5578897/1/Lest-We-Forget][Lest We Forget]]: George talking to his mother many years post-series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] : series of oneshots post-war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]]: Very sweet. Harry, Ron and Hermione go back to Hogwarts. Author has other canon-compliant work and wrote Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10770606][Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery]]: Absolutely hilarious-post war Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny.

I can't think of any more right now (I might add to this-I have a lot of stories that I really enjoyed but never wrote the names down of, I really need to start a collection)-most of these authors have other works that are worth checking out, and also have a look at their favourites list which is far and away the best way to find stories outside of reddit.

Also check out other threads that mention canon compliant stories to find some that might not have been mentioned here. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/96cgv0/what_are_some_of_the_best_nonau_fics/?utm_source=reddit-android][Here's an example]].

*** Seconding Cauterize and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Cauterize is my go to story for showing how great fanfiction can be. If you haven't read it, go do so. Now. Seriously, it's only about 1k words, it won't take long. And it's phenomenal. The Scarlet Pimpernel, on the other hand, is a lot longer, but also excellent. Basically, Percy Weasley uses his position in the ministry to actively (but quietly) oppose Voldemort. It made me love Percy.

***** Really, it's one of the best overall Luna-centric fics I've ever seen. Its greatest flaw is actually its formatting.

It manages to be an effective prototype of Seer!Luna, justifying it as Luna being affected by her mother's experiments regarding the Veil, while avoiding most of the accompanying tropes.

It balances the eccentricities of /The Quibbler/ with a desperation to find truth.

It gives a great foundation of friendship with Ginny, and develops Luna's dorm mates, who in the vast majority of fics have no characterization beyond being mean for the sake of it.

I was especially fond of the friendship Luna develops with Christine, who's bullied nearly as often as her.

Really, I'm struggling to find a better overall Luna fic.

** My favorite gateway fic for newbies is linkffn(seeing ghosts by story please). It's outsider POV (at least at first) which I think is sadly underutilized as a technique. I also like linkao3(when september comes by auntbijou) for that.

Those are both pretty short, which pretty much goes with outsider POV.

My other fave canon compliant is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/yaycoffee/TSOOS01a.html][The Secret of Our Success]], which is now my headcanon for how the twins figured out the map.

  Fred and George are so inseparable that most people say their names as some kind of a set. Fred&George. Twins, brothers, business partners. Then the War strikes and nothing is ever the same again. Just when George is finally coming to terms with all that has happened, can it be that Fred is back? Or is it just another loose end come back to haunt him?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6719754/1/Reunion][Reunion by movinggirl]] - James and Lily Potter have had to learn everything about their son through people who have died and come Above.

Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7400212/1/Speak-Softly-Love][Speak Softly, Love by Silens Cursor]] - Antonin Dolohov hadn't always been a Death Eater. He once was a champion. He once had a family. He once had a wife. This is the story how he lost it all.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
