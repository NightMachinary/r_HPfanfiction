:END:
Can't remember the name of the fic, but want to give it a reread - it's a "do-over" fic but that's pretty much all I can remember


** So Arthur is bad but Ginny and Molly aren't? Interesting.

*** Yeah, that's the thing though, if memory serves he's on Harry's side... I really wish I could remember more, what I do remember is a bit vague

** Could be linkffn(The Rise of Thanatos by JasminSky) if not, it at least has dark Weasley family - they all have specialised skillsets and Ron is a necromancer. It's not very long so far but it was updated back in September.

  "Raised like a pig for slaughter" his Potions Professor's words echoed through the mind of Harry when he steps in front of Voldemort. Though probably neither of them would have foreseen the result of the killing curse hitting him. Waking on the day of the trip to the zoo Harry decides that this time he would do it his way. Dark!Evil!Golden Trio, time travel, SLASH!
