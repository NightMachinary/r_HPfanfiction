looking for any good complete Dramione fics.

And please for the love of Dumbledore no teenage pregnancy.

Thanks.


** I'm so sorry I can't link anything at the moment as I am on mobile (and at work), but if you look at my userprofile and scroll down, I've posted a couple of long Dramione-related fic recs (absolutely no pregnancy is any of them!) fairly recently that might fit the bill if you are looking for something ASAP.

Otherwise I always recommend heading over to Dramione.org :)

EDIT: Page 3 and page 6 on mobile... It's pretty easy to spot as they are the posts with all the links in them. Cheers!
