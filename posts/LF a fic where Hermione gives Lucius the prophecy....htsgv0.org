:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been nagging me all day and can't seem to find it, basically for some reason Hermione convinces Harry to give her the prophecy and she gives it to Lucius cause he said he'd let them go if they gave it up??

I think that's pretty much how it starts then, somehow, they stay in touch and end up having a full blown affair all the way through HBP and DH.

Can't remember if it's finished or not.

  Moths tend to be attracted to flame. What if Hermione's need to prove the pure-bloods wrong about Muggle-borns turned into a need to prove herself to one of them, the most prejudiced of them all? The story of a brilliant but naive girl who fell in love with a Machiavellian, sociopathic bigot. Book based, not your typical LM/HG fanfic.

**** That's not it, very similar though, a good read, thanks. They one I'm looking for was much longer, all the way to the Battle of Hogwarts. At one point Lucius is passing information along to Hermione through some charmed jewelry while they're hunting Horcruxes and she confesses to have a connection to a Death Eater, they assume it's Draco and she just goes along with it.

  A pureblood Death Eater. A brilliant young muggleborn student. An innocent attraction that becomes an obsession. An obsession that will turn the tide of war and change the wizarding world forever.

******* Yes, totally it!! Thanks I had lost it a while back, too bad it's still incomplete, but definitely worth rereading.
