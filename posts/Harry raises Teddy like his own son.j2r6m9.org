Like the title says I would like to read fics about Harry and Teddy father/son relationship. Possibly no Harry/Andromeda pairing.


** This is more how it gets to that relationship, but try Teddy's Excellent Adventure, linkffn(13021745).

Also, not the focus of the story, and Teddy only appears occasionally, but they have that relationship in Steve and the Barkeep, linkffn(8410168).

I had two other stories in my list that might have met the description, but they've both been removed from ffnet since the last time I looked at them, so I can't really verify that.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** there is an avenger crossover one shot.

There is one interaction between harry and teddy and it just melts your heart into a puddle...

linkffn(11426651)

The only bad thing about this is that it's only a one shot, that to a short one... I would read this fic.. with or without the avengers, if I could just read Harry and Teddy's storyline

** Disorder of the Phoenix. linkffn(13668247)

I would strongly recommend that you read the *2018* version from [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=jacobapples&sort=title][ff2ebook]] instead, however. (The fic was moved to a different account and reuploaded as one giant chapter with the notes scattered around throughout. The 2018 version is complete and is still separated by chapters.)

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.
