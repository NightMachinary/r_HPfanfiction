ISO:

Fic I've read in 2020 where Harry takes a student under his wing, it was a younger girl, Astoria or maybe Luna, I can't remember, and chaos and hilarity ensure. I'm not too clear on the plot, maybe it was like a mentorship program or something, but Harry inadvertently becomes the cool older brother figure, and the younger student ends up looking up to Harry like Rock Lee does to Guy. I also seem to remember Harry was mainly just winging it most of the time.


** When you find it please tell me this sounds hilarious and I need to pass time

*** If I can't find it, I will write a version myself.

Unfortunately that's all the information I remember about it I don't even remember if it was on AO3 or FFN. It kinda focused on the younger student basically following Harry around like a lost puppy, then every once in awhile she would use the life tips Harry would bullshit out of his idiot mouth, and she would inadvertently come out on top through sheer dumb luck, further increasing her hero worship.

** As promised, OP will deliver.

I still have not been able to figure out which one it was, so I will write it myself. First chapter will be posted in a week's time. Inspect a series of one shots briefly connected by a flimsy threat of plot, slightly too serious to be crack, spanning a total of 3 years from Prisoner of Azkaban up until the end of Half Blood Prince. Maybe up until the end of deathly hallows, working with the plot lines that differentiate from Canon.

Plotline is as follows. Dumbledore decides to enact a mentorship program to help first years adapt to Hogwarts. Nobody expected that pairing Astoria Greengrass and Harry Potter would lead to an entire breakdown of the Hogwarts house system itself. Or, Harry watches Dudley's VHS collection when left at number 4 privet drive by himself, and quotes films to a pure blood first year.

**** Doing some final editing, and decided I wanted to do a bit longer format than what I had planned. I will personally dm the second it's up lmao.

The plot will basically be something along the lines of Dumbledore decides to select 10 random third years to act as mentors to 10 random first years up until their third year, meanwhile, Harry managed to watch all of Dudley's VHS tapes when the dursleys left him home alone for a week and is now a fountain of wisdom. So he thinks.
