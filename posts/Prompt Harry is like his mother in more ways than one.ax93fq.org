** But Harry IS more like Lily than James, from what little we know about them. He isn't interested in pranks and not that good at Transfiguration, but he is smart-mouthed, quick-witted, and one of his signature spells is Patronus /Charm/.

*** Though patronus cannot be classified as a /charm/ according to its defnition. And Harry was most certainly above average in Charms. He isn't exceptional. Neither is he any good at transfiguration. He's just average in all academics, except DADA, because he has good reflexes and LOT of luck. The only thing he is really exceptional is quidditch.

**** His skill in DADA isn't because of reflexes... Like what? They don't really practice dueling much, he was just good at picking up the charms and jinxes and such that are used in that course. And why can't the Patronus be a charm?

#+begin_quote
  Charms differ from Transfiguring Spells in the following manner: a charm adds certain properties to an object or creature, whereas a transfiguring spell will change it into something utterly different.

  This ancient and mysterious charm conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings. The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity. You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it.
#+end_quote

Now tell me why is it a /charm/ when you are clearly giving /new/ form to your positive feelings, /changing/ something intangible to something tangible, /changing/ it into something utterly different. Shouldn't it be /conjuration?/

Or just say that the age old defnitions of charms and transfiguration are no longer valid with the wide spread development of various spells. But calling a /patronus/ a /charm/ is just... üò£

Harry is smart mouthed and quick witted. I'm not sure I get what you're going for with this. Having people compare Harry to his mother, then what?

  ‚ÄúAlbus Severus,‚Äù Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, ‚Äúyou were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.‚Äù

*** Yeah, Rowling --- as much as I respect her --- made a lot of mistakes in her last two books. From convoluted wand-lore to forced Jesus imagery and downright unnatural OBHWF bullshit.

  A one-shot test story to see if anyone is interested. If you are, great. If you're not, then enjoy the one-shot anyways. Rest of the summary is inside. So enjoy the chaos!

  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.
