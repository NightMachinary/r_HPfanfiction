Not creepy as in pedophilia and shit, but freaky and unnatural horror movie type stuff happening to Harry.

I also don't mean something like someone killing and eating people. Not a character going crazy and killing people on gruesome manners.

I want a supernatural horror. Yes, I know magic is supernatural, but you know what I mean. Something like Stranger Things would work.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  Happily married for three years, Harry and Ginny Potter decide to buy a house in the country with the hope of gaining some privacy from the Wizarding world. However, when a series of unexplained sightings and events occur, their dream life soon turns into a nightmare. Disclaimer:I don't own the Harry Potter characters or world, that honor is all JKR's.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
