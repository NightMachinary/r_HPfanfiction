***** Is that the guy where every sex scene (and story almost characters wise) is basically the same or maybe it was just that he only ever used the same adjectives for various sexual things over and over and over?

****** Yep.

It's a shame though, because I like some of the concepts and they could be fun stories if they weren't bogged down by plot holes and redundant sex scenes.

Like I just looked at his blog today and I guess he's doing a Young Justice crossover this time where Harry somehow ends up fusing with Connor while still in the pod at the beginning of the series.

What a fun idea, it's a shame the likely quality.

Also the first and only HGSB I read -- honestly I don't think the pairing is that good. Hell, even in this fic, I think HGRL would have worked out better -- it feels like the only reason it didn't was the whole predestination thing (Remus already being destined for Tonks) and soulmate shenanigans.

** The Safe Word in Devils Snare is fantastic with great smut ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8376331/chapters/19188904]]). It might not be as smut heavy as you requested, but I recommend it. It's Hermione/Neville.

For pure smut, with a side of feelings, I would recommend Quartet by OracleObscured ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9591863/chapters/21681281]]). It has every kind of sex and kink imaginable. There is no direct incest, though it is Hr/LM/DM/SS. It's bananas.
