This can be things about the books/movies or about fanfic/fandom

Things that don't count as unpopular Harry Potter opinions.

Neville should have been the chosen one,

Liking or Disliking Draco or Snape or James, Liking or disliking Dramione or Drarry or Snilly, those characters and ships are very divisive so a good number of people like and dislike them.

Disliking any aspect of the epilogue ( including ending pairings the jobs, they got, names of the kids etc)

Disliking the cursed child

Thinking Harry is boring/not a good protagonist

Thinking the books are better than the movies

Slytherin Harry and Independent Harry are overdone.

And really any other opinion you see alot of even if the opposite of that opinion is also popular probably doesn't count as unpopular.

The least popular opinion I've ever seen is Umbridge gets too much hate. It was probably a troll comment but still.


** I like the epilogue

I think the canon ships make a lot of sense, though they are boring to read

Rons insecurities make a lot of sense, he is of correct in his perceptions of his place in relation to others.

Harry/Luna and Harry/Cho would never work.

I think Harry shouln't have defended Hermione's actions against Marietta Edgecomb, and it kind of goes against his compassionate characterization.

The books don't make it clear how good/bad his DADA talents are, his class performance doesn't his real world performance.

Harry can be very vindictive:

- He ordered Hedwig to peck on Ron and Hermione's hands for not writing him what he wanted to know
- He held a long grudge against Fleur for being called “leetle boy” by her
- He crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall

*** Not to mention overly restrictive in her ideas of what constitutes intelligence and success and similar concepts. She completely ignores Fred and George's genius in their products, focusing entirely on the rules and on their non-academic nature, for example.

Hermione sees schooling, academic intelligence, and following the rules and procedures of institutions as paramount. This is a fairly understandable character for the academically intelligent, white middle class daughter of two professionals with a high level of education. However, it also makes for a grating, teacher's pet of a person if not ameliorated and diversified with a solid sense of humour, non-judgemental attitude and good interpersonal skills, things Hermione has to develop after the Troll incident since she grew up as an only child with busy parents and few school friends to provide that socialisation. That's why she becomes more bearable with every book (excepting her holding the idiot ball re:Malfoy and the Potions book for the entirety of HBP).

Imagine you are an abused child and you give an adult some hints, they tell you that they are worried but then never do much to help you. That would be devastating to say the least.

And given that she claims to be some form of guardian figure for Harry when she victim blames Sirius, that is actually a criminal offence by British law (as far as I understand it, in German law she would be guilty of "failure to rend aid" regardless of claiming any responsibility, but British law has that weird clause).

Hermione can push SPEW in GoF, DA in OotP yet suddenly in HBP with Voldemort on the horizon she gives no thought about the plight of Muggleborn aside from her own family? Beating Harry in NEWT potions and her love life is really that important?

I would have liked to see some sort of underground railroad scenes of Muggleborn escaping Britain or Purebloods/Halfbloods helping them. Or even a resistance. The plot point of Draco getting hit with a Sectumseptra could easily have been modified to Muggleborn students who were bullied by Draco previously escalating and attacking him almost fatally. Would have provoked a good discussion of what's appropriate and inappropriate in a situation where someone is promoting a hateful idology in a school that's a direct threat to you but who hasn't actually attacked you yet.

** Given the state of the Wizarding World in the epilogue, I believe a new Dark Lord would have an easy time rising within the next 30-40 years at maximum. I say 40 years cause that would allow for a good number of people ripe for revisionist propaganda (having been too young to experience the first or second wars) and for the victors of the 2nd war to step down from some of their governmental/institutional positions.

The Ministry and Wizengamot haven't been reformed, and after a bloody civil war that cost lives on both sides, there's no reconciliation between those sides, simply one side imprisoning all of their opponents and probably disenfranchising/bankrupting their opponents' children and relatives via fines and ostracisation.

This creates two problems:

1. The Ministry will be good only as long as good people are in the Ministry, and there are no greater obstacles to bad people getting in now than there were in 1970. As soon as Percy steps down and Harry retires, the Ministry and Wizengamot can instantly become just as corrupt as they were before. No changes to election rules, balance of power (like not having the head of your executive branch also be hugely important to the joint judicial/legislative body and oversee and conduct trials), no bill of rights or constitutional arrangements etc.

2. The next generation of Pureblood kids (from Draco's year down) are unmarked and haven't committed crimes, but are still indoctrinated into Voldemort's ideology, and now have had their stake in society hugely reduced (limiting the disincentive for war/revolution) plus witnessing their parents imprisonment or death in the war.

Give it a few years and a moderately clever demagogue revisionist will portray Voldemort as either a Che Guevara type protector of Pureblood society (using the progressive policies of Hermione and the newly pro-Muggleborn administration as "proof" of the Muggleborn's evil) or as a tyrant who oppressed the Purebloods just as much as the Muggleborns, and the subsequent punishment of his followers was tyrannical political imprisonment etc, demonstrating the need for an actually honest Pureblood to take up the mantle that he (the filthy halfblood) pretended to fight for.

This is all because JK Rowling wrote a conflict (a civil war based almost entirely on quasi-ethnic prejudice) that in reality would be HUGELY complex and require a long period of intense analysis and work to begin to repair (see: South Africa), while not having even the tiniest bit of interest in writing any of that complexity/analysis and work, or a proper understanding of how they'd work.

This if it was actually done, would be the best way to avoid a future civil war - the defeated side can stew in their resentment as much as they wish, but they have few resources available to make another bid to take power. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that this was the case in canon.

** The idea that Neville should've been the chosen one has always been funny and absurd to me. There's a lot of things wrong with it, but the funniest part is the it usually comes from people who hate that Harry wasn't a magical prodigy.

- Sirius was reckless. JKR's narration also does him no favors. Both these things can be true.
- there's nothing wrong with Daphne or independent Harry save for terrible writing, which is common throughout fan fiction. Most of the time she's a richer version of the fanon Hermione most love.
- the only difference between Snape and Umbridge is a sob story.
- Tonks deserved better than Remus.
- the most interesting characters in the story shouldn't have all been tied to a Weasley. And, looking back, I'm shocked Tonks wasn't.

I can no longer read fanfics that portray Ron as insanely jealous of everything Harry has. He's never shown to be jealous of Harry's money or material possessions in canon. Both times Harry was gifted an expensive broom all Ron displayed was excitement. The times when Ron displayed a destructive jealousy of Harry were over things that were a lot more abstract. In GoF it was over fame and being exluded from Harry's confidence. In DH it was the unknown state of his family and his fears that Harry and Hermione were excluding him/in a romantic relationship. That so many fic writers can't perceive this boggles my mind. The movies really did a number on Ron's character.

Don't get me wrong after book 4 Ron's character remains static and doesn't grow and he's the least impressive member of the Golden Trio, but so many fanfic depictions of him are straight up OOC.

They're 2-3 years older. If Bill and Fleur can happen, so can Harry with Angelina or Alicia. Also, being in the same house as Ginny =/= spending time with her. I recall many instances when she was kicked from a room and she could barely speak to him until OoTP.

Most spells are utterly pointless in a fight either way. The killing curse is the best, then Fiendfyre if you can control it, after that there are area-of-effect blasting spells.

With regards to the stations of the canon, they exist for a reason. It provides writers with a rough framework around which to build their stories, saving them time and energy. That said, too many authors are too committed to the stations of the canon. Like, does the troll /always/ have to be fought in a bathroom? Does Ginny /always/ have to be the one to get or keep the diary? Is it /really/ worth keeping readers in suspense about Sirius Black when we already know that he's innocent? Does Harry /always/ have to fight the horntail? Does the first task even always have to be dragons? It's just a bit much to see so many similarities.

**** A lot of fics put the Marauders on a pedestal and hype up pranking, which tends to be boring to read. Dyeing the Slytherins green or washing Snape's hair was fun to read the first time, but got old very quickly. And quitea fewopranks would be harassment, assault or even worse crimes if you look closer, which the author does not. Far too often they are treated like Rock Stars by the other students, basically hopeless Mary Sues. Hell, we don't even know if they called themselves Marauders or if that was just a cool name for the map. Perhaps even worse is that a lot of Harry centric fics also go into this with Harry's "Marauder heritage" and similar themes, which usually involve being a dick.

And since I'm not fond of either Lupin or Pettigrew, but Marauder era fics do not really diverge from the later canon events, I have very little interest in reading about a future traitor (which the author is not subtle about) and the guy who ran off from his pregnant wife and needed advice from a 17 year old virgin. I mean yes, Lupin had a shitty fate, but to quote Jeremy Clarkson, "it could be worse, you could be shot in the back of the head by a marksman" (talking about traffic jams).

Give me a few good friendship moments between James and Sirius, but their friendship should not be the main theme.

- I think Minerva McGonagall is very overrated in this fandom, because apart from a couple cool quotes, she hasn't done anything substantial to help Harry and to advance their causes for most the series.
- Maybe not very unpopular, but I don't think Voldemort gets enough hate in this fandom, both as a literary character and for his in story behavior. He is basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain, who hardly expresses much competence beside raw destructive combat power. He is compulsive obsessive, refuses good advice, and solely relies on fear and terror. In the end, he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members and got killed while trying to take back a high school! This character is shit through and through.

Fleur, on the other hand, behaved like an arrogant dizzy airhead until then, who shit on Hogwarts, who treated Ginny and Hermione like little children, and who kept calling Harry "Leetle Boy" or "Silly Boy".

** >the cursed child

Yes, about the whole scandal around the child itself... After much deliberation I decided that I'm completely fine with the idea of Voldie and Bella having had sex and even a child. The latter just happens sometimes if you engage in the former, so it's not like Voldie had full control over it even if he didn't want a child. And as for the former, I don't think it should be OOC for Voldie to have had sex in the first place, as you can't really claim that no reference to him being attracted to anyone in that way /in a book for children/ means that he was asexual like some people do. And oh yeah he's damn ugly, too, but how many men are ugly in real life and still have sex? Bella was clearly attracted to his power and not looks anyway.

I'm not particularly impressed with the plot of the CC, I just think that the idea itself is ok, if not the execution.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Somebody who'd stand up on a broken leg to defend you isn't a fair weather friend. I really don't get this criticism of his character. Ron doesn't leave when things get hard, he leaves when he thinks (wrongly) that Harry is keeping secrets from him or excluding him. He is Harry's best friend, they're bros for life. The two times they fall out and Ron abandons Harry are two of the lowest points in Harry's journey, and when Ron returns are some of the best times.

He's far from a perfect character, but he's one of the best portrayals of a best friend in popular fiction.

*** I haven't seen much hate towards black Hermione I just assumed it was accepted.

But ya for the rest. Ron gets alot of shit. And its not even the movie's fault. Not entirely. Its just Harry got along with Ron so well in the books that whenever they fought and did something dickish it stood out way more. By comparison Hermione and Harry had just as many dickish moments if not more. But they weren't that big a deal because it was from Harrys pov.

Narcissa you see do alot less in the series and when you do see her shes doing something non terrible or sympathetic like trying to save her son or lying about Harry being dead. But ya she gets let off the hook more easily by the same people who may ageee without hessitation to send Lucius to Azkaban.

I can see Romione being unliked in the books but you do see instances of how and why it would work. And its the only HP couple I can really say that for other than Arthur and Molly. And its largely because it builds up their friendship too.

Daphne's popularity is sorta weird to me. I initially thought it was to flesh out Slytherins so the same reason Nott Blaise and Pansy got more popular. But seems its just this archetype people like so much she gets alot of love. Its not just her though. Alot of Hermione fic also puts this calculated emotional mastermind aspect to her like make her Tom Riddle esque. Not that she's not smart but shes not smart in a way that makes her Tom Riddle esque. Harry has this issue too in some independent Harry fics.

As for hostile to Rowling i feel like alot of the fandom is now which makes sense though sometimes it goes overboard.

He largely acts out the exact same arc each year over and over (argument with Harry, Ron makes a reference to being poor while Harry is rich, Ron gets jealous and leaves/betrays the other two, when Harry starts succeeding suddenly he shows up again) and only in books 5 and 6 seems to go anywhere character wise but then in book 7 he once again gets jealous for no reason while the horcrux barely effects +super smart Rowling Self-Insert+ Hermione or Harry.

Actually reread that passage, he's terrified for his family who we know are being watched by Death Eaters 24/7 and Harry completely blows that concern off. Also his complaints about the Horcrux Hunt are the same as basically every moan about Dumbledore, they're really valid points.

This is what gets me. Why are people so cool with friends who fuck them over multiple times? I would have stopped being friends with someone that pulled some of Ron's shit like year one for his being an asshat, let alone straight up ditching him twice. Don't get me wrong, he has some redeeming qualities like choosing to eat that hit in the chess game, actually coming back after his his bullshit in books 4 and 7 and being in Harry's corner when the going really got tough in like all of the major battles in the series.

God, I wish there was a vocal middle-ground crowd between "Ron is the God-King of strategy and is the bravest most loyal Lion of them all!!!" and "Ron is a slob, a pig and a coward that should be taken out back and put down like Old Yeller." This sub could really go for some more nuanced takes than those just attacking or defending characters whilst flying in the face of logic.

The GoF is still pretty damning to me to be honest. How anyone can know Harry and believe for a second that he intentionally did anything to put himself in the spotlight like that is beyond me. The jealousy portion only irritates me a touch. Like, I get it, Harry rich and famous, and Ron is not. Ron still knows Harry's family hates him and that he is basically a prisoner in his own home all summer. I know he is only 14, but I remember having some degree of understanding that wealth ≠ happiness when I was in High School, and that what Harry has is nothing to be jealous of.

The DH is honestly more on Rowling than the character. If the horcrux pushes Ron to fuck off and leave his friends, then Harry and Hermione should have done some stupider shit as well. Granted, Ron still ditched them so it is a fuckup.

***** Yeah but it was always him who does that. Outside PoA where Harry and Hermione have a brief row and then stick together it's only ever Ron who gets jealous and causes problems (and it wasn't just twice as I recall).

And Ron being terrified did make sense on its own, but the whole scenario it's wrapped in felt so off as to justify him leaving the picture for a large section of the book through jealousy yet again, and that's the problem of his characterisation in that it felt throughout the books things were designed just for Ron to be the worst of the three and then "redeem" during the book yet then do something similar later in the series.

The Weasleys are one of the most well-known source of strife while least supported families yet the occupied Ministry takes zero action in terms of hostages or anything while other families lose certain members as hostages to keep their families in line? All they do is make the ghoul look like an ill Ron with a crap wig and that somehow works?

Like most complaints it mostly comes down to Rowling's writing, in this case her placing the Weasley family on a pedestal by the end of the series.

******* How am I ignoring her betrayal by flat out mentioning it? That's kind of my argument in part, that Hermione and Harry (along with other characters who have one book bust up) are moved on from very quickly while Ron being jealous or flat out leaving the trio as an arc happens several times.

Ron is resentful of Hermione in a number of the books, most of all in PoA (and withdraws for parts of it as I recall), in GoF he actively goes all "fuck you, you clearly must've just entered this fatal tournament to be more famous", in HBP he becomes a cocky arsehole when he's the centre of attention and the only consequence of it seems to be to have him realise he really wants Hermione, and then in DH he leaves again.

He's used over and over again making the same character failings again and again, undoing growth in previous books which isn't very realistic and more a sign that Rowling didn't know what to do with him half the time. She over-relied on Hermione being the clever one (especially as the books went on and jumped all over) and Harry being the hero (apart from OotP where he spends half of it being a mopey arse) but for Ron outside his family issues he doesn't half have little to do (hence why everyone remembers the chess scene from the first book/film so well I'd reckon).

And the Weasleys were treated differently. The regime knew all of them were working for the other side in some way yet believe the most abrupt "we surrender" while other families do get hostages taken very early in comparison. The closest to a hostage they ever get is Ginny at Hogwarts but even there she's still openly in rebellion and nothing happens...

As for the pedestal stuff, come on, even earlier in the series Rowling pulled out of the harsh treatment for the Weasley's when others face long-term repercussions. We never really get any detail of how Ginny was affected by the Chamber affair, characters who are attacked by a deadly snake somehow survive when others died, it's only right at the end of the series that they finally suffer a loss despite all the situations they get in and how many are in rebellion throughout the series, and Rowling definitely seems to make very roughshot justifications why so many main or major supporting characters all shack up with Weasleys.

And I agree, that Hermione was an arse throughout PoA in particular, it was her book where she was largely criticised.

He has the worst characterisation of the trio because he's given little to do by himself yet is overused compared to the others as a negative or joke character.

#+begin_quote
  "Ron is funny, very funny; he's insensitive. There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humour comes from" ([[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/edmonton-journal/20071023/282278135970051]]).
#+end_quote

He's far too often left with little to do yet is used too much as the "drama" character in more than one book, when it's a character journey he's already done. Hermione was a complete know it all arsehole in much of the first three books, PoA in particular where her and Ron's arguments and her snitching overshadow a great deal of it but then is given a redemption arc in that book while Ron is left laid up in hospital to give Sirius a bit of characterisation while Harry and Hermione are perfectly fine despite getting thrown around by the Whomping Willow.

Ron seems to move past his flaws over the course of four and then five in particular but then suddenly goes backwards with the whole quidditch debacle in six (which again is used in part as a "isn't Hermione so smart" motif for the 500th time) and then in seven of course he has to be the one who quits the search first.

Like I say, I don't hate or even really dislike Ron, I just don't really like him that much compared to other characters as I find him the weakest of the three as a trio because Rowling failed to give him his moments in much of the series to shine, with some of his most well-remembered being the earliest of the books, while his flaws kept repeating to a greater extent than any other. If anything a great arc for him of appreciating his family and not seeing them as a weight or burden could've happened if Mr Weasley had died in OotP but instead that's never followed through as well as it could have been.

He basically suffers too much of "and Ron was there too"...

I know the series is a young adult series, I remember growing up with it. That doesn't prevent it from facing criticism over its characterisation, especially as the creator keeps trying to retroactively alter it like the literary George Lucas.

THIS. Bland, no personality, basically just an easy blank slate for self-insert for any kind of reader.

Which is why the vast majority of fics don't feature an OC or gender-switched protagonist, in comparison to other fandoms. All they have to do is use Harry's name and nothing bothersome like a distinct canon personality gets in the way of imagining a self-insert.

I've read lots of fanfiction but only read from Harry's POV because I have to. I've never read for his sake but for the sake of reading about other characters or plot. Or, at times, for the sake of seeing a much more interesting insert\OC in his stead, even if it's still named Harry.

**** You'll need to give more restrictions to get down to a top three.

The definition of series is important. Often times book series might have my all time favorite stories in it, but the overall series might get brought down from my favorite list. Usually this is a series like *Pern* by McCaffrey, where the author finished her stories in this world, but it was so popular she kept putting new stories into it. So the entire Pern series contains several good and great stories, but they are not all AAA material. Or you have series that get so popular that the storytelling changes over the course of the story (including *Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Star Wars*. This can be really detracting when the intro stories are structured as simple stores, but the follow ons are structured as tombs because the original story got popular enough for the author to write it the way they really wanted in the first place.

​

So, are single stories in series allowed? (*The Smallest Dragonboy* would be on most of my good lit lists, but is part of the aforementioned Pern series). How about series within series? (*Dragonsinger*, also in Pern, is stellar)\\
*1632* has some great series of entries in it, but also some duds. A phenomenal series, but not flawless.

​

Or how about "Series" with a single entry? Either because the author hasn't written a sequel yet or it was intended as a stand alone? (*The Practice Effect* by Brin and *The Martian* by Weir come to mind. Also *World War Z* by Brooks). Not sure it is fair to compare single entry works to multi entry works.

And then what about the definition of book? Two of my favorite all time literature are /light novels (/Novellas in the US) series, which certainly are series but don't quite stand up to the title of book. *Seirei no Moribito* by Uehashi (who is apparently a professor of Ethnology o_O) and *Twelve Kingdoms* by Ono. Twelve Kingdoms, by the way, stands in my opinion as the absolute best translation of literature to a visual medium. Both the novellas and the anime are great, and they are great in different ways as required by their medium.

​

Feel free to limit your request more if you want something specific, but for an initial list I'm going to go with /Series as marketed/ (Anne McCaffrey kinda said all her works live in the same universe, but they are not sold that way. However, her Pern books are sold as Pern # X), /Not allowing subseries within a series, No single entry series,/ and /Full length novel series only./

​

I would honestly have to ruminate a bit on it to say for sure my absolute top three, but these come to mind and all should be in my top 10-15 easily. In no particular order:

- *The Brain & Brawn Ship* series by Anne McCaffrey
- *Nantucket* series by S. M. Stirling
- *Twelve Kingdoms* by Ono (cheating I know, but!!!!)

I do want to note that if you change the limitations (for example, allowing single works and/or allowing subseries), the list would be VERY different. Or even "Overall good series with the best single entries in it".

Honorable Mention (These would win some awards if I gave out awards, just not best overall series):

- *1632* By Flint
- *Honor Harrington* by Weber
- *Dragonsinger* by McCaffrey
- *Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy* by Adams
- *Dahak* by Weber
- *Council Wars* by Ringo
- *Empire of Man* by Ringo/Weber
- *Stormlight Archive* by Sanderson

You might notice a lot of these are published by Baen. There is a reason for that. They are an extremely customer friendly sci-fi publisher that constantly turns out quality work. As a side effect many of these have the first book in the series free in Baen's online library.

Thing is, pretty much everything mentioned here would be well above HP. Thing is, none of these have the community HP does. McCaffrey might have if she didn't kill it off early by forbidding people to play in her sandbox :(

I know you asked for only three, but best overall series is hard to limit like that. If you narrow it a bit (best reader interactions, best character development, etc) I could be a lot more suscinct.

Including their free online library, CD's in the back of books containing earlier works of the author, etc. Eric Flint basically threw open his 1632 series to public collaboration. (He requests fanfiction, which is then edited and published as Canon. Also allows other professional authors to play in his world.)

Sanderson is... Very good for a particular style. If you like fantasy novels that read like they are stuck with the same restrictions as reality (so more like a sci-fi), kinda his thing.

Twelve Kingdoms is one of my all time favorites. It has one of the best character arcs I have ever seen. Youko, the main character from the first and third book, starts as a complete doormat of a character. So much so that it is grating. But somehow she is a complete badass by the end of the first book. And (this is important) she never takes a level in badass. Her development is so organic and gradual I can't tell you what chapter/episode the improvement happens in.

There is a great light novel series and a great anime adaption. It has one of the better novel to screen translations I have seen: the books contain a lot of inner monologues and conflicts. The anime chose to take those and externalize them (creating new characters to represent the previously internal fights). /And it works/. Most importantly, you still have the organic and gradual character growth.

For non-japanese speakers, there is a good sub and dub of the anime. There is a professional translation of the first few novels, but honestly they are significantly worse than the well known fan-translation available online. (As much as I hate to point people away from the official work, where the author gets paid, the fan translation is just a much, much better translation job. Plus he translated more books than got done professionally).

Plus it is a pretty standard 'japanese fantasy's setting with good world building. It is a great example of how Japanese fantasy works use vaugley Chinese worlds the same way Western works use vaugley medieval worlds. (Known well enough to give readers an anchor to latch onto but distant enough fantasy elements can be added without breaking immersion)

** Where do I start?

​

1.  Harry is a bad protagonist, as he's lazy and stupid and more interested in quidditch than survival!
2.  Hermione isn't a prodigy and doesn't hold a candle to the Marauders and Fred and George...her behaviour also isn't ok in the slightest (she doesn't get to snitch behind Harry's back about the Firebolt, she doesn't get to patronize him ("Oh, my poor stupid Harry you need me!") or boss him around, especially since she was to blind to see that Harry had been abused (damned, I am not the most perceptive guy, but even I could see that when I knew people better and I would have reported the case that I learned off if my friend hadn't begged me not to because his dad was well connnected and would probably get off!)
3.  Ron is a useless waste of perfectly good air and space - he is also a bad friend (but he's brave...I don't question that, I just think he is a fair weather friend!)
4.  (Almost) all the adults in the series are dumb (especially Dumbledore, McGonagall and Molly Weasley)
5.  Hagrid is a danger to himself and others and should not teach anything, no not even that water is wet!
6.  Voldemort is a bad villain (seriously, he's like a comic-book villain and that sucks!)
7.  Hogwarts is a bad school (rampant bullying, bad teachers, dangerous building (trick stairs/moving staircases? Seriously, that's injuries waiting to happen!))
8.  Remus is a coward and doesn't deserve Tonks
9.  Tonks should have never banged Remus
10. Molly is an overbearing nag and I hate her
11. A hero's journey would have been much better than this message of "It is ok to win through the sacrifice of others and sheer dumb luck and DEUS EX MACHINA!" (seriously, if I were Harry I'd be ashamed of myself!)
12. etc. etc. (more to come if I remember my other complaints :D )

What fair weather friend would stand in front of a mass murderer on a broken leg to try to defend you? Does that sound like something Ron did because he can't feel fear and pain and he just randomly felt like doing that?

*** 7) I really don't know much about history, but couldn't this be how a school was run in 1700-1800? (I don't even know if schools existed at that time).\\
Nowadays there are several rules of how teachers should behave, the ratio of students to adults in boarding schools, the punishments that can be given to students ...

But at that time there could be none of that.

**** Why would you be asking about schools in the 1700-1800 time period, when Harry Potter takes place in the 90s?

How about instead of just downvoting me, you actually respond? OP wasn't talking about schooling in the 1700-1800 times, he was talking about schooling in the 90s, since that's when Harry is there.

***** The statute of secrecy was made in 1689 and officially established in 1672 (HP wiki).

Because of the statute of secrecy the magical world and the muggle world have been separated, so we can assume that the rules of the wizarding world are different from what they are in the mundane world.\\
Because wizards have a longer life span (Dumbledore was 116 years old in Book 6 and Griselda Marchbanks who examined him in the N.E.W.T.) it is assumed that the speed of changing the rules of the magical world is slower.

And because there are healing spells and magic wells any bullyng can be seen as bad jokes that have no permanent effect.

And it wasn't me that downvoted you.

*** I'm willing to bet you were downvoted for point number 3. While Harry Potter is a children series, which is why all everything you listed happens, it's very agreeable that almost all of your points work.

Harry is only good at a few spells.

Hermione is an asshole to everyone until she almost dies by a troll (Harry and Ron did not like her at all until that point in the book).

Ron is a lot better in the books than he's portrayed in fanfiction, but still pretty well under Harry and Hermione.

None of the adults do anything in the series that actually help the 'good guys' at all.

Hagrid is a nice guy, but obviously too simple to help with much.

We're told Voldemort is a scary and terrible thing, but we're never actually shown that outside of him throwing tantrums.

Hogwarts, during Harry's time, is OBJECTIVELY a BAD school.

Molly is very overbearing, especially when it comes to telling Harry and Hermione what they can and can't do.

The books work when you're reading them as a young kid, like I did, but as an adult, A LOT of it starts to crack.

*** You're getting quite a bit of hate for this but I agree....especially with your points about Hermione, Tonks and Remus. People may say Ron is a bully for saying what he did about Hermione in first year. ..but let's face it, we all know he was right!
