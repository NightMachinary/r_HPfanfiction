My very first HP fanfiction that I fell in love with was a Jily fic "The Boy Who Loved Lily" by rinoaj. She took it down some years ago and I haven't been able to find the full version since. Does anyone know where I might be able to find it?

*** I've made multiple attempts to join the yahoo group but to no avail :( If I do find it I'll keep you posted because it was one of my favorite fan fics of all time.

** On her [[http://rinoaj.livejournal.com/][livejournal]] she said it is posted [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rinoaj/][here]]. I have never heard of this fic, but I enjoy the hunt for them. You need permission to gain access to the group and I have no idea if the group is still moderated. If you can't get it there, I didn't see it elsewhere.

** Isn't [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3409112/1/The_Boy_Who_Loved_Lily][this]] it? It's only one chapter, but the author's name is similar.
