  Karkaroff is caught as a death eater as probably a man in his twenties or thirties right?
#+end_quote

...whatever gave you that impression? Perhaps the way he looks in the movies? At any rate, I thoroughly resist the notion that barely-out-of-Hogwarts amateurs like Snape were the norm of what Voldemort recruited. I conceive of Karkaroff as having been in his 40's at least when Voldemort recruited him, and in his 60's or even 70's by /Goblet of Fire/.

** He sometimes is, but the only way that'll work in his favour if if Dumbledore takes him into the Order, because no matter how reformed Karkaroff gets, Voldemort hunts him down and kills him for his betrayal. Only way he's living is Fidelius, like staying at Grim Old Place.

It is my long-standing headcanon that he took the job of Durmstrang Headmaster mostly because, much like Hogwarts, Durmstrang has /really/ strong protective enchantments, and so it was one of the few places in the world where he felt safe.

  And yet Karkaroff died quite easily.

He didn't die in Durmstrang, if that's what's being implied here.

** There's a fic where he runs off after GoF and hides in the country with a dying/sick muggle and looks after the guy, I'm pretty sure when the guy dies he assumes his identity and he meets up with Bill Weasley because he's trying to do a ritual to check that Voldemort is truly dead and I guess he turns out to be a sort of good guy trying to do the right thing? I can't for the life of me remember the rest of the fic though!

**** Yeah, it's not a great story. Well they aren't tattoos but scars, but close enough. Interesting enough premise, not great execution

#+begin_quote
  Pre HBP. Days before his sixteenth birthday, Harry Potter disappears in a blaze of fire and magic. When he returns, few recognize him for who he is. He's out for Voldemort, as per the Task the Founders' set to him. And he isn't about to fail.
