Barty Crouch Sr had quite an interesting life, almost becoming the Minister and all. Yet I've never read a fic from his perspective, or where he was focused on. If anyone knows any fics where he plays a role, I would love to read them. Preferably nothing where he just appears for a chapter and then disappears. No bashing please.


** He features prominently in linkffn(Lesser Evils). It's a well-rendered portrayal, at that.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.
