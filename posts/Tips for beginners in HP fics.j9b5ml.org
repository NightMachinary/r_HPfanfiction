Any tips for beginners? I am thinking of starting my first fanfic and would like recent tips or suggestions of what people would like to read. I want to distance a little from the canon, but keeping the major plots. This is bad?

I am in between a Hufflepuff Harry or a Fem!Harry (one of my prompts is here if you are interested) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j8uydl/snape_obsesses_femharry_disturbing/]]

I would like to write something that people would like to read in general, and I see a lot of complaints about there being a lack of good fics of Harry in alternative houses or where Harry is originally a girl and I want to try to write something that is original and interesting. Any help? Thank you!


** The first tip is watch your spelling - both generally and with Potterverse specific words. eg. Make sure you spell 'expelliarmus' correctly and capitalise things like Avada Kedavra consistently. If someone is casting a spell, use the incantation, if they're referring to a spell, use the name (eg. the incantation is Avada Kedavra, but the name is 'The Killing Curse').

Second tip, watch your plotting. Make sure that what people are doing makes sense and follows on from what you're written before. If you've got a character out for revenge who suddenly gives up on it with no warning, that'll be jarring to read. But if that character has a conversation with someone where they really reflect on their vengeance and where it'll take them, that gives a little more foundation to the 'giving up on revenge' plot point.

Second tip two, electric boogaloo - foreshadowing is your friend. If you wanna write a twist or a surprise, think of some things that if you added them together, would maybe give a reader the ability to guess your twist/surprise, then pepper those things throughout the story (eg. if the killer was disliked by the family dog, have someone claim to have heard barking the night of the murder). You can have as few or as many as you like, but I tend to go with three.

Generally, people dislike when you hit all the stations of canon - meaning that whatever your change is, the story still happens pretty much exactly how the books do. There is an audience for that, but it's a popular thing to dislike (on this subreddit, at least) so be prepared for at least a little dislike if you do that.

Finally (and most importantly), try to have fun and learn from what you're doing. Remember that this is your first story, so nobody is expecting Shakespeare, and that this is a hobby, so it really ought to be fun. :)

If you're interested in getting someone to talk over your story more specifically or to help with grammar and spelling and so on, you could try the Beta Bartering thread over on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. They have one a week and you basically post about your story and see if anyone is interested in helping. :)

Good luck with your fic!

** Sorry I'm not into harry as an mc at all so in terms of what people want to read I'm not much help.

But as a fic writer in general there are 2 things that I work on explicitly that make a fic infinitely more readable. (This is beyond basic grammar and structure of course.)

1. Outline it, if not write it entirely before you start to publish. Have a clear beginning and end in mind, and, depending on the length, some of the stuff in between. Every chapter needs to have a purpose and make progress toward that ending.

2. Maintain tight perspective. It's ok to actually change perspective as long as it's clear enough. But it can be really hard to enjoy a fic when the perspective shifts are hard to follow.

Combo corallary of 1 and 2: Know what each character is doing and/or thinking during a scene, even if you don't write out their perspective. Your overall characterizations will be better if you can get into their headspace throughout the major points of the fic.

** Write what you're interested in, not what you think others want to read. Ultimately, you're the one who is going to have to write the thing, and /keep/ writing it. The more enthusiasm you have, the easier it will be to keep writing. And it'll also probably show through in the writing as well.

This sub isn't representative of the HP fanfic community as a whole. There's tons of different niches you can fill. So things that some people hate will attract great praise from others. You can't please everyone, and that's okay.

Second, think about what your story is really about, and write that. In other words, make sure your fic has focus. If your big idea involves the Triwizard Tournament, then start in 4th year. There's no need to get bogged down in three whole years of prologue (or worse, prologue starting with Harry's childhood). Alternatively, if your fic is about the relationship between two characters across all 7 years, then you don't need to go into detail about everything else Harry is doing in his life.

** Write every character so that you could think of a context where their actions seem reasonable.

** I could give you lots of advice on writing but in the end it is you who has to enjoy the project since you are not doing it for profit. Overall, check your spelling both in English (or whatever language you write in) and HP-speak. Make sure you have a clear plot. Make sure that the situations and character descriptions are realistic (canon compliant or in-your-universe-compliant and the conversation flows naturally with no awkwardly-staged-scripted interactions). If you want to please other readers look for what tropes are popular nowadays, but also suit your style, and use those for your plot.
