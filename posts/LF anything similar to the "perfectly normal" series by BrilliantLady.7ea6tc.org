I just finished the first four parts of the series and I really enjoyed them, so I was hoping to find something similar with: - a reasonable Voldemort - a dark side that actually makes sense - a Harry that actually thinks for himself


** Colubrina writes a lot of reasonable Dark Side fics, but it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11508846/1/A-Big-Ball-of-Wibbly-Wobbly][A Big Ball of Wibbly Wobbly]] that stands out for this theme. There is a reasonable Voldemort. However, Hermione centric. (Tomione, if you want to be precise.)

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
