** Probably one of the better insights to Dementor culture and life. I've seen very few, and probably only one other that has described them in a redeemable way. I'm not sure Hermione's entirely realistic, it has a slight flavour of 'Hermione/Harry is the only person ever to consider being polite to subhumans like house elves, centaurs, and goblins, and befriend the nation, becoming an honorary member, all due to their Muggle background.'

I'd like it if it were a little more Main-Dementer-Friend saw an unusual human and decided to befriend her, and less, Unusual Human blows Dementer's minds, having never seen one like her ever before.

** I'm up to the end of Chapter 2 and I just had a funny thought; what if the Dementors created a marching band to parade through Azkaban? Play entertaining songs, let the prisoners get amused by them, suck out their amused thoughts relating to the song, rinse and repeat.

**** Mm...perhaps not that silly. I finished reading it, up to chapter 8.

The thing is, in this story, dementors are portrayed as just pulling out happy memories; they don't stop someone from generating any more, and it's perfectly possible for them to rein in their aura. Which goes against canon a bit, but hey, it's fanfiction.

With this variety of dementor, it would actually make perfect sense for them to try and make humans happy so that they had more food. Perhaps if the story continues the plot will steer towards dementor/human cooperation?

***** Maybe. Though there's few chances of that at this point, since there hasn't been an update in 13 years.

** u/Ember_Rising:
#+begin_quote
  She knew of only one curse that might make it through his shield. "Avada Kedavra!"

  A stream of green lit up the space between the buildings again, and indeed, it did not bounce off but cut through the Death Eater's shield without even a sparkle. Hermione felt intensely relieved as Pettigrew went down.
#+end_quote

That's it? That's all that happens in her mind when she casts the most Dark, horrid, Unforgivable curse in existence? I know Hermione is a bit quick when it comes to throwing spells at people (Neville), but there should be more analysis and thought about such a /huge/ moment, which carries massive implications.

*** That is perfectly true. It was one of my qualms with the story --- I do have a few. However, the very creative exploration of the Dementors and their "culture" outweighed the flaws to me, which is why I recommended the story anyway.
