** It's definitely Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery. It's the first in a trilogy, and one of my all-time favorites. I'm surprised most people haven't heard of it.

**** You should also check out the author's other series, which starts with Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link. Post DH, but AU. Harry is still powerful but not as strong as in the Veil of Mystery series. EDIT: And to clarify, Harry/Kingsley is NOT a romantic pairing. linkffn(5238750)

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

  {Hermione POV} Ug. Bra shopping. It's a horrible experience as it is, but it's even worse when you run into someone you know. Especially if that someone is Harry. {One Shot- somewhat hhr}

*** In case anyone else is wondering, this is it for sure. At least the mindset part. I haven't gotten to the dreams yet but I assume this is the right one, since [[/u/chaoticconfiguration]] says so.

This story has the tone you would expect from a sequel to a book where you find out the protagonist's superpower is the power of love. It may lay it on a little thick at times, but it's still good. It's good enough to ignore the fact that harry teaches year 1-5 defense as a 6th year. And it's clearly written pre-hbp, so there's no chance of a rehash of the horcrux hunt.

** In [[/u/taure][u/taure]] â€˜s The One He Feared, Harry has all of Dumbledore's memories up to the duel with Grindelwald. It's some of the best writing I've seen in a fanfic, and sticks close to the tone of canon.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** People keep getting the flairs wrong... this is "Fic Search". "Request" is for asking for stories that meet a particular guideline, as opposed to finding a specific story you read and then lost.

*** Sorry about that. I'd never seen that flair before. I'm also on mobile and I don't even know if I had the option for flair unless it's a keyword in the title.

Edit: also, I don't know if this helps, but it's kinda both. I remember one or maybe 2 particular stories but if someone links something that isn't one of those but meets some of the criteria, then I'm not going to be disappointed or anything.
