Yo!\\
I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10814626/1/A-Fresh-Bouquet][A Fresh Bouquet]] which is a fanfic where someone essentially put a self-insert original character into the story. I quite liked that fic (too bad it's unfinished and extremely irregular in releases) and am wanting to know if there are any other fanfics which are similar.

â€‹

The rules for what I'm looking for are:

1. There must be a character which is from "our world" (and thus knows of the whole Story, though they may be a person that never read the books and only know bits and pieces from second-hand knowledge)
2. They must be a character that either didn't exist in the books, or which never really showed up (that is, they might have been mentioned by name one or two times in non-important situations, like by a professor during class)


** There are a couple ones that are currently being posted on the forums that are pretty good.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/][Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw]] Shadenight is a monster who is currently posting around 1-5 thousand words a day.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]] This fic actually has an original method by which the character is inserted, which after having read a bajillion SI's is pretty freakin rare and good.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** I thought I'd chime in with a bit of self-promotion if that's okay:

I'm currently writing a Stephen King crossover Self-Insert with elements of Twin Peaks. The protagonist finds himself in the Harry Potter universe a year before Harry arrives and each new year he has to deal with material from a Stephen King book. For example the first year is /The Shining/, which I'm about halfway through at the moment, and his second year will be /IT/. I'm doing my best to make the King books as accessible as possible to readers who haven't read them, and the same again with Twin Peaks, although it is more of a fusion with Twin Peaks than a direct crossover as no characters from the latter will appear.

It's probably terrible, but it's fun to write and I'm trying to not make the OC/SI overpowered. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-fire-waltz-harry-potter-si-with-stephen-king-twin-peaks-elements.49613][It can be found here]].

I would also second the recommendation for /Umbrus Shade/, if you actually want a good Self-Insert fic though!

*** Hello.\\
Thanks for the tip. If I'm getting it right, your story is /OC arrives in Harry Potter universe and has his own adventures inspired by Stephen King/ which sounds fun enough. Though unless I misunderstood your character won't actually interfere with Harry & Co. I really enjoy when an OC or self-insert messes with a story by trying to change it so that's kinda what I want to find.

The /Umbrus Shade/ sounds great though. Going to check that one out right now

*** Ok, I just read about 20 chapters of /Umbrus Shade/ and I really like it so far. Then I almost got a stroke when I started looking at the publishing dates. There's good writing and there's fast writing, but this is the first time I've seen good AND fast writing. *How does someone write that much so fast!?!?!?*

** [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] has one of the better self-insert fics, and certainly the most amusingly titled, in "Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals."

It takes a while, but it does eventually match your criteria. Paragon's SI eventually becomes the Muggle Studies Professor.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
