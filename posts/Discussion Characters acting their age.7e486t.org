So, a common complaint about HP fanfiction is that younger characters act atypically to their ages. This complaint is justified, to an extent, but do you really want 11 to 16-year-olds to act like /real/ people their age?

I think most of us can remember what we were like between these ages - and for a lot of us, it was not flattering. Yes, in some instances, characters must definitely be written like younger people. For example, a Harry who hasn't experienced Voldemort and lost his parents would act his age. But if you want a Harry that "acts his age" but also a super!fic? The two can sometimes contradict each other.

A typical sixteen-year-old isn't gonna do even a quarter of the shit that someone in such a fic would need to do. They would masturbate, goof off, /maybe/ do homework, and masturbate - rinse and repeat. Likewise, if you want to go even younger (e.g. younger than eight), the child character can become more of a drag than an actual character. There has to be nuance - with great power being counterbalanced with /a bit/ of immaturity, but I bet that a lot of you wouldn't be able to stand reading about more-or-less realistic preteens.

My answer is NO. I don't want to read about average teens.

People should realize the Trio was anything but average. Average teens would have long collapsed under the pressure they were in. Ron, the most average of the three, also gets the most hate.

On the other hand, teenagers are perfectly capable of becoming vicious killers. Read [[https://www.amazon.com/Old-Breed-At-Peleliu-Okinawa/dp/0891419063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511133383&sr=8-1&keywords=with+the+old+breed][this book]] and you will find out.

*** This.

Harry, Hermione and Ron were way ahead of the curve in canon. Heck even some of the other characters like Draco were ahead of the curve too. I mean in first year Draco had the foresight to trick Harry and Ron into going out after curfew. Thats pretty good planning for an 11 year old kid.

Personally I think that authors that try to write 11 year olds actually make them act like toddlers which is kind of creepy to see. I would honestly rather see a character written to be a bit more mature than see a character written to be immature, it makes them seem mentally handicapped.

**** You just reminded me of a really weird scene of a fic that I read, in it Lily was alive and raised fem!Harry and she put her shoes on even though fem!Harry was already eleven and the way she was described hiding behind Lily was also weird, because it was written like a six year would hide behind their mum. It´s generally worse the younger the characters are, especially in the 1 to 6 age range. Though it is more obvious to me because I see my niece and nephew at least twice a week since they were born.

***** This is the exact thing I was talking about, you would have to really 'baby' an 11 year old to get them to the point where they have to hide behind their parent when meeting strangers.

You also see a lot of this kind of thing in fics that feature angst/hurt/comfort, Harry usually breaks down and devolves into a literal man child. it's really creepy.

What I was talking about was characters that are 11 being portrayed as 5 years old in the way they throw tantrums, act all "cutesy" and use very childish language.

** There's also a big difference though between teenagers not acting like teenagers and teenagers not acting like literally any normal person would. I recently dropped a fic for the exact reason that it seemed like the author had never heard a teenager speak before, but that was less because they sounded like adults and more because it was obvious the trying to be edgy teenage author thought that this was what cool, mature young adults sounded like and the result was stuff literally no one would ever say and me trying not to cringe as I read it before giving up.

Which is why a lot of people prefer post-Hogwarts fics - coincidentally it means that we also don't have to endure the 5754th retelling of how Malfoy baited Harry into revealing he's a parseltongue in the duel by an incompetent Lockhard.

** I think there is a huge difference between what you see in the books (which is certainly a bit more that you expect of kids at their age) and what you see in some fanfictions, which manages to go from 'stretching belief', skipping 'that isn't even possible' right into 'ok I'm uncomfortable now'. Like any romance fic set during their 11th year.

And honestly, having your characters be more mature than cannon is more of a 'you are out of character' problem than anything else.

And I still maintain that Hogwarts chemically castrates all its kids through Pumpkin Juice. /cough cough/ The exact effects of doing that to a school of kids left the the imagination of the readers (and helps cover up other problems)

However, it's also poking fun at how Voldemort comes up with bonkers plans in cannon (seriously the whole triwizard thing as well as the stealing the stone one is something Emperor Pilaf would be proud of) and how Harry and Co manage to keep foiling the death eaters and voldemort despite being kids.

** I already posted here once about how you can not compare 11-16 year old muggles to wizards, but I want to bring up another point that has been somewhat glossed over.

The average life expectancy for Wizardkind in the 1990's was just over 135 years of age. However we also know that many Witches/Wizards can reach much higher with Madam Marchbanks supposedly nearing 200, and Dumbledore at 150 and still going strong. If you do the scaling math... this means that a 70-year-old witch/wizard is the equivalent of a 40-year-old muggle. 100 would be 60. And so on.

This brings up interesting aspects because it means that Witches/Wizards are expected to grow up extremely fast (partially due to the culture and partially due to the fact they wield a weapon), but then once they hit their late teens the aging is DRAMATICALLY slowed. That is to say, children are children from 0-10 or so, then develop extremely quickly from 11-15, and then are basically adults at 16+ and just finishing their school training (remember you can graduate with just OWLs).

But than because of the length of life, you have to delay what amounts to "middle age" and other such "tags" we put on life periods as muggles. Effectively, there is much less difference between a 40-year-old and an 18-year-old wizard, than there would be between the same 2 aged muggles.

So in leymans terms... basically think of a 40 or even 50 year old wizard/witch as still a "young adult".

** We do need to keep in mind that wizarding world teens are not exactly going to be comparable to muggle world teens (OUR WORLD) to begin with. There should be no reason they would act "exactly" how we would. The Wizarding world is a vastly different environment to be growing up in and you are literally carrying around what amounts to a possible weapon and dealing with an entirely different cultural environment.

So lets not think of Wizarding 11-16 year olds as being comparable to muggle 11-16 year olds (coming from a muggle world that we, as readers, live in).

*** Just think about the time period the wizard world is still stuck in, Basically the 12th or 13th century for most of it. It makes an unfortunate amount of sense to have arranged marriages, marriage contracts, and kids acting much more mature than their modern day counterparts. In that time period there were "Men" cutting down trees, building log cabins or other such country houses, raising some crops and +getting+ looking for a wife before they turned 16. That doesn't make them more... experienced, just...they had to grow up faster in that society.

That being said, its yet another reason to look down on the naive muggleborns who have no idea how the world "really works" and are still children well into their mid teens.

**** It's... /not/ stuck in the 13th century, though. For one thing, there's no opressive clergy breathing down everyone's neck. It's a rather liberal society (Death Eaters notwithstanding, and Beings are another issue entirely; let's focus on the hupmans), life expectancy is centuries ahead of the muggle one, wizards scarcely have to truly a work a day in their life anyway because magic, there's no nobility (the Wizengamot as an inherited body of lords is pure fanon; Lucius Malfoy himself is never given a title in the books) even if the purebloods wish there was, it's a democracy...

You only get the /feeling/ of a medieval world for cosmetic reasons, essentially; the wizarding world's fashion sense seems medieval to the muggle eye, and because magic can repair most things most buildings are really old.
