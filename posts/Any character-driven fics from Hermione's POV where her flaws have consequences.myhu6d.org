Do you have any recommendations of fics with a flawed Hermione from her POV?

I'm looking for a rounded Hermione with good and bad traits that feels in character and in line with (book) canon. Preferably where her "flaws" have consequences for how the story progress. Basically, character-driven stories you think are "spot-on" in their characterisations of Hermione!

No bashing, all ships and taggings are fine :)


** The best flawed-but-good Hermione fic is, in my opinion, the sadly abandoned [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/][Vera Rozalsky]]. Any flaw you can think of from trying to do everything alone to steam-rolling others to thinking she knows best, it is in this fic and is lovingly and gently deconstructed. It's very clear that the writer loves Hermione's character warts and all.

Other assorted flawed!Hermione fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There's a List for That]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/GatherYourStrength/pseuds/GatherYourStrength][GatherYourStrength]] - she had to be stunned in order to get her to rest. Almost worked herself to death. (Note: some chapters are in other people's POV, but it is decidedly Hermione-centric)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/][Cry Out, Curlew]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]] - worked herself to collapse (Warning: abandoned; there are also chapters not in Hermione's POV but most are)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6766210][Will you?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SinBin/pseuds/SinBin][SinBin]] - thought she was right and tried to handle stuff on her own. Now, she is running from the Skrewts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/474762][More Than Kisses]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Rozarka/pseuds/Rozarka][Rozarka]] - tendency for self-isolation bites in her the butt and almost wrecks her relationship (Note: only half of this is in Hermione's POV)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21187844][Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Coulsdon_Eagle/pseuds/Coulsdon_Eagle][Coulsdon_Eagle]] - She ends up as Triwizard Champion because of a spell she secretly put on Harry. The entire story is the consequence.

  Redirected and rebranded, the Death Eaters have dismantled and destroyed everything the Light holds dear. With their society on the verge of extinction, Hermione is the only one who can fix the future. At least, that's what she keeps telling herself. Armed with plans, lists, books, and a house elf, she won't stop until things have been set right. But what will happen when she doesn't arrive at her intended destination? Will her plans to work alone still hold water? Or will she sink among the endless waves of memory and regret?

  Hermione is solving a problem. It's not her fault that her solution has run into some...unforeseen obstacles. Prompt: "um, i don't know you, but you are headed right towards the grounds, and i don't have time to explain that i accidentally let all the blast-ended skrewts out of their cages, stop asking questions, you need to RUN"

  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** Golden something? It's on ao3 and Hermione critical. It's about when Hermione attacks Ron in 6th year. If you're interested I'll find it when I wake up.
