I've been on a kick of WBWL stories, particularly the twin ones and a persistent element of sorts seems to keep popping up, the twin believed to be the boy-who-lived has a “scar that resembles the letter V”. Does anyone know where this came from or maybe some early examples? I'm interested in these sort of “canon in fanon” story elements.


** V is for Voldemort

*** Yeah, I get that, I just wonder why it's something that pops up frequently, or why it's not like another rune such as how people depict the lightning scar as a Norse rune of power.
