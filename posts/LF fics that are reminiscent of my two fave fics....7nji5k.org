So without a doubt my favourite fic finds (through the sub) this year have been All the Young Dudes (which in my mind even if you're not wolfstar- and I am not - this is the best marauder fic out there and it's AU) and the Innocent series (which is literally everything I have ever wanted in a Sirius raises Harry fic). Obviously the fics are different for those who've read them. ATYD is a marauder AU where Remus was in an orphanage after his father kills himself out of guilt over Remus' condition. The Innocent series in premise is just Sirius raises Harry after escaping Azkaban, but in a lot of ways is also HP and what if he had a competent adult caring for him from age 9? He does not become HP and the fic that he's scary smart and questions everything... he becomes Harry with a guardian who isn't an oblivious idiot getting thrown into every random situation possible. Anyway - looking for recs that fit either of these two themes and vague plot lines - but that have an air of mature writing that doesn't make you want to bash your head in, which is really what sticks out to me in these fics! Thanks in advance!


** Just finished a marauders plan, and loved it. I also loved the innocent series

*** Not super crazy about Marauders Plan... I find it a bit slow and the characters a bit OOC. But thanks for the rec all the same! :)
