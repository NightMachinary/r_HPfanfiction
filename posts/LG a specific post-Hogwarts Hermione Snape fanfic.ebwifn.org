Hi, I'm looking for a specific fic I read a while ago. From what I remember, at the beginning of the fic Hermione is stuck in a low-paid administrative job where one day she is visited by Snape. Later on he proposes she works for/with him. Does anyone have any clue as to the title of the fic? It's really driving me crazy. Thanks!


** I believe I've read this but now it's driving me crazy too! I can't remember it either!

But also if you want a good one, you should read “And they didn't live happily ever after” by Betz
