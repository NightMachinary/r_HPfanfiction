Next-gen and beyond, anything that shows how the wizarding world changes over the decades following canon and how it may adapt to changes in the muggle world (internet culture, climate change, space travel, AI overlords)


** Alexandra Quick series would be your best bet.

** There are a lot of next-gen fics that address this, but I'd start with *Annals of Arithmancy*, actually. It's the epilogue to a million-word series, but if you just want the magifuturism you can probably pick it up at the beginning of this one.

NoahPhantom's *Albus Potter* series constructs a ridiculously overpowered progression of magic with a very valid and concrete reasoning behind it. It's probably the one of the best "magic systems" of any Harry Potter fanfic. The impending collapse of the Statute of Secrecy is also mentioned in this one.

*** Actually read Annals as it got published. The Arithmancer series was one of my first fics I read. Haven't done Albus Potter, can you link it?

**** Knew I forgot to link. By the way, there's a similar series to this one by Vekin87. It's also good but touches less on the stuff you were interested in. linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

** I'm subscribed to this great fic called Mi Aedijekit by local_doom_void. linkao3(18851794)

The premise is that Harry was discovered to be a horcrux by Voldemort and was subsequently given the Draught of Living Death. Over 1,000 years pass before Harry wakes, and the world he emerges into is completely unrecognisable. The author has put a ton of work into the world-building and it's frankly one of the most creative fics I've seen in a long, long time.

** This might be more in the future then you're looking for, but Mi Adijekit is set 1,000 years in the future and is an incredible and unique piece of world building. It's a WIP Harry/Voldemort but so far that's not a big part of the story. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794]]
