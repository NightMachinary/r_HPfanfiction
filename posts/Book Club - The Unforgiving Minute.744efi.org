What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/][The Unforgiving Minute]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsd2xYdHliN0NrN0E][Soul Play]]* by /snapesforte/. It's on old fic and isn't online anymore, so you'll have to use the link above. I think it has one of the best characterizations of Snape (who has been lacking in the Book Club for a bit). Here's some more information:

** I have a fundamental problem with this fic (and other similar time travels):

Voldemort's hiding place during the TWT period was known, and he was much weaker in his homunculus form. It would be much easier and safer for the time traveler(s) to strike at him directly than waiting for the Graveyard event.

Once Voldemort had been captured, they could subject him to ALL KINDS of treatments without killing him, and it would be so much easier to hunt for Horcruxes without his interference.

I now heavily favor time travels that completely avoid the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme.

****** They knew Voldemort was hiding out in Little Hangleton prior to his resurrection, and he was WEAK in his homunculus form.

There are many ways to neutralize Voldemort without killing him, and then they could hunt Horcruxes without much pressure.

Even if Voldemort escaped again in wraith form, he would be weakened further than after the PS debacle. Furthermore, Wormtail and Barty Jr would certainly be finished off, and he would have even fewer means to attempt another resurrection with the same method, because the time travelers would certainly VANISH ALL his ancestors' remains. His enemies would also have plenty of time to hunt for his Horcruxes.

Oh true I forgot about that. Perhaps Harry didn't know the exact date (vs. something like the date of the maze, which could easily be looked up) and didn't want to take a risk since he needed an exact day.

But yeah it would've been better if the author explained that.

******** A raid on that weak Voldemort in Little Hangleton would be A LOT LESS RISKY than storming Azkaban or Gringotts. Even Malfoy Manor with its excellent protection would be far more dangerous.

** I'm not sure quite how to react to this story.

The action scenes are among the best I've seen: really imaginitive sequences of spells with logical countermeasures and realistic consequences. After a while, though, it began to feel like trying to take a refreshing drink by sipping from a firehose - there was almost too much action in too short a space.

The interludes at Grimmauld Place didn't work for me. Smith was too much of an asshole, Wood was wildly OOC, Sprout... wtf was she doing there? Ginny was just eye candy. The others weren't around long enough. Only Hermione was in any way enjoyable to read, and she didn't have a huge amount of page time.

I found it difficult to have much empathy with Harry. He spent so much time being a badass that there wasn't much characterisation beyond being an unstoppable duelling machine.

It all adds up to a story that I feel I should have enjoyed more than I actually did. It's well-written and an original take on an old trope but has too many flaws for me to imagine re-reading any time soon.

** I'm still reading this one. I'm 20% in and so far it's been rubbing me the wrong way. I'm going to keep reading until I either get into it or get completely turned off it, but I hope it engages me soon. The premise really seemed interesting and up my alley.

In particular, the parts that bothered me started off with when he broke into Azkaban for Bellatrix. All the description of how he magicked the cell bars and then other cell bars etc it just seemed really hard for me to picture. Like I couldn't quite get what the author was imagining? It felt more show-offy than like cool action if that makes any sense. Then when he gets to Bellatrix and she shows him that flashback to what she did to that pregnant woman with her wand... I just blanked. I mean you could have gotten just the same effect/served the same purpose alluding to what happened with the wand, but I felt the circumstance was horrific enough without including rape. Especially, ON screen.

Anyway, we'll see how it goes from here.

*** So, I'm at the part where he is trying to get the key to Bellatrix's vault. He takes polyjuice to impersonate Lucius. Then he fools Narcissa, confunds her, slips her veritaserum... only to Imperio her at the end? What purpose did any of that serve if he was going to Imperio her anyway? It was working beforehand. These sorts of things just pulls me out of the story and I'm really not one that notices every small detail. This just seemed really blatant.

** It's been awhile since I read /The Unforgiving Minute/ but I recall it fondly, one of the hands-down best action thrillers in the fandom. VotN consistently writes good words and pushes the fandom into creative corners it wouldn't otherwise go.
