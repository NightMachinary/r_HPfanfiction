*** All the pure bloods then try to get Harry and Voldemort together because it goes against the most ancient traditions to come between soul bonded mates. Part of their motive is their fear of being cursed if they hurt someone's soul bonded mate.

** 6th year he's seated around the common room the 6th year's are all seated around playing cards while some are just chatting and he hears Lavender prattle on about Soul Bonds in her favorite book, Harry cracks one of his sarcastic remarks before Lav goes on about what a soul bond is, before Ron just goes in a real low voice "Emotions, Dreams, seeing what he's doing, your sure you aren't supposed to bugger the fucker to death" Harry laughs for a moment before stopping, he isn't Soul Bound to a fucking Snake... So why was he able to see through Nagini's Eyes the night Arthur got bit... Unless He like the damned Snake is a FUCKING HORCRUX
