I'm curious as to people's thoughts on this. I usually read crossovers for the purpose of reading specific characters in another fandom. But what if a story just fuses the fandoms together but the characters are not introduced in the story whatsoever.

Ex: Harry Potter and GOT.

Harry and other characters are in Westeros but none of the characters from GOT are seen or have even one line of dialogue. It's just Harry and co. having their own adventure in Westeros.


** Do the GoT characters still exist? Are the events of GoT still happening and Harry and co. just aren't involved with that part of the story? If so, then yes. I'd call that a crossover.

If HP character are taking the place of GoT characters in the setting or story, I'd say no. In that case, I'd label it an AU.

Either way, I'd put that there's only HP characters in your tags or summary so that people aren't expecting the typical crossover.

** For me personally, I think fusions are still crossovers so long as the characters aren't In-Name Only.

** I would only post it as a crossover if actual knowledge of that second universe is needed. For example, the Denarian Trilogy isn't marked as a crossover. So I think you could get away without marking it as such.

*** I strongly disagree. If the story with HP characters takes place in Westeros it's a crossover. A universe isn't just defined by its characters and when I read a Harry Potter fanfiction I don't want to read about Westeros and White Walkers.

Labeling such a story not as a crossover is straight up disingenuous and you will get (deserved) angry reviews.

@OP: Do not listen to this terrible advice. What you are talking about is very clearly a crossover and needs to be posted as such.

** If actually knowing the other universe is required to understand/enjoy your story, or characters/very specific plot elements are in it, definitely mark it as a crossover.

But if it's just an alternate universe, I don't think it's necessary. Just a quick note that xyz universe is being used and that familiarity with the other fandom isn't needed.

** Yes. Of all the characters that exist in a fantasy world, the world itself is oftentimes the main one.

** Is it clear that they are in Westeros? With crossovers the sky's the limit on what you can do. If you want them doing their own thing in the crossover setting without interacting with the setting's main cast, fine.

*** Yes it's clear that they're in Westeros. I was just curious if at that point you'd mark it a crossover or just write in the summary GOT - AU

**** If they are /clearly/ in Westeros then yes, do mark it as such. If someone wrote a story in which a character from whatever other work ended up going to a wizarding school that is clearly based on what we've seen in Harry Potter and if they made active use of the Harry Potter lore, even if none of the characters originally from this series appeared in the story you'd want it labelled as a crossover, at the very least because it makes it easier for people to understand what is happening. This goes both ways.

*** Sorry, it was an example example idk why I didn't just put down that I'm writing an hp x chilling adventures of Sabrina crossover. For some reason GOT was just a go to example.
