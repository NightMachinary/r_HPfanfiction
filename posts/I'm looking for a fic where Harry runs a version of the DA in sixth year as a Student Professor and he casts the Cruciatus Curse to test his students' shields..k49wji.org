:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Edit: It's not Taking Control, but [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/7__Honest_Abe/][This Means War]].

I'm pretty sure that it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]] but I can't find what chapter it's in or if it's even in it!

In the scene, I think that Harry's duelling against at least three younger students and that Snape (at least, I think it was Snape) was watching everything going on while invisible.


** I don't recognize the scene, but I am compelled to poke a logic-shaped hole in it. Neither the Torture Curse (crucio) nor the Killing Curse CAN be blocked (I believe the same goes the the Imperius Curse too), so no shield would work. Unless that's the point.

Okay, rant done, I wish you luck* on your fic search.

Edit: I knew this comment was going to stir up debate, so I did do some research before posting. I did some more digging and as it turns out, the original sources I used were flimsy. Even originally I did not mean anything truly negative, and I was just pointing out what I thought was a deviation from canon. A fanfiction author can do whatever they want and I wholeheartedly support that.

*** If we're going to be pedantic here, I'll point out that that's not actually true. Crouch/Moody specifically said that the Killing Curse can't be blocked, but not anything about blocking the other two Unforgivables. Fanon has mostly decided that they can't be blocked either, but canon is silent on the matter.

**** I had to do a LOT of digging to get to reliable sources (of which I found ONE), but here is a question from W.O.M.B.A.T.S (the standard exams) as stated by the Harry Potter Lexicon:

1. Which of the following is FALSE? a. Patronuses vary in strength according to which animal's form they take. b. There is only one documented case of a person surviving the Killing Curse. c. Hags have only rudimentary magic, similar to that observed in trolls. d. No defensive spell exists against the Cruciatus Curse. e. Giants have traditionally allied themselves with the Dark Arts.

That doesn't give an exact answer, but it confirms the POSSIBILITY that the Cruciatus Curse can't be defended against.

The Fandom Harry Potter Wiki also mentions that Wonderbook: Book of Spells has more evidence to support this, but it doesn't list said evidence anywhere. So no, I admit that I cannot say for certain that crucio is unblockable, but I personally believe that it is at least implied.

***** Obligatory mention that you should never trust the wiki for trivia like this; it often lists book-canon facts alongside stuff that was made up for random merchandise like the video games, without distinguishing the two.

****** Yeah, thats the mistake I originally made. The W.O.M.B.A.T.S things is cited, but that's not enough for a confirmation without more evidence.

***** I'd say that falls under the "dubiously canon" category. Rowling may have intended it to be true, but since it's not in the books, it's not official, and she could choose to change her mind about it in the future. Especially since the test is no longer available. So as far as I'm concerned, any author can choose to use or ignore any information there as they please.

Also, according to the only answer guide that seems to exist, one of the correct answers is blatantly contradicted by the books. (The test says animate to inanimate transfiguration is impossible, but we see it several times in the books, including mice to snuffboxes in PS and hedgehogs to pincushions in GoF.)

***** my headcanon is that the shield charm in the clothing is weak, its just enough so that magical law enforcement are protected in case something slips past their notice.
