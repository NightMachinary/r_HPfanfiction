I´ve mostly read fics with Harry growing up or being father of young James/Lily/Albus, but I actually have never read a fic where he is at least 50+ years old.Anyone got some suggestions? I would prefer a a canon Harry who has improved a lot and showing off his skills when he is the best wizard at the time to fight a new (or old) enemy to be the savior again.\\
Old/wise/skillfull Harry pls.

Thanks in advance.


** This is something I always wanted to read. I want Harry that's on Dumbledore level, maybe not on magical power but on skill and experience.

The closest one I know is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]. It's great, but has a good action scene and mystery. It has a good Trio interaction, but sadly no Ginny. The characterization is a bit off if you're used to Northumbrian or little0bird's work, but still better than most of the fanfiction out there.

**** Thank you, but I was and I guess I will never be interested in Crossovers in my life. Personally, the cringe is too real for me.

  Anakin Skywalker was not the first to be called The Chosen One. There was another before him, and this is his story.
