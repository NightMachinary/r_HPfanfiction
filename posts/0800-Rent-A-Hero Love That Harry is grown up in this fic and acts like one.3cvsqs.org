** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=29116][DLP]] has some rather.... entertaining reviews for this story, which has been aptly renamed 0800-Rent-a-bitch. I think this one is my favorite:

#+begin_quote
  This is a Slave!Harry story that just happens to use dimesion hopping as a plot device to enslave Harry.

  I thought of all the ways this could've been a great fic.

  When he first woke up in the infirmary in Hogwarts and found out he'd been disfigured by the ritual I was hyped. I was certain that Harry was going to go Darkman on the Order of the Phoenix. Except he tried to guilt them into letting him go and failed.

  So then I thought that this was Lock-Stock-And-Two-Smoking-Barrels-ish. Except that movie was about crooks that got themselves into trouble and were desperately trying to get out of it. Their failure was funny because it was all their fault. Not so here.

  Maybe Dresden-ish then, but even Harry Dresden set his master on fire when he tried to enslave him.

  And that is what Harry is. A slave to Dumbledore's magic and his own twisted morals. He tried to get justice through Madam Bones, who basically told him "I don't believe in human rights, unless you're a Death Eater" and basically reported him to the DOM, who are more concerned that he give them his blood than about his freedom.

  The thing is, Dumbledore and his Order kidnapped Harry, tortured and disfigured him, put his friends and what little family he had left in danger, interrogated him and then enslaved him in such a way that he's under their power for at least a year. And they were willing to do all this to an innocent stranger, but not a Death Eater?

  In the original series, whenever Harry was confronted by corrupt, incompetent or unconcerned authority figures, he went and did shit on his own. In Book 1, McGonagall didn't listen to his warning, so he went and saved the stone by himself. In Book 2 he tried dragging a clearly incompetent Lockhart with him and almost got obliviated for his troubles, then did shit on his own. In Book 3 the entire Ministry was shown to be corrupt and he basically had to get shit done by illegally using a timeturner. In Book 5, the only time he went with an authority figure's plan and "kept his head down" he basically got a year's worth of torture. Ect. Ect.

  But he can't go do shit on his own now, because Dumbledore has him on a magical leash and threatens to summon him again. And in the next sentence he persuades him that he really is a good person. Except he's not.

  So I keep expecting him to tell Bones to go fuck herself, get shit done, kill Voldemort and Dumbledore and fart in this world's general direction. Except all he ever does is rant and rave about the injustice of it all, and then gets persuaded to do the right thing and save them from Voldemort in the very next scene.

  Think of the children. /snort/

  Until Harry gets his head out of his ass and realize that he is the only one that even thinks about doing the right thing in that world, this story is going to continue to be an angstfest that I refuse to sludge through.

  TL;DR: Harry, take Tilly and run, I'll hold them off. Except you can't run, because they got you by the balls. Then kill them all and then kill Voldemort for good measure. Except you can't kill the Order off, because they are the good guys. Except they are not. No one is. Except Tilly. Maybe.

  2/5, and that single point is for the writing, not the content.

*** I cant really disagree with what is said here. There were times here where Harry is a weak bastard. But then I remember this Harry comes from the books, and that Harry is weak. I also remember that good stories have their characters face challenges to grow. And so we have Harry being injured by a swan.

** I can't wait for all the divination shenanigans to be filled out so another author can steal it and put it in a better plot. Harrys a bitch and probably should've started cursing folks off the bat. I'm 100% with the dlp review.

*** To be fair, though, who could he really curse? Every time he's with Dumbledore there are about 20 other order members there.

** I really love this fic so far. Harry's attitude toward being sucked into another universe is very real and honest. I also like the divination in it. The writer has a nice take on it. I can't wait until the author updates.

** This... I love it. Never a dull moment, shit going wrong left and right and an awesome as tits Harry somehow muddying through it all as a badass. I haven't felt this happy at reading an HP fanfic since Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch back when it was still Fate's Bitch (damn you, ff.net political correctness standards!). Bravo Brainthief, you magnificent motherfucker.
