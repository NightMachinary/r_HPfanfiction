Hermione Granger was a Rather precocious child, kind, well behaved, But with an endless thirst for knowledge. She never stopped asking questions, But her line of inquiry always had a purpose. Why was the sky blue? What was a prism? Did Sir Isaac newton really nearly stab himself in the eye with a bone needle Just to see the different wavelengths of light? Why didn't he just use a prism in the first place? Her mother Became so used to a routine interrogation About some historical fact or scientific anomaly During the morning commute to Hermione's new primary school St. Grogory's, That she kept a list a anything her daughter wanted to know that she couldn't answer, And took Hermione to the library Daily to satisfy her brilliant daughter's curiosity. Unlike other mothers Helen Granger was a dentist and couldn't just give her daughter a sweet to keep her quiet, Despite the migraines Hermione endless questions Occasionally caused. The Grangers were proud of their Curious daughter and her scholastic achievements but they always had a nagging worry About her lack of friends. Until one Thursday, During Hermione second week at her new primary school, their darling girl came running towards their car at the end of the school day dragging a little boy in Hand me down clothes behind her. Hermione's Endless chatter This time was not an endless Quest for knowledge but excited banter about her new friend, The little boy standing nervously next to her. Named Harry, Who according to Hermione could teleport, the Grangers bemused At their Child's imagination and Silently relieved at the Prospect of their little girl's first friend let the matter rest without correction. As Hermione Hopefully asked if they could give Harry a ride home, as his aunt had forgotten him again.

Helen Had raised an eyebrow at that but of course consented, To help the child get home safely, And perhaps set up a play date For later that week.

As Helen loaded Both the children into the back of the station wagon and her husband climbed into the drivers seat, she Couldn't help but get the feeling this act would somehow be Significant in a few years time.

That feeling was cemented, when she glared at Petunia Dursley when Harry asked if he could still have dinner before going to his Cupboard.

A phone call to CPS and Some parenting classes later, and Instead of a new friend Hermione Granger has a foster brother Who wouldn't stop calling her ‘ Mione No matter how loudly she protested. And the Granger family home Became littered with not just with books but with soccer Equipment as well. The family became die hard Manchester United fans, Under Harry's influence, When he met another little boy named Dean Thomas, At his first peewee soccer match.


** Some recs

Grangers adopting Harry: linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) (Involves "Lord Potter" but is realistic and not horribly cringy about it, sequel currently updating)

Harry, Hermione, and Dean all meet pre-Hogwarts: linkffn(The Perils of Innocence) Last updated 2017 and maybe abandoned?

Edit: Harry, Hermione, and [SPOILER] all meet pre-Hogwarts in linkffn(Innocent), but there's lots of other stuff going on as well.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

** I have an issue with Harry's football club. Lol.

He's not from Manchester. And, let's say we're going to follow canon. United at that time did not enjoy the fame during the 90s. It was more of Liverpool during the 70s and 80s.

He's more likely to be a fan of a local club. Since Surrey and Hampstead (where the Granger lived in Canon) are near London, Harry is more likely to be a fan of some London club like Tottenham, West Ham, or Arsenal, which were the top league contenders in the city.

** Just my thoughts on your headline: People severely underestimate how difficult university level science is to comprehend. There is no way for a child to grasp it at an early age without having SEVERE deficits in allmost every other part of life, this includes walking, speaking and other parts of our lives we find quite trivial.

​

It feels as if the more than absurd storyline of HPMOR shaped a whole new genre of absurdly smart children who outsmart adults in primary school. I mean, children don't even realize that they will die until between 6 and 8 years, which is the reason younger children cannot really be motivated to do something they do not want to do. Otherwise, great prompt. I especially liked the image of Hermione telling her parents about the teleporting.

*** The issue I take with this is that kids still ask questions using the kinds of words they hear around them.

They don't need to comprehend anything to ask the questions - and I didn't get the implication of the adult Grangers answering any of her questions at a "university level". The title may mention quantum mechanics, but that's not directly a quote from child-Hermione's question - it could easily be she's asked a question that is best answered using that and now Mum's going "how the fuck do I explain this to my child, where's my coffee"

I hope that perspective helps the minor irritation!
