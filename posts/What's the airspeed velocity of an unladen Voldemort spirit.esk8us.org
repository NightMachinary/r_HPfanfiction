Like, when Voldemort left Quirrel and escaped as a spirit, he could just pass through walls. But what do you think his top speed in that form is? How long would it take him to travel the distance between Hogwarts and Albania? Do you think he has a maximum altitude?

*** It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce spirit could not carry a one pound stone.

** Mind over matter? Rationally, a spirit has no physicality so a lot of energy would be spent on making it keep up with the plant and not get left behind in space?

*** If a spirit is still affected by gravity then it just needs enough energy to hover like anything else. If it's not affected by gravity then it'd need a lot of energy to keep up with the movement of the earth but that's unlikely.
