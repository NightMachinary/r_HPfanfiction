Why in /nearly/ every fanfiction, Harry's animagus happens to be a black panther? I understand the black hair link but it's been done to death. I think it might be in every story I've read (that involves harry transforming) , apart from one where he is a shadow phoenix.

It's getting old now.


** I remember a fic which was essentially a super!Harry fic, where his animagus form was a Robin, which was a nice departure from the norm.

*** I think, at least canonically, Harry's form would be something with wings with some great flight potential.

Something like an Eagle, or Hawk or some sort of bird of prey perhaps.

** I tend to dislike stories where Harry is an animagus. It's fine in an AU where he's raised by his parents or Sirius, but in all other cases, he has shown no inclination towards transfiguration nor a want to do it. Worse is when it's some super-rare magical being. Nearly as bad is when he has the same form as either James or Sirius (because Harry is /not/ like them). A black panther makes no sense for Harry - it doesn't represent him very well (seriously: he is not a predator)... but it could be much worse.

** That's not his animagus form in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]], and more often than not the stories I read he is some sort of super magical never before seen dragon, or phoenix, or some other super powered form that has zero use apart from making Harry special. I do like its use in TLIL though, and I would recommend the fic to everyone.

**** Yeah I would recommend giving it another go. Personally, when I re read it for nostalgia, I skip the first few chapters because I find the first parts boring compared to the rest.

What about it stopped you from enjoying it?

** I've read a handful where he was a wolf.

I don't think it's necessarily a lack of creativity or anything, we just don't know enough about why certain animals are people's animagus form (or patronus), so people either go for dramatic or strength, while matching whatever personality they're trying to give their Harry.

The "Living with Danger" series is actually pretty good about having many varied animagus forms, though I won't say what because one of the mini plotlines is the kids figuring them out.

** At least it's not a Phoenix, probably the most popular form given to Harry.

I think much of it is imitation, as many reasonably popular (by reviews) stories use this idea (RossWrock's /Harry Potter and the Power of Time/, jbern's /Bungle in the Jungle/, MissAnnThropic's /Vox Corporis/, LignumVitae86's /Harry Potter and the Path to Greatness/ are +three+ *not three* examples off the top of my head). Also, unless one chooses to make his form that of a magical animal (which isn't seen in canon) or a bird of some sort, there's a limit to what forms he might do that would be superior to his human body. Great cat, wolf, gorilla, bear, snake... That's pretty much it.

Edit: Lol.

(I'd written 'three,' then added Ross's fic which started the trend, and in the process betrayed my innumeracy.) ;)

** In the story i haven't written yet, i have Harry as an Octopus. Abandoned on the streets and learning to pickpocket, he has an affinity for the creatures that can squeeze through the tightest of spaces to hide or escape, and the long, dextrous tentacles/arms work well with his sticky-fingered youth.

**** Two Neville/Bear stories:

The most recent one I remember is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707895/7/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Bureaucracy-of-Failure][Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure]] (second story in the series, I've linked to the chapter that he first appears as a bear). The story is a cross-over with WH40K. Harry doesn't have an animagus in this story.

The other one that sticks in mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/7/Partners][Partners]] by muggledad. (I've linked to the chapter that they first become animagi). HP/DG. This story actually has Harry becoming a Bengal Tiger.

****** Partially because it is as old as the hills, fanfiction-wise. IMO it is the oldest still-viable longform HP fanfic, dating back to 2001. And yes, still one of the best-written out there; probably something anyone who is writing novel-length fanfic should read.

** I mean, if you think about it a panther fits rather well no?

Sure you get the black hair/fur but in terms of personality it sort of fits.

Panther's are solitary and territorial but don't go looking for fights just like wolves.

Think of Harry, mostly solitary especially during his early years at the Dursley's and is territorial when it comes to things he cares about, friends/people he perceives as family.

Maybe I'm reading too much into it but if a form is determined by personality panthers at least fit a little bit.

** With my [in-progress] fic, he's likely to be a Kneazle with a sleek black figure.

It was going to be a Merlin [a small falcon] for my sheer amusement, though when my Harry developed broom-less flight abilities I had to re-write.

Kneazles are apparently good at sensing moods in fanon/canon so I figured my Super!Harry could do with some cross-over of that in his non-animagus life.
