** Don't know off the top of my head, but sounds great. Too much Hermione in all the fics, even though everyone is pretty quick to reject/bash Ron.

*** That's because canon is from Harry's PoV and Hermione is his most loyal friend, even joining him as Number 2 on the Ministry's most wanted list. And the shady shit she pulls mostly does not affect Harry. If you were to write a story from Marietta's or Cho's PoV, Hermione would be a lot less likeable.

But I get your frustration. Too many stories insert Hermione as some cardboard cutout for "follow the rules" and "study more". They take away the small human moments she has. Just look at her Yule Ball tantrum after Ron is a dick. She burst out crying and runs off to the dorms instead of simply not giving a fuck and walking away or twist those moments into a central plot moment (where the Protagonist gets to show off how much better he is than Ron).
