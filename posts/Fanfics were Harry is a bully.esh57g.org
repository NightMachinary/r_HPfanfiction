** Pick just about any independent!Harry fic out there. Nine times out of ten, Harry's going to be a bully... even though the author doesn't think he is. Fics where Harry is intentionally portrayed and named as a bully are a lot rarer... the only one I can think of is "The Golden Age," which is less a fic and more a long rant about why Harry, Ron, Hermione and every single character apart from Snape and the Malfoys are despicable human beings, DISGUISED as a fic.

The first line paragraph of the story is Harry screaming "I want to see some punishment!!" and it just goes from there.

** It would be refreshing to see more fics in which Harry is a straight antagonist: not an angsty anti-hero, not a sympathetic con artist, but an actual unsympathetic antagonist to another protagonist. There are fics in which Harry is a bully, but he tends to be portrayed in a flattering light---in how clever and powerful he is---and never gets a satisfying comeuppance.

One premise I'd like to see is where Vernon and Petunia would have spoiled Harry like they had Dudley. (Rationale: After hearing from Petunia what wizards are capable of, Vernon declares that they are going to stay on Harry's good side, whatever it takes.) And so, Harry would have absorbed Vernon's attitudes and bonded with Dudley over stealing lunch money from other children. He would take one look at Draco's expensive new robes and Ron's tattered hand-me-downs, and immediately know whose friend he wanted to be and in which House he wanted to be.

Once there, he would take the easy way out, following Draco's lead in sneering at Gryffindors and bullying Muggleborns. He would mock Hagrid, badmouth Dumbledore, and ingratiate himself with Snape. He would exploit his Quiddich talent and his BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot for doing very little. On those occasions when Harry is absent, Draco would rile up Ron by shoving the fact that Harry chose him in his face.

The actual protagonists of the story---Hermione, Ron, and, later, Neville---would have to rise to the occasion, fighting the bullies despite being outnumbered and dealing with some of the threats to Hogwarts that Harry dealt with in canon. For 4 or 5 years, there would be an ongoing feud: vicious pranks, hexing in the hallways, sometimes outright duels. The Gryffindor trio quickly becomes too dangerous to bully, but even when Draco and Harry switch targets, the do-gooder Gryffindors have the gal to intervene.

There could even be a redemption arc for Harry. When Voldemort returns, it turns out that Voldemort isn't the libertarian meritocrat that Draco talked about and isn't particularly interested in recruiting Harry. It also turns out that Harry's Slytherin friends value their own safety far above their friendship. The most he can get from Draco is a whispered, "Sorry, Potter. My family's more important. It's been fun."

And so, he has to go to the Gryffindors for help.

**** You sure? It'd probably feature Hermione as both the leader of her group of friends and as a BAMF, personally humiliating Harry and/or Draco in combat on multiple occasions (though probably not to the point of raping or castrating them, unless pstibbons writes the fic).

***** Lol never mind I thought it would be from Harry's POV with some of Ron's sprinkled in for flavour.

****** It can certainly be told from Harry's and Ron's perspectives only. It wouldn't change the substance of it, though. Harry would still come off as an unpleasant, unsympathetic character. And, it'd still be up to Hermione to organise the Gryffindors to oppose the Sytherins' bullying; and as the one with the most talent and drive of the group, she'd end up being their best fighter as well.

If the redemption arc happens, Harry would still have to abase himself (in his own mind) before the Gryffindors and deal with their open distrust.

** Can't suggest any I'm afraid but it would be interesting to read. Might link in with something I'd like to see in a story, i.e. a Harry who is exactly like his father at the same age and actually has all of the faults that Snape thinks he has.

*** Also if Harry had all the traits often told by Rita Skeeter, or the students who dislike him. That he's a glory hound abusing his fame.

I've seen this in WBWL fics, but not in any other context. Would be fun to read.

** Here are two that come to mind:

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7800970/1/The-Fine-Line-Between-Love-and-Hate]]) is a Dramione fic in which Harry, Ron, Blaise, and Draco are in Slytherin and are bullying Hermione and Neville.
- In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version]]), Harry accepts Draco's offer of friendship and is sorted into Slytherin. He joins Draco in bullying Hermione and others. (However, this is a Harry-centric fic, so he is portrayed sympathetically despite that.)

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
