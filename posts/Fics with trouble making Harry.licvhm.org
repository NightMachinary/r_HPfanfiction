Please recommend me a few fics like *Oh God not Again!* and *Harry Potter and the Arcana* in which Harry is an amusing trouble maker.

  Everything A Decent Death Eater Needs To Know About Britain's Most Belovedly Feared Dark-Lord-Who-Definitely-Isn't-Back as reported to you by Harry J. Potter, the Boy-Who-Knows Harry needs a hobby. Luna offers to show him the ropes in investigative journalism. --- In other words: Luna Lovegood is Luna Lovegood, Harry is so done with the Wizarding World, Ron is along for the ride, and Hermione really doesn't have time to stop Harry from becoming a Dark Lord.

** */That Universe Over There/* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959/chapters/56911591]]) show not Harry being a trouble-maker but his younger, female counterpart/adoptive daughter Ivy (it's time/dimension travel) being a trouble-maker.

*/Potter Club/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11987060/1/Potter-Club]]) I guess that would also fit. Harry travel back in time (accidently I think) and since it would be very boring to repeat all of your education at Hogwarts when you already know everything, Harry decide to cause trouble by founding a pranking organisation named Potter Club.

Let me guess, the first two rules are about how members do not talk about it.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
