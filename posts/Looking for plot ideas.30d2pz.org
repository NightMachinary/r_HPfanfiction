** Perhaps try stealing ideas from one of the many [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28351][plot bunny threads]] over at DLP? They have something like 8k posts in the threads, collectively.

** You have to be less generic. "I want do dis gimme a plot pls" isn't enought.

What's your goal? What will be the main conflict? What differences there will be from canon? Do you want to avoid as many clich√©s as possible or not?

** The HPFFC group on ffnet has [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/69510939/1/Request-Give-Challenges-Post-Plot-Bunny-Crossover-and-Specific-Detailed-Plot-Challenges-HERE][this challenge and plot bunny thread]].

I posted a list of authors' oneshots [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2qytzh/more_drabbles_ficlets_idea_files_plot_bunnies_and/][here]] most of which are up for adoption and/or good for ideas.

** Where does the story start? Physically and Harry's overall state.

Where does he (in both senses) need to end up?

How does he come to realize what he needs to do?

How does he do it?

How much of canon do you want to use? Is Harry's biggest problem Voldemort? Does the prophecy exist? Do the Deathly Hallows exist? How about Horcruxes?

If you can answer those questions its a short jump to fill in the gaps and start writing.

#+begin_quote
  Rowena Ravenclaw created a creature to store knowledge for future generations. But she was proven too dangerous and was hidden away in a fortress forgotten. Years later, wizards discovered the fortress and transformed it into a prison while the creature hid in the shadows. People went mad there but she was immune. The prisoners spoke to her but she was forgotten when they could no longer see her... all if the prisoners except one. Sirius remembered the girl, she returned to him every day and they spoke, she kept him same. Then he vanished. Ravenclaw's daughter must mascerade as a dementor to protect Sirius from losing his soul and prove his innocence, although that could prove difficult when nobody knows you exsist. The girl's name? Calypso.

tl;dr: The girl never ages and she was created by Ravenclaw to store knowledge. She befriends Sirus and leaves her home (Azkaban) to protect him from dementors.

When I first thought of it i imagined scenes like:

  Sirius watched as the blue-haired girl turned away from his cell, intending to begin the long walk to her quarters at the top of the tower no doubt. She stopped before long and turned back to face him. "You know, Padfoot," She said in the quiet voice she always used. "Dementors don't affect animals as much as humans, of course I'm not human... But neither are dogs." She winked and vanished into the shadows of the prison and Sirius, once again, was unsure if the had imagined he girl, but transformed into his dog form nonetheless.
