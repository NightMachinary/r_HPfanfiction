The other professors catch wind of what they're going to do, and don't do anything to stop it, even secretly encouraging it.

Maybe Harry subtly (not so subtly) infers about the I must not tell lies that is on his skin, and Umbridge realizes that perhaps scarring the Boy Who Lived wasn't the smartest of her plans.

Though that's all optional.


** I remember one that's similar to this idea. Full on Boycott by the students, Dumbledore gets sacked and the entire thing revolves into civil war early. Students vs Ministry, before Dumbledore gets involved, adding another side. Then there's Riddle adding another and I'm pretty sure by that point the entirety of Wizarding Britain has been FUBAR'd.

**** word of warning dada boycott is a straight slog to get through, its unapologetically preachy and instant jumps into ron bashing. i dont like ron, so it's a little jarring when it's even to much for me.

its also clearly written by an american as harry decides to style himself after jefferson of all people. firstly how would he have ever heard of him and secondly hes english why not the magna carta or the hunger strikes by the irish?

it also hurts itself in its confusion by chapter four hermione declaring it will be a countrywide movement because they boycotted a single days of classes. and harry of all people is the one to go ballistic saying shes trying to make the magical world go into a civil war.

  Dobby grinned again. "Of course, Mister Harry Potter Sir!" He disappeared with a crack and returned with a very confused Argus Filch in tow.

  "Clean, caretaker!" Dobby demanded, stuffing a mop and bucket into his hands.

  "Dobby! What are you doing?" Harry asked, appalled.

  "Sir, the house elves is not having time to do everything masters wish of us," Dobby scoffed. "So we has humans that do it for us too!"

** It's a nice prompt for a crack fic, but in a canon universe, Umbridge would just shower Harry and who ever is with him with dententions (more Blood Quill yeaaaah) and maybe write the Education Decree NÂ° 978: "All student must be present in class unless permitted by the Great Inquisitor" with which Draco and other Proper (aka Slytherin Purebloods) students can miss 90% of its class because he "felt tired" but Muggleborn must be in class even if dying.

Umbridge did not come to Hogwarts to teach, she came to watch Dumbledore, take back as much influence on the school as possible to the Ministry, and bury Harry. She enjoys an almost limitless support from Fudge, and thanks to the Ministry Propaganda campaign, most of the population think Dumbledore is senile and Harry crazy.\\
Harry misses class? It's a proof he is not . . . "stable" enough to go to school, maybe we should remove it for his own security and the one of the students.\\
He is accusing Umbridge of using a Dark artifact to scare his hand? Another lie for the "Boy-Who-Lied".

He can show everyone the truth, it's on his arm. He can also be given the truth serum, as well as show pensive memories.

If enough students denied Umbridge's teachings, which I think would, considering how many decided to join Harry's DA class, plus even more would stand by him, that weren't in the DA class, if they saw others doing it.

People seem to rarely understand how fickle reality would be in a world like the Harry Potter's one.

The scar is, by itself, only that: a scar. Harry could very well had done it to himself, proving in the eye of the public that he is not stable.\\
Veritaserum doesn't make someone say the truth, but what he thinks is the truth. Poor boy is so delusional he believes in his own lies. Or maybe he has been confused by someone, say Dumbledore.\\
Pensives are very rare. For all we know Hogwart's one is the only one in Britain, if not the world. Can you really believe what is shown in an item belonging to a man who is gathering forces to take over the Ministry, or so Fudge think? And even if the Ministry does have a pensive, poor Harry has been confused, someone must have cursed him, or maybe he took a potion, Snape always seem suspicious.\\
And anyways when would Harry even have the opportunity to show his memories or take Veritaserum? Just as the Ministry can decide that a simple use of Magic outside of Hogwarts is enough to the whole Wizengamot, he can also decide that the Ministry have better things to do than listen to the rambling of a kid.

As for students joining him in his boycott. Must of the people who joined the DA did not do it by belief, but because they wanted to learn Defense to pass their exam. If Umbridge write an Educational Decree along the lines of "Any student not going to class will see himself banned from taking the end of the year Exams", then most of the DA will decide to leave the group and go to class. As for the most loyal ones (all of the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna . . .), they are probably the core of Dumbledore' Army and it would be a simple matter to convince Fudge that maybe Hogwarts would be better without all these dissidents.
