What if a certain someone made more than one horcrux? (AU 4th year. Voldemort has no horcruxes, years 1 and 2 were quiet, year 4 was because a Death Eater wanted Harry to die in the tournament).

Three weeks. It had been three weeks since he had figured out the clue to the Second Task, and two days since Barty Crouch Jr was found out, and fourteen-year-old Harry Potter was in the Black Lake, preparing for the Task that was to take place in two weeks.

He was currently making use of the Bubblehead Charm, familiarizing himself with parts of the lake. As he got to a certain patch, where the bed of the lake was covered entirely in sand  when he spotted a peculiarly round pebble, pitch-black in colour. It looked quite cool, he had to admit, so he decided to take a closer look. As he got closer, he began to hear whispers, all varying in voice, but all saying the same thing: "Herpo the Foul".

** It would be hilarious that instead of a Horcruxes he made a magical rope thing that tide him to the earth but he can't leave Albania
