My wife and I just finished a re-read of the whole series, and now we're looking for good fics that take place after the Battle of Hogwarts, stuff that's in the same vein as the books. "Same vein" in this instance means not bashy, not particularly shippy (relationships are fine, just not, you know... hypersexual or anything) and nothing wildly ooc.

Don't really care one way or the other if they're epilogue compliant as long as the writing is good and the characters are... essentially themselves.

We mostly just don't want the story to end.


** Take a look at linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian)... then check out the other 80 or so stories he's written as canon complements.

It takes place immediately after the end of the story and before the epilogue. The writer has a whole series of stories.

** Here's a few I've rec'd before [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][here]]; these are all complete and they cover a range of genres and lengths, so hopefully you can find something you like :D

*- - - Post-War Era*

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=233193][Hey, Fred]] by hedwidgeon* | gen, oneshot, angst. George visiting Fred's grave over his life time, told in vignettes.

#+begin_quote
  /"It's been a week, Fred. A whole week. I've never gone so long without talking to you. I mean, I'm talking to you now, but you're not saying anything back. I know you're listening, I know it. I can feel it. [...]"/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]* by Toujours Padfoot* | Ensemble, novel, adventure. A frequent favorite whenever it's posted here. Characters who've died now live in "second-chance" afterlife universe with mysterious annual races.

#+begin_quote
  /The village of the dead is not as peaceful as it seems./
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332461][the earth and the sky]] by randomwriter* | Draco/Astoria, oneshot, drama. Told in vignettes.

#+begin_quote
  /Life in three words? It goes on. Trial and Error. Fear and Joy. For better, for worse, it goes on. Time ticks along, years fly by, and somewhere in the mix of things, lies their story./
#+end_quote

 

*- - - Next Gen Era*

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][The Stygian Trilogy]] by Slide* | Ensemble, action/adventure. /Ignite/ is the first.

#+begin_quote
  /A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot./
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] by Aiedail* | Gen, novel, adventure. Hugo, Scorpius, and Neville hunt through the Forbidden Forest.

#+begin_quote
  /If romping through the Forbidden Forest on week-long escapades to hunt for a mythical plant doesn't seem normal to you, then you haven't met Hugo Weasley. Hinkypunks, nymphs, Acromantulas? Not a problem for this ragtag team of ordinary heroes. [...]/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]]* by Celestie* | Ensemble, novella, dramedy. An ensemble Weasley family piece, told in a series of vignettes through Rose's eyes.

#+begin_quote
  /My family was never one for normality nor did we ever try to label ourselves that way. Through the years, we lived through our shares of fights and laughter and chaos. I didn't know much about living, but they taught me all I knew about loving. In the end, there didn't seem to be one without the other./
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] (by me)* | Ensemble, novel, adventure-comedy. A self-promo of my next gen, if you like screwball heists and bad puns.

#+begin_quote
  /Armed with spunk, sugar and a blatant disregard for the laws of physics (or laws in general), inventor Bea Chang is determined to bring her electricity-to-magic device to life. She has no patience for her unenthusiastic friends who'd believe in Nifflers over her, nor the suspiciously enthusiastic Malfoy heir who wants to cut a deal. Unfortunately, she'll need their help./

** Are you American? Cause if so the James Potter series ([[http://www.jamespotterseries.com][www.jamespotterseries.com]]) might be enjoyable for you. It's Harry's son James at Hogwarts. The reason I mention you being American is because there's a lot of Americanisms used, an American exchange student and frequent holidays to America...which frankly is painful for me but a lot of people really enjoy them.

*** I am American! And so is my wife. I don't know how we'll feel about an excess of identifiably American stuff in HP. We're both librarians, a notoriously anglophilic group, so the Britishisms in the books never bothered us. Still, I'll add it to my list! Thanks!
