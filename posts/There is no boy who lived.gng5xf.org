Voldemort doesn't find out about Harry or Neville or anyone else being the person associated with the prophecy, or never finds out about the prophecy. Or knows about the prophecy but chooses to not hunt the kid down to avoid marking anyone his equal.

The main point is a result he doesn't "die" and is a active threat by the time Harry goes to school without any special killing curse surviving kid for people to hold up as a savior ( though Dumbedore still exists to give them hope same with others fighting voldy).

They could be in the middle of a war, or maybe Voldemort is at the fringes making terror attack or maybe he's infiltrated the government all are fine. Harry doesn't have to be MC.

No major character/OC ships, No major character/self insert, No character of harrys gen / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older, No next gen characters/ people of Harry's gen or older.

being critical is fine but preferably no bashing

preferably No Draco/Hermione or Sirius Black/Marlene McKinnon

No sex swap aka any canon character being a different sex than what they are in canon like for example fem!Harry or male!Hermione ( trans characters are fine i dont consider sex swap trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused and/or plot focused.


** I'm not sure how closely it adheres to all your criteria(haven't read it in a long time) but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][/Promises Unbroken/]] by Robin4. It's a fic primarily centered around the idea that Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew never switched places as secret-keeper, thus Voldemort never learned the location of the Potters, thus the attack that resulted in Harry Potter becoming the Boy-Who-Lived never occurred.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): There is still the prophecy, but James and Lily were much better prepared that night. After destroying Voldemort's body, they faked their own deaths, burnt down their house, and fled for Germany. Harry never went to Hogwarts in this fic, so there are no shenanigans involving the usual Hogwarts crowd. Voldemort only got his body back in 2005, and most of the story plays out after 2008. If you like dark war epics, this is it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Voldemort killed Harry in this world, and later Neville. But soon "that fucker" appeared and totally derailed his progress. Things dragged until canon Harry and Sirius came through the Veil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Tom Riddle is the head healer of St Mungus in this world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738): This world has no magic, but still features a confrontation between Harry and Riddle. The difference is that Harry shot and killed him for good. On the other hand, local Hermione disappeared for 7 years until the canon witch Hermione arrived...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World as We Knew it]], linkffn(3571753): No prophecy in this world, and things are worse.
