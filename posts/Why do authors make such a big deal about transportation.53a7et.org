** The answer, my friend, is always in the plot.

Whenever JKR feels a simple or smart solution interferes with her plot, she tends to disregard it.

Example 1: Potters could not choose James or Lily to be their own secret keeper, but must select someone else not protected by their Fidelius. Fast forward to Book 7, Arthur and Bill Weasley were suddenly perfectly happy to be their own secret keepers and could hide under their own Fideliuses.

Example 2: The Moody impersonation scheme could easily be foiled by a few security questions by Dumbledore.

Example 3: Harry blatantly forgot his two-way mirrors.

Example 4: The flight of 7 Potters could easily be avoided by the methods you mentioned.

  I drank it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. *I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him.

What he's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.”

Side-along apparition was the plan before it was made illegal. This was before the whole ministry has fallen, so the Order did not want to fight the ministry and the Death Eaters, both at once.

The only reason Harry got the two-way mirrors in the first place was so that he could forget about them. The two-way mirror serves no purpose till then, so I fail to see how the answer is 'always in the plot'. It is there as a narrative device to show how easily tragedy could've been avoided if only they had stopped to /think/ instead of charging ahead recklessly.

The only one that requires some consideration is the one about the Fidelius charm ([[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lf86j/closing_plot_holes_the_fidelius_charm/][here]] addresses this point), the rest of your assertions are trivially false.

It could have.

But, Dumbledore would have to get really darn lucky, because of the reason you listed; because really, I doubt Junior knew absolutely everything about Moody so there might have been an obscure and little thing for him to slip on. Yeah, might have been, but such things don't come up in conversations often so it's more of a convenient escape clause for those who want him caught early on rather than something that would justify this complaint. Or, in other words, I do agree with you about the complaint but not about the “absolutely never” sentiment about it.

Going on about the other, I will note with the seven Potters thing that Harry did have his cloak and could have used it to escape; his things would remain, but since the trace is on him after he left there wouldn't be anything stopping people from the Order from just shrinking his things and also leaving under an invisibility cloak. They might have simply not thought about it after the ministry went rogue, but yes, they did have a way out that wouldn't have broken the law.

The rest of your stuff I completely agree with.

***** I remain unconvinced that invisibility is the best option. We know from DH that Moody expected number 4 to be under surveillance from the Death Eaters. The DEs know that Harry's got an invisibility cloak, and we know that invisibility cloaks are far from infallible (well, Harry's is close, but neither side know that, so it's immaterial). Liberal use of /Homenum Revelio/ to detect invisible persons is expected, and if there is any cause for suspision - /accio cloak!/ Besides, there are many devices that can reveal invisible people. Moody's eye is the most blatant one. Uncommon, to be sure, but it would be foolish to presume that Voldemort wouldn't employ one in his all-important mission to kill Harry Potter. There are other devices - like Sneakoscopes - that should be able to do the trick as well. Sufficiently skilled wizards might not even need additional means - Dumbledore managed to locate Harry under his cloak in PS just fine.

Invisibility just seems too obvious a choice for the DEs not to predict. In a battle where each side is continually trying to the predict and outmanoeuvre the other (and Dumbledore is trying to outmanoeuvre them all), something as simple as invisibility seems like highly unlikely to succeed.

****** While I do agree that invisibility is not infallible, far from it even, back then it either was a better option than the whole “seven Potters” thing---assuming there were no Death Eaters watching the place all the time---because it would have allowed Harry to leave whenever, or it was infeasible for some reason---like the Death Eaters watching all the time and the risk of detection spells getting through the cloak---in which case it would have been nice to have /someone/ say something about it because with nobody saying anything it feels as if everyone forgot about Harry's invisibility cloak which is fairly ... stupid if we consider that the Order used invisibility cloaks extensively.

But even without that, there are ways in which they could have tried. If Polyjuice works (and we know it does) then the least they could have done would be to change Harry into someone else, unless for some bizarre reason him using any potion would trigger the trace (would be weird, but I guess not impossible), but even then considering how ... inexact, yes, the trace is, they might have still wanted to try. Heck, get a suitcase with a room, make Harry go inside, carry him out, voilà; and yes, I know such things weren't exactly in Madame Rowling's mind when she was writing that book as it's only recently she got deeper into the concept. At the very least go with the plan they went with but have Harry wear the cloak on top of that; with all the stuff happening the Death Eaters might have ignored Hagrid altogether had the side-car of the bike appeared empty as they might not have had the time to think about detection spells and stuff.

My point is that Madame Rowling handled this one quite badly in comparison to what she could have done because as it is it just stinks of a blatant attempt to kill off major characters; so basically drama for the sake of drama, which gets very annoying once they get out of it and then they get to casual stuff like wedding preparations when there was forced drama just a moment earlier. It's a mood whiplash via use of an idiot ball, and it did not have to be and would have been better had the difficulty of the whole thing been because of Tom's forces being overwhelming rather than because of people on the Order's side dying out of stupidity.

Alternatively, the reliance on the vow over time could do the same to their loyalty because being loyal is something you choose to do and we don't really know how those two things (unbreakable vows and Fidelius) interact.

Unbreakable vows in general are something way darker than people think it to be, so the insistence of some people that they can be used to solve whatever tends to be ... well, not something well thought out. Personally, I could see the watchers' horrified reactions when someone decides to use it to prove anything, because unbreakable vows are basically soul bondage and when I write this I do not mean “kinky” but rather “fuck, don't mess with that”.

Veritaserum is a less questionable example, but it too is something that wouldn't solve /everything/ as really it's nothing more than a magical equivalent of a lie detector and those aren't 100% accurate (and neither is veritaserum, really). Though I do admit that veritaserum as a plot device was horribly underused, only being used on Junior and with nothing coming out of it because of Fudge being stupid.

The house wasn't theirs. As much as I dislike some of the more convoluted mechanics of whatever, the fact remains that the thing about secret keepers is simple: it has to be someone who is an outsider for the secret. Thus, while I do agree about her disregarding the simple solutions sometimes (the seven Potters thing you wrote about is a fine example, to a degree), the example you used about Fidelius is a really crappy one.

Edit: And by “theirs” I meant Bill and Arthur, not Lily and James. Because we know that though Bill lived at that house it was not actually his, and thus, being an outsider, he could be the secret keeper to that secret. So yes, using that place as an example does make for a very bad one.

***** It may /imply/, but it does not /prove/ it. And considering the situation they are in (what with the war and with the ministry being pretty much useless and them going there /because/ of the ministry being useless), it would not be surprising if the house was simply lent for their use until a time when they could get their own place. The fact that it's a house built in the 1970s (when Bill was still in single digits) and that it is basically a summer residence supports the theory of it being lent to them because you wouldn't build a house for yourself, weirder yet as a kid (for those who think it must have been Bill who did it), only to not really use it for 15 years unless it was not supposed to be lived in full-time. Sure, they did remain in the Shell Cottage after the war ended, and most certainly had the house become actually theirs then, which could have broken the Fidelius and quite likely did it, but that happening in the future does not make it already happen in the present as they only went to live in that house because of the ministry going rogue which again implies they might not have /planned/ to live there.

And considering the way the Fidelius charm works, considering the way this one assumption---that the house is not actually theirs for that one year---invalidates the whole part of the complaint about it as it goes “oh, look, it's /clearly/ their house and so you /clearly/ can be your own secret keeper so /PLOT HOLE/”, well ... no, there's no “clearly” there because we do not know who actually owns the house and thus it does not work as a proof of that plot hole.

It's fine to wonder about the possibilities and what-ifs, but when you take something you do not know, make conjectures based on data you inserted that is not actually there about it, and shout “it's a plot hole because MY VERSION”, well ... that's what happened with the Fidelius complaint here, and it should not have happened.

#+end_quote

From a storytelling perspective, it's another source of tension. Sources of tension are valuable. The author is left to justify it within the narrative. Given that you're making this post, I'm guessing there are quite a few authors who don't.

#+begin_quote
  Does apparition and Floo suddenly not exist?
#+end_quote

Remus Lupin claimed that Apparition can't be tracked, but that's just canon. An author can change that.

I have vague memories of the Floo being compromised at some point, maybe? Once Voldemort had control of the Ministry. And before that, there wasn't much need for stealth, aside from Sirius Black.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, why the hell would a Magical family, no matter how large, drive to King's Cross?
#+end_quote

Because Arthur Weasley wants any excuse to drive that he can dredge up? That would be reasonable, considering how much work he's put into it and how he even finagled laws to make it just barely legal.

This is an issue with canon rather than fan fiction as such. It's harder to fault a fic author for deciding not to change canon. Plus it doesn't have anything to do with the Order's competence.

#+begin_quote
  And if the Order is well and truly so very concerned about harry's safety post 4th year, why have him take the dam train at all?
#+end_quote

So he could have a brief altercation with Draco Malfoy and chat with Hermione and Ron.

From an internal perspective, Dumbledore was firmly attached to giving Harry a normal childhood until Sirius died. That leaves three trips of interest.

There's no indication of increased security on the Express at the end of fifth year. That's a clear miss.

On the way to Hogwarts at the start of sixth year, Aurors are guarding the platform and the Hogwarts Express, and more Aurors escort the Weasleys with Harry in tow to King's Cross.

The return trip isn't depicted, but the final scene mentions that a lot of the Order and a number of Aurors are at Dumbledore's funeral and the Express is scheduled to leave shortly after.

It makes sense to teleport Harry directly. But at least there was security available for two of the trips, and if Voldemort attacked, he risked killing his followers' children.

Back then the minister was still Scrimgeour so they'd tried not to have those “protections” detect anything going on---thus they couldn't do what they originally wanted to do, and because they all forgot about Harry's cloak it ended up with the silly “seven Potters” thing---but considering how soon the ministry failed and that Thicknesse, the man who controlled those things, was on the side of the Death Eaters for one reason or another, they might as well have simply done that and tried to avoid the response team that would have been sent by him.

If you factor that fact in, more than half of your complaints become invalid.

Furthermore, a thing that has always sat with me is how ridiculously overestimated is the number of people know apparition. Anywhere it is mentioned, it is always said to be an extremely hard and dangerous skill, and in every fanfiction, every single character knows how to do it.

  The trace is placed on wands, and not a person's body, right? So if someone under 17 whips his wand out and decides to apparate somewhere the trace will detect the underage magic and the Ministry will know where the person went to, correct? This is why Ginny wasn't able to go along with the trio on their Horcrux hunt.

  However, if an Order member side-alongs Hermione from Point A to point B that shouldn't be traceable, correct?

It would.

We know that the trace, regardless of whether it's on the wands or on the wizards---and I presume it to be the latter, since functionally it's identical so why tamper with objects when you could tamper with people---detects magic not only coming from the target but also performed in the vicinity of the target. The exact range of this detection is not known, but being side-along apparated no doubt would mean that whoever apparated them would be in the range.

/This/ is why Ginny couldn't go with them on the hunt: her very presence would have made /their/ magic detectable by the trace, simply because she was near.
