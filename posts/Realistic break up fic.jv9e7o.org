Are there any decent realistic break up fics out there? Preferably Hermione/Ron but I'm open.

As in, Ron doesn't hate Hermione and suddenly start calling her names and Harry doesn't pick sides and they aren't suddenly enemies. Instead they are sad, there's avoidance, learning how to change their interactions, uncomfortable around each other and even having to deal with latent jealousy. I'm just interested in reading about how the characters learn to become friends again - even if it's not specifically Hermione/Ron I just feel like that pair would be the most likely to have a fic. Or Harry/Ginny. The beak up doesn't even need to be the major plot point, as long as it's explored.


** I've seen it a few times but can't think of specific instances, sorry!

To be fair though, few teenage splits are handled well. I feel like accepting someone doesn't want to be with you with grace is really one of the final marks of maturity.

Now that I'm older, I look back on how seriously I took high school romances and laugh. I also laugh when people I date flip out on me when things don't work out lol.

*** Doesn't need to be teenagers! I didn't specify a timeframe, but for Ron/Hermione they didn't even get together until they were what, 17? I'd imagine a breakup for them would come later on when they realized perhaps their life goals weren't compatible. I've had several breakups - most of them were not friends beforehand. The one that was my friend first I'm still friends with him over a decade later and we broke up when I was 18 and he was 17. He was even in my wedding party haha. I feel like a breakup between previous friends is just different than people who you were never friends with first.

** I don't have any that are 'realistic' in the fashion you describe, but the only Ron-Hermione breakup fic I've seen that's... reasonable? and doesn't have one or the other being accused of war crimes, rape, mental abuse, or unpaid parking tickets is Crazy Little Things by Dreiser. It starts out pretty reasonably canon-compliant, then breaks up Ron and Hermione and hooks up Luna and Hermione. Actually makes the latter relationship seem workable too, which impressed me. :)

Anyway, before I go too far off-track, it does have the second part of what you asked for, with characters reacting to the break-up and learning their new dynamics after it happens.

  Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

** Ron and Hermione break up pretty early in my postwar fic, and I tried to make it highly plausible.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.
