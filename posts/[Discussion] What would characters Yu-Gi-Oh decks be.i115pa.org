So I just finished the highest rated Yu-Gi-Oh fic on AO3, which happened to be a Harry Potter crossover. Problem. It was canceled after only 12 chapters. I now need to know what deck the characters would have used. Any input is greatly appreciated. Any. At all. Please. If I can't see it written out, at least let me imagine it in my head. I'm begging. The characters I'm most interested in are Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Voldemort, Dumbledore, and McGonagall, but any character is much appreciated! Thank you!!


** Red Ears Black Dragon for Ron

Twinkling Eyes White Dragon for Dumbledore

Dark Edgy Magician for Lord Hadrian Potter-Black Peverell Slytherin Gryffindor Pendragon Lannister McClane

** "I sacrifice my 'Death Muncher' and my 'Giant of the East' to summon the 'Basilisk guarding the Castle', and end my turn here, Potter ! Now, trem-"

"Not so fast, Lord V. ! Because I use this Trap Crad, 'Parseltongue hero', I can take any 'serpent' monster summoned on your side as mine for three turns ! And I choose to take your Basilisk !"

"Curse you, ... POTTEEEEER !"

"'Basilisk guarding the Castle', attack Lord V.'s 'Diary of Immortality' !"

"NOOOOOOO !"

** The twins would have a deck with monsters that look silly but is incredibly effective. Frog Burn FTK maybe?
