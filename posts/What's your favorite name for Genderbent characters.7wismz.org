** Always-A-Member-Of-The-Opposite-Sex or Majicked into it?

For the latter, I prefer no change. "Hello, my name is Robert" "... You're a girl. Is that short for anything?" "Naw, Accident with a dragon and a drunk dwarf. Just call be Robert, or Bob for short" "...."

Best way to avoid the first law of gender bending is to not overly care about said condition. Plus character who just don't give a hoot are fun to read.

*** There are also a number of "Gender-Blender Names" that work equally well for either gender, usually with a slight change in spelling. (Danny and Dani, for instance.)

*** James Potter married Bellatrix Black, the elder daughter of Orion Black and fellow Gryffindor.

Severine Snape had a crush on Liam Evans, who fell in love with Bellatrix Black. He was heart broken when she chose his best friend James Potter. When James and Bellatrix were later betrayed, people assumed Liam did that out of jealousy.

Bellatrix sacrificed herself to protect her daughter Rose and took down Voldemort (Emily) with her.

Later, Rose made friends with the bookish Victoria Weasley. They didn't like the bossy show off Leon Granger at first. Leon made Victoria cry on Halloween 1991, but deeply regretted it and saved her from a Troll later with Rose Potter.

**** Why is James not genderbent? (Also, I think the Marauders era would go rather differently to canon either way.)

****** I usually find that works better with a matriarchal society, otherwise you have to start the gender bending only after the Marauder's parents are born.

Edit to add: I'm particularly referring to Sirius' parents here.

** I don't have a favorite name for genderbent characters except for when they're interesting, well-constructed versions from a particular story. When that happens, that name is almost "taken" and future, different characters with the same name become harder to read.

For example, it's difficult for me to think of any Jasmine Potter without thinking of /A Long Journey Home/.

Draco Malfoy - Solaris Rosier, daughter of Acrux Rosier and Lucretia Malfoy
