Like, any good ones where his wand is personified as an actual character? Preferably in a manner where Harry is the only one this happens to. Maybe a quirk of being Master Of Death and its the Elder Wand or something?

Bonus points if the Wand fulfills the requirements of the prophecy - wand was crafted 'as the seventh month died' to 'those who trice defied him' (Fawkes defying Voldie is easy, but how do you do that with a tree?) and was 'marked as his equal' via the whole Priori Incantatem GoF thing. Dunno how the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' thing would work but hey ya never know.


** linkffn(10210053) its a consequence of being a talented wizard. I think Dumbledore and Kingsley also heard their wands

** linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone) has a personified wand, but it's also heavily AU - I don't think the story has established that there /was/ a prophecy, let alone that it had the same wording as in canon.

*** The wand mentions a prophecy almost right away, like chapter four I think.

It was about there I gave up on it. It's not a narration style I can get into.

** My “Whispers” story in my one shot collection (and sequel) probably qualify.
