** Honestly it had to have happened at some point.

Maybe Molly gets the flu, or has to leave for a week and the world is never the same again (especially after Minerva and Moody got involved and wiped the floor with everyone)

....Or maybe /Molly and Arthur/ wipe the floor with everyone hmmm...

*** Well, Fred and George have to get their pranking from somewhere!

I love the idea of Molly and Arthur being great at pranks in their Hogwarts days.

** Fred and george are bored in Grimmauld and decide to prank Sirius and Remus, after all what could an old professor and an azkaban fugitive do ?

Sirius and Remus are outraged, how dare someone prank the pranksters of all pranksters ? They're about to show them what happens when you mess with a marauder.

Molly Weasley is furious, this is not the time for such childish behaviour, she tries to make everyone clean that damned house to appease the tensions.

Minerve McGonagall is tear eyed, but you won't get her to admit that.

Severus Snape won't spend another minute more than necessary in the headquarters. This is giving him too many bad memories and almost got him questioning his position as a spy. This is not what he signed up for. He doesn't need a reminder of his teenage years.

Albus Dumbledore is amused. Everyone needs to smile in this dark times.

Of course all of this stopped after Harry got attacked by a dementor. Sirius and Remus were brought back to reality and Fred an George respected the marauders too much to continue.

** So, you have chosen /death/.

--------------

Edit:

I'm imagining some scenario where the Weasley twins think to themselves,

"Poor Sirius, we ought to do something to liven his life up a bit."

"Put some pep in his step!"

"Make him tread a little lighter!"

...

And then Sirius and Remus drop a hammer on them.
