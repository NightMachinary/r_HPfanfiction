Harry creates another secret order that does a better job than the order of the Phoenix. He creates an entire separate identity for the groups leader. It also has other students in as well it might also have some elements of time travel. But sadly cannot remember much more than that, was years ago when I read it. Any help is appreciated ðŸ”®


** This is the only one I can think of where he starts a new group with new identitys
