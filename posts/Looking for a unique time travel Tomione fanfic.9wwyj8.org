So I read this fanfic last year but my phone melted, and now I can't find it. It's a time travel fanfic but not. I don't know if I suck at searching google or if the fanfic is gone.

The story takes place after the war, the trio is looking for Death Eaters and clearing out bases. Hermione is in a shack of sorts and stumbles across an unknown horcrux that sends her back in time. Hermione, falling though time, meets Tom throughout certain points in his life. Tom falls for her and tries to help send her back to her time. Tom eventually realizes that he isn't real, just a soul fragment reliving his memories over and over until Hermione came and changed them. He comes to the conclusion that to save Hermione, who is slowly dying because of the horcrux, he has to let her go and destroy himself. In the end Hermione wakes up in the care of Harry and Ron who found her and a destroyed horcrux.

I remember certain parts of the story. Like Hermione appears out of order to Tom. Like one minute she's in his room at the orphanage tending to little Tom the next she's falling from the ceiling landing in the middle of Professor Slughorn's class. At one point Tom is at Hogwarts trying to apply for the DADA position and is holding her professing his love while she's disappearing. Also to explain why she keeps popping up at Hogwarts, Dumbledore and Hermione come up with the excuse that Hermione is an Auror with a broken/malfunctioning portkey.

Anyone know of this fanfic or did I dream this up?


** This sounds amazing. I wish I could help.
