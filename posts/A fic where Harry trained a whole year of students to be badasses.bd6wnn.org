I cannot for the life of me recall the name of an amazingly hilarious Fic I read that included Harry training the Seventh Years to be badasses and having Moody be a bit of a fan of his. If any of you can give me the name of that fic I'd be grateful.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
