James Potter was a Gryffindor to the end. Brave, Arrogant and bold, Just like his father before him. But James wasn't only raised by his father, his mother Dorea, was Slytherin to the core and she taught her Gryffindor son to ask questions while performing Brave acts of Heroism. What would have happened if James Potter the Gryffindor that bled red and gold , also had a tongue of silver?


** while it's generally accepted fanon that Charles and Dorea were James' parents, it's canon that his parents where Fleamont and Euphemia. nothing is really known about them though so house wise? /shrug/ only thing known is that it was hard for them to have kids and had pretty much given up on having them until Euphemia found out she was pregnant

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.
