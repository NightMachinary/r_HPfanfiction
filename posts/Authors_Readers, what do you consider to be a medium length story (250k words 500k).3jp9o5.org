Currently writing out the outline for a John Watson X Jack Harkness fanfiction, and trying to get a good idea of how many chapters I should write in. Thanks for any and all input!


** 60k-150k words. But it all depends on the reader.

*** Same here. As to 500k+, those are definitely epic for me, 300k+ is as a matter of fact. 150k-300k would be long then.

What I like more depends a lot on how much time I have and therefore how many days I'll have to stay with the story (So if I can only read 2-3h a day, I prefer medium length, as it lessens the chance of me getting interested in some other type of story along the way, but if I can spend the whole day reading, long to epic it is, so I don't have to search for something new every couple days.)

** Here are the lengths of the actual Harry Potter books.

The Philosopher's Stone - 76,944\\
The Chamber of Secrets - 85,141\\
The Prisoner of Azkaban - 107,253\\
The Goblet of Fire - 190,637\\
The Order of the Phoenix - 257,045\\
The Half-Blood Prince - 168,923\\
The Deathly Hallows - Approximately 198,227

I admit long fanfiction stories have spoiled me quite a bit: I now consider 100k-200k to be medium length.

*** I've got a rough outline of 17 chapters right now. So anywhere from 15-20 chapters. However, chapter length is also a factor. I might need to have only 5 000-15 000 words per chapter, so my chapter limit could easily double there. I'm basically checking to make sure my outline is viable, with that query.

*** This. Chapter length is dependent on personal preference - I started with 3K minimum, these days I am shooting for 5K to 8K words.

As long as you have a good stopping point - with regular updates, cliffhangers are fine - and decent mini-arcs built in, you're fine.

** I consider ~80-100k to be medium. Stories above 300k I often see classed as 'epic' length.

** For fan fiction, I'd say:

- 15k- is short

- 15-115k is medium

- 115-250k is long

- 250k+ is beginning to be /too long/ for a single story

- 500k+... a bit /absurd/. ( That's when it starts to mess with your dreams.. )

Look at the [[http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-longbook2507/2.jpg][Harry Potter series]] for example. I've always thought most of them were decent length books, the medium length books (first three) are easy to knock out in a few hours, after that they start getting a bit wordy and it takes longer.

With Fan fiction, it's about the same. (Except those huge 500k+ fics...)

** ~115k is medium length for me. Used to consider 200k medium length until I started reading more fast-paced, action-packed fics.

** I consider 150k to 300k medium-length. The length I consider perfect. Reading them doesn't take too long but can have a fair bit of story.
