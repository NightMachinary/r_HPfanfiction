The characters don't need to talk about theory or anything, although judging by the number of fics with eleven-year-olds defending traditionalist Pureblood rule with theory, there's gotta be some fics like that out there.

(Also pls don't start a fight with me about politics. I just want to read something nice. I don't bash your requests, pls don't bash mine.)

Don't care what era. Fine with slash or femslash, fine pairing or no pairing. Fine with Snape. Not fine with Umbridge haha. Not fine with Harry as a cop

  "What's false consciousness?" asked Ron curiously. I knew he would be more open to communist ideas because he was part of the proletariat, whereas Hermione was part of the bourgeois intelligentsia.

  "False consciousness is when people think communism is bad," I explained. "Since communism is good, it means they're obviously insane."

  "Harry, are you a communist?" asked Hermione in a quiet voice. I could tell she was scared, probably of losing her private property.

** "Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy. It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished."

So. Google gave me this. This doesn't sound bad at all? Why would you be worried about a fight starting over it? Everybody having equal rights should be the norm in the world. Just ask yourself this: Would /I/ want to be discriminated against in life? If the answer is no, then you can't ever say it's right to do it to other people. It's that simple. Anybody who tries to deny others the same rights they have themselves is just immoral and wrong.

Unfortunately politics is a very polarizing topic of discussion. It can lead to heated arguments where we forget the human behind the screen and result in discussions that violate Rules 2 and 3 of the subreddit.

There is too much to go into a discussion than can be simplified into a reddit thread, or even comment. I encourage you to do more research on your own, using unbiased, neutral sources for information. For the most part, we tend to recommend not discussing politics because it can lead to less-than-stellar comments.

*** Google "Right-wing Politics" and see what the results are. Or participate on Reddit as a non-leftist, and watch how fast you can rack up negative karma.

The assumption is, of course, if you're not "left wing" or are against the "left wing" that you must be against "equality" and "fairness", etc. Which, as a Libertarian who has equal disdain for Democrats and Republicans, is complete and utter nonsense.

If you're curious, look into Google's hiring and advancement policies, including the multiple lawsuits they're currently in over them. Then ask if that's what "equality" means when you read that definition.

Of course Google's motto of "Don't Be Evil" kind of goes out the window when you realize they're helping the Chinese government to track people's "Social Score" and have gone out of their way to assist China covering up the fact that they're putting people into "Re-education" Camps, and several million people (the majority Muslims) have "gone missing" from those. Presumed dead by many, but an inconvenient thing to discuss in any event.

Ask yourself if a company that facilitates, or even participates, in that is the company you trust to run the entire Internet - because they pretty much do. And you can watch videos online of their executives online talking about the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election being a mistake they won't allow to happen again.

As far as fanfic goes, everyone is allowed to read whatever they'd like, obviously. Personally, I have a hard time thinking of Communism/Socialism (i.e. what many 'Leftists' advocate for) in any sort of positive light considering it has resulted in many, many times more atrocities than Nazi-ism did. But hey, some people like Death Eater centric fanfic where they're justified in their actions because of Reasons, and I'm sure I've read some stuff other folks find terrible over the years too. It's kind of like playing the GTA games - nobody condones murdering people for fun....but Video Games!

To each their own and all that.

Of course, this being Reddit, I get downvoted and the vulgar non-reply is ZOMG aweosme!!1ty because my viewpoint isn't the popular one.

**** Out of curiosity, do you have a source for Google helping China with tracking social scores? Using Duckduckgo and Bing, I couldn't find anything to corroborate that other than a deleted Infowars video which I won't honor as a viable source given the controversies that follow Alex Jones. Also it's been deleted, invalidating any information it holds as it's is not observable.

I'm not asking because I don't believe that it's possible, but because it matters a lot to me as a modern consumer given Google's power over the internet. Were it to be true, my behavior would likely change.

The World knows China is committing human rights atrocities at worst, and is abusing their citizens at best. And we know Big Tech is helping them to build their surveillance state beyond any reasonable point (assuming their is one.)

Is it a reach to say Big Tech (Google at the center of it) is helping China to find dissidents, knowing they will be placed in re-education camps or made to disappear? That's probably up for discussion.

****** By that logic, I'm helping China build its surveillance network whenever I buy a product manufactured there via my minuscule contribution to their economy. It seems a stretch to conclude that Google, Facebook, IBM, etc. are helping to build China's surveillance network because they collaborate with Chinese Universities/AI talent on research. An unfortunate effect of capitalism is that the AI talent pool of China is a competitive advantage that American tech giants can't afford to ignore. I can somewhat understand one's disdain for them doing so (I think?), but it still feels like a highly misleading claim.

Now, if you had a source that could prove that China was contracting Google to spy on their citizens abroad or to develop algorithms directly for the Chinese military, then that would be a good example of ' helping the Chinese government to track people's "Social Score"'.

Also, while I didn't address it in the prior response, I was unable to find anything about Google directly aiding China in covering up evidence of the re-education camps.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

"Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy. It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished."

So. Google gave me this. This doesn't sound bad at all? Why would you be worried about a fight starting over it? Everybody having equal rights should be the norm in the world. Just ask yourself this: Would I want to be discriminated against in life? If the answer is no, then you can't ever say it's right to do it to other people. It's that simple. Anybody who tries to deny others the same rights they have themselves is just immoral and wrong.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

There's really only the Harry becomes a communist parody that I can think of, though. But yes, it would be nice to see something different since so many fics revere purebloods or try to both sides the death eaters and the order of the phoenix or straight claim the death eaters had a point.

Also, not necessarily a "leftist" fic but it pokes a bit of fun at the pureblood artistocracy trope "Harry Potter, Lord of the Swamp."

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15175937/chapters/35193059]])

An exploration of wizarding culture as pertaining to working and middle classes. It's a WIP but very interesting, and I've been trying to find works like this ever since reading it.

Everytime people talk about wizarding culture, it's all, moste ancient this and lord that and other stuff and nonsense. What about the vast majority of wizarding people who probably don't come with vast manors and many, many vaults in Gringotts attached to their birth?

They'd have their own tales and their own ways of working magic and their own impact on society. They might not make someone a social pariah for not greeting them in the exact correct fashion, but they'd have other social traditions and taboos, etc. And what about down-market neighborhoods such as Knockturn alley? Some enclaves would have to have more Muggle influence in them while others would be more isolated. I can imagine insular wizarding villages peppering the British countryside. And the Welsh and the Irish and the Scottish would have vastly different mythologies, the same as they do IRL, especially considering how anti-nobility Scotland is. This is a whole society of possibly hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world that separated from the Muggle world centuries ago, which is a vast amount of time in terms of social evolution.

So what kind of culture do the Weasleys and the Lupins and the McGonagalls of the world have?
