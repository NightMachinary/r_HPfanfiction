*Had this little idea while reading Forging the Sword (It really excelled at giving each character their own specialty). It always struck me a lost opportunity that its mostly the main character that has unique powers or attributes. Throughout cannon we see friendships form and individuals come into their own, working together to overcome obstacles they couldn't tackle on their own. And what's the point of fanfiction if we cant take known talents bring them to extremes?

-

Draco ducked behind a crate as spellfire screamed above him.

"This was supposed to be easy" he cursed under his breath. looking over at Hogsmeade, he couldn't believe what he was seeing.

Today was supposed to mark the Dark Lords first major offensive. An all out attack by his forces, bolstered by his followers that had just been released from Azkaban. As usual, Potter had to mess it up

But looking at the square, doing a double take, it wasn't just Potter that was decimating the Dark Lord's forces. His four friends were too. Oh, Draco knew that they were ahead of the class, ate, studied and schemed together. You couldn't sneak up on one without having two appear behind you. But that didn't explain what was occurring in front of him.

Longbottom was next to Potter, whispering into the ground his want moving in complex circles as he surveyed the battlefield. Vines, trees and flowers ruptured the flagstones around the square as they ate up killing cursed and entangled the unwary. Draco gasped as a bright purple plant shot spores into the mouth of a death eater, only for more of the same plant to burst through his chest, seeking their next victim. "Oh God", that was Dolohov! A second later a tree that behaved similar to the whomping willow twisted to absorbed a bombarda before caving in the skill of its attacker.

He could make out the pale sheen of Luna's hair as she stumbled past a death eater. No, just as she stumbled a spell past just centimeters above her head. She fired a stupefy at a shielded opponent and he chose that exact moment to drop his protection, falling into another death eater who misfired a spell that hit an ally. Spells were focused on her for a second and all seemed to just miss before he lost sight of her again.

Granger, he knew she was smart, but what were those spells she was using. He'd never even heard of most of them and they seemed impossible complex. Her wand was a blur as visible and half visible spells streamed from it. One death eater has his protego turn against him and start to crush. One managed to redirect an orange spell only for it to curve around to slam into his back and cause his clothes to rip into shreds and start going up his nose. Another was taken down by a flock of birds who then produced mini wands of their own. Seeing motion near the window of a two story shop, he could swear there was another Granger firing down near-invisible spells into the throng, a large hour glass round her neck. It was chaos.

If Longbottom was a bastion of defense, Potter was an all out frontal assault. Sure his magic was always a bit stronger than others, the half blood had that going for him, but this was ridiculous; His bombardas hit with enough power to shatter multiple shield and the booms shook the earth. His stupefies blasted people back with enough force to cave in shop walls and... did an expelliarmus just rip a death eaters entire arm off?!

And Weasley, just poor, rude, average Ronald Weasley, the least of all his brothers. He stood behind Granger, elevated on a rock stool and calmly observing the opera of death all around like a proud general. Every couple seconds he would conjure a pitifully small shield in front of his allies, a pitifully small shield that was always angled to deflect spells just enough to miss. Draco's mouth hung open as Weasley conjured a sword only to spin around and behead a death eater sneaking up behind him, when had the youngest brother gotten so quick? Just as more death eater arrived on the scene and the group became surrounded again, he raised his wand to his throat and barked out a series or random numbers. Were those chess positions? The five abruptly shifted focus and positions, focusing and utterly destroying the reinforcements. That was Avery who just succumbed to dozens of spells, his body was unrecognizable.

Glancing at the burning mark on his arm, he looked back at the group and gulped. The five had just destroyed a majority of the Dark Lords forces in mere minutes. What had he gotten himself into?


** Top Secret: Merlin class clearance: Preliminary recruitment report_ From the files of the Unspeakables:

Subject: Potter, Harry. Apropos: (The Chosen One, future designation; Agent Reaper)

Potter is rather headstrong, and while some may call his battle tactics stupid, others would say no planning is needed. While not the most knowledgeable in spells or battlefield movement Potter has shown a trifecta of skills that make even seasoned Aurors jealous. With incredible power behind each spell cast, rivaling even Dumbledore, Potter is capable of sending targets into low orbit in seconds with a wingardium leviosa, his Bombardas are equivalent to muggle battleship rounds, and I have personally seen him dismember a man with a simple Expelliarmus. Other documented examples of Potter's phenomenal power levels include surviving the effects of Basilisk venom for minutes at the age of twelve, where it would normally be near instantly fatal, and casting a patronous charm so powerful it banished over 100 dementors, actually burning a few into dust. Secondly Potter's draw speed is near supernatural, and has been timed at mere milliseconds. This is not limited to simple casting however, Potter's reaction speed and spatial awareness are truly incredible. Dodging spell fire beyond his vision range, predicting hit locations and moving before impact, tracking and capturing disarmed wands in mid battle and reflecting multiple spells with a single cast simultaneously. Agent Chameleon, a member on the Auror force apprenticed to "Madeye" Moody has stated that her mentor has complained "that if he had more Aurors with half of Potter's talent that Voldemort would have never risen the first time." Finally Potter's acucuacy is unrivaled by any on the force. He has been documented to be capable of jinxing the wings off a fly from over six hundred meters.

Recruitment recommended, field agent likey, task force Alpha; high risk situations, squadron support and heavy hitter, possible leader material with some more training. Pending final review before approval.

Subject: Granger, Hermione. Apropos: (Know It All, future designation; Agent Athena)

Please keep in mind this witch has yet to graduate her seventh year of Hogwarts, and yet she is able to verbally recite as well as perform at minimum acceptable levels (near perfect pronouciation, wand movement, average power levels behind cast) a documented 793 spells, most of which are not taught as standard or even advanced Hogwarts curriculum. Project Horoscope is a result of an incident in Granger's second year, where she brewed what was thought of as a textbook perfect example of Polyjuice (NEWT level potion), further review shows subtle differences in standard make-up, and may be the reason she was so easily returned to her original form after accidentally ingesting a sample contaminated with feline hair (though she has been observed displaying feline traits, including night vision, increased reflexes and more acute hearing, and an a tendency for her hair to puff up when upset.) We are currently trying to reverse engineer her version of the potion and are researching applications in animal transformations. While Granger's power levels and casting speed are on par with witches her age, her affluence in creating paragraph long spell chains with cascading and intertwined effects that simply drown out or bypass opponents spell work is astounding. We have yet to figure out how she has been able to summon a bound God as a familiar (see Subject Nabu), nor how she seemingly left a self sustaining black hole inside of Malfoy manor after her escape that lasted for an estimated 7 hours and consumed the manor and 76% of the surrounding grounds.

Recruitment recommended, research and development department, subject shows aptitude for field research as well. With enough experience she may come to lead that department. Pending final review before approval.

Subject: Weasley, Ronald. Apropos: (Weasel King future designation; Agent Checkmate)

One could call this young wizard a savant genius. While he displays a lack of intelligence or efforts in anything not related to eating, Quidditch, or chess, from even his first year at Hogwarts he has been observed to be capable of concocting multistage modular plans at merely a few seconds of observation. Given more time he can plan out an estimated 10,000 outcomes to a single action, capable of directing a battles outcome to his optimal goals. He was observed to have solved the Tri-wizard tournaments third task hedge maze before the second contestant had made it in. He later reveled he had Granger charm a parchment with the protean charm to match one Potter had and easily directed him through the maze. this of course led Potter to the cup a hour ahead of any other contestant, even though potter was simple walking at an average pace and entered last. (Potter later stated he would have rather gon with plan A: blast a hole through the entire maze, but thankfully Granger talked him out of it.) With enough motivation Weasley is capable of great things, therefore we have tasked Jr. Agent Glamorous; our information broker currently attending Hogwarts to begin grooming him by using the one thing a male teenager could never resist, female attention, so far results look promising.

Recruitment recommended, tactics and management department, subject shows aptitude as squad leader. Flag for fast track to eventually lead The Department. Pending final review before approval.

**** Not necessarily. See, it's a difference between active and passive power.

The Death Eaters and their master are attempting a conquest, so they have to actively exert power.

Harry and his friends just wanted to enjoy a Hogsmeade weekend. The DE's matter only as long as they are an obstacle towards that goal. The DA do not have a motive to throw their weight around beyond that.

The end result would be shifting the conflict away from Voldemort (a good thing since the whole "Prophecy is be all, end all. It must happen " is overdone...) and towards those supremely powerful teenagers growing up and looking for their place in life. For Harry "Just Harry" Potter, this would be especially hard. Boy-Who-Lived-To-Put-Merlin-To-Shame would be something he'd never live down.

At least, that's my approach, [[/u/aidan6am]]

***** The concept you outline here reminds me of linkffn(Harry is a dragon, and that's ok). None of the big threats actually seem to threaten him, but combat isn't the focus of the story at all.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I loved Luna's Master of Tides performance. Ebb and flow, Luna. Ebb and flow...

I've seen somewhere a variation on the usual "Seer Luna" cliche where she was not a seeress, but merely had the power of unbiased observation. Where normal people rely on their knowledge base to draw conclusions and might try to match to a known pattern, that Luna basically used a Fourth Wall as a mirror to view the universe with.

"My lord, we have a problem. Potter and his companions are completely destroying our army. Our thousands of inferi cannot even touch them. Even our elite Death Eaters fall to them after a handful of seconds."\\
"Hmm...an unfortunate turn of events, but not insurmountable."\\
"What will you do, my lord?"\\
"A bluff, I think. Find Augustus and Bellatrix, tell them to use the Menacing Aura Charm, in red."\\
"Oh! You intend to trick Potter and his friends into thinking you're invincible!"\\
"I /am/ invincible, but yes. After a few minutes of useless fighting, their goal will no doubt become to retreat."\\
"What then, my lord?"\\
"Then? Then...we level grind, and seek out better weapons. In particular, news has reached my ears of the Elder Wand..."
