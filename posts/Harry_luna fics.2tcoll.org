I suddenly got an urge to read a harry/luna fic. I've read a lot of harry/luna/someone else, but i can't remember any that are purely harry/luna. Especially not ones that show luna's sweeter side rather than her loony side.

So, anyone got any reccomendations?


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because they're two of the finest Harry Potter fanfics ever written.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, if I remember correctly (read it years ago), but I recall some rather compelling moments that may make it worthwhile.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but very intelligent fluff, and well worth reading despite being abandoned after 8,000 words.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help of a Seer]] was pretty good, iirc, although it's been several years at this point. Very AU after a while, but starts with atleast one foot in canon.

** So, I'm recommending this with a big warning on it. If you don't like sex, don't go any further. If you don't like BDSM, don't go any further. And if unhealthy relationships really squick you out, stop right now.

That said, I enjoyed the /hell/ out of [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks & Englishmen]]. It's got everything I mentioned, and even though I found myself sometimes glossing over the sex, the characters were enough to keep me coming back. I really, really enjoyed this fic.

*** I have read this, and found it my least favourite of rorsach's stories. Crazy luna bugs me a lot, hense why i specifically asked for less crazy luna.

**** Lunar Harmony and its variances are generally pretty bad for characterizations, I've found. More like Harry (barely)/yes-woman 1/yes-woman 2. Luna in particular seems to wind up lulrandum instead of being dreamy and a little out of touch. H/L life is a fickle and frustrating thing lol

***** That tends to be the case with a lot of multi pairings. A self insert Harry and a collection of women unburdened by pesky things like personalities and their own desires outside of what Harry wants. Blech.

****** I was reading one recently which was H/Hr/Daphne, and it just tripped over itself from the get go. The author had to LITERALLY deus ex machina to make sure no complications arose from silly things like parents being not on board with a "triple soul bond." I think my favourite part of it was when the author writes that Daphne and Hermione are also soul bonded, and then they continue to essentially ignore each other in favour of dangling off Harry as "his girls." Creepy fuckin' fic. I could complain more, but yeah lol

I lost my suspension of disbelief pretty quickly with that one.

******** Nailed it on the head, there. Awful stuff. Harry became Draco Malfoy except instead of his father hearing about this, it's "My solicitor will hear about this!"
