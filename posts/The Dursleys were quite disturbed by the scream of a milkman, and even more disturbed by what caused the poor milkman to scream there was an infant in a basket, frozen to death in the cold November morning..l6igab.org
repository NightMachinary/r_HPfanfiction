It was quite negligent to leave an infant out overnight on a cold November night.

PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE EDIT

Can all the people commenting that Warming charms are a thing just find the oldest comment that Warming charms are a thing and upvote that?

I've gotten several comments in my inbox which were for all practical purposes identical.

Also, I hate to have to point this out in every prompt I've ever made, but this /is/ a writing prompt. The fact that Warming charms exist is not really relevant to the prompt, except for a note for the story to work if warming charms actually do exist in the story, it makes Dumbledore look even more negligent, or even potentially malevolent, in his treatment of Harry.


** Not to mention that Harry was a year and a half old. He wasn't a little baby anymore, he was fully a toddler. By that age he would have been walking and saying words.

He could have woken up and wandered off at any time. He could have been two blocks away by the time Petunia set out her milk bottles.

**** The hot air charm is canon, though a more pemanent warming charm doesn't seem to be. However there's also the impervius charm, which protects a garment from +the weather+ water, so you could keep the blanket from getting too cold +or+ from getting wet possibly?* The only time it's used is on Harry's glasses, but the spell doesn't imply it only works on glasses/glass. Bluebell flames are also a thing, so keeping a small flame under the blanket until dawn is also a possibility, though that would damage the blanket.

Edit: So I got the impervius charm wrong, but the point remains as it keeps water out still, and winter is just water, even if it's in the form of snow.

I obviously don't know anything about magical healing, but I went to muggle medical school and you can /bet/ that a toddler who's just been, like, electrocuted or smashed on the head or whatever the equivalent of this is would not be safe to be sedated.

****** No, you cannot. Respectively, you can trust teenagers to exactly try to whatever you have forbidden them. There is even very famous scene in the film here (“Obecní škola”, “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elementary_School][The Elementary School]]”), where the director of school forbids children to lick railings while it is freezing. And of course, he has to remove with soldering lamp some kids with their tongues sticking to the railing. The phrase “Neolizujte zábradlí!” (“Do not lick railings!”) is the common phrase here, why excessive warning of teenagers can lead to giving them wrong ideas in their heads.

Vernon Dursley hummed as he selected his most boring tie, Petunia tried to feed Dudley and generally all was right with the world. Dudley showed himself to have a strong will already, ever since he discovered the word 'no'. So precocious already!

All that peace and quiet (as far as there /is/ any quiet when a kid is throwing everything he can at the wall) was disturbed by a loud scream, a great clattering, and more screaming. Petunia hurried to the door. The first thing she saw was the milk, threatening to spill over her lovely shoes, and the shards of glass, surrounding a basket. With a baby in it. A pale blue baby, as a matter of fact, with a scar on his forehead and eyes reminding her of orbs of emerald, because they were as lifeless as stones. The milkman, it appeared, had stumbled back in horror and - very unprofessionally - dropped his bottles. For a few seconds all was silence. Then Petunia began to scream.

Anyway, I just don't agree with your prompt's plausibility(not bashing the prompt, just saying I don't find it logically plausible to myself)(please don't downvote me for saying that. I truly don't mean to be rude if it came across like that).
