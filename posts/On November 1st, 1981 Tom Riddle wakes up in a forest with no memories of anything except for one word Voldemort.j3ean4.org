This idea just burst into my head, it should be kind of like the “Bourne” movies where Voldemort has absolutely no memories whatsoever and has to track down his past using vague flashbacks and clues he might have left himself in the case of memory loss. I think it would be appropriate for the story to start to develop a redemption arc for Voldemort and end with him regaining all of his memories and realizing that he was a monster.

It could also do some world building with Voldemort finding safe houses he's left himself all over the world with supplies such as magical items, journals, money (both muggle and magical) and different wands.

It would also be cool to see him being hunted by the Order of the Phoenix and him having no clue why.

** It's not exactly what you're looking for, but I remember there being some similar stuff in a fic I've read. Maybe linkffn(The Imposter Complex by NotusOren)? That's one in which *spoiler-because-i-dont-know-how-to-do-that-on-mobile* Diary Tom escapes and starts fighting against Main Voldemort.

Edit: or the summary can give it all away, that's cool too.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

*** In my mind a few hours after Voldemort wakes up and subconsciously starts using magic again, he's surprised but isn't too shocked and just assumes everybody can do magic. He keeps using magic until he ends up in a town and realizes that not everybody can do what he can after a person sees him do magic and freaks out.

** I *really* like this idea!\\
Jason didn't like what he discovered about himself and desperately tried to outrun his past.

I think I'd like to see him thrown back into his youthful body and go from there, though: The idea that he'd be forced to overcome the handicap of having a hideous appearance ON TOP of everything else would be horrendous, but how interesting for him to have to still discover that he's *magical*!

Even as of the last Bourne movie Jason still didn't remember his childhood or growing up, so perhaps Young amnesiac Tom could actually bypass the memories of what caused him to despise both the mundane AND the Wixen worlds and if he's far enough away from England, he might be able to establish himself anew!

Thanks for posing such a delicious premise!\\
I want to read it! ;D\\

** Okay I spent the last 2-3 hours brainstorming on this idea because it sounds really fresh and fun to read/write. I think I've expanded a bit on the original idea and would love feedback on it. Its too big to type all the way out so I put it in a google doc link.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15t6pSGCSI0o6_6L2Cv5HoWWZzK_0qmSeyfSRnwuWIqY/edit?usp=sharing][Voldemort Lost in The Woods by Aiya Knight]]

This is a TLDR of the changes/additions. There are more but you will have to read the document I linked to see them.

1. James and Lily both survive the night they are attacked however James loses his magic/gets restricted after deciding to give up lily and harry to live. Lily was with child and is cursed.
2. James has a proper pureblood wife, Lily doesn't know about the wife or know she just got a consort title.
3. Tom Riddle used his fan girl who gave benefits (myrtle) in the horcrux journal ritual and awakes in the forest with the journal(no horcrux) and myrtle beside him.
4. Lily Evans wakes up baron with her baby womb cursed, child lost, marriage contract voided and muggle/magical full guardian rights of the Potter Scion Harry James Potter.
5. Tom Riddle/Elizabeth Warren Ship (both memory loss)\\
   James/Pureblood Princess Ship(to be determined)\\
   Lily Evans unmarried, full harry custody with full marriage contract penalties.

** First of all, let me just say this: Him going back to the way he was seems pointless to me. Why go through all that, only for him to wind up at the same point he was before the fic began?

Second of all: How about he ends up as a kind of Magic-based superhero? Like, he reads some DC and Marvel comics and thinks to himself, 'That might be cool, given my powers.'

For those who say, 'But he's a psychopath!' He's a psychopath in the sense that he has anti-social personality disorder. But psychopaths CAN experience love, just not the kind Rowling wrote about in HP. That kind of love is warm, fuzzy feelings for people. But another kind is that of an act of the will.

I highly doubt Superman has warm, fuzzy feelings for everyone. Well, maybe the Silver Age Superman did, but whatever. =Clarks love for humanity is more an act of the will, as is our love for our loved ones when they annoy/are mean to us.

Like, Tom could be a hero to the Muggle world(Whom he has convinced of his supposed 'origin' as an alien from the planet Kryptoscant.), and a villian to the wizarding world(Despite his pleas that he's a new man, and even his heroic actions).

His superhero identity would be simply 'Voldemort', and he would even have a secret identity as mild-mannered scientist Thomas Riddle.
