With all the things fanon added to the world of fanfictions and how many of them are universal from one story to an other, who do you think the infamous ‚Äòblank slate/pure-blood Ice Queen' married? I understand it could be just some guy (or girl, I won't assume anything) who isn't named even in the extended cast of fanfiction, but do you think one is more likely to be the lucky person than the other? Please do not say Harry Potter, I try to make this as serious as I can and I don't want a sarcastic answer.

**** The only mention I've found in the books is from the OOTP, when they're getting called up for OWLs - and Daphne gets called up in the same group as Hermione.

I /think/ that's the only time Daphne or Greengrass is used in the main 7 books.

** Excuse me, she's a strong independant Ice Queen who don't need no man (or woman.) Honestly I have no idea, given that her name is only even mentioned once in the books. Though based on how Slytherins in general are presented in canon, JKR probably intended her to be yet another blood purist, bully, and totally okay with genicide, which would obviously color the kind of person she'd be likely to marry.

** With the large caveat that we know nothing about her actual character and that this is assuming we're going with the fanon portrayal of her, the likeliest scenario I see is a later marriage. Witches and Wizards supposedly live a lot longer - it's always struck me as strange how quickly they pair off and have kids in canon, instead of in their late 20s or 30s.

From the generation that we see most directly, there are none that I can think of as great fits for the fanon version of Daphne - unless there's also a fanon pureblood that's got some power/influence/wealth and isn't a huge bigot. Instead, I imagine she's more likely to end up like Fleur - getting together with someone from another wizarding country.

** My best guess is that she marries someone like Roger Davies. Not a Slytherin boy, but a Ravenclaw elitist to keep her family neutral/grey.\\
The fact that she had no real 'power' in her year besides her reputation as an Ice Queen also shows that she is really trying to keep her family as neutral as possible. Pansy Parkinson had more influence than her I think - since she always followed Draco around like a lost puppy. So I believe that I am not far off to think that Daphne ended up marrying a Ravenclaw boy pureblood elitist (Ravenclaw and Slytherin are quite similar in many ways, both rear children who end up in politics or as Lord of their hoses, conducting business).\\
Most of the boys in Daphne's year in house Slytherin were either Deatheaters or influenced, and the older ones wouldn't have been affected by her Ice Queen persona.\\
That Ice Queen persona could also be a defensive mechanism to keep the boys of her year away since she isn't interested. Who knows.

Anyway, my bet is that she married some Ravenclaw whos father has some kind of important role in the ministry that boy will inherit.

** in my writing, I ship her with Theodore Nott and I see them as a couple who got together behind the scenes of HBP/DH and made it last despite marrying young, although I like the idea of them being a childfree couple. but my interpretation of Daphne is really different than the popular fanon version and I gave her a lot of extra backstory tied into her 7th year, so those people may not like how I've written the relationship. also if you hate the Slytherins in Harry's year, you will hate how I write them - but this is just something I do for fun so it's fine if people don't like it.
