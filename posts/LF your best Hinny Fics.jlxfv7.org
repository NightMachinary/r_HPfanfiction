So I'm writing a Hinny Fic, my partner loves the pairing. I want to read some good quality Hinny Fics to get a good grounding. I've never really read stories with that ship, so I don't have a basic idea about it.

So hit me up with your best Hinny Fics. Length isn't important, but I'd prefer if the stories didn't have any misogynistic elements to it, especially if those elements offer no purpose. Like the other day I read a story where Parkinson and Malfoy, after jumping Ginny and taking her hair, go about posing for playwizard and taking risque photos and basically making Ginny look like a slut. Don't remember the story but it ruined the whole thing for me. So yeah.

Edit: also Seeking Ginny by Casca

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

**** Just finished it. Thanks for recommendation. It's very well written but not for me. I think it's because it is too far off from what I was looking for. But still a good story People might not like it cause it's not Harry centric, Ginny dates others, Harry doesn't date at all, Harry messed up with Quidditch (even though that's cannon). I don't consider it a favourite because it's not Hinny but more Ginny, not that it's wrong, and because towards the end it's just following cannon. Even though the author put in a hell lot of effort, the ending bit is what most didn't like and she didn't change any there. She changed the bits most people do like. It's a very mature story and not everyone would be receptive to it.

  This story will be a series of unrelated chapters. All will be based on different moments in the JKR books where Harry and Ginny could have gotten together before they did in the Canon Story. Though the first is in the CoS they will be posted at random.

  An AU story with my take on what if Ginny had stepped in when Ron didn't believe Harry about entering the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Pure fluff. A bit long but I wanted this to be a one shot.
