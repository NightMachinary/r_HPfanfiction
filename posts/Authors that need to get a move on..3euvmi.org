*** I adore Inverarity's method because when I get the story, I get the story and I know it will be great. But I just break into fangirl smiles and weird twitches when I think about waiting just 1 more second for the eventual update. At least he is kind enough to keep us updated about progress.

Now obviously I need jacobk to hurry up please.

*** The problem I have with AQATWA is that while it isn't done and that while I can understand that Inverarity would rather release it as a whole work, I just plain don't like that they are withholding what's already written (which is around 200k words apparently according to their blog)

***** I guess from a readers point of view, fan fiction should always be free. From a writer's point of view, I am not sure I entirely agree. Why shouldn't someone be able to live off fan fiction? [[http://bookshop.livejournal.com/1044495.html][This]] list might be able to convince you. But even from the point of view of the original story writer... I dare say adaptations, modernisations and twists are the only way for fiction to become /classic/. As long as your story contains enough original ideas and is not plagiarising, I don't think it should necessarily be free.

****** Beyond the fact that the definition of "fanfiction" is stretched to the point of worthlessness, overwhelming majority of those authors do not and did not make a living off of fanfiction. Making stories that retell or adapt ancient mythology, centuries old plays, or a culture's fairy tales, the stories that are so historically significant that they've become part of our culture and have been reprinted by various publishers since the inventing of the press, is not nearly the same thing as writing "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince except Harry dates Hermione". There's no objective way to measure "enough original ideas" and the entire point of fanfiction is plagiarizing so that you can build a story off the popularity and audience knowledge of an existing world.

There's really no comparable real world situation that would fit the idea of selling fan fiction. The way I see it, using the world that JKR built, her characters, and her plot, to make yourself money is just scummy. If you want to make fanfic, you know going in you shouldn't sell it. If you want to write a story and sell it, create your own original world. I'll never pay for the sort of fanfic I read, but I have bought original works from authors that have written fanfics.

** robst needs to move on but in the opposite direction you are thinking of.

All of his stories have a character spectrum consisting of "awesome and everything works out" vs "damn near worthless and gets defeated or outdated". If I could convert each story into a map they would all end up at the same address.

I don't even dislike his writing that much. I just want an original piece of work. The fact that so much of his stuff occupies what is essentially the front page of H/Hr is a tragedy.

Enthusiasm for their work is great and nearly always appreciated, but please remember that writers have lives outside writing -- and also remember that fanfic authors are doing it /solely/ as a labour of love, and making not one red cent that pays their bills off of it.

Tell the authors you love their stuff, by all means (it's the only 'pay' fanfic authors get!) -- but the whole, "You need to get a move on" phrasing really smacks of entitlement issues.

When Hermione begins to see a gigolo for conversation and companionship, the foundation of her life is shaken to the core from revelations concerning every aspect of her life.
