doesn't have to be any pairings and such\\
just curious about the concept


** - “War in a time of peace by SecondStarOnTheLeft” linkao3(13143726) ... not completely excited about it; one of those stories which would required severe cutting down to make it readable
- Actually (SPOILER!) “Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89” linkffn(9566537) ... although it is certainly not the most important part of it

  Bellona de Poitiers begins her time at Hogwarts as an interloper for her French accent, for her Veela's blood, for the absence of her father.Hogwarts is not the haven she expected, though, and she quickly discovers that Slytherin is no true home to any interloper. With fewer friends than enemies, she does her best to keep her head down and muddle through safely.Then, just as she's about to return for third year, her father escapes from prison, and everything goes to hell.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
