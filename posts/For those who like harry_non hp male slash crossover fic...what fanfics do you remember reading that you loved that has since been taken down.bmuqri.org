And is no longer available to read online? I remember reading a Twilight/Harry Potter fanfic about Harry being sent to a camp by the Dursley's where he meets and falls in love with a male member of the Cullen family and vice verse.


** Serpens Arcanum(?) It was Snake-Thing!Harry/Drow OC and it was not the best quality writing but I loved it. As of this year I just can't find it anymore.
