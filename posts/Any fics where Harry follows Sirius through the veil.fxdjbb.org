  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

** *On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads* - linkao3(17926664)\\
The Veil isn't really the Veil, it's a dimensional crack. Manipulative Dumbledore, but in a reasonable capacity. No other bashing. Except maybe Odin. Well, he doesn't really follow him. It's more of an expedition?

*Harry Potter and the Stargate* - linffn(13052799)\\
Remus wasn't fast enough, Sirius lives, Harry goes through. H/LL. Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny bashing. The Dumbledore bashing at the end was hilarious. It borders on the level of absurdness you see in Champions Champion. Op Harry.

His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.
