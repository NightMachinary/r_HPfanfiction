Looking for stories where it focuses more on Harry as an Auror.

Any rating is fine, would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing, but any other pairing is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing, unless it's like Percy.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
