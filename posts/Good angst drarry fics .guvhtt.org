Hi, I'v just read : [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16138103]] And it was just so great and well-written, and now i'm craving for more angst drarry I'd like something in the same type with a depressed/sick draco and if it's possible a good characterization haha (i can't tell how much fics I began to read until I saw that Draco was just described as a two years old)

Thx hehe


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/GallaPlacidia/pseuds/GallaPlacidia/works?fandom_id=136512][GallaPlacidia]] has some fantastic angsty Drarry fics. My favourite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970/chapters/53596558][The Bucket List]], which also has dying Draco. I actually found you're the antidote for me through this fic, which the writer said inspired them. I also just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13826685][A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption]], which has a similar premise and is also fantastic. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4230765][Somebody to Love]], but it seems like it's hidden right now because of a challenge. These all have a Draco will die unless Harry loves him premise. General angst-wise, I also loved GallaPlacidia's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300][Dad says]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21650332/chapters/51627013][Lessons in Grace and Decorum]].

There was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/g8tc9w/fics_similar_to_the_bucket_list/][a post]] from [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] (where you're better off posting slash requests) with similar fics to ygtafm recced that you can check out!

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love. Also indebted to You've Got The Antidote For Me by Kandakicksass and IDK My BFF Hermione? by lettered

  A fuck-or-die fairytale in which Draco Malfoy lives a despicable and unapologetic life --- that is, until he's cursed to die unless he can fall in love with and fuck Harry Potter.

  In Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy gives Draco lessons in how to manipulate people into loving him. When Draco is released on the condition that he is bonded to Harry as his prisoner, he finally has a chance to put his newfound skills into practice. Forced bonding, eighth year (eventually), a Draco driven slightly mad by grief, a furious, self-destructive Harry, a whole lot of angst and a proportionate amount of comfort.Inspired by an excellent story called Unexpected Consequences by Lauren3210.

  When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.
