I would really love to see Harry (or other MC) using his magic to save the planet! I'm good with time travel and slash, but I'd prefer no harems. I'm also cool with crossovers when they're well explained.

** Well, linkffn(the queen who fell to earth) and it's trilogy. Except it has a harem and ‘no' slash. Well, it ‘does' have slash in the background, but it's not in focus...

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.
