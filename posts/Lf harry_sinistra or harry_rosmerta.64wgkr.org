******* So, I take it you're also not cool with Lupin and Tonks being together? He also knew her as a child.

We may be just on two different boats here. I'm of the opinion that if both partners are adults and therefore fully responsible for themselves and their own well-being, they can decide to be together, no matter the age difference.

********** I dont think he actually met her until her introduction canonwise but if sirius and andi were still talking before he went to prison---as my headcanon says they were due to both being disowned---she likely met him at least once pre-hogwarts while he was post-hogwarts.

******** Not entirely sure but I think age difference between Tonks and Remus is about ~13 to 15 years. Much better than 35+.

But yes of course couples often have big age differences. I'm generally fine with that. Just there is way too much of underage children paired with much older men/women in fan fiction. That is the part that I am less comfortable with.

********* That I totally agree to. Underage teenagers being together with adults is uncomfortable to read /at best/.

Afterwards, if they're all adults, 10 or 30 years - doesn't matter.

******* My high school band director recently married my old classmate. He met her when she was 13. She's currently 25.

Extremely unnerving, yes. But technically nothing wrong with it.
