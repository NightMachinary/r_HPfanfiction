Recently i have gotten back to loving fics where Harry fights back, so what fics can you guys recommend where harry does one or more of these things: Goes: "champion selection is on halloween? Im going to get entered! Prepare! Train! Protect myself!"

Doesnt compete so barty jr. Loses his magic. (Goblet cant read, so magical signature of the one entering the slip of paper)

Gets emancipated because the tournament is only for adults.

Doesnt play by the rules and wrecks havock on the tournament.

Doesnt think outflying a dragon is sane, and doesnt save ron but hermione from the lake. (Leaves the idiot down there? :p )

Reads the rules of the tournament and abuses the hell out of them.

Just makes dumbles/snapes/malfoys/rons lifes hell


** linkffn(Inspected by Number 13) has Harry showing the power of the +dark+ Bureaucratic side and why everyone fears the Inspectors.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.
