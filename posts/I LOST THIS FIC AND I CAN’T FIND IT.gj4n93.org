:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I have been searching for this fic I read a while ago. It's a dark harry potter fic with heavy light bashing. Harry is well aware of all the manipulations of the light side of the war and he either works for or with Lord Voldemort. I think it either starts the summer before fifth year or after fifth year. Harry spends a great deal of time either in Regulus's or Sirius's old room in Grimmauld place because he is done with Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore/Molly/etc. And they come banging on his door a lot to get him to come down but he has cast spell on the door so no one can get in. Harry is BAMF and he sneaks out of Grimmauld place frequently to report to Lord Voldemort. I think he also has the ‚Äúthe power the dark lord knows not‚Äù which is some form of necromancy or a sway over darkness itself. I don't think it's reincarnation or MOD but i cannot be sure.

So if anyone knows what fic I am talking about that would be great! If not I will keep looking and post it here when i find it.

Thank you üòä


** Any luck finding this?

It sounds like a bop, I'd like to read it if you ever find it!

Also I'm sorry if this notification made you think that someone had found it for you.
