*** I think this is the only remotely H/D fic I've read that I've liked. Really nice characterisation.

** linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

This is also Bellatrix/Hermione, and Tom Riddle just has a random Ministry job, he's only mentioned once. Thank you for the other recs though, will check them out. I tried reading Fractures, but the writing has a lot of issues, especially with tense, and is technically not up to scratch, will check out the others.

The Pureblood Pretense series has a Tom Riddle who became a politician instead of a Dark Lord.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Link for the fic where Harry is a serial killer and Tom Riddle is prime minister? That sounds interesting

*** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/][Dreams and Darkness Collide]] - I just remember that Tom Riddle doesn't become Voldemort but he used 'Voldemort' moniker while dealing with some other people. It's a aghast story. Probably ended up with Harry/Tom slash.
