As the title indicates, I'm looking for recommendations for the best Harry Potter crossovers where Harry ends up in the thing he's crossing over to's world. I'm ok if they blend the HP world with the crossover world or anything like that as well, as long as the the plot is not just a rehash of HP canon with extra characters along for the ride and not changing anything.

Bonus points if there is a romantic subplot and Harry actually gets with a female character from the other medium (book, series, tv show, movie, etc...).

I'm just looking for some new things to read and I've found crossovers to be the most exciting as they tend to veer off the canon path more than just HP stories. Thanks for all you're help in advance!

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

** The overall best HP crossover I've ever read was I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. It's a HP/Star Wars crossover where Harry goes through the veil to the Star Wars universe, and he meets Ahsoka and apprentices her. It's not done, but so far it's amazing.

1. Yeah, it did constantly say that the Jedi Order was wrong, but from Harry's perspective, an organization that takes children and sort of indoctrinates them towards their way of thinking probably wouldn't be something he'd like.

2. They has been absolutely no romance in the story yet, and there's been nothing remotely similar to a lemon in this fic, so I don't know where you're getting that from.

******* I have not read the story so I am just guessing right now, but there is a difference between a character being of the opinion that something is wrong and repeating it, and the story itself repeating the very same thing. In the former case it's just an opinion, but in the latter it is, for anyone that did not come into it looking for a specific fan fank, a “for fuck's sake, stop this shite already” kind of annoyance.

The question is: is it the character just repeating himself and that's it, or is there more to it? Because if the gist of it is that Harry takes offence to the “indoctrination” of the Jedi then anyone who isn't a complete backwater bumpkin will treat Harry's complaints as a personal bias and that is it; there are many issues with how Jedi handled things, including certain preconceptions that were just wrong because, despite how they looked at it, they /were/ grounded in their fears, but /indoctrination/, as it is known, is not actually an issue with them because to be a Jedi is a way of life and that is what this is about. This is why it matters whether it's just Harry complaining or if there's more to it.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** I remember really liking [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/argonaut57/][this HP/X-Men crossover]]. It's a series that starts out with Xchange Students. Harry/Ron/Hermione go to New York while Rogue/Iceman/Collosus head to Hogwarts. There's a few different ships and teased ships, both canon and crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1995083/22/Crumpets-Aren-t-My-Style][Crumpets Aren't My Style]] is HP/Stargate SG1: /General O'Neill is sent on a nice relaxing dipolmatic mission in the U.K. Of course there's bound to be trouble when he runs into a murderous cult called the Death Eaters, who've some how gotten their hands on alien technology./ Despite the summary, a big part of it is in the crossover world and a lot of HP characters end up in space.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818][D.S.S Requirement]] is great. I'm not sure how closely this fits though. It takes place in Hogwarts but they're technically in a space ship around Jupiter most of the time. The setup of the technology is from Stargate, but it's a series where the actual characters haven't intersected - yet. I'm only mentioning it because you wanted something that veers more widely off canon and this fic is pretty unique.

BTW, I'll probably be back with more later. I love crossovers so much, but my bookmarks all over the place.

**** Yeah, it unfortunately suffers from a problem I see in a lot of crossovers: writers just sort of jump in, creating convenient friends/romances/backgrounds in order to move the story along but not putting much time into development.

However, I think it does well in other areas. I like the characterizations. It develops a talented, mischievous, and confident leader in Harry without going too far or overpowering him. The loving but casual romances are just part of a larger story and don't veer into the melodramatic. Both the kids and adults (in both worlds) have parts to play and they're all competent. It manages to incorporate a ton of characters over the course of the series and create unique situations and fun interactions.

Despite it's flaws, I think the whole series is well worth a read.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

  Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

*** Ok, I really liked the HP/Sword of Truth one. Been many years since I read that book. Wish the story idea had been continued though. The one chapter was quite amusing. Harry was just trolling everyone with his magic.
