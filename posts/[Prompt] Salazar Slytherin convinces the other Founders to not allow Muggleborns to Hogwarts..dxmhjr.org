** Uh, how would that work out exactly? I'm intrigued, but this sounds like a one shot more than anything. And isnt that like the entire premise of durmstrang, purebloods only?

*** I'm going to play the devil's advocate here and Durmstrang only doesn't accept muggle-borns because Draco Malfoy said so. Which is not a truly reliable source. Viktor Krum had no problems with dating Hermione after all.

I don't see it feasible for Durmstrang to not accept muggle-borns and half-bloods at all, considering they cover the majority of Europe. But who knows. Maybe muggle-borns are just killed at birth everywhere East of France? (Yes, it is a dig at JKRs terrible world building).

In Britain, I can find it more plausible, the population is much smaller.

**** I have this head canon that there are places where children get taken out of their muggle families once they show magic, so there are no muggle-raised kids, but that difference is lost in translation towards Draco

**** Since Malfoy talks about his father wanting to send him there across countries, rather than the Hogwarts 'Britain and Ireland only' policy, it makes me think Durmstrang is a place you /have/ to apply to attend. Muggle-born kids can still attend a small local magic school but have no way to contact Durmstrang.
