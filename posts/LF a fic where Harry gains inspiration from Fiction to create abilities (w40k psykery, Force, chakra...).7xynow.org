#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Seven year old Harry Potter gets his hands on one of Dudley's comic books, a fictional tale of heroes using supernatural abilities called "Stands" to fight evil.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter gets interested in Star Wars and after a small piece of accidental magic starts to believe he is force sensitive and his magic powers develop accordingly. Deviates from canon quickly and without apology. Multi-year story. First year is posted. Second year, and Luna's first appearance, will follow when it's finished. Currently only Star Wars fiction influenced.

  The somewhat realistic and humorous story of Harry Potter, if he grew up watching a little too much Star Wars. - This takes place in the real world, where Harry is inspired by Star Wars to learn magic and discover the wizarding world in new and interesting ways. Canon secrets are revealed and hints are hidden throughout the story to discover what is really happening at Hogwarts.
