How, Why and When did Marriage law fanfics start and how are they so popular?


** I have no idea and they drive me nuts!

I've yet to see one I thought maintained a solid internal logic i.e. Wizarding kind just fought a war to be free of a fascist tyrant who espoused blood purity/eugenics so the Ministry decides to enact a law to enforce suitable breeding matches? Really? I can't imagine they wouldn't be forced out of office. If it's a conspiracy within the Ministry how do they get around Shakelbolt?

Further more, they usually include an arbitrary age range (17-50 for example) to ensure the participation of familiar characters but it doesn't make sense for the lawmakers to introduce this law and apply it to the youngest of the breeding age witches and wizards - who have decades and decades to find a suitable partner and have babies. Surely the law would first apply to those at the upper end of their fertile years who have not chosen to marry/have kids and whose genes/magical bloodline is in higher danger of not being passed on?

I have so many problems with the tropes that one usually finds in marriage law fics. Bah. Humbug.

** The only two types of marriage law fics I would read are:

1. Our heroes stage an revolution and get rid of those dark age murderers/rapists once and for all, very much in the *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution* style by Starfox5.

2. Our heroes stage an mass escape and let those inbred blood nazis die out by themselves, in the *Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law* style, linkffn(6049450), by kb0.

  After the war, the Wizengamot passes a law requiring all young wizards and witches to marry, and the Ministry will assign the partners. How do Harry and his friends react? H/G, but not overly so

** 2003, with a challenge on the whenikissedtheteacher Yahoo group, a group dedicated to the Snape/Hermione pairing.

"The Ministry of Magic has finally acknowledged, publicly, that the wizarding world is in danger as the continued intermarrying of the Pureblood line causes more and more stillbirths, squibs and barren children. In an attempt to save the old families The Marriage Law has been put into place. Under this law any Pureblood wizard or male head of a Pureblood family can petition for a betrothal contract giving them legal power over a Muggleborn witch. This step has been deemed necessary as they discovered Muggle families feel that betrothal contracts are too ‘old fashioned' and would rather let their daughters ‘fall in love'. Our leading man of choice is going to get a contract on Hermione."

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I'd love to know the answer to that one myself -.- (same for soulmates/soul-bonds or anything like that (vampire-"mate" in twilight or imprinting does count!) and for slash fics (I don't have a problem if it happens with characters that don't hate each other in the canon story, but I draw the line at people who hate each other - or the very idea of the other person (Draco and Harry are the best example, as they can't stand each other and they hate each others basic believes (pureblood bigotry for Draco and tolerance for Harry!)))

ps: I'd fight against either of them if I'd be forced into them (don't care if it's a supposed soulmate (don't believe in that trash, same for love on first sight...bullshit!) or forced through legal documents)...I'd rather die (and I mean that!) then give up my freedom just because somebody (or something) say I should do so! I think people are very strange in that regard (it's like women who have rape-fantasies but don't really want to be raped...it's strange and IMHO needs therapy!) and wouldn't want to be stuck in such a situation themselves (why they believe that somebody would be "Ok" with that is really beyond me!)
