1. Muddle in a Muddle

Lionel Muddle was just about to take a bite out of a particularly scrumptious pumpkin pasty, freshly-made for him by his wife that very morning when his boss summoned him into her office, sounding even less pleasant than usual. Lionel had only held his job in the /Accidental Magic Reversal Department/ for a week, and yet, he'd found out on more than one occasion just how short-tempered Hilda Blank could be. Eager to remain as close to her ‘good side' as possible (if such a thing existed), Lionel dusted off the loose crumbs from his suit of the pumpkin pasty he'd almost had the chance to eat, fixed his emerald-green tie and promptly presented himself in Hilda's spacious, immaculate office. His colleague, Arnold Peasegood was also present.

Hilda's face was flushed red, a stark contrast to her otherwise pallid complexion and a clear sign that someone was very soon going to feel her wrath. Her hair was mostly neat, save for a few flyaway hairs that had no doubt been forced loose each and every time she'd run a hand through the brown (but greying) strands in an effort to ground herself amidst the endless requests of a paranoid Cornelius Fudge and his equally anxious Wizengamot.

She immediately fixed Lionel with a glare, the hazel irises appearing threateningly icy - almost as if his immediate appearance had taken too long.

‘The Minister has given us another job, one that he wants cleared up immediately,' Hilda said, retrieving a document from the top drawer of her broad mahogany desk. ‘I've already explained a little about the job to Peasegood; however, the pertinent details are in this file.' Hilda handed the document to Arnold, and dismissed them both with a mere wave of her hand and a final statement. ‘I shouldn't have to tell either of you that I expect no mistakes on this case.'

Once outside Hilda's office, Arnold and Lionel took to examining the document given to them. While the envelope was white and pristine, the file inside was crumpled. Lionel found it easy to attribute its condition to Cornelius Fudge. It was common knowledge that recent events were getting to him. The details the letter contained were thorough, a large header reading:

‘SCHEDULED FOR OBLIVIATION: MARJORIE DURSLEY, LAST SEEN IN THE VICINITY OF MAGNOLIA CRESCENT, LITTLE WHINGING, SURREY.'

The document went on to explain that Ms. Dursley had been the unfortunate recipient of an accidental Inflation Charm and had been left airborne over Little Whinging for a couple of hours. A footnote revealed that her in-flight language had been particularly foul, containing mostly graphic threats aimed at Harry Potter and her ‘dreaded brother Vernon'.

‘We'd best get this seen to,' Arnold said with a grimace. ‘This sounds like it'll be one of the more enjoyable jobs.' His voice was laced with sarcasm.

‘I'm at your disposal,' Lionel replied, also grimacing. ‘It'll be an honour to meet Harry Potter though.'

‘You'll have no such luck there, Muddle. Hilda told me that he's fled his home. Fudge was furious when he found out; Sirius Black has escaped Azkaban, and his priority will be getting at Harry. Did you know he's Black's god-son?' Arnold shook his head. ‘The life that boy has lived.'

Lionel agreed. Only 13 years old, Harry had already seen too much in his life.

Arnold let out a cough, clearing his throat and moving forward with the conversation. ‘We'll need nothing more than our wands and perhaps a flask of Butterbeer for this one,' He chuckled weakly. ‘Let's go.'

The pair moved off from their department, finding their way to an available grate for travel using Floo Powder. Arnold went first, confidently announcing his destination. ‘LITTLE WHINGING!' There was a roar as flames every bit as green as Lionel's tie engulfed Arnold, and then there was nothing. Just an empty fireplace as if nobody had ever been there. Lionel had done this before, but he never had felt any better about it. With a slight tremor, he too shouted ‘LITTLE WHINGING!' and the roaring began. Two seconds later, he was hurtling at break-neck speeds towards the heart of Muggle suburbia.
