Harry's not the good guy. Nor is he the pseudo-good evil guy. I want to know if there are any fics where if you changed Harry to Ron it'd be just another Weasley bashing fic.

Slash, dark!harry, crossovers and bashing (duh) are fine. Please no mpreg, harems, pottercest, genderbending or smut/romance-driven plot

Writers like to use 'the Weasleys just want Harry's gold' as a plot point to bash them on, but when Harry first visits Diagon Alley, he goes straight for the golden cauldron and has to be steered towards the pewter cauldron instead by Hagrid.

Then, in Prisoner of Azkaban, he has to keep reminding himself to NOT buy the solid gold gobstones, on account that he'd run out of money. And in between we have Harry chasing a Golden Snitch.

So what if 'Harry is greedy' was used as a bash-point? Not just 'wants more money', but gold-and-jewels hungry like a niffler on steroids. He may have the power of love behind him, but love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.

**** Harry could come at it with the mindset of "There's no way in hell I'm actually going to be able to retrieve it myself, but maybe I can help stop the /competent adult/ from getting it." So long as he legitimately thinks /he/ can't get it, but that someone else could, a greedy!Harry might be willing to go out of his way to deny others treasure ("If I can't have it, nobody can!"). And then, when he actually /gets/ the stone...

** There's substantial amount of Harry bashing in linkffn(You Only Live Thrice : The Tale Of Elsa Jones by pstibbons), although it has plenty of Ron bashing, too. The author used to be a pretty controversial figure, from what I could gather, before his sudden disappearance from the community, but I must admit I rather like this fic.

**** Pstibbons was apparently a vehement Harmony shipper, the kind that makes Robst seem tame.

So just um.. read his FF [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/919491/pstibbons][Profile]] and just... yea... read... it seems to hit every single bat shit harmony crazy thing there is to hit.

***** I honestly doubt that you read his profile. In the first few paragraphs, he says:

"All that said, I don't think Harry is much of a match for Hermione either. Yes, it took me a year or two to figure that out, and my early fics are HHr. There are no instances in canon of him ever choosing her side over Ron's, despite her showing him far more loyalty and friendship. He seems incapable of grasping subtleties, and has no intellectual curiosity - the latter quite possibly due to Dursley abuse. Frankly, he ought to ship with Luna, who seems to amuse him in a way no other character does. There's always Ginny, I suppose, but it's never been clear to me that she would date Harry if he wasn't the BWL. Then again, both Harry and Ginny display potential to grow and become more mature, unlike Ron. Nearly all HHr stories have to give Harry more maturity than he has in canon."

So, you're about as wrong as you can be claiming he's a vehement Harmony shipper.
