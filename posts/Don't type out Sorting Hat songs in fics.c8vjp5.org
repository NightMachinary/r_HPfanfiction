They don't add anything to the plot, were not written by you, and serve as a very transparent attempt to pad the word count. A lot of writers just say something like "X listened to the Hat's song with one ear as they..." or "The old hat opened one of it's folds like a mouth and began singing..." without actually printing out the canon song. Similarly with the Hogwarts school song - it doesn't add anything to the plot or set the mood in anyway.

  Shy and abused, Iris Potter slowly uncovers the truth about the magical world, despite the warnings of her brother and father. What are the Old Rites, why is numerology a dark art, and why does she keep blushing whenever Blaise and her bond-mate look at her? Prepare for magical theory, politics, paganism, creatures, a twin, romance, and above all, self-discovery.

*** This is generally true. To get a good sorting song generally requires more than a few hours and somebody to go over it and tell you if it sucks or not.

As most fic writers don't put that much effort into the whole chapter, let alone the song itself (the excellent writers active on this Reddit and elsewhere notwithstanding) when one shows up in a fic it's almost universally terrible.

** Even though everyone - including me - skips it, I prefer it when fics include it. For me, the goal of fanfiction is to be of equivalent quality to published works - that is, the perfect fanfic is one that could seamlessly take the place of the original books and no one would notice.

This requires that each story does its own groundwork in establishing the characters, world etc. without using readers' knowledge of the original as a crutch to prop up technically deficient writing. So - sorting song in, because to exclude it would be to tell an incomplete story. Unless you are removing the song from the world entirely, of course.

Though just curious, how do you feel about authors saying for Harry's first year, for instance, ‚Äòthe hat began to sing, detailing the strengths and weaknesses of each house in a warbling song' with Harry's thoughts, something we barely got in the book, instead? And for other years something like ‚Äòthey listened to the sorting hat's song (insert details here)' or ‚Äòthe sorting hat's song was unusually macabre (insert details here)' or something like that, alluding to that there was a song but not going as far as to write the whole thing out?

I think you should reread the books. The first or second chapter always includes a recap, something along the lines of "Harry isn't a normal boy, he's actually a wizard, he goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Voldemort killed his parents, his best friends are Ron and Hermione."

*** While it's nice when the quality of a fanfic is equivalent to a published work, and one could say that a fanfic generally should have such quality, that doesn't mean it needs to repeat all the same details from canon. Fanfics are by definition based on some canon text, which is generally assumed to be known to the readers. Therefore, anything that is unchanged and that is not important to the story can stay unmentioned without diminishing the quality of the work. The reader already knows the canon work and generally assumes that everything which isn't mentioned as different is the same as in canon. It is generally not expected that a fanfic can stand on its own without the canon, just like a sequel isn't expected to stand on its own.

*** But even in the books, the sorting hat's songs only appear in three books. You can understand why the song is mentioned in the first book as everything's new to Harry so he is listening excitedly to it. Then in the fifth book it is an appeal to unity between the houses and foreshadowing of DA. But then yeah, the song had no point in book 4.

*** I'm ambivalent either way. If a fic's well written, then I don't mind if they shove the sorting song in there. Quite often if an author includes the first or last line of the song I find that to be better than including or omitting it entirely. I'll always skip the sorting song, but I find it to be a far more criminal offence when authors either copy and paste dialogue/scenes from those first years, or stick exactly to the canon plots despite alterations made to characters which should then have an impact on their actions and the subsequent consequences.

Anyway, I just wanted to comment here because I disagreed with what your other commenter said - after all, we're each entitled to our own opinions, are we not?

Also I love your Dumbledore gives memories to Harry fic, but that's irrelevant to this convo üòÇ

  Even though everyone - including me - skips it, I prefer it when fics include it.

Welp. No need to look any further for the most idiotic comment of the day.

******** Translation: "I am going to ignore your reasons and just repeat my bare denial."

The point is that a person could and would read it, if they had not read canon or any other fanfic. Writing out the sorting song makes the story you are telling complete, such that your story stands on its own two feet as an independent work.

Every fanfic which excludes the sorting song has an implied footnote in that section: "to see the sorting song, please refer to a work other than the one you are reading". That's not good writing.

** I included /parts/ of the fifth-year song in one of my stories because it actually had plot relevance. Other than that, yes, there's no point in including any of the canon songs. No one is actually going to read them.

** The only time I enjoyed a sorting hat song was when it was when the hat sang classic rock lyrics, usually Another Brick In The Wall Part 2 because that's the only classic rock song most kids these days know of, and they probably had to Google the name and lyrics.
