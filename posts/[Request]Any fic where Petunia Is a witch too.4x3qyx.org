** In Core Threads she has a small amount of magical power, but it's minor and not a large part of the central plot.

*** I like Core Thread, and the idea of how Harry helps develop her power is cool. I just expected it to go somewhere else, rather than her learning a little, I expected her to at least get a wand or something.

  November 1, 1981. The day Petunia Dursley, nee Evans, had her world turned upside down. With the death of her sister and brother-in-law, she is left as the guardian of her nephew. Her husband, Vernon, refuses to accept Harry, so Petunia packs up and leaves, taking Harry and her son, Dudley. This is the story of how she got to that point. But mostly, it's the story of two sisters.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
