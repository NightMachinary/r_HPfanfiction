Yes so I was just having a discussion about self inserts in another comment section and I came up with a self insert idea!!! It is very unique and very cool, also I think it would be amazing to write. :) Yes I am going to write this! It will be a self insert, but the SI has criminal tendencies and stuff and so they decide to join the Death Eaters and Voldemort, and they totally throw the timeline to crap because they told Voldemort all their knowledge of the books, the Order, the actions taken by Regulus, the connection between him and Harry by the Horcrux fragment, and everything else ever! Including other important information like Dumbledore's past, Harry's friends, and even stuff about Voldemort's true half blood status and his past at the orphanage! They become the most loyal Death Eater because of their value AND their threat to Voldemort, the second in command! :) And YES this story will follow this SI villain like how Death Note follows Light in his quest to take over the world!!! :) It would be so great to follow a villain instead of a hero for once, and they would be a villanious SI so it would be even more interesting!!! :) Also to see an SI use their knowledge to help the BAD GUYS instead of the good guys!!!


** Ah, I see! Interesting! That's not /quite/ a self-insert then, though more of a "pseudo-self-insert", since the Self-Inster wouldn't be a copy of you.

*** ALSO HI ACHILLE!!! :) Did you know there are a lot of people here with super cute names? Like I saw a Hufflepuff name like marshmallows and book worms that help you read, also a person with a name called just KEVIN but with numbers, and it's super cute because they are like plain tiny letters "kevin" and then numbers. :)

***** Thanks! :) Yes mine is from EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE because it is a very good and funny movie but also with deep lessons and stuff in it, and also a crossdressing acceptance scene! :) Which was very nice! Also Kusko is a hilarious character and I love his voice! But I also love Pacha and Kronk!

********** It's Kuz/c/o.

I kinda agree on the sequel (but then, Kuzco's story /is/ "over": he's learned his lesson and would be less funny now that he is no longer a jerk). The show is called /The Emperor's New School/, and it has the original cast. Kuzco is once more the same character, though as I said, it comes at the price of negating some of his character development (he's once again lazy and entitled, though he'd no longer leave Pacha to die like in the first movie).

/Kingdom of the/ */Sun/* (I made a typo) was the movie that /The Emperor's New Groove/ was once /going/ to be before they decided to turn it into the wacky comedy we know it as; it was once a much more serious fantasy epic (there's a story there that the animators were split on which approach to take, and for a while each half was making their own movie in neighboring rooms until the producers stopped /Kingdom/). I love the /Emperor's New Groove/ we got, but /Kingdom of the Sun/ looked awesome in a very different way. I

n that version, Pacha was younger and Kuzco's lookalike, Kuzco was called Manco, there was no Kronk (sadly), and Yzma was a darker villain (though still played by Eartha Kitt!). That version of the movie drew more heavily from Incan mythology and had a central "Sun deity" motif that they eventually recycled for /Tangled/. In that version, Yzma was aligned with the evil God of Darkness (she'd made a deal with him for her magic powers; /that/ part was reused for Dr Facilier in /The Princess and the Frog/) because she wanted to stay young forever and thought that sunlight was what was making her age. Her plan in this version is thus to become Empress so she'd be in a position to unleash Supai and blot out the Sun forever. It's a pretty weird plan, but also very original, and in that version Yzma had [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAt9ovvKgCU][a song]] that was all about it!

*** Oh. Well /I/ I couldn't make it as a self insert! So I will have to make up someone else more competent and not mentally disabled, and also evil unlike me. :P It is unfortunate but I have to! I would be slaughtered instantly and I would never join the bad guys.

** Are you sure that you want to write a story in which a self-insert joins the magical Waffen SS? Because the Death Eaters are not your average mafia style crimelords but genocidal terrorists trying to do their own little holocaust while happily ruling the rest of the world.

Not that I am against the bad side per se, but it would be far more interesting to see the SI create his own crime syndicate instead of joining the people set out to exterminate certain people based on circumstances beyond their control without any personal gain (unlike the mafia, who is after the bottom line).

*** Oh. :( Well maybe I could do both? :) Have the SI join the Death Eaters and give Voldemort information and stuff, but then break away and form their own mafia family and criminal enterprise because they realized that wasn't what they wanted to really be involved with? Like maybe it is like Teen Titans where even Slade said that the world being destroyed was something he wouldn't have wanted, and HE was a criminal mastermind. He teamed up with the heroes to beat the demon king. So yes maybe the SI could have THEIR limit at genocide and world domination?

**** But if he knows the books he knows about the Death Eaters. They turned Azkaban into a Muggleborn Concentration Camp after all. They use child soldiers. That's not shady for profit, that's from Hitler's playbook.

****** I think it might be a more interesting story if your character didn't know all the details. Like maybe they aren't really interested in Harry Potter and didn't read (all) the books themselves, but they picked some things up just because of how popular they are. Maybe saw a movie or two, know a few random details, but can't tell Voldemort everything. Otherwise, it would be a very easy win for Voldemort. Also, if you want to write a "kind-of-self-insert joins the Death Eaters", just do it. Maybe he/she is an evil person, maybe a power-hungry psychopath, maybe just a person with criminal tendencies who dosn't have enough knowledge of the books to judge the situation accurately (and regrets their decision later, when they find out what Voldemort actually does...) It wouldn't really be a self-insert, I guess, but it could be fun to write.

****** You could always have Gregory Goyle go back in time and use his limited knowledge of what went on in the war to help Voldemort , in exchange for keeping Vincent Crabbe safe. We know Goyle isn't the smartest, but he is a malicious bully who isn't afraid to torture or kill, which makes him far better for going back to change the outcome of the war to his side's favor. With how smart Tom Riddle is supposed to be, even faulty remembered histories from the future would have enough information for him to avoid the same pitfalls he would have had otherwise.
