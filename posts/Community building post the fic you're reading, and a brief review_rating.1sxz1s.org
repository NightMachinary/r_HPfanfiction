[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5934267/1/Finding-Why-s][Finding Why's]] by B. A. Ware, 95 chapters/350k+ words, Complete

/I am on.../ Chapter 24

/Author's summary.../ Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

/My summary/ Thoughtful, clever Harry raises himself and heads off to Hogwarts with the lessons he's learned. A bit of a loner, he is nevertheless friendly and helpful. Surprisingly humorous, this fic focuses on wandless magic, with a strong theme of superiority (dealing with issues such as: humans are not the superior animal, wizards are not the superior human)

/Rating/ 9/10 so far! If it continues to surprise me in good ways, this may very well end up being one of my all-time favorite fics.

** Just finished reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/][Altered Destinies]] By: DobbyElfLord Author's summary: Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald.

My summary: 7.5 out of 10. Story is pretty good. Could use cleanup on the typos though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2866740/][Grey Maiden series]]

Still on book 2 out of 5. Like the style but struggling since I normally don't like to read about pre-teen years (like some romance/sex in my books) and not a big fan of Harry/Ginny pairings.

That said, this is the first story with that pairing that I've found that's in my opinion "well written" (spelling/grammar/mature perspective) so this may be the one that gets me to see that pairing as viable.

*My Thoughts* Well thought out story on how Sirius could have taken charge and started Harry on his own path before getting his wand snapped. If you like A Mauraders Plan check out this one.

*My Thoughts* An interesting AU where Harry's Giant heritage isn't really the main focus so far. Its more about his crafting (Has an apprenticeship with Ollivander) ability and his huge heart. Hufflepuff!Harry

** Im currently jumping around, reading new chapters of the uncomplete ones (listed first) and re-reading some of my absolute favourites (listed after the break). I have read all available Chapters of the stories listed here at least once... Be warned, it's winter so everything I'm reading right now is Humor or Crack :D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/][Faery Heroes]] by Silently Watches

#+begin_quote
  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
#+end_quote

Very funny, a little bit of super and a hint of crack but thoroughly enjoyable

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/][Madness at the Gate]] by ZenoNoKyuubi

#+begin_quote
  The sequel to ItMoaS [In the Mind of a Scientist]. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race. Harry/Tonks/possibly more
#+end_quote

Well its mostly crack and a bit of super in a bit of a Stargate-Crossover. The previous story can stand on its own and is not a crossover but just as hilarious (and required reading before this one)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9775036/1/][Takin the P.I.S.S]] by robst

#+begin_quote
  This is a reworking of one of my very earliest stories, Knowledge is Power. My intention is to smooth down some of the really rough edges and then add a few more original chapters at the end. A time travel fic that begins near the end of POA but is AU by the end of the first chapter.
#+end_quote

Well, it's a rewrite and the original was great so whats there not to like...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/][The Power of Paranoia]] by arekay

#+begin_quote
  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
#+end_quote

It's pretty much a "Harry lives on his own and has no problem doing it" with a new premise... Updates seldomly but I really like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/][The Adventures of Harry Potter: The Video Game Series exploited]] by michaelsuave

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.
#+end_quote

A very humorous take on Harry gaming the (video game) system to make the best of his chances. Also some very general gaming humor.

Complete stories I'm re-reading:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/][Make a Wish]] by Rorschach's Blot

#+begin_quote
  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
#+end_quote

The ultimate "Harry gets a break" by one of the best Humor Authors you can find!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] by Nonjon

#+begin_quote
  Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
#+end_quote

Another classic. If you don't care that Harry gets a tiny bit super in the beginning this is one of the best Humor stories around the net.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/][The Horror! The Horror!]] by DisobedienceWriter

#+begin_quote
  Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.
#+end_quote

A ridiculously lucky Harry sets out to make his luck in the Jungle and hilarity ensues.

** Just quit reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2701458/][Petal in the Rain]] - Entrapped in a snobbish boarding school, Lily Evans mischievously escapes for one night, fatefully encountering London's most eligible bachelor, Lord James Potter. Set in 1940 during the Battle of Britain. A story of love, war, magic and deception.

4/10 - I found this fic rec'd on tumblr as one of the top 5 Jily fics. I made it through the end of chapter 9. I think it's pretty awful thus far. Lily is the epitome of a Mary Sue - literally, her only "flaw" thus far is that she sasses the abusive nuns at her boarding school (who irrationally hate her because she is poor), but really that just shows how brave and strong she is. James' portrayal isn't much better. James (rich, privileged) and Lily (poor, helpless) fall in love at first sight - no relationship development at all, they're just all of a sudden head over heels! It's so ridiculous that at points I was literally laughing out loud at the absurdity of the dialogue/writing. In terms of the plot, things happen, but I'm really not sure what the point of most of them is - it's the same basic story arcs (Lily sasses the nuns; Lily <3 James; James fights with his mother, who doesn't like Lily), the setting just changes. No depth. No character development.

It's possible that it gets better as the story goes on. A lot of people in the Jily fandom seem to love this fic and I just don't understand why. Maybe it's more suited to people who like action / romance fics and care less for drama / angst.

/I am on.../ Chapter 74

/Author's summary.../ The Dementor attack on Harry during the summer after his fourth year leaves him on the verge of having his wand snapped. Unwilling to leave anything to chance, Sirius Black sets events into motion which will change Harry's life forever.

/My summary/ rare non-smutty Harry/Fleur pairing, with a surprise. Starts with Harry's trial at the Ministry and goes AU from there.

/Rating/ I like it, dunno how to put that into numbers as I am a newcomer to fanfiction and I don't know how it compares to other works. I definitely recommend it though.
