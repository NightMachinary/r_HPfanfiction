Drastically different intent and purpose. The government is, in most cases, there to serve the people, and serving the people often comes in the form of enforcing laws meant to preserve lives, such as making first degree murder a felony. Because, you know, killing someone for selfish reasons is generally considered bad form. The Imperius is mental slavery. It is about power, control, and dominance. Nothing more.

They are both methods of controlling others, just because one is significantly better doesn't mean it's any worse per say, merely that it is effective. Sort of like how a hand grenade is significantly more effective than a tennis ball at killing things. The base problem is that your trying to control things (government, Imperio) or trying to kill things(tennis ball, grenade).

1. The government was not created, nor is it used, specifically for the purpose of controlling people. It was originally meant to serve the populace.

2. A tennis ball is not meant to kill, just like the government is not meant to control. Likewise, the Imperius was created with the intent to subjugate a person's mind, as a grenade was designed to kill more effectively.

3. We are not talking about the a person's potential for good or ill while using the Imperius. My argument is that the Imperius is not merely the government in a nutshell.

To wit, I'm /not/ trying to say that two small and round things are the same, that is what /you/ are saying. I'm saying that these are two /very different/ things that both happen to be small and round.

Now if you don't mind, I'm going to stop arguing this. We seem to have different opinions on what government is. That, and I doubt anyone else is reading this anymore, and if that's the case there's no use arguing.

** Tough one. As far as I'm concerned, the following offer the most interesting possibilities:

SPELLS

- Imperius. Undetectable, can be maintained for huge durations, very few have any chance to resist (though orders going strongly against the individual's principles can be resisted, so asking a dictator to suicide himself... not dice). Grants an immense control flexibility on others in a flagrant to invisible way.

- Apparition. Movement is key, the possibility to come to any place you have got the knowledge of (within an unknown distance) is a major convenience and strategic factor. Think "jumper", basically. Get a good look inside a place, wall it of in 30 meters of concrete... can still apparate there (probably need air though).

- Avada Kedavra. Death without visible cause? That is a get out of murder free card. And a good way to play the Death Note god. It is though very specialised. If your deal is more constructive, that's too bad. Still, nice contender.

- Obliviate. Obviously, the possibility of erasing memories with impunity is tempting. The movie version also seems to erase physical evidence (see the Hermione scene), in which case it definitly can be of use. Otherwise much more restricted, as the guard might not remember you, but cameras could (or your dna etc).

- Fidelius charm. One of the most OP possibilities. Not much used in HP because it is so hard to cast... but here you can cast it at will. Make yourself some true safe-house, or even take key location hostage. Protect wonders of the world from interference... give yourself a temporary breathing space. Make the perfect jail. If the secret keeper needs to be somebody other than the caster, the use decreases, but does not disappear.

ARTEFACTS

- The philosopher's stone. Transmuting to gold is fun enough, though bringing a pure gold pigeon in a pawn shop (any huge amount of non barre/jewlery gold) might put you on some lists. Abusing it would also disrupt the economy, but it's big scale. The eternal life aspect (including possibly curing afflictions, which is why Voldemort is ready to sacrifice much to get it into his possession) makes it nearly obligatory, especially when you can choose to end the effect at will (stop taking/producing the elixir).

- The invisibility cloak. With the major drawback (you need to keep it at hand) gone (it is now a power), true invisibility is very, very tempting. Noise still seem to be a give-away, as well as prints and physical contact though, but it still would allow for a great everyday advantage.

- Horcrux. You could be your own soul container. You know, without Gryffindor's sword, fiendfire or basilik venom, there's not much left that would be able to harm you. And as long as the horcrux (you) isn't destroyed, you don't die (in effect, you are immortal). As you also contain you whole soul without murder, well, no split sould madness (if such exists) or ethical connendrums.

POTIONS

- Felixis Felicis. If anything, would make the world a whole lot more interesting. In a positive way. Though acting half drunk half high all the time might get annoying. On the other hand, infinite good luck (of the positive kind, that is, good luck from the standards of the drinker. No "oh no, I got what I wanted but it's not how I wanted" that I can think of in the HP world).

There's probably more, but these are some of the most over-powered.

Depending on tastes and requirements of ethics/legality, a lot of combinations are possible. I'd go with the following build:

- Horcux
- Felix Felicis
- Imperius

So both something with high control (on death and other people) and a lot of positive chaos for me. No apparition i a bummer, but less so when you got all the time in the world. Invisibility would be nice, but imperius takes care of most of the dirty business and felix allows for a lot of mistakes to go unnoticed.

The best, this build allows to just go around and enjoy life (see what the felix cooks up every morning, promoting peace when feeling like it and exitement when needed) or make major chances in the world. For a day or a millenium.

TL;DR: Horcux Felix Felicis Imperius

**** Fair point about bringing others for the ride. My choice guarantees a solo run.

The horcrux aspect would allow to have the same kinds of resistances as Nagini (only example of living horcrux), which seemed to mean that only horcrux destroying methods (including Gryffindor's sword of course) could destroy it.

Having the soul be whole in the one container means no wraith. In case of destruction, that's a direct promotion to dead.

I guess the main unknown is if anchoring my own soul in my body as a horcrux would guarantee immortality, but I don't expect a canon answer to that one.

** Depends on what limitations the skills would have in “real life”, but probably:

1. Imperio --- lets create a hegemon, read minds and memories, control, kill instantly or with preset conditions, shock and awe, eliminate corruption, etc;

2. Philosopher's Stone* --- ensures that the hegemon doesn't die (if careful enough) and “his” achievements don't crumble through time. Would require further research (both with genie and scientists) before choosing;

3. {Something that's best suited for creating large amounts of energy or mass} --- would require further research before using the 3rd wish on this.

Metamorph has got better all round potentiel, but if you are going for stealth, the invisibility cloak (used permanently) is the way to go. No need to change appearance if nobody ever saw you. And no need to see you to get imperiused.

**** I belive I misused the term stealth, I intended more like changing identities and being able to impersonate people. I was really tempted by the cloack but, at the end, it only gets you invisible (and not soundproof), while metamorph has a larger quantity of uses

** Well, because I'm not a super-villain I'm going to say:

- Geminio or Engorgio : The one I choose depends on the old 'you can increase food if you already have some' line. People starving, you say? How about a loaf of bread the size of a house.
- Unbreakable Charm : Space elevator here we come! (Space elevator + Geminio = UNLIMITED POWER)
- Bat Bogey Hex : After solving world hunger and the energy crisis I figure I'm allowed some down time. Alternatively; Apparition for escaping the religious fundies that are likely to take exception to my witchcraft.

** Variant A:

- /Evanesco/, instant garbage removal and if I'd need to murder someone I'd just vannish them or parts of them. No need for evidence removal
- /Portus/, because I'm lazy and will get extraordinarily fat.
- /Wingardium Leviosa/, for science purposes and getting stuff. Since it can actually move them along the x,y,z axis with more precision than the summoning charm.

It was a close matchup between Leviosa and Reparo. But I figured I'd earn a shit-ton of money vanishing nuclear waste so it'd be WASTEful to get a repairing charm when I could just get new things.

*EDIT* Formating and spelling

For money I'd obviously setup portkey terminals instead of airports and become a billionaire pretty much instantly and they'd run themselves... Just make a couple, hire security and attempt to spend the Scrooge McDuck amounts of money that will be rolling in.

** I'm surprised that not that many picked Metamorphmagus, it would just be pure fun.

In the end I would Impero to make others make the world a better place, Metamorphmagus just for the lols and in case someone sees 'me' Impero an important person. And the last would be either Horcruxes depending on it's limitations, else the Stone. And I guess depending on the limitations of Impero I might pick Obliviate as well instead of Metamorphmagus.

*** People choosing making Stones are asking for a random car crash to take them out. Immortality>serial longevity.

The rules make horcruxes work "unlimited" so even the fanon theories don't limit you. No murders needed either, if people can get away with potions as spells without having to find eye of newt for every use.

** Apparition is a no brainer. Instant transportation, yes please.

The rest is a bit harder to decide. Accio is great for being lazy. Felix Felicis would mean the rest of my life is lucky, assuming the associated power doesn't carry the same overdose risk. The Imperius curse is unethical but hideously flexible. Metamorph abilities have all sorts of uses, some of them even safe for work. Obliviate is a reset button on any person to person interaction ever. The Philosopher's Stone is immortality and money.

Right now I'd say metamorph abilities and the stone on top of apparition. But Felix is super tempting.

** Piertotum Locomotor! Oh, I've always wanted to use that spell.

As for the other two: If I'm thinking pragmatic, probably Accio + Apparation would be the most useful to me personally. Some camouflage spell / peruvian instant darkness powder / invisibility cloak in combination with Alohomora would be a more thrilling choice and I guess, which would actually change my life(style) instead of just improve it.

** Variant A:

/Protego/ is probably the single best spell /iff/* it blocks physical attacks.

/Obliviate/ is also really good for obvious reasons.

I'm not sure what it would be called, but some sort of spell that creates continuous motion, ideally something you'd apply once and then it would last a long time. It'd basically be a get out of jail free card for renewable energy transition.

** Limiting myself to not being immortal or using Unforgivables (and memory charms because they should be Unforgivables), in addition to stupid deus exes like Felix, I would say that I would want

1. Apparition- Faster and more reliable than a portkey
2. A regeneration spell that worked on organs (Snape's Healing spell for example) to extend my life without making it eternal
3. Legillimency- because getting ahead means knowing what people want and what they dont want you to know.

Alternatively, I could also want these:

1. Invisibility Cloak
2. Alohamora
3. Enchanted Trunk ala Moody

I would be the world's greatest thief.
