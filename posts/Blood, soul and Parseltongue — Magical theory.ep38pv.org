Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.

It is safe to assume that Voldemort's ability to speak Parseltongue comes from his mother, direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Before, his resurrection, Voldemort was a wraith with no body, no blood, no magic and possibly not even a voice. All he had left was the ability to possess people. While inhabiting an homunculus (a made-up body) gave him back his speech and the use of magic (he killed Frank Bryce while in that form). Thus we can assume that the ability to use magic lies in the blood or at least the body. But I'm not sure if the homunculus had blood as it was technically a magical construct. Parseltongue is a magical trait which carries through blood, and Voldemort's doesn't have any. So how could he retain the gift of Parseltongue? Tom Riddle Sr, Wormtail, Harry Potter--- none of which are descendants of Salazar. Only using a part of Merope could have ensured the restoration of his magical ancestry.

I know that Harry could speak Parseltongue because of the horcrux in his head, so then we can theorize that magical traits are embedded in the soul. But then, what of blood ? Why would the gift would only passed down in Salazar Slytherin's bloodline?

Are blood and soul connected? Flimsy if you ask me.

Then onto the soul, having split his soul seven times, it stands to reason that each shard wouldn't retain properties of the whole. If you can function normally with a small portion of your soul then horcruxes would be made left and right. Yeah, yeah it requires murder but I don't think it's all that intimidating to someone pursuing immortality.

Could Voldemort's be drawing his Parseltongue from the soul shards even if they aren't part of him anymore? We know of the link about Harry and Voldemort so maybe he retrieved Parseltongue from Harry. Not from his blood but from the piece of soul in his scar.

I still wonder how he was able to retain it. Harry's blood was probably how he retrieved the use of magic. His father's bones gave him structural stability and Wormtail's flesh filled the carcass. We can probably thank Nagini's milk and venom for his serpentine features.

But Parseltongue has me stumped. While I think that him retrieving the ability thanks to his link with Harry is a theory that has merit, it doesn't satisfy me much.

Maybe the inherent nature of the soul requires it to be whole and that's why each shard reached out to the other. This would then enable Voldemort to use the six connections (subconsciously) to access the magical gifts and traits they possessed, giving the impression that he had never lost them.

What do you think?

Note : I just realized I almost wrote my first thesis of magical theory. Couldn't be more proud. Hope to get my Mastery of Magical theory soon and be able to fill the shelves of Flourish and Blotts with my work!

*** Yes, sure. The problem is that first it is an ability carried through the line of Salazar Slytherin by blood, so where does the soul comes into play in all of that? Then if it's in the soul, then how can Voldemort still access it? A soul is one. Voldemort splits it seven times. It is impossible that each shard of soul have the same property as if it was a whole soul.

A vase holds flower. You break the vase. The pieces of vase cannot hold flowers anymore. You glue them together and you can hold flowers again (probably less efficiently than before).

Harry Potter's story is one. You break it into seven books. Each book is a piece of Harry Potter's story. But you can't access Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. You have to have the seven books to have access to the entire story.

Now, Voldemort only has one piece of his soul, the others are scattered to the four winds, so how can he still access all of his magic and gifts? Is it possible that even if he broke his soul in seven parts, he is still able to access them from afar, thus giving him a whole soul as long as the pieces are not destroyed?

**** This is gonna sound weird considering I'm reaching into another fandom, but lemme just quote Buffy the Vampire Slayer right quick:

#+begin_quote
  Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think we eat it? It's what keeps you going, makes you warm, makes you hard, makes you other than dead.
#+end_quote

BtVS also plays with souls a lot (characters losing their souls, etc). Blood keeps you alive, but the soul is what makes you YOU.

Again, I know it's a different fandom, but I think it's still relevant. I think blood and souls are more closely connected than you're implying. Blood helps build the person, but the soul is who a person actually is. Basically, I think the blood gives the abilities to the soul, and then the ability is forever tied to that soul.

*** Sorry I'm a little fuzzy on the details. What with the films and the fanfictions I read. Absolutely correct. Inhabiting a homunculus he regained the ability to use magic. But then the ability to use magic requires a body of some sort. The problem is that the homunculus is a made-up body so probably no blood in it (or maybe someone else's). So we're still not clear about what carries magic and magical traits/gifts.

*** We can assume that the ability to possess people and animals is a natural power for a wraith. After all, a piece of soul or a spirit is not supposed to be separated from the body so it is likely that it would try to find a host. We can refer the piece of Voldemort's soul latching onto Harry, nothing to do with Voldemort or his power, just a natural property of the soul.

What did Voldemort retained? If not the natural ability for a wraith to possess. He possessed Quirrell but he had to give him instructions, he didn't use Quirrell's body to use magic. Maybe except Legilimency when he was able to determine that Harry was lying about the stone in his pocket. But then Voldemort probably took refuge in Quirrell's head thus allowing the use of mind magic. When he left Quirrel and fled, he wasn't able to harm Harry at all, or possess him because of his mother's protection.

Most people don't know about horcruxes, yes. But if the information was available, I'm sure half the Slytherin would make one, probably a handful of Ravenclaw, and one daring and boastful Gryffindor (probably McLaggen). Hufflepuff students just wouldn't.

Because he was weak. "I lost my powers" he said, but I already said he couldn't wave a wand. Regardless, possession is a magical ability only those with magic can do. Just like muggles can't become ghosts. He also kills Frank Bryce, tortures Bertha Jorkins, and, I think, he imperiouses Crouch sr before returning to his body.

It was available in the Hogwarts library until Dumbledore became headmaster. Dumbledore himself was a daring and arrogant Gryffindor. Regulus Black, who was probably a lot like Malfoy and McLaggen, knew of it and was disgusted. Hell, Salazar and Grindelwald, who was experimenting on his peers, didn't do it.

It's pretty difficult to murder someone, especially an innocent. School aged children who aren't psychopaths aren't likely to do that.

And therefore you could create a Horcrux by cold blooded murdering a locked up serial killer or a pedophile, for example. I didn't think it was so specific to require an "innocent person."

***** Yes we can assume! No it is said that Voldemort was planning to make a seventh horcrux with Harry's murder, so the piece of soul was ready to be transferred. But when the spell rebounded and destroyed Voldemort's body, his soul departed as a wraith while the little piece he had planned to split latched onto Harry. This is like a magnet effet for the soul. The soul can't just wander, it has to be tethered. That's why, to me, possession is not something unique to Voldemort, proving that he kept his magic. To me it's an ability born of natural necessity for a wraith or a soul to be bound to something. If it's not bound to something then in a finite amount of time it simply ceases to exist and joins the Great Beyond. That's why possession is possible and even vital for a wraith.

I'm not saying it's not a magical ability I'm saying it's not something you are born with, it's something that can only exist out of necessity. It's a magical ability of a wraith not of Voldemort! Muggles can't create horcrux so they don't have the option to become a wraith (which is different to a ghost). So there is nothing that ties them to life. Their soul just fades away. While Voldemort couldn't die, so his soul was forced to exist without a body, which is not natural! But nature finds a way and souls that can't cross over have to have the ability to latch onto a living thing.

The only person Voldemort ever possessed was Harry and it was only because he could use his horcrux to tie himself to Harry's consciousness. It's not an ability of his. When he has a body, he stays in his body.

Moreover onto the horcruxes. Dumbledore didn't do it because of the Hallows. He didn't need one if he could unite them. The same goes with Grindelwald. Then Dumbledore reformed, leaving his ambitions and quest of power behind, feeling content of living a normal lifespan (as proved in Book 6 when he doesn't fight death). Grindelwald relied on uniting the Hallows, and being the owner of the Elder Wand didn't fear dying in the least so never really looked at the other options. Now onto Regulus Black, he was never described as arrogant but we know he had doubts long before finding the horcrux in the cave, if not he wouldn't have investigated the cave in the first place. Maybe he found the process revolting but I think it was more about seeing the effects it had on Voldemort and how he was a megalomaniac that should be put down (thus destroying the horcruxes was important). Now I'm convinced that if the process of making horcruxes was made public, then a lot of people would attempt it. Just look at us muggles that kill each other for essentially nothing and tell me that wizard wouldn't do the same for promise of immortality. The book in Hogwarts library probably didn't explain the process and just explained that « A horcrux is an object used to bound one's soul into the plane of the living thus making the owner invulnerable to the effects of death ». That's probably why he had to ask Slughorn about clarifications. It's Slughorn who tells him how to split his soul, by committing murder. He doesn't tell him the incantation but Tom is smart so he finds it on his own. The Slytherins (most of those portrayed in the books) have no qualms killing if it serves their interests, and if surmounting death isn't the definition of ambition, I don't know what is. The Ravenclaws (very few) would do it, seeing it as another academic experiment. Does it really allow you to evade death? Does it affect one's magic? Can you feel it? Does it prevent you from aging or dying of old age? I'm sure some Ravenclaws have no qualms about what they study as long as it's magic, and present a challenge. And as I mentioned the arrogant Gryffindor who want to duel everyone and make themselves a place at the top via fighting --- who wouldn't stand being defeated and would take steps to ensure they wouldn't.

We can only assume that after creating horcrux, Voldemort hoarded the knowledge not wanting to share the gift of immortality, and not wanting his enemy to stumble upon it. He wanted people to believe that he was naturally so powerful that he had mastered immortality. (He refuses to tell Malefoy in the graveyard how he was able to survive, just that he should have known better than to doubt his master). Pettigrew would have made one out of cowardice and fear. Lucius because of his survival instinct.

****** Just a little quibble... I think that Slughorn didn't provide him with the information on how to create a horocrux... Riddle had already created one at that point with Moaning Myrtle and the diary... or possibly the ring and his father and grandparents... what he wanted to know was if it was possible to create more than one horocrux... that was the horror that Slughorn was trying to hide when he obscured his memory.

******* Oh yeah. The timeline about Voldemort's horcruxes is unfortunately not clear but I think you're right. I re-read the chapter about the conversation between Slughorn and Tom before answering you. And in it, Tom asked how to make a horcrux, about what spell to use so I just assumed he went to Slughorn to learn about the process. But Tom was cunning and maybe concealed what he wanted to know (the number of horcruxes he wanted to make) presenting it as a theory question when he graciously accepted not being given the spell. So I think you might be right. But I still doubt that a Hogwarts book would contain the incantation. Personally I reckon that Tom reverse-engineered the spell, but I could accept being wrong

You have to commit the murder to split the soul. Needing to "ready" the soul doesn't fit when TMR used Myrtle's 'wrong place, wrong time' death to make the diary. That piece broke off because his soul was unstable. If Harry's death was to have been used for the 2nd or 3rd horcrux, it would not have broken off.

Voldemort almost possessed Harry in the DoM when he had a body.

I'm not reading that wall of text, but I got the gist. My point is that just because people know about a piece of magic, doesn't mean they're going to do it. You can be as curious and arrogant as you want to be. The average human is not murdering someone to achieve immortality and I don't know why you think the average person could do it anyway.

** There are some theories that Harry would lose his ability to speak parseltongue once the bit of Voldemort is removed from him... but I think that Harry in the Cursed Child could speak it still, right? (I haven't finished reading it, but I think I've heard that).

Tom Riddle in the diary could speak parseltongue... he was a memory (and a soul fragment). Maybe it is through memory? So maybe Harry retains his hold on parseltongue through memory? How is memory connected to soul?

When a Dementor sucks the soul out of a person, they seem to lose their identity... their memory of who they are... maybe there is a connection there?

Maybe once a trait is carried into a person's soul through their physical body (blood, bone, flesh), it becomes embedded in their soul?

*** Memory is likely. Maybe the gift of Parseltongue is just a package of information (basically a dictionary and how to pronounce the words). It makes a lot of sense actually. Because even if the horcruxes were made at different points in different points in his life, he had the ability to speak Parseltongue from birth. And each horcrux has the memory of everything that happened up until the point they were made. So power and traits are carried through blood, but then become who the person is and are embedded in the soul. But Parseltongue as it is essentially a language would be just a package of informations carried through blood and then committed to memory. The blood would just be a medium, able to carry magic. Then the homunculus must have had blood, but not Voldemort's (whose?). And the blood of Harry literally gave Voldemort's new body the power to channel magic. But then where does magic come from, if not from the blood. If it from the soul then then Voldemort should be diminished from having split his. Questions questions... But the memory idea is a very good one! Even if it kind of defeats every Parselmagic fanfiction (:

I imagine that the portion of soul lodged in his head contains more DNA than would be transferred through sperm, even if it contains the building blocks of his person.

Maybe it is similar to how genetic traits are passed from one generation to the next...

I'm also curious about this because in the fiction that I'm writing, Harry absorbs some qualities from the magical creatures that he imbibes... phoenix tears and basilisk venom. He also uses his parseltongue abilities a lot.

************* Oh it was already in my reading list but I have been postponing it until after my exams. I'll read many the first couple of chapters tonight before going to sleep just to get a taste. Well, the blood protection is magic, powerful because of Lily's sacrifice, but ultimately magic and magic runs out. So it stands to reason that deflecting the killing curse would weaken the amount of magic greatly. To me, after deflecting it, it only had enough strength to tie itself to Harry's core to be able to survive and power itself for when needed. Thus it could not have been able to focus on the horcrux and when it had regained power, it could not detect it as it had been there for a long time. Let's keep in mind that the blood protection also powers the blood wards around Privet Drive. So when Harry is at the Dursleys it would be weak within Harry as it would focus its energy on the wards. The Muggle environment would be then detrimental to Harry but it's practically canon that Harry should not live in the muggle world.

************** That's great that it was already on your reading list :). Sorry for potentially distracting you from your exams.

I like your theories about Lily's blood protection and how the horocrux snuck past it.

It's interesting to think that Lily's magic was tied up in the wards, and so less able to protect Harry from the threats from his family. His own magic provided some protection from them.

** Just a minor thing. His snakelike appearance was not a result of Nagini's venom being used in the homunculus creation. It is explicitly the result of his shredding his soul so much. He already looked like that by the time he went to kill the Potters, as we see in the flashback in Deathly Hallows.

Not a major thing, but when fanfics act like he looked even remotely human before he was defeated by Lily's sacrifice, it makes me twitch.

** Well, here's what we know:

1. being a parselmouth is a talent that resides to the soul (or mind)

2. It is passed down through familial connections.

Blood has no real relation, because it's used more as a phrase than any sort of accurate statement. Blood-relatives, yes, but not literal blood, otherwise blood-brothers or people who have a transfusion from a parselmouth would suddenly be able to talk to snakes.

All this leads me to theorize something which may seem disconnected at first - having a child is somewhat like making a Horcrux. Perhaps the exact opposite in spirit, but very similar nonetheless. We know people have souls, and the souls have to come from somewhere - based on the fact that the Parseltongue is a soul-based talent, it stands to reason that a child's soul is in fact built from the souls of its parents, which explains why magic passes on through families, how Harry's patronus could be his father's animagus form despite not knowing anything about that and how there are rare magical talents like metamorphmagism and parseltongue, among possible others.

** I believe magic comes from your soul. Your body is a different kind of wand, a channeler of your magic. Your wand is a focus.

I think the Parseltongue is a chicken/egg thing.

If you learn it or earn it yourself, it marks your soul. Reincarnate, reborn, etc? The mark on your soul causes your magic to form your body into being good for parseltongue.

If you hail from a bloodline with the Parseltongue ability, and your body is born with the ability: Your body is a wand, so your magic channels that specific way which marks your soul.

​

Metamorphmagus is similar too.

** The Best answer is that there is a permanent connection between the Blood and the Soul, the Blood create an unique magical identity that has consequence on the Soul, when the body is destroyed the soul retain that magical identity which recreate the Blood when the Body is recreated by ritual. For the Horcruxes, I believe that there is an reflexive identity between the part and the whole that make each fragment of soul the same from a magical signature point of view.
