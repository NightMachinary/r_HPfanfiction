:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry adopts Snape's daughter (or possibly goddaughter) from a really abusive ministry orphanage. Snape has been looking for her but by the time he gets there, Harry has already adopted her


** Okay, this one reminds me of a story. In this story, the girl is actually Draco's daughter, but Snape and Harry are both looking for her and Harry happens to find her first. Harry adopts her on the spot to keep the Ministry from denying him custody, which upsets Snape because he wanted her and also thinks Harry won't let him see her. Snape and Harry end up co-parenting.

The story was called "What a Malfoy Wants" by Corgi (note that there's a Dramoine out there by the same name), with a sequel called "A Malfoy Gets."

If this is the story you're looking for, then I'm sorry to tell you that I don't know of anyplace it's still online. It was on [[https://kardasi.com][kardasi.com]], [[https://thesilversnitch.net][thesilversnitch.net]], and [[https://hpfandom.net][hpfandom.net]], all of which are defunct. There is an account on AO3 named Corgi, but there are no HP stories under that name.

Soooooo, if this is the story you're looking for, PM me your email address and I can shoot you a copy of the Word file I have.

*** Hey, good news! I just found it on AO3 under a slightly different username (DarkCorgi instead of Corgi), and dug through my old comments so I could share the link. linkao3(10050953)
