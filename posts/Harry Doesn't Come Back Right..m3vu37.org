Harry Potter dies, it's only natural and we see it in the book. Then he comes back to life. But what if he, like Voldemort, doesn't come back right? Not necessarily evil, just different.

His Body is still dead and he finds he has stopped aging and no longer gets tired or sleeps. Pain? What is pain to a dead man? And since when can he touch ghosts? Since when can he HURT them?

Bonus points for this prompt: It can start before, during, or after the series proper with different effects. Does Harry die before first year and come back? Will a child Harry be walking around? Or during the Triwizard Tourny, a perpetual Teenager? Or will he simply stop aging at 17 after the final Battle?

Not to mention what other connections to death and necromancy he might have now... Or weaknesses!

  Hourglass 2 - Dora Kirk aka time-tossed Nymphadora Tonks thought that things would be easier with Voldemort exposed and Umbridge gone. But now there is a new enemy on the board vying for Voldemort's role, her boyfriend is getting friendly with another girl, and to top things off...Time itself seems to be breaking down more and more often. Who knew being a teen again was this hard?

  Cordelia is the Master of Death and has been for quite some time. The only problem is that she doesn't particularly enjoy being an Eldritch Abomination. What's a girl to do when you have no interest in the role forced upon you? Run like hell perhaps. And hope to Merlin and God and all else that's holy that maybe, just maybe, one day you might get lucky...and find a way out.

** The deathly hallows when combined open a gateway past death, to the great eons beyond the edge of existence. Something beyond death, beyond time comes through, hence the title master of death- and settles into Harry's body. By infinitely incalculable coincidence, because of prophecy, who killed him, what killed him, and how he died, voldemort is the one that has his soul consumed and because of death being timless, the elder being merges with Harry the first time he died, at Godrics hollow. In a convoluted time paradox this is what causes voldemorts killing curse to rebound, and is the power he knows not, rewriting history to have been so since the beginning, even though it had not happened yet.

Harry grows up as the mortal soul and mind inhabiting the shell of a manifest elder god. He is immortal, can perceive up to eleven dimensions, drive people insane with a whisper, shred thier mind like tissue, and unfold himself into a non euclidian form made of tentacles, teeth, eyes, and things best left unsaid. The funny thing is he doesn't know it, neither does anyone else. So he grows up slowly realizing something is apocalyptically wrong with him, a freak on a super paranormal level as he figures out these abilities, accidentally picks up or starts a cult, learns even dark creatures fear or are in awe of him and winds up in situations where they help him, follow his orders, and treat him like a lord but can't exactly explain why, assassination attempts by various religious groups, and convenient yet convoluted accidents that are usually terrifying and mind scaring happening to people that inevitably get in his way. The church hates him, dementors want to be him, he's a myth in occult circles, a legend in others.

I leave a writer to decide what elder god he now has the body of, Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Hastur, etc... Going for a supernatural horror but dark comedy vibe.

** When I read the title, idk i just thought more like his morals got skewed because if he can come back anyone could! right? I just imagining like, a Soulless!Sam Winchester type of thing.

Also, the example you're thinking of his great, and i think there's so many possibilities with it! Like, would rigor mortis still settle in? or would his heart continue to just, not pump?

But a prompt i really like is that, he's come back once, yet there's something off about him. No one can really say what it is, yet people feel his stares boring holes into the back of their heads and those people, who may or may not have done something heinous in the war, feel a brush with something cold and sinister.

Another thing they've figured out is that he's apparently immune to the killing curse, having found that particular fact after a nasty skirmish with remaining sympathizers to the Dark Lord.

He's put on the front lines of the Aurors, whether he wants to or not, and these disputes start gradually happening more. After about five Avada's, his friends have noticed something weird about Harry, yet they still can't pinpoint the exact thing, and it's gotten more frequent.

Ginny first noticed it after he put on a smile for George on the first year anniversary of Fred's death. But that smile, it was too wide, and his cheeks shouldn't be able to stretch that wide. She knew it was a fake one, but it was too wide, showing too many teeth.

She informed the others about it, and isn't surprised when Hermione comes forward and admits she started to get suspicious couple of months ago but didn't want to voice it in case she was wrong.

Harry chooses that moment to walk into the room smile still too wide. And Hermione knows Harry's hearing is perfectly good, and if he were anywhere close to the room, he would have heard their (rather loud) conversation-as they hadn't figured to put up a privacy charm-yet he just stands there, not having moved from his spot. After what seems like an eternity, Harry drops the smile and beckons them to come and rejoin the festivities. They comply, and he turns around and walks away, and Ginny, Hermione, and Ron steal glances at each other, because it would be impossible to miss the way the skin under is eyes didn't flatten out, and still stayed bunched up, as if he were still smiling.
