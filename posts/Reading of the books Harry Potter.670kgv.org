Hey so I'm looking for some really good pretty much completed fanfics were Harry and the school reads the books? I'd like it to be between mid of 5th year- right after the Battle of Hogwarts. Preticulrly in love with the Ines that are hurt/comfort or angst or drama. Like people finding out what umbridge did to his hand, his home life and such and especially reading about the 3rd task, ah how I love seeing my favourite characters be torched ðŸ™‚

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

*** Usually nothing happens in them. A few character of Harry Potter read the series and comment on what happens. They rarely have an outside plot and are mostly all terrible. For most people like me they are some kind of guilty pleasure to read at best. They can be entertaining but of course mostly the author fails to bring anything intresting up.

#+begin_quote
  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.
