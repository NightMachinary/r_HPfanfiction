Hello everybody, after a very long time of writing, rewriting, beta'ing and editing, it is finally done: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23720263/chapters/56959165][A Grim Odyssey]]. This is the final part in a series called The Elder Tales. It is completely finished and edited, and in the coming months I will be publishing a chapter every Saturday and Wednesday. Here is the summary:

#+begin_quote
  Part 3 of 3 in the Elder Tales series. After killing Hermione and her unborn child, Harry Potter wanders, guilt-stricken, over moors, through mysterious forests, and in the underworld of Belfast. With a cursed wand strapped to his arm, and a Death Eater and corrupt Minister on his heels, he is left wondering if he will ever be able to find forgiveness and come back home.

I recommend you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15691989/chapters/36463626][part 1 (Driving Miss Weasley)]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15692223/chapters/36464445][part 2 (On the Woodway)]] so that you're up to speed with everything. If you'd rather read on fanfiction.net, then the links are listed below. But for the eager beavers who want to dive straight in, here is a summary of those two stories:

#+begin_quote
  Auror Harry Potter is assigned to escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. They run into trouble, their romance rekindles, and Harry has to take possession of the Elder Wand again to save Ginny's life. Scared of the corrupting effect the Wand has on him, he hides it from everybody. Trouble looms for the new couple: mysterious murders take place, and Corban Yaxley, the last remaining fugitive Death Eater, re-emerges. Fear spreads and Kingsley Shacklebolt's Ministry hangs by a thread. It all comes to a head in the Forbidden Forest, where Harry accidentally hits Hermione with a curse. He runs away.

I hope you enjoy the first chapter, and that you'll stick around for the rest of the story!

** I've been a beta for a large chunk of the second book, and it was pretty great. It's amazing to see how long this fic has come, and I love to see it being close to finishing.

Also, I like that it's one of the few fanfics that are edited as a whole, meaning that there's actually overarching themes and stuff.

#+begin_quote
  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries, through a Scotland plagued by a mysterious infestation of Dark creatures. Part one of the Elder Tales series.
