Would people be interested in reading a fan fic whos main character is not Harry or one of the main characters in the series? Its going to be set probably in the current year and have death eaters who have survived/ not confirmed dead in the deathly hallows.


** I wouldn't write it off out of hand, but it would be a ding against it. If you're not featuring any of the main HP characters, you've got a much higher bar to clear.

** So you are doing an OC piece? That will automatically pull in some people and instantly dissuade others. It's much harder to do an OC but it isn't impossible and it can very definitely be good. Just make sure you build a character and not a Mary Sue. Give them flaws, don't make them overly powerful. Don't make Harry 2.0.

My advice would be get a beta, they will help you!

Good luck! Make sure to post the link when you've uploaded it so we can take a look!

** I definitely don't see it out of the realm of what I would read. However, I think the problem with a book like that is drawing in an audience. You have no easy hook to draw people in with. Of course, I don't want to dissuade you from writing it, I think that it has potential to be a very good read.

** If it's good, I'll read it! Having it /not/ be about a main character makes it pretty interesting to me. If you write it, make sure to promote it here please!

** Also i almost never read a post hogwarts fic unless its a crossover of some sort. So i probally wouldnt be reading it without a major character in it.

** I would enjoy reading it if it's done well.

In my own fic I've got lesser explored characters heavily involved throughout:

- Justin Finch-Fletchley
- Wayne Hopkins
- Ernie Macmillan
- Hannah Abbott
- Susan Bones
- OC: Amanda Derwent (Oh yeaaah)
- Obvious Ron/Hermy/maybe Dean Thomas AND:

... dun-dun-dun....

- Boy-Who-Lived Neville Longbottom.

It's a beach (in a rotten area) developing them decent likable personalities to them but it's going alright. I'm developing histories for them too (woot woot) I love writing things that earn me no money :-D...

Don't feel too put out, it's really interesting to read about new characters if they're done well :D It's why I'm so looking forward to this Newt Scamander fellow movie :-D

*** I've only just started writing so I have the first chapter done more or less, and I have about ~4 characters right now including the Carrow siblings.
