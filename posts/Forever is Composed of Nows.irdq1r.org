I'm currently writing a fanfic where Harry is reincarnated and ends up in Wool's Orphanage with a young Tom riddle - it's called /Forever is Composed of Nows/ and I'm working on chapter 6 at the moment. They grow up and attend Hogwarts together etc. but I'm trying to make it as realistic as possible. If it sounds like it's of any interest to you I'd really appreciate you checking it out because it's my first fanfiction haha.

** Well, when you said it was your first attempt at writing fanfiction, I was a little hesitant to checl it out, but concept intrigued me enough to give it a go Was pleasantly surprised and now I'm interested to see where the story will be going. Looking forward to future updates!
