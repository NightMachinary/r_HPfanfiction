I'm not a talented writer but this idea of a Sirius that is out for revenge and chaos sounds amazing if someone who can actually write did it


** I remember there's a fic where Sirius is /literally/ the Heath Ledger Joker.

#+begin_quote
  Surrounded by Bruce Wayne's party guests at a fundraiser for Harvey Dent the Joker walked closer to Rachel Dawes, knife in hand. He slicked his green-sprayed hair back and as he arrived close enough, he asked his signature question."You wanna know how I got these scars?" He wasn't expecting the correct answer. "Bellatrix Lestrange." Oneshot, not continuing.

** Arguably, canon Sirius /is/ out for revenge and chaos. It's only the threat of being recaptured that's keeping him halfway in line. He has truly psychotically violent moments as it is.
