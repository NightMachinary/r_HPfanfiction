Seriously... what?

So much shit that doesn't make sense.

Phoenixes coming to any Dumbledore in need... why?

A new, previously undocumented Dumbledore. Really?

Nagini being a Maledictus?

What the fuck is going on?

#+end_quote

All evidence of him being a Dumbledore has been supplied directly by Grindelwald and verified by nobody else.

I don't see why so many people seem to be taking that to be the truth when the chances of it being bullshit manufactured by Grindelwald are so high.

** Grindelwald might be lying to Credence after all.

I'm not upset about Nagini, but she hasn't done anything other than going along with Credence. But yes, an useless and redundant character so far.

However, I like the rest of the movie. Grindelwald proves to be so much more interesting than Voldemort. Leta, despite her short appearance, has impressed me. It's kind sad to see the last good Lestrange getting wasted so early. Queenie's arc is not bad either.

The various ministries are shown to be highly malicious, and I honestly enjoyed how Gellert burnt those Aurors to ashes.

*** Honestly, I was confused and disappointed by Queenie's arc. She goes from so obsessed with Jacob she's willing to bewitch him in order to marry him, to leaving him in order to work for a wizard who literally views muggles as animals and wants to subjugate/kill them all. My main issues were, -Why didn't they just leave America to get married? It's not illegal to marry muggle in britain, so why not go there, or just stay there after they found Newt? At that point what was stopping them? -She can read his mind, so she know's he loves her and is only concerned with her well being, so why is she so angry at him? -The whole situation could have been easily resolved by both of them sitting down and having an adult conversation, but she storms off before that can happen and then they never see each other again until she literary joins magical hitler. It's frustrating as a viewer because it doesn't seem believable, and I think Newt and Tina's arc has the same problem where if they just talked to each other ONE TIME, we could avoid the whole situation.

Ironically, in a movie that seems to have been 90% character exposition, I don't feel like her character grew enough on screen for it to be believable.

**** Since this is an ongoing story, I shall reserve my judgment until it's finished.

But it seems as a natural legilimens, Queenie can get emotionally and psychologically destabilized in a crowd. Pottermore even publishes a [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/a-guide-to-legilimency][new article about legilimency]]. This power does have drawbacks.

***** Fair point, but the first scene in question between her and Jacob takes place at night on a deserted street. Perhaps she's just an unstable person, but she is an adult who has theoretically been instructed in magic likely including her specific gifts so you'd think she'd at least have some coping mechanisms.

***** That's sort of my point though, Jacob's reason for not wanting to marry her is for her well being, which means he loves her, which she should know because she is literally a mind reader. That also doesn't explain why they couldn't just marry in a different country.

But really this was just one of many things that left me confused when leaving the theatre.

Honestly none of it was really explained it just seemed to work the way grindelwald wanted it to (which is fair, being magic and all), but Queenie was definitely under some sort of spell in that scene.

******* When was she put under a spell, or is it just that she seemed like she was under a spell? Because if it wasn't on screen or referenced at all, then I'd argue that the movie failed to properly communicate that to the viewer. Does Grindlewald have an established history of using the imperious or some similar magic to gain followers? Or do we just sort of assume that because "dark lord"?

I suppose the "magic" explanation makes sense, but it gets tiring answering all the plot difficulties with "because magic" after a while.

It was on screen. I too only saw the movie once a while ago so I don't remember the context but, IIRC it happens when she gets caught by grindelwalds equivalent of Bellatrix.

The spell itself might have been off screen (again can't remember), but a main character getting captured, then the next time we see her, she's inexplicably switched sides and is way more spacey and giggly then normal in a world with all sorts of mind control is more than communicative enough.

** I'll just go ahead and say that Grindelwald bullshits about this Dumbledore thing. By giving the poor guy that information he sets a magical nuke onto his greatest enemy. And the phoenix may just be more of his manipulations. We'll see. If the next movie confirms the third brother, I'll be miffed. But I'm pretty sure Grindelwald lied here.

Nagini being a Maledictus is kinda cool, I think. She unfortunately had not much to do in the movie. I would've liked seeing more of her.

I enjoyed Queenies arc as well. Her desire to forcefully push away the secrecy laws that keep her and Jacob apart makes a good motivation for joining the only one who makes this promise. I could live with it if the movies claim Grindelwald is just that good at Occlumency that he can withstand a natural Legilimancer like Queenie, but even if not, Grindelwald doesn't have genocidal end goals. He has no qualms against using genocide to get there, mind you, but overall he doesn't think muggles are useless - quite the contrary. He finds them so capable that he /fears/ what could be if their capabilities are unleashed.
