It doesn't specifically have to be Second Impact, I just chose it as an example of a near Extinction Level Event with global repercussions.

For those unfamilliar with Neon Genesis Evangelion, info on Second Impact can be found [[https://wiki.evageeks.org/Second_Impact][here]].


** In linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon), which is a Firefly/Serenity cross, they leave Earth on colony ships like the rest of the population.

In linkffn(The End of the World by AWMPerry), they die like everyone else.

In another story that isn't an end of the world catastrophe, the Wizarding World (except for Harry) moves into a hidden dimension to isolate themselves from muggles.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

  Possibly the fluffiestever take on the apocalypse. The Earth's orbit is about to take the planet through the middle of a massive asteroid swarm, and the world has a few months to face certain death. Call me strange, but I actually see the ending here as q

** Given that they can create shooting stars, create matter, and teleport, I think they'll be fine if it's just an environmental collapse. It's the other magical creatures and beings that have to worry.

Given the existence of drought charms and atmospheric charms, I wouldn't be surprised if wizards could simply replicate their effects on a larger scale, preventing or limiting said collapse.

*** Shooting stars are EASY. NASA does it all the time when they dispose of Astronaut waste from the ISS, although usually not over populated areas. All you need to do is get something high up moving fast.

**** I wasn't aware NASA had developed a way to create matter from nothing. Or create matter in space from Earth. Or teleport. Or time travel. Or yada yada.

In any event, even if they can't change the climate, wizards are going to be more than fine. Plus, they probably don't have to worry about the statute anymore.

*** Small problem with doing things on a large scale: That's the one thing that muggles excel at while the wizarding world utterly fails.

They've got a tiny population, an even tinier subpopulation of highly skilled wizards required for such feats, and pretty much everything they do has to be done manually by people. Scaling up a small scale weather charm to work globally would pretty much require everyone casting it 24/7, the globe is huge.

Meanwhile if muggles had a weather altering machine that worked on a small scale, doing it on a larger scale would be pretty easy, just build a factory where millions of weather machines roll off the assembly line, with most of the work done by robots.

** Invincible linkffn(13161929) 2012 crossover where the radiation is especially deadly to magicals. Mostly they panic. Goblins offer them sanctuary in their tunnels which they swear will be able to protect them. It's bullshit, goblins just want to watch wizards die.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
