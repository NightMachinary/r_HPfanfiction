I'm looking for a Draco/Severus/Harry fic that I found a while ago on scarhead.net. Recently I've realized that I can no longer access the website anymore. The fic begins with DM/SS; they are both spies for the Order that are discovered and cursed with sex-related curses. Harry is asked to help them both--basically by getting them off however is needed. He eventually joins their relationship. If anyone knows the title, that would be awesome--if you know of another place I could find the fic that would be ever better. Thank you!


** The site has been dead since mid 2010, and went down some time last year. The Wayback Machine has a cache of the front end stuff but it appears to not have any of the fics. I doubt they would have been migrated to AO3/FFN/any other archive in that time. Sorry, I think it's gone. Not the first time an entire site was lost, and it won't be the last unfortunately.
