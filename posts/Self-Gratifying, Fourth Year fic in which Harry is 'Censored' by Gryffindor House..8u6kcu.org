Hey! A long time ago I read a fic that was a guilty pleasure of mine, one of those Harry-Gives-No-Fucks stories that happened to include the House of Gryffindor Censoring him in response to the Tri-Wizard. His house all are idiots and McGonagall is pissed at them and essentially it means he's shunned from Gryffindor.

I can't remember any more specific details, because I think I was on one of those OP-Harry-Does-What-He-Wants kicks, but if anyone can remember anything, I would be much obliged :)

Thanks!!


** Just a quick thing my man. I believe the term you mean is, “censured”.

*** I think this is a case where the difference between american english and british english is in it's full effect.

both "censured" and "censored" mean the same. the first should be british- and the second american english.

Sorry, I was wrong and you are right. [[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/censure-or-censor]]

*** This is probably it, though OP's plot query is one of the reasons why I think the story is terrible. The whole Gryffindor plot is just a massive unrealistic overreaction to pretty much nothing.

**** Dunno. I find that masses tend to be easily manipulated and if you have 1-2 people speaking in favor of doing something, the more people joining in, the easier it becomes.

Stupidity knows no limits and stuff like that.

** Just a warning, I have come across this idea more than once so you might have trouble working out the specific fic you're looking for. I'll comment if I remember any others I've seen, but for now I can only think of linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and I'm not 100% on that one.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

Maybe this one? I vaguely recall seeing it before when looking for Triwizard-centric fics. Maybe.
