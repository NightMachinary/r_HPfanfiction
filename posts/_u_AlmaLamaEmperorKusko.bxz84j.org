** You can look at the stats on SnoopSnoo to get a general idea of what her posting/comment trends were. [[https://snoopsnoo.com/u/AlmaLamaEmperorKusko]]

A while after she deleted her account, a new one sprung up with a similar name that seemed to be parodying her comment style. I say parodying because the comments from the new account tended to be more confrontational and even further to the extreme of hyperactive. [[https://snoopsnoo.com/u/AlmaArachnidFriend]]

Might be the same person, or it might not.
