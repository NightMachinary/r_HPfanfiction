** I don't mind a snippet at the beginning of a chapter, or a reference to 'what I was listening to while writing this' at the end.

So long as you don't interrupt the story with it, it can be rather flavorful and appropriate.

There are exceptions where interrupting the story can be done well, but I'd /generally/ advise against it unless you have a very good reason. I'd say only the best authors can do it well, and they'd be able to better categorize the exact exceptions of when it works.

***** You see, you may say this as a joke, but in this kind of fic, I wouldn't mind lyrics. Its when they just come out of the blue that cringes the shit out of me.

The only time I can remember a fic using lyrics well is from a Were!Harry with the lyrics from both Monster and Demons from Imagine Dragons. It fit perfectly with both the mood, the setting and that particular interpretation of the lyrics. It also made me fall in love with Imagine Dragons.

*** I do this in the second chapter of my story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13105802/1/Singing-Crying-Laughing-and-Fighting]] , as the main characters work at a music shop, and music is a pretty important part of their lives. Not sure if it's well executed though. I tried to avoid just listing the lyrics, but actually describing the song through the characters eyes, and the action of the characters as it plays.

** Only time I tolerate it is when it's a character performing the song for story reasons. Given what the Harry Potter series is, this is pretty much never the case in this fandom. Like, in Life is Strange, Max (protag) actually knows how to play the guitar and you can do so in the game, so it's common to see her serenading her girlfriend in fics. Is it ideal? Usually no, hell it's often still annoying, but at least it makes sense and it's fluff or relationship progression. There have even been a couple of fics that really pull it off and make it very enjoyable, but well, it's pretty rare.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

If the author says that they listened to a song, which inspired them to write the story, that's fine, but when the story flow is interrupted by lyrics from the song in italics or whatever, that's where I draw the line.

Songfics have been around for who knows how long, and I swear that I don't see them as often as I used to. I've never really cared for them or really look for them in particular. When I see the lyrics in the fic itself in the middle of the goddamn story, I can't take it seriously, since that takes me so out of the moment that I can't help but laugh. The whole thing comes off as a bit amateur to me. It's like watching a character die on tv or a movie, and some asshole behind you starts blasting a random song on their phone.

** I don't mind it if it's done in an organic way, sort of like Stephen King puts a lot of songs into his fiction.

Particularly I don't mind songs in the Marauders era to give it that '70's feel. I imagine the Gryffindors in those days sort of looked into Muggle culture as they were trying to be better than the Death Eaters who despised everything about Muggles. You see Sirius with his motorcycle and muggle posters of women in bikinis, if they listened to some records too, or even tried going to a concert or movie (Star Wars was big enough in '77 that I imagine all the muggleborns saw it that summer), it just all fits in.

For Harry's age it's a bit harder to fit in. Harry was always kept apart from getting to enjoy anything by the Dursleys, Hermione seems to prefer reading to any other form of entertainment, and Ron of course is completely clueless.
