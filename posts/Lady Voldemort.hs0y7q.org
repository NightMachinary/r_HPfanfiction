I've seen hundreds of fem!Harry fics, but I've just realised I dont think I've ever seen a Lady Voldemort fic.

Can you imagine a Lady Voldemort, seducing her followers, and her opponents to her side?

In her younger days using her perceived vulnerability as a weapon, to get people to underestimate her, just as she was as a perceived muggleborn originally?

To have the stereotypicalised changes a female character does, such as poisons over curses, subtletyand manipulation over agression?

Having her followers even more dedicated as some (stupid) people feel need to protect her, even knowing she can protect herself?

This has to have been done right?

Sorry, random thought at 3 am had go samewhere


** The other one I've read besides Limpieza de sangre (mentioned earlier) is Power is Control by Rikuriroxa

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Distaff side has one, but I don't think it is quite what you want, since it is a universe where females are the stressors of the sexes.

I have been meaning to write a ginnymort bfic, where lord Voldemort revives in Chamber in Ginny's body. But have not got around to it
