:END:
I've been looking everywhere for this fanfic i read some time ago about Hermione being cursed by Bellatrix and as a result she can't sleep unless she's around dark wizards. Bellatrix believed she would go to Voldemort because of it but she ends up being helped by Snape. It's bery vague i'm so sorry but thanks a lot if you help! Also i think it was on Wattpad but am not sure ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ
