Harry gets sent back to his first year, is sorted into Slytherin, becomes friends with Hermione, Draco, and eventually Theo. Harry frees Sirius but that goes wrong and he lives with Severus instead. They also create a book for introducing the muggle born to the wizarding world.

Edit: Another detail I remember is that he was sent back via a ritual, being sorted into Slytherin messed up the original plans and Narcissa was the abuser of Draco not Lucius.

*** No, it's not that one :/ it was a trio of stories, the third one ended with Rita hanging out in one of their bags and then a message that the story was being abandoned. Hope it hasn't been deleted...

***** u/DanteDeLaMort:
#+begin_quote
  I also remember his boggart was of the future, it was Draco vs Hermione and she AK'd him which made Harry run out of the room.
#+end_quote

This plus Snape telling Harry he won't let him go back to the Durselys.

Edit: they also talked about their worst memories and Harry says he killed one of his teachers back in primary school.

** In the story is the reason Harry goes to live with Snape that Sirius has a flashback episode because of PTSD (though I don't think it's labelled as such in the story)? During the episode Sirius thinks that there are death eaters outside the house and keeps referring to Harry as James. Harry ends up flooing to Snape's.

If it is I'm hoping that this extra detail will help jog someone else's memory, because I would like to find this fic too.
