Starting off with Philosopher's Stone, this is the first thing we learn about her.

#+begin_quote
  But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were *proud* of having a witch in the family!
#+end_quote

This is a rant from Petunia, first and foremost, and is likely to be a bit biased, but it likely isn't going off from the Deathly Hallow's chapter. So, here we learn that she had a good relationship with her parents. That indicates that Lily was likely an easy child, as far as children go, she was likely not melodramatic and did not give them a hard time. However, the reliability of Petunia's judgement is questionable, because she's bitter.

#+begin_quote
  Head Boy an' Girl at Hogwarts in their day!
#+end_quote

This position is mostly given to those who: have a good academic record as a result of showing great responsibility towards their school tasks. So Lily was a good student, we know she was talented, but talent alone doesn't earn you this position, so she must have worked hard and Dumbledore must have seen her as reliable, and with good leadership abilities. McGonagall gets teary-eyed over the revelation of her death, so she's popular with her professors as well, she seems a loveable person if McGonagall cries over your death. She must've made an impression on her, so Lily is not a passive, air-headed bimbo. This part is important because it goes back to a quote Slughorn says later on in HBP. It tells us that Lily was a responsible student. However, before that Petunia says something:

#+begin_quote
  Turning teacups into rats!
#+end_quote

This shows some audacity, given that she was a muggleborn and she's clearly risking her position at Hogwarts. She was clearly not as desperate as Hermione (Expelled!) and likely would have thought she could (a) get away with it or (b) just didn't care. But Rowling states in an interview that Petunia was exaggerating.

#+begin_quote
  When Aunt Petunia said Lily turned teacups into rats, she was exaggerating a little, although "just like her son, Lily was not averse to testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy, so you can safely assume she will have had a few warning letters - nothing too serious, though."
#+end_quote

The Gryffindor rule-breaker in her comes out! Lily is officially /not/ a stick in the mud, and this information is from book one! How does the fandom really think she's some sort of law-abiding miss goody-goody when she's as audacious and daring as Harry? So far we have established that she's academically responsible, a bit daring (even if a huge risk taker, when she could have easily gotten expelled) and the pride of her parents.

#+begin_quote
  'But it's that sad- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find.'
#+end_quote

The first person we know of who knows Lily, and the first thing he describes as pertaining to personality is that she was nice. I think a very obvious message in Harry Potter is that good is not nice, and nice is not good. However, Lily had both traits, and she was a likeable person. . Lily goes out of her way to be kind to others, but this is all just reported traits until now, and James was not necessarily the nicest person one could befriend, Hagrid still described him as such, but I'll take it. She also knew Hagrid well enough that he knew where they lived, and Dumbledore trusted him to bring Harry. Whether Lily knew Hagrid through school or the Order, or both, we'll never know.

#+begin_quote
  But then he noticed she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time
#+end_quote

This is just Harry's projection, but since James isn't crying, and Lily is weepy in other scenes, it's safe to assume that the Mirror reflects the person you envision clearly too, because Harry had never seen his parents before, but he's viewing them with a very accurate physical image, so why not personality too? She may have been a very emotional person if we take the Mirror as the truth, but this is a very flimsy image of her, so it may not be too accurate of the person Lily was.

The second book we learn a lot about Lily through isn't until three books later.

#+begin_quote
  A group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.
#+end_quote

As Lily is one of these girls, she isn't self conscious about taking off her shoes in public, which many people are afraid of. She's laughing and chattering away and the image that she was a diligent student who spent every waking moment of the day reading is suddenly shattered. Die Hermione!Lily, die. This is in contrast to Lupin who is the only person aside from Snape revising. This shows us she's quite chill and carefree, and since she's laughing and having a good time, she either doesn't care too much about her mark, knew she did well and is confident in her abilities, or can shrug off her mistakes if that meant having a bit of fun. So she's a chill person, which fits in with her image as the popular girl who also later becomes Head Girl.

#+begin_quote
  'Leave him ALONE!'
#+end_quote

Really putting that emphasis on that alone, aren't we, Lily?

#+begin_quote
  'Leave him alone,' Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike.

  'You think you're funny,' she said coldly. But you're just an arrogant, bullying toerag'.
#+end_quote

So, the first thing Lily did isn't hexing James in a fit of rage. She clearly has a grip on her temper, and she doesn't like to exercise on James what he is doing to her best friend (supposedly, she's not sitting with him). She also has an expressive attitude ('ALONE!', every sign of great dislike). Lily is not afraid to show off her emotions, and wears them proudly on her sleeve. She manages to also call James a worthless person while she's putting him off. She also says things coldly when she's angry, so here we go: Lily is not always in a temper, always screaming and calling names, she's quite controlled. May angry Lily burn in hell forevermore.

#+begin_quote
  'I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid'.
#+end_quote

She's going for a burn with a bit of an absurd touch. She said the giant squid instead of saying she would rather go out with, Bertram Aubrey for example (let us pretend that he was a pimply, nerdy, weird dude with hair equally as greasy as Snape's). That tells me that that unpopular kid is Snape himself or she didn't want to hurt somebody's feeling. This fits quite well with with the image of her as a nice person.

#+begin_quote
  Lily, whose furious expression twitched for a second as though she were going to *smile*, said, 'Let him down!'
#+end_quote

Lily may be a fan of physical humour, and she doesn't seem to find old jokes unfunny (Lupin says levicorpus was a very popular hex back in the day). She's clearly showing some self-restraint, so she isn't one with an explosive temper, and she 'said' instead of 'shouted'. She does /not/ have a temper, and she's quite a chill person usually, but does not stand for bullies, or public rivalries or people who hex others, or whatever you want to brand James in this discussion, because he is not the point of this post. Again, Rowling describes her facial features/tone of voice with great emotion, furious in this case (although she doesn't lose her grip and start to hex him).

#+begin_quote
  'LEAVE HIM ALONE! Lily shouted
#+end_quote

She shouts now, after James has hexed her childhood friend to become 'as rigid as a board', but Lily only pulls her wand out now, after the third time she's told James to lay off. Imagine Harry in this ugly situation, he'd pummel Draco, wouldn't even go for wands this time. Again, great restraint.

#+begin_quote
  'I don't need help from filthy little mudbloods like her!'

  Lily blinked

  'Fine,' she said coolly. 'I won't bother in future. And I'd wash your pants if I were you, /Snivellus.'/
#+end_quote

This is brutal. She doesn't lose her grip this time, she's as cool as a cucumber. She knows he's poor, she must know he hates that nickname, and she uses the two things to wound him most. He's called her a derogatory slur, and she just fired off with an insult about his class, and she's turned what he hates the most on him. Lily is from the better part of Cokeworth, so she's reminding him quite clearly of his place, by adding to his humiliation. The Snivellus part is just the icing on the cake. She's cool as you please, she just blinks and that is all she needs to poke Snape in the place where it hurts the /most./ This is actually interesting, because it tells us that Lily knows Snape extremely well, so well that she knew how to hurt him and get away with it. Also, the fact that she doesn't go into a fit of histrionics proves that she is accustomed to this by now.

#+begin_quote
  'She hated him!'

  'Nah, she didn't'
#+end_quote

This is more of a James thing, but Lily evidently did not hate him as her dislike showed in the memory. She seemed to be a very expressive person, and she found him quite funny actually (suppressing a smile). So, either Sirius thought that Lily was in denial or it was common knowledge after Lily and James got together, and Lily admitted that she didn't hate him. Or simply, she disliked him back then, but loved him later on. I find that transition quite fast. Fifth Year: Dislike. Sixth Year: ???. Seventh Year: Dating. 1978 -1979: married. 1980: parents. That was so quick, but then again, this wasn't unusual during the First War, but they were extremely young. So Lily felt passionately to marry him this quickly and immediately go from dislike to love.

#+begin_quote
  'She didn't know much about it, to tell you the truth.'
#+end_quote

Sirius is implying that Lily could be easily lied to or fooled in the face of James and Snape hexing each other. Either that, or her love towards James was so blind she was willing to overlook it after Snape called her a mudblood, although I find that very cheap, but her being gullible and trustful is something I can get behind, because she and James both trusted Wormtail ('Wormy') and made him their secret keeper. This is a very interesting tidbit, actually, and I like it because reading between the lines, you can draw even more similarities between Lily and James! James, after all, was described to think mistrusting his friends the 'height of dishonour'. Thinking that Lily was very similar to James in this respect is plausible, and I think, quite fits into their tragedies of their untimely demise. They could have both been blindly trustful, to the point where it was a fault and quite annoying. A room for some Lily flaws in here, you can extend it to mean that Lily was even naive, although I think fighting for the Order would have made her a bit more jaded.

In the face of James's like towards Lily, and how he always made a fool of himself, he may not have been the only one. Rowling says:

#+begin_quote
  Quite a few boys were attracted to Lily. "Like Ginny, she was a popular girl."

  Lupin was very fond of Lily, we'll put it like that, but I wouldn't want anyone to run around thinking that he competed with James for her. She was a popular girl, and that is relevant. But I think you've seen that already. She was a bit of a catch.
#+end_quote

Here, a direct parallel between Lily and /Ginny/. Rowling is implying that she did date boys before James, and she was a loveable, well-regarded girl amongst her peers, like Ginny herself, she had many friends (she was sitting with a group of girls). This also fits quite well with her being Head Girl, because Lily should have also been well-liked by others to earn such a position. Although we have no backing up as to Dumbledore's motivation (it could very well have been a political statement, muggleborn as Head Girl). She's a catch, a good romantic prospect, and this is clear evidence (if you consider the interviews canon), that Lily was as active as Ginny romantically. Whether she dated as many as Ginny is unknown, but she was popular. Hear that, popular. Should I wave this on a banner and stick it on this sub's icon? Lily Evans was popular. Do you know who was /not/ popular? Hermione, she had only Harry and Ron as far as friends go, and later on Ginny...maybe.

Slughorn is the only person here who's willing to give us an account of her personality, aside from Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows, so here goes:

#+begin_quote
  'You shouldn't have *favourites* as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your Mother'

  '*Vivacious*, you know. *Charming* girl.'

  'I used to tell her she ought to have been in my *house*. Very *cheeky* answers I used to get back, too.'
#+end_quote

Slughorn seems quite enamoured with her and since he gets misty-eyed when drunk as Harry talked about her, his feelings were genuine. She's Slughorn's favourite, so it is safe to assume she engaged him in discussion, Slug Club meetings and didn't hate him. Slughorn is a man with experience and I think he'd know when somebody doesn't like him. Notice how he mentions Sirius, but not James, as well. The first thing we know about her is that she is vivacious, which is defined as being 'lively and animated'. Lily had a zest for life, and she was a very expressive person (it fits quite well with the descriptions we get of her. She is bursting and bounding with energy. She's also charismatic. Slughorn cannot imagine anyone who wouldn't have liked her, and speaking of charisma, he says she ought to have been in his house. I wouldn't say it is far-fetched at all if Lily had a manipulative streak, since that requires charisma by said manipulator. Whether she used this trait is unknown, and maybe she didn't even do it consciously. Slytherins value cunning, ambition, leadership and resourcefulness. Lily could have had any of these traits.

Wait a second, actually, this reminds me of someone. Hermione was a very funny and charismatic girl, you know very bright and animated, the resemblance is quite uncanny! Lily is also cheeky, and he acknowledges her as so. Cheekiness requires some form of disrespect towards authority figures so her humour could have been a bit on the impudent side (again, her almost smiling at Snape's ordeal in SWM). I honestly think we ought to take these personality traits at face value, given we had a previous memory of her from before. Lily seems to have a more offbeat sense of humour than Hermione Emotional-Range-of-a-teaspoon Granger, and less cruel than Ginny Bat-Bogey-Hex Weasley.

#+begin_quote
  I don't imagine anyone who wouldn't have liked her...very *brave*...very *funny*....
#+end_quote

We're hit with the likeable aspect yet again, and Slughorn really seems to love her sense of humour, doesn't he? Poor Slughorn, he keeps bringing it up, and yet we're so far into our perception of Lily is Hermione that ignore him very clearly. Among her intelligence, her humour, Slughorn also admires her bravery. It's safe to say that it didn't manifest out of nowhere when she defended Harry or joined the order, or defied Voldemort thrice So, Lily was always courageous. She might have even had a saving people thing, like Harry, or could act quite rash or recklessly in some moments. He could have commented on how good a potioneer she was here, but Slughorn is really more in love with her character, and she must have left a good imprint on him (that's two professors whom Lily has left a lasting impression on and has made cry). He did not just see her as a valuable piece at auction, like Harry would think at the start of the book, but I think this relationship is quite sweet.

We have a lot of memories in this book, and we see the most of Lily here, from letters to memories. Lets' start:

#+begin_quote
  Dear *Padfoot*,

  *Thank you, thank you*, for Harry's birthday present!

  He smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent for Christmas (*no complaints there*).

  We were so sorry you couldn't come, but the *Order's got to come first*

  *Wormy* was her last weekend, *I thought he seemed down*, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; *I cried all evening when I heard*
#+end_quote

Okay, the first time we see Lily not angry and defending Snape. First off, she uses nicknames (Padfoot) and nicknames of nicknames. She likes that sort of thing, just like her sister, who calls Dudley 'Duddikins''. She's also very expressive (thank you, thank you), again, she wears her heart on her sleeve, and quite proudly at that (I cried all evening). She must feel quite strongly to cry a whole evening, or she is exaggerating. Also, I love the tidbit about the Order coming first, what a badass. Can we appreciate the fact that Lily is a warrior through and through? Even after she had Harry and her and James became domesticated, they still had that spark, and she was very loyal to Dumbledore; Lily wanted to fight for people like herself, and she was not petulant.

Lily also is either quite perceptive (notices James trying to hide his feelings, but then again, he /is/ her husband) or James and Peter are obvious. Wormy 'seeming down' is likely due to the fact that /he/ ratted out the McKinnons. However, she puts it on the McKinnons' death. We see that Lily is a very unsuspicious person, so any thought of her maybe being gullible and naive, or simply optimistic and putting blind faith onto someone, is quite plausible, and ties into her not suspecting what James was doing. Again, blind trust although I may be a bit extreme to call her that. Lily wears her heart on her sleeve, and she is not ashamed of being 21 and openly admitting that she is crying. Now, twenty one isn;t super old, but you'd think she'd be more jaded by the war, and would cry a lot, but she seems quite accepting of her being weepy and emotional, and she's very comfortable informing Sirius of that. And because I have to make everything about Sirius, how sad is it that Harry finds it in his family's old bedroom? Poor Sirius. Back to Lily, She seems quite remorseless about Harry breaking Petunia's vase (Petunia isn't a devil here, wow). To suggest that the rift between the sisters laid solely on the older one is dishonest, because relationships rarely work that way. I think this is a good indication that Lily might have also had her part in the relationship falling apart. She displays very feminine traits that, might I remind everyone, we bash Cho and Lavender for. How about suggesting Lily was as weepy and emotional as Cho and can give nicknames like Lavender? Shocking, I know, Cho and Lavender are obviously horrible people, nothing at all like Saint Lily, calm, cool and collected all day, everyday.

Lily also snaps that picture of James chasing Harry, she's the laid-back parent here, James is the one who's worried and Lily treats everything nonchalantly. 'Oh, he almost killed the cat and broke the horrible vase my estranged sister sent. By the way here is James frantically chasing Harry'. Lily is trying to make the most of her situation here, talking to Bathilda, taking pictures, writing to Sirius. It might be an indication she tried to distract herself from getting worried.

#+begin_quote
  But the girl had let go of the swing *at the very height of its arc* and flown into the air.

  'Mummy told you not to!'

  'But I'm fine,' said Lily, still *giggling.*
#+end_quote

Okay first scene of Lily as a kid and she's naughty child who disobeys her mother's rules. She's also experimenting with her magic, so she is naturally curious and a very perceptive person to spot her oddities and know she can control it. She also giggles! The horror! It is like a breach in the fandom's wards has been done, protect us from this monstrosity! Let up your Occlumency shields to fight it!

#+begin_quote
  'You're...you're a witch,' whispered Snape

  She looked *affronted.*

  '/That's/ not a very nice thing to say to somebody.'

  She turned, *nose in the air*, and *marched* off towards her sister.

  The sisters considered him, united in *disapproval*.

  Lily obeyed her sister at once.
#+end_quote

Again with the emotional side of Lily showing, I'm starting to think she might have a very expressive face. Also, she's clearly offended because little Lily might have grown up reading stories about evil witches, and took it quite seriously. What a sweetheart. Can we talk about she stuck her nose in the air, for little children that's a very animated gesture, and they do it on purpose to express displeasure, they actually look quite cartoonish. Also, this is such a Petunia gesture, these sisters are very much alike, so far they share a habit of nicknaming others and sticking their nose on people. Also, little Lily emulating Petunia, this is so heartbreaking to read.

#+begin_quote
  Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air
#+end_quote

She still thinks this is some Fairy Godmother Cinderella type of situation, and it's adorable. She's quite imaginative, as far as I can tell. Definitely not limited to her views, I think Xenophilius would like her, like Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  'Really?' *whispered* Lily
#+end_quote

Why the whisper? Again, she's an animated child.

Okay now onto the good part:

#+begin_quote
  'Does it make a difference? Being Muggle-born?'
#+end_quote

This part is really important. Lily would have grown up hearing stories such as Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz or even the Chronicles of Narnia and in these situations, where she is Wendy, Dorothy or Alice, they always find trouble, and she's maybe worried that she'll be rejected. She has some lingering insecurity, and she's quite fearful, despite her bravery, as she seems to have dementors on her mind very early on (she might concoct worst image scenarios in her mind, like Ron does in the tent). We know her wand wood is willow, just like +Hermione+ Ron.

#+begin_quote
  I have noted that the ideal owner for a willow wand often has some (usually unwarranted) *insecurity*

  My willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn.
#+end_quote

This rather fits Ron's description. Lily had a lot ahead of her, and it's not dishonest to say that Ron did too. She had lots of potential, and she must have achieved some of it, at the very least, since she and a lot to learn, and being muggleborn, it does make a bit of sense, doesn't it? So far, this is the only parallel I can draw to Hermione, and it is hardly unique to them, since both were muggleborns, and that should be quite the usual situation for them, there was never a shortage of them in the series.

#+begin_quote
  'How are things at your house?'
#+end_quote

She shows concern , probably the first ounce of kindness he's ever been given. Hagrid's statement about her being nice is now backed up, since she's showing a bit of sympathy for young Snape.

#+begin_quote
  'Tuney!' said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice
#+end_quote

A typical child would have been angry that her sister was caught eavesdropping, but Lily is nice, and she's open, she doesn't jump to worst conclusions for /others/ but might do it for herself. I think this is a very important part about her character. She makes excuses for Snape, she sees the good in James, she believes the best of Wormy and Tuney. Her bravery lies in Lily being able to see the good in others, maybe that movie quote was not so horrible after all, except for the fact that it was said by Lupin.

#+begin_quote
  There was a /crack:/ a branch over Petunia's head had fallen. Lily *screamed*...'
#+end_quote

For all her bravery, she's quite easy to startle, and Lily being so obviously afraid makes her bravery all the more impressive, she's just a child here. But again, she wears her heart on her sleeve, and she's a very emotional person. She clearly also has some loyalty towards family first, before she ever goes to Snape's side at all. Only when her loved ones are visibly hurt does she seem to see that others had some bad in them, and she's very convinced of her own view. See here:

#+begin_quote
  'Did you make that happen?'

  'No.'

  'You did! You /did!/ You hurt her!'

  But the *lie did not convince* Lily
#+end_quote

Why ask if you're quite sure of your opinion, Lily? But this means that she's just a child, most likely, although she's always been an emotional person, even when she grew up a bit. Again, he lied and she ratted him out, she's a perceptive person, although that seems to have been clouded over by her judgement of her friends (like Wormy seeming down). When she knows you well, you're in her good books. I think she doesn't like to think the worst of her friends, but is quite ready to do so for people she dislikes (like James and Snape once upon a time each).

#+begin_quote
  'I'll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!'
#+end_quote

Sweet Lily, she is so optimistic. This optimism really is heartbreaking when she misplaces it, however.

#+begin_quote
  '-you think I want to be a - a freak?'

  Lily's eyes filled with tears.
#+end_quote

Emotion. This girl cries a lot and as someone who does, I am all for it, naturally. Strong female characters should be portrayed with their feminine traits too! I don't want to keep reading about impassive women who wear a mask of cool detachment every single time that she appears on page (or onscreen). But just like SWM, Lily jabs Petunia right where it hurts most.

#+begin_quote
  Lily glanced towards her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene.

  'You didn't think it was such a freak's school when you wrote the headmaster and begged him to take you!'
#+end_quote

The part about her parents being proud does seem to be true. So, no, Lily's mother and father did not disown her for being a witch or try to perform exorcisms on her. She also knows how Petunia would be hurt, and she hits right where it's sore, where she knows Petunia would falter. She's such a little sister, and I say this as an older one, although I like to think I am nicer than Petunia.

#+begin_quote
  Lily gave herself away by half glancing at where Snape stood, nearby.

  'No - not sneaking -' Now Lily was on the defensive. 'Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn't believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts!'
#+end_quote

Not good at lying, her thoughts slip very easily, and she's an easy person to read. She's also ready to stay in her sister's good books as she's leaving and not about to see her until Christmas, by throwing Snape under the bus. Not very nice, but it may have just been a moment of panic, and very childish. She's 11 here, after all. She's quite fierce her, but then Snape enters in the next scene and:

#+begin_quote
  She had been crying.
#+end_quote

I sound very repetitive, don't I? But again, weepy.

#+begin_quote
  She threw him a look of deep dislike.
#+end_quote

Do you like him or not, Lily? Fanon often portrays her as a very loyal person, but she seems quite fickle here. But then again, 11 years old. However, Ron does stand up on a broken foot to confront a mass murderer for Harry, and he was only two years older then. I would not be surprised to learn that the break in Lily and Snape's friendship does only belong to Snape alone, because again, just as with Petunia, relationships barely go like that, however I am not saying that Snape doesn't the bigger share of the blame. She was not with him after the exam, she is a bit turbulent when she's upset so Snape might have been confused sometimes during the five years they were friends.

#+begin_quote
  Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.

  James and Sirius imitated her *lofty* voice.
#+end_quote

She doesn't seem to like anyone much. Also, expressive face, very easy to read, yet again. Some Petunia similarities here, she's lofty and even when she calls James arrogant, she has a streak of self-righteousness herself.

#+begin_quote
  He watched his mother go forward on *trembling* legs.

  *Barely a second* after the hat had touched the dark red hair the hat cried, 'Gryffindor!'
#+end_quote

I like this. A lot, actually. Lily is quite obviously scared, but even in the face of her fear, the hat declares her a Gryffindor without a second thought. This bit really stands out to me here, because it implies that Lily might be the quintessential Gryffindor, and this is where her character stands out. Everybody remarks upon Lily's bravery, and suddenly, that comment about Dumbledore saying Harry's deepest nature is like his mother's makes so much more sense. Lily embodies all the Gryffindor traits, but that doesn't just mean the positive stuff, but also the bad: we already see her break the rules and act quite rashly by jumping off a swing, She is quite obviously afraid and it shows, yet she persists, and I think I understand how Slughorn loves her personality so much. He sees a scared little girl, but the spitfire is as brave as the mightiest Gryffindors, the hat doesn't even ponder another house for her. It's so much easier to like somebody who is brave in the face of their worst fears rather than somebody who is fit to burst with bravado. This is pure conjecture and headcanon now, but is it really a stretch to believe Harry inherits the hero-complex from his mother? Or that she herself was a reckless person, since she was a bit of a daredevil ever since she herself was young, and joined the Order at the tender age of just 18?

#+begin_quote
  ' We /are,/ Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging around with. I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber. M/ulciber!/ What do you see in him, Sev? He's creepy!
#+end_quote

Again, nicknames and feminine traits. Also, hilarious that Snape was once Sev. She talks with such vehemence, and again, she likes reiterating her words, she sounds quite childish when she does so, but not in a bad way, just like Slughorn calls her vivacious, it shows it with her way of speech. Also, lots of exclamation points, show your passion, Lily. It shows you that Lily has that spark of youth and she may still be a kid at heart. So I don't know where stoic Lily with a penchant for clipped words comes from? Others may see her repetition annoying, it's not the first time she's done it, and we only have a handful memories of her.

#+begin_quote
  'It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny -'

  'They don't use Dark Magic though'
#+end_quote

I think the theories that Lily invented Sectumsempra should have never been a thing, so I hope they die . She was not a dark lady in training. She is also mentioned to have put the Order first. I think that Lily who mistrusts Dumbledore and hates him should have also never been created. She also thinks that illegal hexes are nothing on dark magic.

#+begin_quote
  'He's ill, they say he's ill-'

  'Every month on the full moon?' said Snape.

  'I know your theory,' said Lily, and she sounded cold'.

From what I can get here, Lily seems to know Lupin is a werewolf since Snape wants to bring it to her attention, and it's clearly not the first time she's done so. Personally, I like to believe that Lupin's secret may have been some sort of open secret by then, just nobody could prove it. Lily being in on it and protecting her housemate is a possibility, and again, she's not a very good liar, and she sounds cold. Her face betrays her emotions. I also like to believe that Lily herself didn't go around snooping, and it's likely judging from this, with her admonishing Snape about being obsessed with them, I doubt Lily gave the time of day to find out where Lupin went every month, she just had better things to do, although I feel like when Snape was cluing her in, she was smart enough to figure it out.

#+begin_quote
  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.
#+end_quote

I can write a ten-hour speech about the horror of strong female characters blushing in literature, but I will leave it here. I cannot fathom how Lily could flush, blush and giggle, but the day is here, and Lily Evans displays some very basic teenage girl traits, and it's in-text.

#+begin_quote
  'And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there -'
#+end_quote

Okay, so Lily has been fed some version of the truth. Maybe Bertha Jorkins was still around, and she spread it? Or more likely, James and co. told her about it, and she believed the truth that they came up with. But there's the possibility that she also knows part of the truth and she's covering up for Snape by telling him that she doesn't know what's down there. However, that makes her come across as really bad here, because Snape is obviously going through a bit of a crisis, however much you think he's right or wrong in this situation, or if the werewolf traumatised him. This brings us to another point: Lily may have wholly believed it, without knowing other details. This can mean that she likes James, and thus, is thinking the best of him and doesn't want to believe that it's a partial truth, or a bit of a lie, which fits in with a Lily we've seen who /might've/ been a bit of a gullible girl, and would believe anything thrown at her. I think this is also slightly nice, because given the insecurity that was mentioned before, she could've initially believed some of the propaganda that was thrown at her about being muggleborn, which made Snape's comment about it not mattering, and when he called her a mudblood a bit vicious, and very hurtful, more than we can imagine.

#+begin_quote
  '/Let/ me? /Let/ me?'
#+end_quote

Not afraid to call out her (presumably) best friend on his bullshit. No one tells Lily to do anything, and she's her own person. She might seem like a pretty regular girl from before, but Lily here is actually a bit distinct from other 15 year olds. This is a huge contrast to her blushing just a moment ago, she's quite clearly the one who has a dominant side of this friendship, and she's not afraid to exercise it. This draws the difference between her and most others. I know I would've been too nice and shut up, although would have become passive-aggressive. However, Lily was quite ready to confront him head on.

#+begin_quote
  'I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.'
#+end_quote

Two things from this scene: Lily is willing to let Snape come and beg and plead outside of the portrait hole, and Snape knows where the Gryffindor common room is. Could Lily have been the one to guide him there? If so, she's a bit more on the non-traditional side for Gryffindor, and likes inviting others over. However, her anger knows boundaries, even though he humiliated her, Lily actually did believe he will sleep out there, and she didn't want to do him that discourtesy to her friend's dignity, especially if James catches him there. She's being the bigger person, she doesn't need to listen to excuses about how her friend is a racist, but yet here she is, trying to save him some dignity.

#+begin_quote
  'Slipped out? It's too late. I've *made excuses* for you for years. None of *my friends* can even understand why I talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny thats' what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join *You-Know-Who*, can you?'

  'But you call everyone of my birth mudblood, Severus.'
#+end_quote

She says that she has made excuses. She does not tell him 'I thought you had good in you', but says that she's excused his actions for years, even if they're bad actions, so she knows full-well what he is, and yet she was either too kind or too cowardly to tell him what is going on in her head. Calling her a mudblood is the straw that broke the camel's back, but only when he called /her/ one. Again, that side of Lily who sees the best in her friends comes out, she's fully aware that he is in the wrong but part of her seems to think that Snape could change. She also says You-Know-Who, the war is in full swing right now, and she doesn't call him by his name, she's too afraid. It's really interesting because here we have a girl who is ditching her nazi friend and standing up for herself, but she's also scared to call Voldemort by his name, it shows her obvious fear but it also shows her immense bravery in the face of that, and it's quite beautiful. She's a flawed teenage girl who is not fearless, but she's the quintessential Gryffindor by standing up for herself. She's also not really surprised at Snape, she must have subconsciously come to that conclusion a long time ago, but she was waiting for there to become a full swing in his actions until she cut him off. She also says 'my friends' and not 'my other friends', so she's cut him off mentally as well. She's either actively or instinctively excluding him from this. She also knows he calls others mudblood. I think this shows some cowardice if he has done it directly to her face before, and she had done nothing until he turned it against her. It makes for an interesting flaw, but teenage girls are usually not in the field of cutting off friendships that have lasted years. They like to extend it as far as possible, and I do not speculate, but speak from experience.

#+begin_quote
  'I can't pretend anymore, you've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.'
#+end_quote

She nows him extremely well, and she just wants confirmation. In the face of Snape joining the Death Eaters, Lily is telling him that she's going to fight against that, that she's fighting against Snape himself, and that takes guts. It's an emotional scene, because war does separate people and they did end up on opposite sides. Lily knows what she's going to do, just as Snape is, and she's admitted it quite openly, and that is the last we see of Lily.

**** I think it's because she's constantly portrayed as this perfect wife-mother-goddess figure. We only see tiny snippets of her, but they all portray her in an overwhelmingly positive light. Part of it is probably people not wanting to speak ill of the dead, but a lot of Lily's character seems two dimensional as a result.

If she ever has any fault at all, it's that she has a bit of a temper, but somehow she always turns out to be defending someone in need or standing up to some injustice. Probably the only canon-compliant fault is that she's unforgiving - she cut out Snape after he called her a mudblood once accidentally in the heat of the moment. But even that is excusable, given that there was a war going on so those kinds of insults had wider reaching consequences than childish bullying, and then she died within 5 years, so the two never had an opportunity to reconcile.

It's maybe less applicable to James/Lily (and I guess also Frank/Alice), because both witches were heavily pregnant by the time the prophesy became known, and they both did go into hiding.

Generally speaking, everyone in the books hexes other people time and time again. None of them ever get accused of using Dark magic. This is one of those instances where JKR would have been better off keeping silent, but instead she went ahead and categorised all hexes and curses as dark magic.

Guess that makes Hermione a budding Dark witch at 11, when she uses the Body-Bind *Curse* on Neville. /Gasps/. Another spell that is taught to first years (in their very first term) is the Leg-locker *Curse*. But nope, all curses are dark magic. smh

We do see a few truly dark spells, like Sectumsempra and the curse that attacks Dumbledore's arm, or the one that hits Hermione in the battle at the end of OotP. They have pretty big differences from the regular hexes and curses that Harry and his peers normally use.

Honestly, Lily would probably have thought that Lupin was in a similar enough boat as she was, and is probably just covering for him. This was during the First War, when muggleborns and those who stood up for muggleborns were abducted, tortured and killed. Werewolves are almost universally hated throughout society, but Lily, as a muggleborn, probably wouldn't fall in that same category, if only because she can relate somewhat to the hate. She's also known Lupin for five years, and can clearly see he's not a bloodthirsty monster as werewolves are widely known as. Lupin might be mischievous and probably gets into a lot of trouble along with his friends, but he's no monster.

And considering the kind of company Snape keeps, it's easy enough to determine what his opinions on werewolves were, and what he'd have done had he gotten proof that Lupin was a werewolf.

Overall, I agree with nearly everything you've written here, apart from the likeness to Petunia. Younger siblings do try to imitate their elder siblings' mannerisms, and the time when you described Lily as similar to Petunia on the train, she's had a pretty bad day and is probably just pissed.

I'm not arguing here, because I just realised that it's not really backed up by facts, but if you have to know my train of thought about this, then here goes. Snape had grey underpants, which I took to mean worn out or washed too many times (like when you wash really old pieces, they lose colour), and I guess it translated directly into poor in my mind, because in my language it's kind of like that. So after that, I guess my brain carried on and said this stuff is taboo (and it is, you just never mention this stuff, at all, you'll get sneered at), so Lily was obviously commenting on him 'washing it' when she very well knows it's likely clean. Yeah, I think I stretched it a bit, and it's a bit flimsy, so I'll give you that.

#+begin_quote

Except for Sirius and James obviously. Snape good, James bad, please remember this. I've never seen hexes portrayed as anything bad in the narrative until Rowling seemed to want to cement the fandom's hatred of James (and it worked magnificently), by saying 'look, he cast an ILLEGAL hex' and it sort of carried from there. Obviously, we must conveniently brush aside sectumsempra because Snape good. Hermione is Voldemort's apprentice for cursing Marietta, obviously. Harry was just too oblivious to notice it, and it wasn't relevant to the plot, just like Voldemort having tea with Umbridge wasn't. We don't even know if it was in retaliation to something Bertram Aubrey did, or he was being a jerk. We collectively jumped onto the 'James bullied Bertram Aubrey' train because of that.

Yeah, I put that up as an explanation for her being defensive that night, she most likely has been told herself after having theories. She would've had suspicions, especially with poor Sev niggling her about them ('why are you so obsessed with them?'), even if she wanted to ignore it and not try to pry into Lupin's private business. It makes for a nice bonding point between Lily and Lupin, both being outcasts. Here's how I've been looking at it: Remus Lupin being a werewolf is kind of an open secret, or something like a private joke in the school because most brush it aside as ludicrous and take it lightly as Lupin having a rabbit. However, there are some fanatics who subscribe to this theory, and Snape was one of them. So Snape thought he could finally prove it and be labelled a hero for expelling all of them, but James thankfully botched his plan. The idea that he was blameless and Sirius was a cold-blooded murderer (especially after he saw Pomfrey leading him down, literally staff, and why is he out stalking Lupin, it wasn't from a window because somebody must've seen it by chance before), is ridiculous.

I don't think the train ride is entirely indicative of it, because I've mentioned other stuff, but I've neglected the amount of times Petunia also bursts into tears. Anyway, to each their own, but I think some stuff from being raised by the same parents does carry on, like the nicknames thing, or (pure headcanon now), their mum was a very orderly lady, and they both liked a neat and clean state of their house, things like that.

  Snape had grey underpants, which I took to mean worn out or washed too many times (like when you wash really old pieces, they lose colour), and I guess it translated directly into poor in my mind, because in my language it's kind of like that. So after that, I guess my brain carried on and said this stuff is taboo (and it is, you just never mention this stuff, at all, you'll get sneered at), so Lily was obviously commenting on him 'washing it' when she very well knows it's likely clean.
#+end_quote

I took it as a very basic teenage comment about someone being gross and wearing dirty pants, and it also being a clear reminder that he's the one with his pants on show to the world. Especially as Snape is repeatedly described as greasy even as an adult, I'd imagine he had a reputation at school for being a bit unclean and this kind of comment just shows that shes now happy to make a comment like that to his face in public when she would have defended him before.

I've seen certain other people share their sob theories about Snape being so impoverished that he couldn't afford shampoo to wash his hair, and that's why it was greasy all the time. It never made any sense to me, because Hogwarts provides all the toiletry stuff to students, with prefects getting a rather great bathroom.

Snape has a terrible sense of hygiene, even as a professor. You can only get greasy hair (which is sweat+dust) when you don't wash your hair.

  Snape good, James bad, please remember this
#+end_quote

Yes indeed. I've the same people who've shared their boo-hoo theories about Snape compare James to Voldemort. It's insane how utterly ludicrous they are. I sometimes think that James is one of the most hated characters by the fandom, rivaling even Umbridge. These same people go to any extent to justify Snape's actions during his teens and adulthood - it's uncanny how much their twisted justifications resemble real life journalists trying to whitewash real life terrorists and criminals.

In all the books, jinxing/hexing/cursing another student will get you punished. I thought that would be obvious, but Snape stans will be Snapestans, I suppose.

From your Lily is naive/gullible and trusting point, it could also be assumed that Lily only heard of the Marauders' fights with Snape and co from Snape, who could have presented those fights to her in such a way that Lily would believe Snape's version over anyone else's, because Snape is her friend. Snape displays that same attitude decades later in PoA, when he is whinging to Dumbledore about the Willow incident.

#+begin_quote
  The idea that he was blameless and Sirius was a cold-blooded murderer (especially after he saw Pomfrey leading him down, literally staff, and why is he out stalking Lupin, it wasn't from a window because somebody must've seen it by chance before), is ridiculous.
#+end_quote

The only one to blame for Snape being in that situation, is Snape himself. It's not as if Sirius cast an imperius curse or something along those lines on Snape and forced him to go looking for Lupin. Snape had seen the school nurse lead Lupin away from school on several occasions , he definitely knew what that meant, and he knew what he was getting into when he went down the Willow.

That's so silly, you missed book 5, page 61, line 3 about Hogwarts bathrooms rejecting Ginny and Ron because they were poor. This is why they always had greasy hair. Also, it's because of /potions fumes/, because Slughorn was as ill-tended as Sna-

Oh wait.

On this line of thought, the constant posts on Tumblr about how Snape wasn't really ugly, Harry is just prejudiced. I try not to judge artists, but when I look at a fanart and think 'Regulus Black' only for it to turn out to be Snape, I get really uneasy. He was ugly, why can't you accept this? It's like 'now I've made Snape look as nice as possible, he must be pretty'. It's also really hypocritical when they say 'Lily only went to James for his good looks' in the same post. Damn, pick a side, and don't manage to sound so hypocritical.

I've long since learned that there really is no need to dignify such assessments with a reply. In light of the recent protests against police brutality, I swear I've seen over three posts a day about how James only fought for the Order because he was always a bully, and he just saw it as means to let out his aggression on someone, like brutal US cops. This makes you go speechless, and not because it's a good argument, this constant vilification, which also goes hand-in-hand with 'James was really dumb at school, he cheated from Lupin' and 'he wasn't actually good at Quidditch'.

I do think he is to blame here, but I wouldn't let off Sirius this easily, it was a really stupid thing, what he did, even if it was most likely not attempted murder. But Snape does get the lion's share. Oh God, you've reminded me of this argument that Snape seeing Pomfrey down there actually meant Lupin was /restrained/ in chains...in addition to being inside a whomping willow and a shack in Hogsmeade? It's also bizarre because it makes Lupin sound as if he were a zoo animal, or that Dumbledore would treat him that way.

** Thank you for this. I'm in the middle of a reread for the first time in a while, but I'd definitely thought that Lily barely had a personality in canon - it's nice to see someone go through in such great detail and pin down what we do know about her, particularly with such sharp analysis.

** The only thing I would counter is Lily being afraid of saying Voldemort. If I'm not mistaken, it was strongly implied there was a taboo curse on Voldemort's name during his first war as well. So Lily might have an excellent reason for calling him "You-Know-Who" that isn't based on fear.

Otherwise, I thought this was an excellent and very thorough analysis! I really appreciate all the quotes you hunted down, it makes it very comprehensible and easy to understand where you're coming from, and I easily agree with almost all of it.

#+end_quote

So nope, Lily was likely just scared, or if you want to go the more unconventional route (and in the eyes of the fandom, blasphemous), Lily was concerned with keeping up appearances and trying to stay the popular girl by not uttering The Name. Although part of me doubts that. Unless you're right and Dumbledore is trying to get the people who annoy him dead.

But thank you, I really appreciate nice feedback like yours, especially because I haven't thought about Lily before in such depth, and I was scared to post this <3
