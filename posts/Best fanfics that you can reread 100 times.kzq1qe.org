What are the best fanfictions that you have ever read? So good in fact that you can reread so many times and still enjoyed it? The type of fanfiction that has you thinking of it for days and begging the universe for more?

For me its [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6419452?view_full_work=true][Walking Dead Wizard]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19142380/chapters/45495025][The End]]

What about you?

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** linkao3(survival is a talent) just has this feeling of pure Found Family beauty to it that I seldom get to enjoy in fiction, fanmade or no. And I absolutely adore it. Considering how much Harry sees Hogwarts as his home in canon, this is exactly what I wanted his experiences there to be like. Like, it's actually believable that hundreds fought to their deaths to defend this one castle, if this is what they were fighting for. It's great. It exemplifies why I read fanfiction in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort, unexpectedly short on money and growing tired of both Wormtail's existence and Nagini's incessant pleas to eat the wizard, has a most brilliant idea: crowdfunding, and the first reward tier is a livestreamed broadcast of Nagini getting her wish. It is a massive success -- and the people demand more.Said 'people' just so happens to include one Boy-Who-Lived.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Okey, it's time to share my wisdom. There are SO MANY fics that I could reread 100 times. Some of them I did rearead 10 times or more. It's a shame that it's onlh hp but here we go. Warning: they are dramiones or tomionnes *[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion][Pygmalion]] by Colubrina. I absolutely love this one. I think I almost know it by heart from all the times I have read it. It is a Tomione one. But, 3ven if you don't like that couple, give it a chance for Neville. Neville has never been an interesting character for me, until i came across this fic. OMG, how could her create such a masterpiece? Here, Neville is dark, easygoing and intelligent. I could talk about him for hours, but i don't want to spoil anything. I also love Luna. She is eerie and powerful a revengeful and has so many interesting ideas. If I could only read one fanfic would be this one. * [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11335983/1/Housemates][Housemates]] by Colubrina. This is one of the first ones I read. It is short and extremely interesting. I love ALL the characters and thanks to this story I discovered one of my fav poems. It really gave me another perspective. It is in a modern AU and magic doesn't exist. HOWEVER it is extremely accurate with each personality. It is polyamorous and great. 10/10

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11258545/1/The-History-Project][The history project]]. A drammione. It started with a draffle but she has been kind enough to make a hole story. Such a queen. It is absolutely original. All the story is conversation like in texts. It is wonderful to see how they both grow fond of each other with the things they wrote. I would like to say that this ones are my favourites, but in reality all her work is amazing. ALL OF HER STORIES NO EXCEPTIONS.

- How to win friends and influence people [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12531992/24/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People][here]]. How can this Book, novel, work of the Gods be free. Oh my, OH MY. It is incredible. I am deeply in love with AT LEAST 3 characters. This story has everything: romance, conspiracy, drama, homour ... and it is finished. Here the rols are marvellously reverse. Here hermione is the muscle and Draco the brains and i am in love.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8611642/4/][Love in a zombie apocalypse]] zombies and the greatest Draco I have had the pleasure to read. And believe me, I've read A LOT. Even today i think about it and the reasons that this crazy yet extremelly useful man could have. It is really an slow one but it is perfect. No finished, tho.

I have more, but I should look for them.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6467810/1/Rojo-Negro][Rojo y negro]] by MonicaAlejandra55. Este es un fanfic en español. No puedo, realmente no puedo, indicar el impacto que esta historia tuvo sobre mi. Es de las pocas historias de la 3 generación que he leído. Los personajes originales son una locura. DIOS MIO. Y la trama es otro nivel. Sólo que no está acabado. Pero por Dios y por la Virgen leer este fanfic. Por favor.

Recently I read linkao3(the imposter complex by notus_oren) and I've immediately started a reread once getting to the end of what's currently written. I think I'm on read #3 now? So that one definitely has reread potential haha. You notice more things each time and the adventure and advanced magics don't stop being awesome.

*** Everything by monroeslittle is fantastic. Their fics are not crossposted between ffn and ao3 so check out both profiles!

My favorite (and one I've reread a bunch) is linkffn(And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle). I tried it a couple of years ago and it was too dark for me, but I read it last year and now adore it. monroeslittle's works always end with hope and concrete possibilities for the characters. I always finish their fics with a warm, content feeling. :)

linkffn(Just Stay Here Tonight by monroeslittle) is their other HP fic and is also great. Muggle!Lily and another twist.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??
