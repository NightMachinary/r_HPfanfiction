Whenever the news is dropped that the Ministry doesn't really track who exactly casts the spell and that most wards block the Trace anyway, everyone gets so angry about it and goes on rants how it's unfair, and evidence of systemic persecution, and whatnot. /Oh, woe is me, I'm so oppressed!/

No, you annoying smartass! The rule isn't there as a sinister ploy against Muggleborns! It's there because if someone in a magical household accidentally grows antlers on their mom's head, the mom will just reverse it with a flick of her wrist, or if some really bad accident happens, she will have professional help in the house within 10 minutes. If a muggleborn/raised fucks it up with a spell, most chances are they will break the SoS, cause an inter-species war and most likely genocide of one of the parties involved, or, and this is actually best case scenario given what the other options are, kill themselves or their family because they have no clue how to reverse it, give magical first aid, and they can't summon help in time.

Yeah, I know the Ministry is corrupt and a lot of lobby is made in favor of old families, but can we please stop the whining? Not everything in the Potterverse has some perverse agenda behind it.

*** I saw comments here that make the argument that wizards already pretty much rule the world and the only reason for Secrecy is that they find direct rule and involvement in the Muggle world just too much of a hassle and time waste.

I don't really agree, I think it's pretty clear that at least at the time when the Statute was created they considered themselves the inferior group, and not disinterested overlords, but it's an interesting theory.

I agree with what you said, it's so naive to think Muggles could peacefully coexist in the open with a society that makes a type-3 alien civ look backwards. It's way too much of a liability and threat, and I totally understand, from the muggle perspective.

**** Here's the thing.

Wizardry in Harry Potter is so completely, unbelievably over-powered that there is simply no possible way Muggles could win, or even fight, an inter-species war. For better or worse, wizards do rule the world. They can access any world leader with impunity. They have invisibility, mind control, fiendfyre (which cannot be put out by water), memory wiping, literal time travel, etc... There is simply absolutely no reason for an organized society of Harry Potter wizards to be afraid of Muggles. The most devastating weapon Muggles have is the nuclear bomb, but unfortunately for them wizard population centers are not only usually very hard to find, but also very often tend to be located 'within' muggle population centers.

Think about it. If an organized group of wizards spent a day teleporting around the world casting Fiendfyre in every major city, how many people would die before Muggles figured out how to stop supernaturally fast flames that burn through almost anything, actively hunt living things and cannot be put out by water? Look at the wild fires that savaged America and Australia this year, and then imagine that taking place in cities. Think about that one scene in the Deathly Hallows, but its London, or New York, or anywhere - if wizards decided to genocide the muggle race, they could. It wouldn't even be hard. Because they have magic, and in Harry Potter magic is truly awesome, fearsome power.

The X-Men are in their position because they exist in a world where there are other, non-mutant super-powered beings, and because they aren't unified. Wizards are unified, and they are the greatest force in the world. Mutants have to worry about people like Tony Stark, Captain Marvel, or Doctor Strange getting involved if they try and forcibly change the status quo - wizards have no such fear. There is no force above them. The only thing capable of fighting a Wizarding culture is another Wizarding culture.

We can't have our cake and eat it to. We can't have a piece of fiction where magic is this wonderful, incredible, powerful thing, and then also say wizards are afraid of muggles. Because they really should not have to be. There is nothing the Muggle World could possible do to the Wizarding World that wizards could not defeat - the worst Muggles could do is start tracking down and killing young Muggle-Borns; which would be bad, but it wouldn't help them win the war. And even if Muggles started capturing young Muggle-borns and making them fight on the muggle side - magic is an art that takes 7 years to get proficient at; any 'traitors' would get absolutely destroyed by the educated magic users fighting on the wizarding side.

You both even said it yourselves - wizards are a massive threat to muggles. And, more importantly, wizards are a massive threat to muggles that muggles can do precisely nothing about. Wizards are not the ones in danger - not even close; muggles are. The horror here is knowing your neighbor can teleport, read minds, etc... and that if you do anything about it, you would call down the wrath of a civilization whose capabilities you can only imagine.

And what's more, wizards are completely indistinguishable from muggles - I don't think we are ever given any way muggles could use to detect wizards that didn't rely on the wizard themselves using magic. If, for some reason, an adult wizard choose to live among muggles instead of in the Wizarding World, all they would have to do is be discreet and they could pass almost entirely under the radar.

Wizards would dictate the terms of any Open society, not muggles, for all the reasons we have all already detailed.

That's why the Statue of Secrecy seems so weird. It really is a part of canon that is very hard to reconcile with what we have seen of magic. Wizards aren't hiding because they're afraid; they're hiding because they simply have no interest in the Muggle World. It has nothing to offer them. The Statue of Secrecy is there for their convenience, not their protection; it's simply less bother to keep things the way they are.

It is established canon that muggleborn are at least marginalized in wizarding society, having access, in general, to only the lowest positions, so where exactly do those spurned and disillusioned muggleborn go when they cannot get a job they are overqualified for and lack the muggle schooling to re-enter the muggle world properly?

They are captured by Aurors in the act of trying to intentionally break SoS. The well-estabilished purebloods might get off with a fine, but an ostracized muggleborn might lose wand rights - along with memories of WW.

Option two:\\
They are fined, more with each offense. It doesn't mater if they fail - attempting to provide proof would mean magic in a muggle area, attempting a meeting with someone actually important would mean magic in a restricted area. Lack of ability to pay would mean Azkaban. If they could not provide proof, they would be dismissed as LARPers or lunatics and respectively ignored or losked in an asylum.

To avoid this.... Well, the wizarding law enforcement would have to be carrying Idiot Ball 24/7, and while they are not supercompetent, they would be able to handle barely trained schoolchildren (since Hogwarts DADA program is unreliable and there are no dedicated combat classes).

And even if someone managed to do a worldwide broadcast of magic existing, with evidence, and not be dismissed...

****** Hermione eventually becomes Minister of Magic (if we're taking stuff Rowling said after the series ended as canon), so that problem probably got a lot better.

As to where muggleborns went before Granger hopefully made things better - they probably stay in the Wizarding World. They can't use their magic to make money in the Muggle World (unless they want to go to Azkaban), and they most likely have very few non-familial ties or contacts there anyways. Most of them would work low-tier or service jobs, and a token few (like Hermione) would manage to ascend by virtue of truly being the best of the best of the best.

African Americans faced similar or worse discrimination in the Jim Crow South (Voldemort's reign was a particular bad time, but it was short-lived, and Hermione was permitted to attend the same school as pure-bloods), and yet significant numbers of them stayed put and found work (I think even to this day the South is where most of America's black population lives).

I don't think Muggleborn Discrimination in the Wizarding World is even as bad as what I described above (because, again, Hermione was allowed to go to Hogwarts), but even if it was, most muggleborns still probably wouldn't leave. From history we know the emotional ties of home are enough to keep many people in place, even when faced with oppression and knowing of better opportunities elsewhere. Add magic into equation, and make the Wizarding World the only place they can legally practice their magic openly? No one is going anywhere.

Though I would assume that many Muggleborns simply immigrate to Wizarding France, or Wizarding Germany, or most likely Wizarding America, or wherever the political/cultural climate is more accepting of them.

******* Quick note: I would counter that most Black Americans faced greater obstacles to migrating north than what Muggleborns would have theoretically faced by leaving Wizarding Britain. I think at best no one in Wizarding Britain would have particularly cared about Muggleborns emigrating, and at worst actively encouraged it. Plus, you'd probably see a random distribution of wealth among Muggleborns, so having the means to leave wouldn't be a barrier. And in general, they could always "disappear" back into the Muggle world long enough to get on a plane.

In contrast, from say about the 1870s to 1930, Black Americans were still largely impoverished due to the legacy of slavery. While there were some gains during Reconstruction, the 1870 Compromise ended it, and with that came a white backlash that erased so much of that and began to install Jim Crow. Those same riots and massacres would also regularly erase what economic strides black communities did make until at least the 60s. So you have a group of mostly poor people, who are often treated as less than and heavily surveilled and exploited. This is backed by laws in many cases, so if any of them make too much noise about it you can just imprison them and use them for labor then. Yeah, you still had the Great Migration, but that usually would have been one or two people headed north. If other family members came, it might've been over the course of a decade or so to put together the resources, since you might have had convict leasing and/or sharecropping to contend with. And that's if they wanted to go north, as white northerners didn't want them there either. Even up north, there was still discrimination for housing and jobs, still heavy surveillance by police and "concerned citizens". Two different populations and contexts, in my opinion.

***** Plus the idea of muggles trying to teach those kidnapped/turncoats muggleborns magic in order of having them be able to do anything at all is frankly laughable. Wizards have the abilities of teleporting, changing matter, creating more space inside a room, multiple instances of interacting with souls... and all this powers are liable to be casted spontaneously at random in high-stress situations, like being told to do something you are not able to by a band of inpatient (there is a war happening after all) scientists on an attempt to send you off to fight in a war. And the surrounding muggles would be utterly defenseless when the stress eventually lead to the complete annihilation of everything unlucky enough to be in the muggleborn's general surrounding.

****** No, but here's the thing. Arthur Weasley is never actually around muggles, ever. He spends the vast majority of his life in Wizarding Areas muggles have absolutely no chance of accessing. In a war situation the only wizards that are going to be interacting with muggles are trained fighters, while all the Arthur Weasley's stay at home.

Aside from that your main point is correct - the average wizard could just get shot in the head and die. But that changes absolutely nothing about the relative strengths of Muggle and Wizarding Cultures. If, in an open society, a muggle bigot killed the rare 'exposed' guillible wizard they would instantly call down the attention of the Ministry, who would almost instantly solve the crime (since they have access to things like mind reading, time travel, invisibility, etc...). No Muggle criminal would ever escape the Ministry, making most hate crimes almost suicidal - especially since the Minstry is likely to just chuck the criminal in Azkaban and just throw away the key.

A single muggle could deal with a single wizard, given enough prep time. But the Muggle World cannot deal with the Wizarding World, and that's what really matters.

I'd say nuclear weapons are a no-go, since many wizarding populatoin centers are 'within' muggle ones (e.g magical New York City is just in New York, Magical London is within London, etc...). Muggles would have to nuke themselves to get at the wizards.

Yes muggles can't overthrow wizards, yes in a situation where muggles attempt to hunt wizards more often than not they will end up killing other muggles and not getting anywhere near wizards, no way in hell could wizards keep control of things tho and many many wizards will die which with such a little population is just not worth it. It's like arguing tigers will never overthrow humans so let me jump in the cage and see what happens.

******** Here's the thing - how would wizards die? How would muggles find wizards to kill? I dont understand that point of your argumrnt; the average wizard would not have to interact with muggles, even if wizards ruled the world. And I'd argue wizards could easily keep control of things, because they have wards. In particular they have wards that specifically repel muggles. They could surround any muggle population centre with invisible walls that repel muggles and call it a day. They could surround their own home with anti muggle wards. They can make their own dwellings invisible and unfindable, etc... even if wizards openly ruled the world, it would be almost impossible for the average muggle to find a wizard, unless that wizard wanted to be found. Magic is just that Capital-A Awesome in Harry Potter.

And secondly - yes there are many muggles, but you are not considering the incredible ability wizards have to murder muggles. Fiendfyre cannot be put out by mundane water of any kind, spreads supernaturally quickly, and actively hunts living things. Think about the wildfires that ravaged the US and Australia this year. If one day organized wizards decided to cast that spell in every major muggle city, then by sundown all of those cities would be ash and billions would be dead and there would be absolutely nothing the muggles could do about it.

Your bottom paragraph is my exact point - I'm saying that if a united Wizarding world wanted to rule the world they could, because they could easily cull muggles by the billions. The only chance muggles would have would be if some wizards decided to defend them; muggles would have no chance without significant Wizarding help. It's like arguing that dogs cant overthrow humans and jumping into a pit full of rabid dogs - only I'm holding an AK-47. Sure it wont be easy, but if I know how to use that gun, and I act in a coordinated, organized fashion my allies, many of home can shoot dogs from outside the pit, and I overcome any defectors that start helping the dogs, then eventually I will control that pit. It won't be easy, but it could be done without many losses on my side if done smart, considering the massive advantage I have over dogs (all of Technology, the ability to leave and re-enter the pit at will, etc...)

But either way, I think we can now agree on my main point; the Statute of Secrecy is not there because wizards are afraid of muggles. I'd argue its actualy around because, for wizards, secrecy makes controlling the world much easier. Why start a war to conquer territory you more or less already control?

******* The premier and only British school for Wizards is according to JK around a 1000 students. The Quidditch world cup was in the low 100,000. Quite frankly 10 million is on the upper end of how many wizards there might be.

edit: googling for the amount of wizards in the world cup i found this old reddit comment:

"The exact number of students at Hogwarts isn't known, but it's somewhere between 300 and 1000. This is spread out over seven years of school, so the total number of new students admitted to Hogwarts per year is 40 to 140. The life expectancy of a wizard is 140 years (much higher than for a Muggle), so the number of people in Britain who attended Hogwarts at any given moment is about ten to twenty thousand. All wizards and witches (down to the Muggleborns) in Britain at least have the opportunity to attend Hogwarts, and though there are presumably some who are home-schooled by tutors, they must be a minority. Even children of powerful families like the Malfoys and the Blacks attend Hogwarts, so it's clearly the best around. So let's assume that there are 10,000 witches and wizards in Britain.

The population of Great Britain is about 60 million, so this suggests that one to two people in every 6,000 is a wizard or witch. Putting the world magical population at about one million people, assuming Magical Britain is representative of the rest of the world.

But this is clearly an underestimate, since there were 100,000 people at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Final, and I doubt that a full 10% of the population are Quidditch fans. Granted, not everyone in attendance was human, so the leprechauns and goblins could be pushing the numbers up a bit. And the ready availability of Portkeys combined with the lack of a magical analogue to television means that attending in person is the best way for fans to see the game. Still, it's an oddity."

So yeah 10 million is way on the upper end of wizard population.

******** This is pretty reasonable overall, but it is important to remember that the Hogwarts population is the aftermath of years of war, which would have dramatically decreased the school-age wizarding population, meaning that it's likely not overly accurate to the whole population.

The 100,000 people at the Quidditch world cup final are only wizards and witches (/"A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats"/ - Goblet of Fire), and with what we know about the relationship between wizards and other magical beings, it's hard to say that there would be many goblins or similar in attendance.

Even so, this is actually a ridiculous amount for a sporting event at the time. The 1994 Football world cup final only had 94,194 attendees (according to wikipedia), and that particular world cup still holds the record for most overall attendees at a world cup. In fact, the biggest Football stadium in the world right now */barely/* has the capacity for 100,000 people.

Edit: Also, the population of Great Britain is 60 million according to muggles, but why would a witch or wizard take part in a census?

***** Fiendfire doesn't mean wizards win, it just means Mutually Assured Destruction.

It only takes one muggle-loving wizard (or more likely, maligned squib) to defect and provide everyone with common wizard locations, and then the muggle military can respond with "muggle fiendfire". I seriously doubt Hogwarts could survive a nuke. I doubt the Ministry could survive a bunker-buster.

You could say " wizards have a way to counter muggle weapons", but 1) that's an ass-pull and 2) that goes both ways - fire extinguishers aren't filled with water these days, and the moment muggles learn what fiendfire is, they'll start experimenting and find solutions the wizards didn't think of. Also, maybe they'll figure out how to transport it to Diagon Alley.

Avada kedavra isn't much better than a bolt action rifle, and could potentially be blocked by wearing a suit made to carry live kittens to intercept the AK. Or by using cover.

An awful lot of wizards are (IIRC) incompetent, and the bubble-head charm is a 6th year spell whereas mustard gas can be mass-produced and dropped on the unwary and sleeping.

But the strongest argument is probably adult muggleborns - the wizarding world is /not/ unified, and I would expect a lot of muggleborns to have retained ties to their family. If you say that there's some sort of magical anti-explosion war, a muggleborns could probably sneak a nuke through that and activate it on a timer before leaving. A muggleborn could probably rig up a wizard-detector (since muggle-repelling magic shows that magic can distinguish between the two), and could provide labs with examples of everything that muggles need to find a counter for.

As for nukes- there's absolutely no reason why wizards wouldnt already have the highest levels of muggle leadership under mind control the moment the War starts. Theres no reason wizards shouldn't be able to find, target and destroy every nuke cache in the world before the real fighting even starts - Harry Potter magic is seriously, crazily overpowered. We're talking about a culture sitch access to casual mind control and casual time travel after all. And there actually arent that many all wizard locations that can be nuked; for example the Ministry is hidden within London and cannot be targeted that way.

Also fiendfyre isn't mutually assured destruction because apparently it can be controlled by its caster- Crabb/Goyle simply wasnt talented enough to do anything but summon it. By the time muggles learn how to counter it (if it can be countered without magic) it's too late - every major city is already ash. Australia couldn't counter ordinary wildfires quickly enough to save much of its forests; the kind of attack I'm talking about would be much more devastating. Because wizards have a massive advantage- time. Time to study the muggle world and then strike with maximal efficiency when and where they choose - and from what we've seen of magic it would be trivial for them to gather an incredible amount of sensitive information about the muggle world. They already have easy access to world leaders (or at least the British ministry has easy, casual access to the PM).

Also is we're going with canon incompetent wizards then we also have to go with canon incompetent muggles, because honestly from the brief glimpses we get normal people dont seem anymore rational then wizards in Harry Potter. (Though I agree, hp wizards are incompetent: as far as I'm concerned their culture should have collapsed ages ago, but that's a different story). United, canon Irrational wizards would curb stomp canon irrational muggles. United, rational wizards absolutely curb stomp even rational muggles. It's hard to shoot someone who is invisible, and can teleport. Anti muggle wards means that no soldier will ever find a Wizarding base. Magic is seriously overpowered in Harry Potter - any faction using it in an intelligent way is almost guaranteed an easy victory

And here's the thing - magic is an art and a science in Harry Potter (we do hear about magical research) and muggleborns are a tiny fraction of the population. Any muggleborn that defected would only be capable of taking a fraction of the magical lore the Wizarding world has with them. Any new muggleborns born would not have access to Hogwarts (or it's new equivalent) training. The wider wizard world would have a much wider magical talent/knowledge pool to draw on, and that could make a serious difference. If its muggleborns and muggles vs United wizards, I'd still give it to wizards; having more wizards is vital in a conflict like this. But I agree that muggles would have much better chances if wizards started defecting.

But anyways, my main points are about how a United wizard world would curb stomp muggles. I'm sure we can all agree that muggles would lose instantly if they dont get any Wizarding help, even if we do let both sides act rationally.

**** I don't really like it when fanfiction tries to excuse the Unforgivables or tries to invent somewhat morally good excuses for their use. The whole point of the Unforgivables is that in order to cast them you have to have the very worst of intentions. The person who is effectively casting the curses should not have any good intentions, rather they should be wanting to control, to torture and to unfairly rob a person of their life. There are many other magical avenues that could be used to treat people or give them a merciful death.

It feels like authors believe that the ministry is so corrupt that a lot of their regulations are arbitrary or unwarranted and so try to justify all ministry-banned magic, despite the fact that we know that magic can be despicably evil (horcruxes, unicorn blood forcibly taken).

*** Absolutely. After all, it's only systematic discrimination if they say it in the law. There's absolutely no way to construct a law that just so happens to harm minorities as a side effect. Nothing like that has ever happened before. Poll tax, anyone?

Let's abandon pretence here. The magical government is an oligarchy that regularly tosses people into torture chambers without a trial. It's controlled by a group that at least tacitly views nonmagical people as lesser. After all, the person in charge of analyzing muggle technology doesn't know how to pronounce electricity. There are some rather fun parallels between Arthur Weasley and all the people who think of those quaint savages making do without proper civilization.

They mindwipe people for the crime of being in a place they want to be. The camp owner in book 4 wasn't doing anything, and they almost liquified his brain. The magical community shows an appalling lack of respect for those they view as lesser, and that's before getting into their slavery apologia that is almost word-for-word lifted from the Confederacy. Governments have been oppressing minorities for centuries, and the Ministry regularly demonstrates that they're a bunch of racist bastards. I can totally believe they wrote a law claiming it's to protect people while actually persecuting minority groups.

**** A governing system that tries to sell the idea of being run by the people and preserving justice while actually being governed by a small elite and discriminating against groups of people deemed to be inferior by the elite, wow... you just described pretty much all governments since the beginning of the modern age! Let's be honest here, be it by ethnic reasons, nationally, religion, income, or some made-up reason that only makes a lick of sense in the head of the prejudiced parts, it is almost assured that any government that we see will marginalize part of their population. Trump outright said many times about his hate for latins during his campaign, most countries in Europe adopted pretty restrictive measure regarding refugees, Ruanda's war speak by itself, as do the /many/ ethnic-targeted slaughters that happened since the second war, including the Bosnia war-Is it enough or do I have to start talking about the many, many, /many/ massacres funded by either the church or the European nobility, most notably the ones set against the native population of colonized countries to say nothing about the further genocides that were started even after the independence by the countries' own population? Native-Americans anyone, does this ring any bells?

Compared to many of those atrocities and the blatant discrimination that is currently happening all around the world I dare say that muggleborn 14 YO not being able to use their abilities of breaking reality without supervision in a place surrounded by people for whom said abilities are supposed to be a secret for two months of a total of twelve really do not have much room to complain because, no matter how you turn it, the muggle world is really no better. Hell, the only kind of prejudice we actually see in the magical world is the blood-purist one (and let's be honest, we find this kind of assholes anywhere), multiple women and people of color got into high-positions inside the government without a second thought in a time where most of the muggle world would be rioting against it -I say this as the ashamed citizen of a country where our first female president was impeached for a minor fiscal crime that no one really cares while our following two male presidents were both caught multiple times actively practicing corruption and getting not even an investigation, our current president is suspect of having had a political opponent killed and having a hand in sending one of the other candidates to prison based in speculations just before the elections and there is no investigation at all- (Amelia Bones - Director of the DMLE, Mafalda Hopkirk -head of the Improper Use of Magic Office, the president of the MACUSA, Kingley - first Head Auror and then interim minister...).

Plus, let's give poor Arthur a break? Electricity is really not that big a part of his life, by all accounts most, if not all, the enchanted objects he has to deal with are non-electric in nature since magic supposedly screws electronics, also, we are talking about someone who would be working in 1980 - so before the technological revolution made technology an absolute in our world - who probably had muggle studies at least 20 years earlier and lives in a world that has no use at all for electricity. He getting a word wrong doesn't mean he is dumber than a brick.

We are never really outright told by JKR (at least I don't think so) if the obliviate spell has any collateral effects at all when properly cast even repeatedly -Lockhart doesn't count, he was using a broken wand and was an idiot - so we have no way of knowing if they are actually attacking people when using the spell or just protecting their secret.

The way JKR portrayed house-elf's though is definitely slavery and there are no excuses, yeah, there is slavery (illegally) happening in the real world, but it is at least outlawed and not in a /school/ of all places.

If I was going to an optometrist and he said he knew nothing about how to execute advanced heart-surgery I wouldn't care, even less if it were the country's top expert in optometry, Arthur's job was to keep enchanted objects away from muggles, not be their go-to guy to explain about muggle things (I am not sure, but I think there was an office dedicated to making “muggle-worthy” excuses for magic in the department of magical accident and catastrophes, /those/ are the ones who need to know about electricity).

******* Unfortunately, InfernoItaliano, you're placing your head cannon into JKR's universe. Its expressly stated, by Ron, in Harry Potter that the children all start off on the same foot. That students from magical families don't perform any better or worse than muggleborns. *All children* do not have the right to use magic. Can certain children get away with it better? Certainly. But plenty of people have an advantage to breaking the law and not getting caught. That doesn't make the law oppressive. If I can commit a murder and get away with it easier than others because of my social status, monetary influence or intelligence does that make murder ok for everyone? No. Does that make the law against murder oppressive, certainly not. In JKR's world, the adults follow the law and dont allow children to use magic.

Now, to address the elephant. This is the common misconception. The trace detects magic around children. It notifies the ministry of the place, the spell and the time. That's all it does. Any child, magical or muggleborn will get pinged when magic happens. The ministry only cares about two things. Was it in a muggle zone and is there a magical adult nearby, because it is assumed that the magic is always being done by the adult. You can see many instances of this. Hagrid giving Harry his letter (in this, Dumbledore has given Hagrid a special dispensation to practice magic). Arthur getting Harry from the Dursley's in CoS. Magic happening all around Harry at the quidditch world cup. The pissloads of magic used in the Department of Mystery. Magic when the Order of the Phoenix pulls Harry from the Dursleys in OotP. Magic constantly happens around underage children, but there are only three instances where Harry gets in trouble. Dobby's levitation, when he blows up his aunt, and the dementor attack. All of which happen when a magical adult is not nearby and in a muggle zone.

We do not know how the ministry knows that an adult wizard is nearby, but its clear that they do know. This was a slight oversight by JKR when she had Moody explain the trace, or maybe it wasn't. I am certain it is a well guarded secret from children as to how the trace works to prevent children from doing stupid things. But its very clear that the trace is ignored the same for muggleborns and, halfbloods and purebloods. The latter simply live in a situation where its easier to get away with it.

Yeah. To a sane and rational point that doesn't restrict freedoms unnecessarily. Which really feels to me what the law is currently doing.

There is an objective and fundamental danger to underage wizards who don't have magical adult supervision when they practice magic. This is an undeniable fact. It's not "oppression for the sake of making purebloods better at magic" its "oppression to literally prevent children from accidentally killing themselves/others by doing magic they don't fully understand".

Restricting magical children with magical adult supervision from casting spells is just detrimental, with no positive effects whatsoever. Should they do so just out of fairness? (mind you, the schools literally do that too. It's just that unlike with muggleborns there is no way to track them doing it)

************** Well, right off the bat, denying criminals the right to vote incentivizes politicians to criminalize behaviours and practices that are commonly performed by people who generally don't vote for that politician.

But that's an entirely different discussion from what I'm trying to get at. Fundamentally, oppression is definitionally the /unjust/ treatment of people by authorities/governments. Prison and the restrictions of rights of people who have performed crimes against people/society is the application of justice and definitionally not oppression.

You seem to have this bizarre idea that oppression is literally any restriction of rights to any individual. That's not what oppression is. Oppression is never necessary because by definition an unfair act performed without a just cause.

Both of your examples (kids not voting and locking up criminals) have a just and reasonable cause to do so and therefore aren't oppression.

It is in principal not discrimination; All children, regardless of blood status are not allowed to use magic around muggles. Its a violation of the secrecy act, and they trace all underage wizards again without any discretion of their blood status. That in practice the trace does not distinguish between who casts the magic is a fault of the trace, not the reasoning behind the law.

It is in practice negatively affecting muggleborns but not purebloods, (and even just assuming this isn't an unfortunate restriction of the trace but assuming it's very deliberately targeting muggleborns, for which there is no canon evidence for) but for good reason; Muggleborns practicing magic are a danger. To themselves and others. As a million others have pointed out; a wizarding child with a spell gone wrong has access to help much much faster than a muggleborn child. Their parents will likely be able to fix it themselves. A muggleborn will need to get a adult wizards attention somehow; and thats of course assuming they havent incapacitated themselves magically and must now hope the muggles nearby can somehow treat his magical condition. They can go to diagon alley to practice magic same as pureblood children can.

Ah yes, magical children are never left unsupervised, and why all magical adults are 100% capable of resolving potential issues caused by magical accidents. And all wizards live entirely separated from muggles, it's not like someone would build a wizarding home on the same street as a row of muggle houses or anything. And of course, the law makes it only illegal for kids to perform magic without competent adult supervision in a manner that would uphold the statue of secrecy, so these things will never be a problem.

They are objectively left unsupervised by magical adults far far far less often than muggleborn children are left unsupervised by magical adults. Screeching about how on occasion this law doesn't fully protect children as it wants to isn't a downside of the law. Not to mention in that case the trace works perfectly fine, since there is no adult wizard nearby and the MoM will be on the way shortly to help the magical child.

In canon, with one or two exceptions this is absolutely the case. Not to mention, again the fact that the law isn't literally perfect doesn't change the fact that it helps. And again, the trace won't even function in those cases where there is a wizarding house nearby; they'll think the adult wizard cast it and the muggleborn is perfectly capable of practicing whatever magic he/she wants.

Is there a legitimate interest in doing so which justifies that discrimination? Also yes - the protection of children is considered sufficiently important that it justifies sex discrimination.

Muggleborns don't have that chance, just because they are Muggleborn. The rule may not be intentionally oppressive, but it is de facto oppressive.

So we need mitigations, to level the playing field. These mitigations can come in various forms (simply removing the restriction (if the Muggleborn's parent are around), opening acessible "wizarding playgrounds" where the rules don't apply, stipends, ...).

But if you want a truly fair society, there needs to be some form of mitigation.

You'd get a lot more Fred and George Weasley's I think, or more Severus Snape's. Find a way to connect them to some capital to get supplies and to distribute whatever they create if they want. And that can easily be the launching pad for full blown community centers.

Problem with creating "wizarding playgrounds" is that they need adult supervision 24/7 add that if you spread them across the UK, its going to cost some money to run them. Having magical parents is a inherent advantage that the world has, as is it if you want to study physics and one or both of your parents are working in that field. If you add in the fact that muggle parents are around, it still dosent take away the risk and actually icreases it where more than one person can get hurt without proper help, magical parents has the experience to fix magical mistakes and heal their children, muggle parents dosen't.

Third, any muggleborn would have the right by going into wizarding areas where there will be many adult magicals to fix anything they may break while experimenting.

The Statute by itself seems to be a great limitation for all magical's freedom. The muggleborns are those who are right in the middle of those who they are keeping the secret /from/, so some limitations have to be applied to guarantee /everyone's/ safety (Arianna suffered - probably as an obscurus - the rest of her life because of the muggles seeing her doing magic; if the ministry hadn't gotten there Marge Dursley would float around until she died from either the cold or of thirsty; a long-scale revel would potentially start a war that -regardless of either of our stances on the matter- would have an enormous amount of deaths).

** Huh, it doesn't happen often but I 100% disagree with this take. You've seemed to fall into the normal pattern of criticizing the extreme view of something while taking the exact opposite extreme view.

If I was a muggleborn student I would absolutely think it unfair that my peers could practice and learn at home. Regardless of the reason, whether it was part of a vast conspiracy or not, the facts are that they've set up a disproportionately unfair system and have made no effort to make an accommodation for those that want to practice magic. That seems like exactly the sort of thing that a story focused on The Wizarding Word's policies being backward and discriminatory would address

** The problem is that the HP universe just assumes secrecy would work with Muggle parents keeping quiet because... they were told? Imagine your magical kid comes for the holidays with stories about a recent war were a stupidly overpowered Dark wizard wanted to kill all Muggleborn wizards and their families. And he was winning, has still powerful supporters and is rummored to be alive, somehow. They'd run to the Government for help. Then there's Christian parents who play along when first receiving their Hogwarts letter out of fear, but eventually expose "demonic" witches, oportunists looking for fame and people who simply can't keep a secret.

Even the PM is told by the Minister of Magic and he does nothing. The existence of magic implies the possibility that it can be used by rival nations. Imagine Chinese wizards are on governement payroll. These are people who can apparate, become near invisible, block bullets, read and control minds, forge objects easily, impersonate others... The ultimate secret agent for industrial espionage or worse. It would be enough to alarm the government into making MI5 study and specially control all magical beings and resources. Hell, the Goblins would be happy to be on the Muggle Government payroll providing warding to critical facilities, intel about wizarding weak points or as bodyguards, for the right price. Revenge on past treaties forced on them by their enemies and profit, what is not to like? Sir Humphrey: "Yes, Prime Minister, wizards are a notoriously distrustful lot, arrogant and stuck in their Victorian ways, but I believe we have found powerful allies among their banking elites. Oppressed bankers, fancy that. Anyway, these gobling are very resourceful and their Galleon prices very reasonable".

Same if parents go to the goverment, seeing as how they have zero authority on the magical world, they probably risk their kids future aswell as their own memory of their child. Plus if they go to the goverment for help, the wizards has been shown to be able to infiltrate the office of the highest ranking officials in the UK with impunity and pepole not suspecting them.

China is wierd as a nation, im just headcanoning that the wizards from China either fled to Taiwan when the ciwil war ended or they simply withdrew into enclaves where the muggle goverment can't find them. And if the gov starts to investigate, the wizards has the capacity to end the "muggle treat" easily enough, they live on the good graces of the wizards

*** Or goblins can be even more racist and hateful against muggles than wizards (the Statute was only created on the seventieth century if I am not mistaken, for the most part of history muggles would be right along Wizards warring the goblins), plus, how much difference /could/ they actually make? They were defeated in all uprising, the only magic we see them doing are on the protection on the vaults in the bank, their weapons would be no use against someone who can use fiendfyre and send curses and/or transfigurations long-range (reason why we don't see swords or arrows used for battles), three average seventeen years managed to not only get inside their most guarded facilities, but also steal something highly protected /and/ a *FREAKING DRAGON*, and then flee without a scratch while causing massive damage to the goblins (I refuse to believe no one died when the dragon bust through the lobby.

Other than that, you are assuming that goblins would have any use or even /recognize/ paper money as currency, most of the things they would want to buy would be magical in nature, hence making pounds useless. And there is also the possibility that the muggle government will take an /even more racist/ view on a specie that isn't even human at all since they wouldn't be accustomed with it since their childhood, chances are that the goblins would be even higher in the government's “Kill it! Kill It With Fire!” List than wizards.

Though I completely agree that there should be greater consequences to telling the muggle parents, either a scenario that puts much more people “in the know” as you proposed or some very gruesome threats (maybe accompanied by a dementor for show) plus proof that they can and /are/ watching the parent.

The question about if muggles would be able to even plan anything against magicals (the minister was accompanied by aurors, there shouldn't be much problems in having one be a legilimens tasked with reading the PM mind to see if anyone opened the mouth or if there are any military concerns to be aware of, a quick imperius if the answer is yes, followed by a “random government-sponsored relocation of every magical in London and before you know it the PM sadly went crazy and dropped a nuke in the city, what a shame that everyone who was told about magic was called for a meeting at the same time! What a coincidence, wouldn't you say? Eh, life moves on I guess) is one that has more to do with personal interpretations about power-gaps, we could talk about it for years and not come to an agreement.

**** You are forgetting one factor: Profit. Sterling is still money, it can buy gold, goblins can be paid in bullion. No banker is that racist that they turn down a profit. And Muggles are ill prepared against a surprise Pure Blood uprising, which at the time of HP was either likely or imminent. Maybe strong wards in critical buildings? Knowledge of wizarding spells, potions, weapons, mentality? Bodyguards for the PM, as I mentioned, so no legilimens, maybe even ways to detect magic and see wizards. Location of every Pure Blood manor, Hogwarts, Diagon Alley? "Mr. Malfoy, your Death Eaters attack the Muggle government, we obliterate your families and states with low grade nukes and chemical weapons. Our goblin associates have already frozen your vaults." Even in wizards are more powerful, well informed, well prepared Moggles would be better prepared still. Intel that critical is worth paying. And Goblins don't have beef with non magical, but countering the power balance against their enemies would be useful and satisfying. Maybe even earn legal protection? Governments are always practical before they are racist. And wizards would be more feared than goblins because they can pass for muggles and are more powerful. So, the enemy of my enemy etc.

***** You are assuming again that the goblins actually /can/ make a difference and that they wouldn't ask for the amount of gold needed to found a small country in exchange (by your account they are the only ones able and capable of providing a service that muggles would find essential (offer x demand). Goblins don't have wands and are only shown to be able to operate the objects they themselves make, any guards would need to be humans, potentially also the ones to cast the protective spells, we definitely have no indication that muggles can use enchanted items or that said items could be used to track wizards (as far as we know there is only the trace that belongs to the ministry), if they froze resources without the ministry permission then I am sure that a bunch of aurors and DE would be able to do /much/ more damage than three seventh years or Quirrel (Fiendfyre may just become their new best friend), no way of even a bodyguard blocking a ligilimens attack on another, wards definitely didn't stop Voldemort before, no idea what good they would actually do the muggles. The ministry supposedly already provides ‘/bodyguards/' that can hit the PM with an imperius if he thinks about contracting the goblins, the nukes would definitely affect the muggles too, they are simply the ones with more population density, they could either evacuate the people around the targets tipping their hands or let them die, this /if/ there are no magical countermeasures against nukes.

The price they would ask even /if/ they were willing would be sure to be outright abusive, they have no reason to not abuse the hell out of the situation, this is the rational choice. I think you deeply underestimate the power of racism, just ask Trump.

** Wizards are just humans with extra abilities, abilities that they're trained to use through a wand and for the most part are pretty much incapable of doing without the wand. Thus their only security is through obscurity. After all, it doesn't matter if they can protect themselves from all but the most destructive weapons if they have no idea an attack is coming. And with squibs being able to see through most of the magical protections that protect wizarding locations, laser and radio-based targeting, and sniper rifles, the wizarding world doesn't have much hope of survival due to the sheer quantity of non-wizards out there.

Yes, they could do significant damage to the non-magical world, but it would need to be heavily coordinated otherwise they just reveal how dangerous they are to a numerically superior foe who can go scorched earth if they need to and still have enough numbers and infrastructure to survive.

Oh, and the whole not nuking London also applies to wizards, as the main reason for using large muggle communities to hide in is also a good reason not to use fiendfyre in those communities.

** What do we know about the statute of secrecy?

We know that the Salem Witch Trials of the late 1600s were the catalyst. This means that Muggles were /successful/ in locating, prosecuting and killing Wizards and witches in that time.

We also know that British Wizardingkind approached the British Monarchy asking for protection under Muggle law, and they were refused. British Wizardingkind feared the persecution that was happening in America, and when they approached their Muggle counterparts for protection, they were rebuffed.

The statute of secrecy was formed because Wizards and witches found themselves in a position of weakness, not a position of strength. If Wizards and witches were truly as powerful as they are painted in other replies in this post, the Salem Witch Trials would have been nipped in the bud.

Great Britain didn't even have a central government organized under a Ministry for Magic until after the ICW adopted the statute of secrecy, and called upon each nation's Wizarding population to govern themselves.

In short, Wizarding kind was disorganized and the Muggles were /winning/ in a conflict against them, and had scared them so badly that they decided to go to ground. Why?

Fear is a factor, of course, but also the Muggles have overwhelmingly Superior numbers. This fact cannot be ignored. Even in the time of the Salem Witch Trials, Muggles were successfully persecuting and murdering wizards and witches.

Another factor is that most Wizards and witches would be unwilling or incapable of the extremely inhumane and horrible acts they would have to perform to bring the Muggles to heel. The overwhelming majority of wizards and witches are still Human, after all, and wouldn't dream of enslaving Muggles or committing genocide against them. This inhumanity is Voldemort's standout and it's one of the things that makes him so different from his kind - he gladly engages in the sort of murder, mind control and bloodshed that most Wizards and witches would find abhorrent.

So we know that Muggles were successfully persecuting and murdering Wizards and witches 300 years ago. Fast forward to the technology of today and the statute of secrecy is literally the only thing keeping Wizards and witches alive. Every occurrence of muggle-born accidental magic is a potential death sentence and the ministry of magic is extra Vigilant in non-magical areas.

As for the muggle-born Wizards and witches who find their options limited, I still think all of them would rather remain magical then give up their wands and be obliviated just because they couldn't find a job. Even the magical equivalent of flipping burgers is still magical.

So yeah, anytime I read a story that is focused on doing away with the Statue of secrecy I exit out.

** I mean, the loophole itself is a fanfic invention. It's pretty explicitly stated in HPDH that the trace is on the individual wizard (admittedly, it's possible that CoS contradicts this but that could be put down to government incompetence more than anything, which is a theme of the books anyway...) But anyway, even in the canon world where you can trace the individual, it's not above belief that the likes of the Malfoys have ways around it, or at least a way of getting out of trouble about it. If Draco did magic out of school, Lucius could smooth that over. If Ron did magic out of school, Arthur has no such influence. Go figure. And that's, sadly, realistic. People with money and power will always be able to bend the laws. And yes, that is unfair. It's literally the definition of oppression and an unequal society.

It's nothing to do with the SoS, really. A Muggle born kid doing magic at home isn't breaking the Statute. Their family already know they're magical because they go to Hogwarts. And if a Muggle born fucks up a spell, that's what the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad and the Obliviators do, they fix it. A Muggle born kid accidentally giving their dad green hair is not going to start a war. The whole reasoning behind the underage magic rule is, basically, pretty similar to the irl laws around underage drinking. Magic, like alcohol, is fine if you know what you're doing and what your limits are. A fourteen year old kid probably doesn't know that, in terms of either booze or magic.

So, to go back to your point - yes, it's oppressive. Not because it /doesn't apply/ to pure blood families - it clearly does apply. But because, as is proven in canon and indeed in life, those with money and power get away with murder and those who have none, do not. Under the canon system, Ron is as oppressed by this (due to his class) as Hermione and Harry are (due to their living situation/blood status).
