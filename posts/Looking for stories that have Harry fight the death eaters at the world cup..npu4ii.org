I thought it'd be cool if Harry sees that family in the air and can't just run away and leave people in danger so he fights the death eaters.

Thanks.

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?
