You know, it occurs to me, even without Hermione having the page about basilisks in her hand, Harry, Ron, and the rest of the school were on the verge of exposing the basilisk for what it was; Harry & Ron already planned to talk to Myrtle about how she died, they had the clues that the spiders had fled and the roosters were preemptively slaughtered, and whether by talking to Myrtle or the students being revived by mandrake, they were about to learn about the deadly gaze and (potentially) that it was some kind of giant snake. And of course, the legend of the Chamber of Secrets itself to go with.

But what if they didn't have those clues? What if possessed-Ginny didn't paint the 'enemies of the heir, beware' sign? What if the victims were preemptively stunned, or obliviated post-petrification, or just killed outright, to prevent them identifying their attacker? What if Myrtle was silenced as well? What if the killing of the roosters was concealed amongst a wave of vandalism of the grounds and greenhouses? And if they just plain missed the significance of fleeing spiders? And, what if the mandrakes were preemptively destroyed before the attacks?

In short, what happens if Hogwarts IS forced to close for lack of being able to identify the attacker/killer or stop the destruction?


** linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) is somewhat related, in that Hogwarts is closed down. However, that's after the basilisk is discovered and defeated.

*** Read it, liked it. But then I like pretty much everything by White Squirrel.

...Is it just me, or does Petrification Proliferation get recommended a lot?

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** There is a fic where Hogwarts closes and all the students go to WaxWings which is a more modern, mugglesque academy but I can't recall it.

** My fic has Hogwarts closing down after a massacre happened and a load of people die linkffn(11950816). Another writer who has helped me with my fic has also explored the possibility in his story linkffn(11265467).

*Edit: He is a much better writer than I am, so you might want to read his story first. His story is Petrifaction Proliferation.*

  YEAR ONE COMPLETE! Harry often wondered how he was supposed to raise a baby Phoenix, live life as a game, learn magic, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, and dodge political manipulations all while trying to make it through Hogwarts alive.
