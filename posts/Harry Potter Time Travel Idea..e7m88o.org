** Rather bland and generic. Why black? Why not something else, rosier? Selwyn and what not? Why slytherin? Why not hufflepuff? Why not reincarnation? Instead of coasting previous experience, how about he has to learn everything starting from walking and so forth. After all, human brain reaches maturity around 20-25 years of age and mature brain does not fit in a baby skull. No matter how mature he thinks he is, childs physiology limits him, he needs naps etc. So no obnoxious little twerp that thinks he comes as a genius and prodigy instead of possessed demon child? How about having vague memories in his previous life? Learning to somewhat trust those memories he has deeply rooted distrust for dumbledore & co.

*** The Black are an influential family. He could decide because it reminds him of Sirius. And during Harry's stay at Sirius's place. He already has some knowledge of the Black family. So he would decided with something he already knows of.

The coordination and implementation of Reincarnation puts me off tbh. I find it unrealistic.

I also don't like having an powerful character from start, but as I said.. because of the de-aging caused by the time Turner he will have to remaster his skills again. He has knowledge of them but can't outright perform them.

Why Slytherin? It is where most of the death eaters come from. In order to put a cap on Voldemort's recruitment effort, save Snape because of the debt he owes him, remove the stain upon Slytherin.

** This is not exactly new ground. It sounds quite similar to quite a few Time Travel stories out there. At least in the ground work of it. Time travel HP stories are my favorite so I have read a shit ton. Honestly most of the concept sounds same old same old.

But I will give you credit for the last little bit...

#+begin_quote
  Because he knows Voldemort is coming, he creates his own Death Eaters. Called the Order of the Midnight Sun. It is made of friends from Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. Hydra is creating his own Death Eaters to combat Voldemort in the future. They train in the dark arts, defense arts, mind arts, ancient runes, protective magics and spell creation.

It would be interesting to see a story where Harry gets the jump on Voldemort and creates what are effectively his own Death Eaters. The way you describe it comes off as sort of a combination between Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix in terms of personality. A group less about pure blood supremecy and politics, and more about simple power, knowledge, and control.

There are stories out there where Harry does things somewhat like this, but it is usually a lot more simplistic. He gets Dumbledores help and works with the early Order of the Phoenix, or he turns the future death eaters "good" through various methods, or he turns into another Dark Lord himself, effectively stomping out Voldemort early and taking control on that front.

But I have not come across one with him going in the direction you describe.

*** It's definitely not new ground. I would like Harry to be Independent from Dumbledore in this regard, follow somewhat in Tom Riddles path. Similar but not the same. Effectively this is a story about a Tom Riddle who does everything he did in Hogwarts, except killing and creating Horcruxes, and becomes somewhat of a Dumbledore; strong wizard who champions values of equality and fairness.

It's not simplistic as you stated. Which I like simplistic fics, but I'll try to use realistic reasons for the complexities that shall appear.
