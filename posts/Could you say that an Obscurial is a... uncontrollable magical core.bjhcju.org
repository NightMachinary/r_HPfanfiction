Just a quick thought.


** Never though about it like that, but I can see that working. Yeah. Be aware though, there is no such thing as magical core in the actual HP canon. Its a fanfiction thing.

*** Don't worry, I was made very aware that magical cores weren't canon the second I found this sub.

Also, does that mean in normal wizards and witches, magic exists within them like ‘calmer' version of an Obcurial, or is it something else entirely? I wonder if there is a fic out there that looked into this.

**** From what I understand it's when a person truly fears their magic, represses I guess. My take on it is that non obscurials accept their magic as part of themselves naturally because even though they don't understand it consciously, on some level subconsciously they know it's them. Obscurials don't accept their magic, fear it to an extent that their conscious and subconscious fear wars with the natural acceptance of their magic. Accidental magic is more raw than wand magic and seems to be more based on strong emotions, self preservation is a big one. As time goes on and a kid gets older their wants and fears and other emotions aren't as basic and strong as they were when they were younger so magic settles but obscurials happen when there's that constant terror of what you are or what's in you.The magic sort of forms a consciousness of its own to protect itself but it's very taxing on a kid. I suppose you could say obscurials are more chaotic but like I said I think it's more that an obscurial has no real control.

**** Id imagine the Obscurial as being a volatile version of the core. Like, the witch/wizard tries so hard to repress his magic that magic actually obeys his command, but can never accomplish it because its impossible. This creates a conflict and just makes the core very unstable, eventually to the point where it cant keep itself together anymore and just lashes out.

*** I honestly wouldn't be surprised if magical cores became a thing in canon as Credence is more discussed in the Grindelwald series. It honestly feels like we're almost splitting hairs on if a "magical core" exists but they talk about how wizards become an obscurial by suppressing their magic due to a traumatic event.

** People frequently seem to forget that the obscurus is considered a magical creature. Yes, it's a parasitic upon a wizard (the obscurial) and its existence is generated under certain conditions rather than it being born biologically (similar to Dementors, boggarts, poltergeists, etc). Nonetheless it is a distinct entity from the Obscurial which hosts it.

Credence's obscurus is not his magic. It is a magical being which is parasitic upon his magic. Indeed, the strength of Credence's magic is given as the reason why he is able to control/overpower his obscurus, which /can only/ make sense if his magic is distinct from the obscurus.

*** According to that same cannon though, the Obscurial is born out of the repressed magic, turning the magic into that being. So it doesn't matter if it's a magical creature. The question has nothing to do with it being a creature.

A child supressing their own magic is the condition under which the obscurus creature comes into being. At no point is it stated that the obscurus is "made of" that child's magic, and as stated above, it's clear at several points that the obscurus is distinct from its host's magic.

Another example of the obscurus being distinct from its host's magic is Newt having in captivity an obscurus of a dead obscurial.

****** It's clear enough if you pay attention.

*ONE:* An obscurus is a "dark force" that the child develops, not the obscurial's magic:

#+begin_quote
  NEWT: I met one in Sudan three months ago. There used to be amore of them but they still exist. Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by Muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus.

  TINA: It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark force that bursts out and - and attacks and then vanishes...
#+end_quote

*TWO:* An obscurus is parasitical, i.e. it latches onto the obscurial rather than being the same thing as the obscurial:

#+begin_quote
  GRAVES: So it's useless without the host?

  NEWT: Useless? Useless? That is a parasitical magical force which killed a child. What on earth would you want to use it for?
#+end_quote

*THREE:* The obscurus is a creature within Credence which takes over his body. It is not the same entity as Credence:

#+begin_quote
  GRAVES: You can control it, Credence.

  CREDENCE: But I don't think I want to, Mr Graves.

  /The Obscurus moves horribly beneath CREDENCE'S skin. An awful inhuman growl comes out of his mouth, from which something dark begins to bloom./

  /The force finally takes over CREDENCE, his whole body exploding into a dark mass which hurtles forward out of the window, narrowly missing GRAVES./
#+end_quote

*FOUR:* An obscurial with unusually powerful magic can use that magic to survive and control the obscurus.

#+begin_quote
  TINA: He's not a child.

  NEWT: I know - but I saw him - his power must be so strong - he's somehow managed to survive. It's incredible.
#+end_quote

If an obscurial having strong magic allows them to overpower the obscurus, then the obscurial's magic /must be/ separate from the obscurus. Otherwise that obscurus would possess that same strength.

*** I wonder if the Obscurus also has genetic components. The only two Obscuri mentioned directly in the franchise (besides the one child in Africa Newt mentioned) were in the Dumbledore family- assuming Grindelwald isn't lying about Creedance's parentage

** Myself

I believe that an Obscurial is the magic of the abused child which has been conditioned to attack itself, when they are shown as abnormal and freaks so to speak. The magic reacts accidentally and starts to attack itself just like accidental magic protects the young wizard/witch.

​

Or to make it more clear like an auto immune diseases where the immune system attacks the cells of the body itself

** Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the "magical core model" of magic, due to my personal preference for vague and mystical magic models over science-like ones.

In the Harry Potter universe, many magical creatures are manifestations of certain emotions. Boggarts are manifestations of fear, Dementors of depression and despair, Poltergeists of mischief. In a similar vein, I think, the Obscurus can be viewed as the magical manifestation of trauma.

** No such thing! Seriously, magical-cores get kind of old, especially since canon does not say anything about them existing -.-

It's more like a character's magic reacting to bad treatment and self-repression (and a retcon, because frankly if that was in the cards early on then Dumbledore can be glad that Harry didn't turn into one, which makes his comment about "...ten dark and difficult years..." more damning and should IMHO lead to Dumbledore truly getting punished!) by getting malevolent and lashing out (it's like a pressure-cooker with too much pressure it explodes violently!)
