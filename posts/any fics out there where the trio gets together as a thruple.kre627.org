there are tons of hary gets a harem stories, and many that feature slash.

so why not sort of combine the 2 and make the trio become a thruple, heck could even have the rest of the ministry team become another thruple


** This is a popular enough pairing-

Almost all of the ones i know are oneshots, but they're all pretty good-

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]] :

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying."Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."“What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”
#+end_quote

This can be read as Harry/Hermione/Ron or as a platonic trio friendship fic.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

** The word you're looking for is triad. Might help you find fics with it.

I don't know of any personally, sorry!

** There are lots of well-written, albeit usually smutty Trio one-shots on AO3 if you sort by Kudos.

I also really enjoyed this series:
