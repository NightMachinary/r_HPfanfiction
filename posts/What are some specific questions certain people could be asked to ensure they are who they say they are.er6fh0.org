** Inside jokes! That's what I use for passwords and such.

ETA: I re-read and you wanted specific questions but nearly everybody has one or two phrases that they can say to their high school BFF that they immediately understand without context

*** This is actually a really good idea. Lots of inside jokes are wholly inexplicable to outside parties, and the stories behind inside jokes aren't something that people usually share (as it's usually a "you had to be there" moment). These would be a great thing to verify people's identities

** Stuff that never happened. "What did you say to me when we did that thing?" - if the thing never happened, then any imposter is never going to find out about it, but they'll most likely assume that it's real because what sane person would ask you what you said at an event that never happened?

*** Technically saying that never happened is by far the most reasonable answer an imposter could give, since its the only answer they could think off which has a reasonable chance of success.

**** Oh, agreed. But most people's first thought would be "Oh shit. I missed something." and they'd either try to pass off not remembering or just take their best guess. It's natural. Especially if it's based off a truth. Like you both attended the event but never spoke at it, so asking what you said at an event would hit an impersonators "Okay, so I was there, but I don't know what I said. Bluff." instinct.

You could also try the 'Other Person said you were at a thing and did a thing, right?' verification bluff trick, too.

** Specific memories not many people know about. Or a mutual memory. Eg: Harry's birthday kiss and his Boggart. Hermione cursing Ron with the cannaries. The Marauders nicknames. Etc etc.
