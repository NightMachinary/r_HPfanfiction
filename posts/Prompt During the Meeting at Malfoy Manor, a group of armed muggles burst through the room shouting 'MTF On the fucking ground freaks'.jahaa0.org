** I doubt any MTF would call them freaks. Also, if the Foundation is aware of death eaters, they *will* be aware of the rest of the WW. And I doubt they would even interfere unless they have a better, more efficient way of "containing" any such a keter-class anomaly.

*** OK, well, the Foundation actually desires a police force that's under THEIR control. But they couldn't just walk up to the Ministry and say, 'Hey, we're a muggle group that has God in its basement, want to help us contain hostile entitites?'

So, they decide to 'draft' the most powerful wizards they can find.

**** I think you misunderstood. The Wizarding World /is/ a keter-class anomaly. Currently they're semi-contained from the normal world (statute of Secrecy), and since it's so huge/established, it would be close to impossible gathering every single wizard, witch, artifact and magical beast/creature and putting them in a box in a containment site.

***** The Foundation in the story knows that. They don't wish to contain the entire wizarding world. There was a vote in the O5 council over whether to police(Meaning treat wizards/magical beasts as they do ordinary people) or contain it(Treat them as SCPs). The result was to police it. They 'recruit' the DEs and Order, as they are the most powerful wizards. They train them to become MTFs, and they POLICE the wizarding world for anomalies that could harm wizards or muggles.

***** The Foundation has used SCPs in the past. That's my reasoning behind their recruitment. But I need some advice.

In the story, the DEs and Order all experience a lot of PTSD and Depression from essentially being uprooted against their will and transplanted into this cruel, harsh world of the paranormal. The DE's are forced to work with muggles, their hated enemy and the Order have to work with their hated enemies.

In time, though, both groups come to see the Foundation for what it is: The only hope of humanity living past tommorrow, or in some cases literally the next second. They know their 'masters' are the only thing stopping reality itself from crumbling.

The new British Regional Administrator gives them two options: Leave, or stay. In the end, all of them choose to stay. The stakes are too high.

I just don't know how to write a character with that kind of trauma, nor a story with THAT level of character development.

The only scene I am picturing right now that /really/ demonstrates this kind of trauma, is a scene where Bellatrix is washing her hands in the bathroom. She takes off her gas mask, and she sees an entirely foreign person from the woman she once was. One with scars and artifically grown muscles. She breaks down, crying.

But that's the only scene I am picturing that allows the reader to get even a glimpse of the character's trauma.

Any advice?

*** Well, they THINK they're muggles, because they have muggle arms. They have both wands and guns, since some Anomalous objects might be immune to magic, or bullets, but most likely not both.

**** So there are two ways to interpret this: The more likely way (where they refers to the present death eaters) - okay that resolves the muggle/death eater issue. But why are the death eaters calling themselves freak? The second way (where they refers to the future ones) - why would they think they're muggles just because of using a gun?

***** They think they're muggles....because Muggles use guns, and wizards have usually never even seen one.

They call themselves 'freaks' out of habit, actually.
