I want a fanfiction where Harry goes on adventures, and people higher him to ward stuff. It must be over 70k words and cannot have any slash at all. If it does have slash I will hunt you down >:O


** Mate, all of your requests are oddly specific but the same. Why don't you just go on a site, search for a keyword and filter by 70k+? You've gone from wandmaking and alchemy and businesses and now you're onto warding.

Why make the same request again and again? It just seems like shitposting to me.

*** I've gone through plenty of sights trying to find things like this. Most are either heavy slash, which when I try to read I end up quitting, or some other stupid thing. Most of the time sights like that only give stories that MENTION what i'm looking for, but don't go into any detail.

If you do not have a story recc, then please do not reply.

**** They gave a constructive method to find something. Which is part of what we do here. Sorry that it hasn't worked for you, but you're looking for something very specific. In my 10+ years of reading fanfic, I haven't come across something that fits your /specific/ requirements.

I recommend also checking out some of the HP themed Tumblr blogs- there are some centered around fanfic that may be able to give you some recommendations.

Either way you're going to run into the same issues though- Harry doing something after school other than being an Auror tends to include slash. Sometimes just a mention, others, more.

It sounds like you're at the point where you've got ideas, and as a reader but not a writer, you're stuck not finding anything.

******** They're commenting that your occasional misuse of words doesn't speak particularly well of your skills as an editor.

"People higher him to ward stuff" should be "hire".

"I've gone through plenty of sights" and "sights like that" should be "sites".

Not nitpicking personally, just pointing out why the coment was made.

***** I'm pretty sure you're thinking of Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood. It's been a while since I read it, but iirc, Harry and Hermione would have people pay them to set up their wards, and leave themselves an easy way in to steal from there later.

A Black Comedy doesn't really have them setting up wards other than Harry with his fidelius obsession.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

**** I was also going to recommend this one. Give it another shot. It is written in the second point of view which will feel different but is still a pleasurable experience because the writing and story are so well done. Also just for reference the first chapter takes place in the middle of the story and is designed to hook you before going back to show you how they came to that. This story has in depth information about using runes to make some pretty awesome effects.

Besides it was popular enough the author wrote a sequel.
