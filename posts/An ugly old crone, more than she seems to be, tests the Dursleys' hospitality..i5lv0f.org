Since one common fantasy trope is some powerful wizard, witch, or fae creature is to disguise themselves as a beggar and ask for help, to reward those who help them, or punish those who reject them, I wonder how the Dursleys' would react to one showing up on their doorstep.


** Probably slam the door in their face.

** Well she's not ugly but it wouldn't be too hard to get McGonagall to pull this to gauge their suitability further than just observation will tell her.

After the expected reaction happens then she puts them under some transfiguration curse that will give them animal features every time they're cruel or mean or what have you, while if they act nice and kindly they will look nicer or something.
