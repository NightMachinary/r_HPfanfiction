I'm in love with Carpe Noctem, and I'd like more fics where he has a chance to go back in time and do things over again. I read a ton of fics where Harry goes back, but I'm really interested in ones where Voldemort/Tom is the main character. Gen is fine, but if there are pairings I prefer them not to be het.

Also, since I just finished The Black Coat and am -seething-, I'd like to humbly request stories with happy endings. Or at least WIPs.

I appreciate any recommendations you may have <3


** Riddle, Grindelwald and Dumbledore are too overpowered as is. Compounded with the advantage of travelling to the past? That's why Voldemort in the fanfics I've read is restricted as a diary, a voice, an animal, who influences, helps or corrupts the actual traveler. Maybe become free once he sees the error of his ways. Otherwise, it's knockout in round one.

Now, it'd be a different story if he traveled to a high tech future, with wizards' tendency to underestimate Muggle science. That might have potential. My two cents...

*** Idk, I think Carpe Noctem does it great. The idea that V went too hard too fast with the dark rituals really makes sense to me, especially considering how different he is from what we see of Tom. I'd like for him to get the chance to try again and take a different path too, not just Harry.

Personally I've always hated sci fi, so I'm not really looking for anything high tech ðŸ˜…

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Voldemort arrives in the past of an alternate universe in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]]. It has some great interaction between Voldemort and Dumbledore. However, you'd probably need to read the previous two fics in the series to understand why this Voldemort is so different from canon.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

  Part 2 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the new world is far more dangerous. Death himself has come to claim his due. Dragons, fairy lords, sorcerers and a town under threat, it's practically your average day. A story of Harry and Voldemort in a dark and dangerous fairy-tale world. No relationships.

  Part 3 of 'The Wandering Devil'. The year is 1996. The Second Wizarding War is in mid-swing. A traveller from another dimension is searching for a forbidden text. Forced to work with Dumbledore the traveller finds himself trapped between his quest and the war with Voldemort. Gods, demons and dark lords, he's seen them all before, but as reality grows thinner can anyone remain sane?

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

**** Unfortunately I find that a lot of Voldemort centred fics are slash(y) and that's just not my thing. Kind of like the ones where Severus is a good guy/on good terms with Harry.
