Hey, all

It really pains me to have to send this out, but, since my February Break has ended, I've received a lot of schoolwork, I don't see it letting up anytime soon, and I haven't really had time for anything else lately. Doing well in school has, as it should be, always been a first priority for me, and I want to maintain good grades.

I really, really hate to do this, but I'm afraid I'll have to suspend this project, at least until mid-June or July, when I actually have time for other things. It pains me greatly to have to do this, and if there was any other way, you wouldn't be reading this right now, but I feel like there's no other choice. I may post a chapter once in a while, but I really need to focus on school, so that means updates will be sporadic from now until mid-July. I'll update this post if anything changes and I encourage (and will support) any future projects of this nature.

I apologize again,

Best Regards,

ThePianoProdigy


** No worries! I know how school gets in the way sometimes.

*** Thanks for still being supportive, Psantium. (This would also give me time to actually learn voice acting, improve my vocal range, and get rid of my lisp)

** Looking forward to it when you get things moving. Were you planning on doing all of the readings yourself?

**** I was just thinking that it might be less daunting if you were able to recruit some readers. Someone tried it a long time ago with Aspens Year like none other series, each chapter was read by someone different with different quality audio, it was a nice attempt but didn't work.. I wouldn't mind giving it a try, i'm not sure that I have the "right" kind of voice for this kind of thing.. I listen to audio books at work and go through one every two or three days. I can't afford any new ones, so I have most of them memorised. It would be nice to have something new, and it might help cut down on the time I spend reading fanfic at home.

***** I've actually heard the Like None Other series, and honestly, it's not that good. The fact that each chapter is read by a different narrator and is of a different quality detracts from the suspension of belief.

I think I'll have to have different narrators for each fanfic (that read every chapter of he book) if this is going to work. What do you think of that idea?

****** Yeah, that is exactly why I didn't enjoy the audio version. It pulled me out every time. That makes more sense, maybe require a sample of the first chapter before they do too much to make sure the recording itself isn't terrible, most people won't want to listen if it sounds crackly like a busted cassette tape
