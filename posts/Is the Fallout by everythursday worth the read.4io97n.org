I am trying to read "the best of" some different ships and so I thought i'd try some DM/HG. I read Isolation and thought it was pretty good but overhyped. On a lot of threads, I have seen people say that The Fallout is THE BEST of dramoine. I have been putting off reading it though because some people say it is still a WIP (even though it says complete?) and might be abandoned. Is it still worth the read even though it isn't complete?

If you didn't like The Fallout, do you have other recommendations for fics that are the best of their ship (any ship fine)?


** The Fallout is complete and has been for a long while. (No idea why anybody would be saying that it isn't!) I would absolutely recommend it and all of everythursday's other Dramione stories. I wasn't a huge fan of Isolation either so hopefully The Fallout will be more to your tastes!

** It depends on your tastes, really.

I thought The Fallout was beautifully written, however I never did finish reading it because it was way too angsty for me to actually remotely enjoy. But as far as I can tell based on the numerous praises the fic does get, I'm one of the few people who actually didn't like it.
