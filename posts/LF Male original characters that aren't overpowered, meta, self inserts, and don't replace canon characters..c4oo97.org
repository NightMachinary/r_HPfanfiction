It's difficult to find any fanfiction that has a male original character. The ones I have found are either overpowered, meta, self inserts, or they replace a canon character and their place in the overall story (mostly Harry). I would prefer a Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff (because I almost never see those) but either house is fine as long as the character is well rounded. No pairings and bashings please.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** There's an...interesting OC male Ravenclaw in Divided and Entwined.

** That's pretty difficult since without knowing the author there's no way of knowing that an OC MC isn't a self insert.

** Most completely original characters are DADA teachers since original student characters usually use one of the names that got mentioned just once or twice in the series like Daphne Greengrass or Anthony Goldstein.

** The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the defense teacher from Linkffn(Forging the Sword), but he's know exactly super prominent in the story, and you could argue that he replaces Lupin, since he's the third year defense professor.

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.
