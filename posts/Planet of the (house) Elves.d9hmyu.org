Are there fics where one or more free-will elves of unknown origin wander into wizarding society and trouble ensues? Bonus points if the newcomers have all the normal powers of house elves while only looking like humans with pointy ears. Also bonus if the Ministry (or other governments) refuses to accept that free-will elves are a thing and tries to suppress the whole affair.
