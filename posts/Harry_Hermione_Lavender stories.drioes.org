** I got nothing, but if I was writing it, here's how I'd do it:

Hermione wants to look good for the Yule Ball, so she swallows her pride and asks Lavender for advice. She can't help being impressed with Lavender's knowledge of cosmetic charms and potions, and humbled by her willingness to help despite Hermione always looking down on "girly stuff". They strike up a tentative friendship. Over time, Hermione learns to embrace her feminine side, while Lavender gains a better understanding of Hermione, whom she only saw as aloof and arrogant before.

Years later, Hermione realizes she has feelings for Harry, and opens up to Lavender, who cheers her on. Unbeknownst to Hermione , Lavender secretly has feelings for Harry too, but doesn't want to get in her friend's way. Hermione eventually catches on, they have a dramatic confrontation, and it ultimately ends in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgFyCuKoEGA][^{one} ^{^{big}} ^{^{^{fuckpile}}}]].
