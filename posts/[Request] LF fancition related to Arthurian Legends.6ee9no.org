Hi guys! I was wondering if you know any fanfics with the theme of arthurian legends? Not the crossovers with Merlin or fics where Harry is Merlin's heir or something like that. I was thinking more of round table legacy, maybe being Arthur's heir/reincarnation for a change. There is a moment in "A Marauder's Plan" when the legends are mentioned and it inspired me :)


** The first story arc ("Forging a Legend") of linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh"), especially chapter two of that arc.

You don't really need to read the rest of the story for it.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(The Marriage Stone) has Harry as the next Wizarding King after Arthur. It uses the elements of the legend well. While this is a slashfic, nothing much has happened with the main pairings explicitly. I really enjoyed how the author developed the Wizarding world more than canon described it to be.

**** It's been almost a year since Violet has updated :(

Apparently she already has 30k written for the next chapter but can't get the ending of it to work out.

***** Oh I know. I check her profile page every day, and I check the reviews as well in case Sister leaves a message. I'm only slightly obsessed. :/

There is some good news, though. Back in March Sister left a message saying that the writers block was gone, but that Violet was so busy that it would be a long while anyway. Just gotta keep waiting I guess lol.

****** There was that one chapter in Serpentine Subterfuge that came after a veryyyyy long wait and was around 60k words so if anything remotely close to that happens, I'll be happy.

I've been resisting the urge to refresh the review page for a sister update lol.

  SSHP. To avoid the machinations of the Ministry, Harry must marry a reluctant Severus Snape. But marriage to Snape is only the beginning of Harry's problems. Voldemort has returned, and before too long Harry's marriage may determine the world's fate.
