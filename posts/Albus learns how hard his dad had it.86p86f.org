Stories where Albus Potter learns how difficult things were for Harry, whether by time travel, memories, hearing about it from someone, or something else.

*** Haha. Although I can't see Harry being someone who would be so unsympathetic to the difficulties of his son. Harry had plenty of ordinary teenage struggles on top of the crazy ones.

** I remember reading a fic where Albus try to prank James for payback with some type of potion in I think Pumpkin Juice. Instead both Harry and Ginny drank it. Both of them de-age with only memories up to that age. The three Potter siblings than had to take care of their parents in which they learn about their parents' past and what they went through as children.

It is an interesting premise. Though if you're reading a 700k fic, an 80k fic would be easy. It even took my less than several hours to read in one go.
