Whether the Fic followes the Canon (sort of, minus the Voldemort thing) or stays AU its up to the Fic. What i imagine for such fics would be that Harry or Ron (or possibly even both) get attracted to her. Draco might be upset about her dating "others", but she would use her Slytherin traits to keep him low. Partly she is nicer than Draco, but she still has Malfoy/Slytherin Traits in her Persona.

​

So much for the Mainpart, the following are Optional Subpoints:

​

The Sister could be built in as some sort of Scarlet Woman as well, meaning: She could dating one of the Boys during School, but they decide to be together with their Canon Partners. At some point, she reappears and attempts to tempt them. Whether its ends in Infidelity or the Wifes call her for testing the Fidelity of their Husbands (yeah, where is their Trust...but i would still accept it) doesnt matter.

​

Draco being upset about her dating (and so possibly sleeping with) other Boys/Men could be because of many reasons, like Blood shame or betrayal or because he is attracted to her himself. I would accept one-sided incest/attractivity aswell. If thats not your cup of tea, fine by me, but its what im looking for.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me]] is the best example I can think of. Neville/Graces Malfoy is the pairing and is my personal favourite romance in the fandom. Canon events are up until 6th year, which is where the story begins. Their romance is the primary focus, but the unwilling servitude of the Malfoys to the dark lord is a sizeable arc that is handled rather well. LV is quite honestly freaking scary, so much so that I prefer this LV to practically any other I've read. Give it a try.
