** I really enjoyed it. It has it's major issues, such as Slytherin automatically accepting Hermione, and the fact that Voldemort seems almost human, but it was well written and entertaining.

** I liked it. Spoilers ahead!

Ups: I totally saw the "Hermione is going to betray Voldemort because he's an immortal sociopath who will eventually be too much to deal with, but not out of any care for Dumbledore's side" coming a few chapters before it really became apparent (i.e. when Neville and the Hufflepuffs started realizing she was opposed to the Carrows even if she was a Death Eater). I thought that was well-foreshadowed, with a gradual increase of clues.

Downs: I wish they hadn't tried to keep it so close to canon; every so often someone on the Slytherin side would do something for no real reason other than that it was in the books. Case in point- there was no reason why the scene with Harry, Draco, Vincent, and Greg in the RoR needed to happen in an identical way to canon, except that they were trying to keep everything as canon-like as possible. The characters had different motivations, the horcrux hunt had gone quite differently, and Vincent using fiendfire "to herd Harry out quicker" was just dumb. Also the "death right after having sex" cliche is lame.

Conclusion: Hermione's reign is going to be just as terrible as Riddle's, mainly because she's quite evil. She was willing to let a bunch of children die without remorse because their parents backed the wrong horse, their friends once punched Draco for being a dick, or just because they weren't in Slytherin. Her regime will be no less corrupt or vicious than the ones before, which is fine, I guess, but it did seem for most of the story that she legitimately cared that the prior administrations were corrupt and run by idiots, rather than just caring that she wasn't on top.

*** Yeah, it bugs me that the author sticks closely to canon.

Either things happen just as they did in the books (like the Slytherins pretended to be a dementor), or roles are reversed. The role reversal does work sometimes, but some parts (like Ron calling Hermione the m-word) seem a little flimsy.

In my opinion, there would be a lot more divergence from canon. For example, would Krum still have been attracted to Hermione Granger if she had been a bookish Gryffindor instead of a Slytherin who hung around with purebloods? Without Hermione to blackmail Rita, would Harry still have given an interview to tell his side of the graveyard story?

** I guess it was kind of obvious that Hermione had an endgame, but still. I literally shouted "I KNEW IT" when I read the end of that chapter.

It's a good fic, though it does a little bit more "stations of the canon" then I would like (i.e., crabbe still dying in the RoR, not my daughter you bitch).

Also I feel like Voldemort's humanity is a little bit much. I buy the whole Voldemort having two faces thing, but I do wish it had been explained earlier.

The author does do a good job of representing the other side of the story, for example, the Slytherins feeling like Harry's being blatantly favorited. Though sometimes it pushes the edge of believability (Ron calling Hermione the m-word).

I feel like part of the problem is that some of the differences aren't really explored as much as they should be. For example, the relationship between Hermione and Voldemort is good, but relatively unexplored and somewhat jarring. We're supposed to accept things like Voldemort giving her the necklace and laughing at her jokes because he sees potential. But the reasons for this divergence and Voldemort's feelings aren't fully fleshed out.

I also don't love how easily things still come to Hermione. We get a hint of backlash with McGonagall, but other than that things generally run smoothly.

I would have loved to see more conflict between her parents, and find it odd that we're asked to accept that Hermione's parents are to be too busy taking six month vacations to remember to worry about whether their only child is spending her holidays. I do love her parents saying that Hermione is a sensible girl, and it's not like these people are terrorists or something.

On the other hand, I do find it to be an interesting exploration of Hermione's character, and I think it tracks nicely with canon. I think it's fascinating that Hermione is probably the most morally grey member of the trio in canon, and yet we see quite clearly that Harry/Ron are rougher and meaner without her influence. It's interesting to see the different dynamics that form, and how Luna is pulled into that world as well.

** I looked at it when it was mentioned earlier in another thread, but when I saw it was unfinished I didn't read it. If the last chapter will be up soon I'll have to take a second look!

** I read the first few chapters, and gave up because the whole Slytherin house was OOC and because of all the Gryffindor-bashing. I took another crack at it on [[/u/DeeMI5IO]]'s recommendation, but I ended up skimming a lot. When it comes to Slytherin!Hermione fics, beggars can't be choosers, but I ultimately found that my initial impression was correct.

The fic has a weird relationship with canon. On the one hand, it tosses out much of canon's characterization, both individual and collective. Most jarringly, while Slytherins (and Malfoys in particular) do not display any blood-prejudice towards Hermione, Gryffindors display quite a lot. (That is, in turn, used to bash them for their hypocrisy, that the author had made up from whole cloth.) On the other hand, it slavishly follows the canon plot outline.

This creates a number of problems. One immediate one is that Hermione's actions have no consequences in the grand scheme of things, because she can't actually do anything of consequence without derailing the canon plot. (More on this later.) Another is that characters' actions often make no sense at all. And, told from Hermione's perspective, it creates a certain lack of coherence: we are told about adversity that she faces as a Muggleborn and a Slytherin, but we aren't shown any that's worse than Ron (of all people) calling her a Mudblood.

*/Warning: Spoilers ahead!/*

For some specific examples, on the one hand, everyone is oh-so-prejudiced against the oppressed Slytherins, and Death Eaters are just victims of Dumbledore's propaganda. But, Lucius's political influence seems undiminished, and when Umbridge tries to make Hermione write lines with a Blood Quill, she immediately gets to threaten to use her connections in the Slytherin elite (i.e., the Malfoys) to ruin her. So much for poor and oppressed. And, that's without Hermione threatening to kill everybody she doesn't like, and never suffering any consequences.

More generally, Hermione seems to have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field]["Reality Distortion Field"]] around her, which magically protects her from any adversity or consequences of her actions. People --- selfish, "Slytherin" people --- often give her things without asking for anything in return. To give a few examples:

- Slytherins' vaunted blood prejudice doesn't apply to her.
- Draco and Theodore have to work and suffer for their Dark Marks. Voldemort just up and gives Hermione a nice Dark-Mark-shaped necklace that just happens to also protect her from magical attacks from Death Eaters.
- She murders Fenrir and Bellatrix in cold blood, in front of multiple eyewitnesses. There are no consequences.

So, this special snowflake Hermione never has to face any meaningful danger, conflict, or adversity, making for a dull story overall, taking place in a Bizzaro Potterverse, where Gryffindors are the ones with blood prejudice, Slytherins are not, and Voldemort is impressed by a Patronus Charm and puts more value on Hermione than on Bellatrix.

And, for me, at least, the saddest cut of all is that all this means that we don't get to see Hermione do anything genuinely interesting, creative, or unexpected. Half the time, she's about as subtle as Draco, and gets away with it just as often. Rather than having to plan carefully to assassinate Bellatrix and get away with it, she just casts the Killing Curse in front of a bunch of Death Eaters, and they just accept it, and nobody bothers to inform Voldemort, who didn't care about Bellatrix anyway. She plots against Voldemort pretty much in the open, and Voldemort never bothers to check on her; though I guess the final chapter might prove me wrong on this count.

On a more trivial, yet telling, end of things, Hermione doesn't proactively act to get her teeth fixed, but rather "waits" for someone to cast /Densagueo/ on her as in canon. Nor does she seem to learn anything in Slytherin that she didn't in Gryffindor, other than Occlumency (but not Legilimency, because that would be interesting), how to sneer, how to manipulate people in ways that only work because of her Reality Distortion Field, and how to cast the Killing Curse. For example, Snape had tutored her in Potions since her 3rd year. Now, you would think that by the time the 6th year rolls around, Hermione would be able to match the "Half-Blood Prince" in her brewing? No, Snape has to essentially reteach her.

So, much as I love the concept of Slytherin!Hermione who takes over the world, the fic remains a profound disappointment.

#+begin_quote
  *Reality distortion field* (*RDF*) is a term coined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Tribble][Bud Tribble]] at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.][Apple Computer]] in 1981, to describe company co-founder [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs][Steve Jobs]]' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma][charisma]] and its effects on the developers working on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh][Macintosh]] project. Tribble said that the term came from /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek][Star Trek]]/. Later the term has also been used to refer to perceptions of his keynote speeches (or "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote][Stevenotes]]") by observers and devoted users of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.][Apple]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh][computers]] and products.

  The RDF was said by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld][Andy Hertzfeld]] to be Steve Jobs' ability to convince himself and others to believe almost anything with a mix of charm, charisma, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravery][bravado]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole][hyperbole]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing][marketing]], appeasement and persistence. RDF was said to distort an audience's sense of proportion and scales of difficulties and made them believe that the task at hand was possible. Jobs could also use the RDF to appropriate other's ideas as his own, sometimes proposing an idea to its originator after dismissing it the week before.

  The term is also used by Apple's competitors when they [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.][criticize Apple]]. On [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_In_Motion][Research In Motion]]'s official [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry][BlackBerry]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog][blog]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Balsillie][Jim Balsillie]] introduced a blog post by saying “For those of us who live outside of Apple's distortion field”.

Nope, not proven wrong. Still the special snowflake with a Reality Distortion Field.
