:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a fic that started roughly from the Goblet scene, but had the lives of all its champions shown during the choosing.

Things I remember of the specific memories:

- Krum's memories consisted mostly of the World Cup.
- Fleur's memories were her being evacuated during a war between Veela and Merpeople.
- Cedric's memories were of actions taken during the Chamber of Secrets incident.
- Harry's memories included the Dursleys as well as all of his heroics up to that point.

What I don't remember is the name of the fic, or any more specifics. I really want to re-read this fic, so does anyone here remember which one it is?

  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

Has the adults being very active, The Baslisk is considered a Wizard-WMD... and safety-procedures get activated when Harry mentions it to Dumbledore.

while not exactly similar, it's close enough and good enough for me to feel good recommending it.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
