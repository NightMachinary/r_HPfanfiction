** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is by far my top Hermione centric story. Romance is only a minor plot point.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), is a fun read and doesn't contain any romance.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has some romance, but is mostly focused on wars and politics.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer), linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and linkffn(Divided and Entwined) both contain /some/ romance but are general fiction where the relationships are as much in the background as they were in canon, if not moreso.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is a fascinating AU and entirely devoid of any sort of shipping.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) is a still young fic, but for now it has basically no romance, and if there is ever some it doesn't look like it would become the focus.

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione. Over 95k hits!

*** It's one of those fics that bashes a canon character for not knowing (and therefore taking advantage of) the author's fanon. A more prominent example is Dumbledore being bashed for not encouraging Harry to Swear on His Magic (So Mote it Be) during GoF or OOTP.

**** Not really. Most of it is really canon. Like Hermione not taking more advantage of the Time Turner. Or how she was useless in her sixth year because of her jealous problem a propos Ron/Lavender and Harry using the book. I shared this fic with a lot of people, most of them liked it except the Hermione's fanatic.

***** I skimmed it again. Nope, almost entirely fanon, highly uncharitable interpretations of canon, or blaming Hermione for stuff that isn't even her fault. All wrapped up in the classic bashfic package of the author avatar righteously ranting at the target, which the target accepts meekly before either lashing out in impotent rage or running off in tears.

Whereas a real creative genius would have caused a paradox and erased herself from time. Ironically (or is it "moronically"?), the Unspeakable also castigates Hermione for being /too/ adventurous with respect to the Troll Incident.

#+end_quote

I wasn't aware that it was her purpose to be "useful" to someone. I guess in Unspeakableverse, being a teenager in love or having integrity and prudence not to cheat off a Potions book of unknown provenance are critical character flaws.

Has it occurred to you that maybe most people you share this story with are already Hermione-haters, rather than those not liking it being fanatics? Just something to think about.

I'll end this by quoting reviewer Judah ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/64932/Judah):]]

#+begin_quote
  And the next day, after careful consideration, Miss Granger used her fame and renown for being a primary vanquisher of Lord Voldemort to convince her friends to do her a political favor. The new minister of magic then appointed "The Brightest Witch of Her Age" to head the Department of Mysteries.

  Unspeakable Worth was fired next Monday. He'd helped her realize more than one path to power existed, and she learned her lesson well.

****** You really are biased. Almost entirely fanon? What about the fact that during the Horcruxe hunt, Hermione took books and not one canned food, despite the fact that she already "prepared" her bag. I have neither the time nor the will to skimm the fic again just to prove you wrong, I learned now that it was useless to reason with a Hermione fanatic.

Good luck with your life, try to improve your argumentation's skills, I'll not answer to any intelligent reply you'll have so don't bother.

Maybe because her time was limited, and food is a consumable resource that could be and was obtained obtained in the field? In any case, if this is the bet this Unspeakable could do, that's not really a very good case.

I wonder if you're merely afraid to look at the fic, because you might realize that I am right, and then you'd have to change your mind.

You seem to be under a misapprehension that I want your answer. Permit me to disabuse you of that. My purpose here is to call out /your/ biased bullshit for what it is. Your reply is neither wanted nor required.
