** It's a way for Harry to simultaneously be Chosen and Special but also Wronged and Oppressed and Neglected, so that he could be properly Gray and Edgy and Independent.

** The idea is straight from canon, is it really surprising that it's commonly used? A large point of HP is the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, I can't stand it when fanfics ignore this and pretend that Harry is the only one capable of destroying Voldemort.

"Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Would Neville's mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no "Chosen One" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's? (HBP pg 139/133)"

*** I loved that fic, and it was very important to me, but it bothered me through the entire fic that Connor is just not a likely name for Lily and James to have chosen for the twin of Harry. Also that the author doesn't seem 100% clear on what a pasty is. These were my trials.

*** Haha, that story was one of the first things that came to mind when I came across this thread. I would have mentioned it if you hadn't - because despite the fact that wrong!boy-who-lived is now becoming a cliche (or was), this was a completely fascinating AU. There was so much effort and thought and words-in-general put into it, and even if it wasn't my absolutely and indisputable favorite, it was definitely a good read.\\
I actually didn't know about it until recently though, after a reading a light-hearted parody. I would say that I'm surprised that it spawned this trope, but I'm kind of not, because it's like what.. a decade old, right?\\
I realize that this comment is slightly tangential, but I guess I just have to gush about this a little haha.\\
And to continue on in [[/u/TantumErgo]] 's thought-process about the fic:\\
Yeah, the name choice really tripped me up. Like insanely. That, coupled with the fact that Draco was such an unbelievable pleb. Ugh.\\
It was a great read though! I'd recommend it to the OP - it might change your opinion on the terribadness of this trope!

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** Because it's interesting to explore the life of a Harry who is not the Boy-Who-Lived, see what kind of person he could be without the responsibility and pressure that comes with being the BWL. At least that's why I read stories where Harry is not the BWL.
