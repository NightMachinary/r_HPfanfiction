A dark Harry Potter x Voldemort fanfic

I have no idea if it was on fanfiction.net, wattpad or archiveofourown but it's definitely those three. It's a book with Harry Potter x Voldemort and I remember this one part where he walks in with candy and stuff into a death eater meeting.

He also changed all the horcruxes for fake ones and was hit by a lot of crucios by death eaters when they thought he betrayed them.

Bellatrix also calls crucios “spankings” and says six spankings in a row isn't good or something like that.

This is pretty vague but I loved that story and want to read it again but I can't find the story in my history in ao3 as I made my account recently and my wattpad library has too many books to go through


** Is it linkffn(Dabbling with the Dark) by Nyx Myst?

  "I was just getting dressed," he said quietly. "I don't know how long I was unconscious and you said Rodolphus only had two days worth of Polyjuice. I was just making sure I was ready to leave when it was time for me to."

  /"Ooh, don't lie to him, Harry. Two spankings in a row is never a good thing," Bellatrix winced./

  *"Spanking?" he snorted turning and looking at her standing behind Voldemort in the doorway.

  "Were you here when it happened?" Bellatrix shook her head biting her bottom lip. "I was hit with six Crucios before I lost count."*

  "Six," Lucius said quietly looking pained at the thought.

  "Before I lost count, yes. I think there might have been two or three more than that afterwards. I'm not quite sure," he replied.

  How does Harry react when he finds out the truth behind all of Dumbledore's secrets from Voldemort? Simple... he plots to kill them both. The only question is whether he'll change him mind about one of them in the end. SLASH - HP/LV
