I'm asking this more out of curiosity than to find something to read, but hey, who knows. Basically, I'm not looking for "missing moments" fics (like say, "Not from others"), but say, fics where, despite a change in the story (say, a character in an alternate dimension, or a sequence of events happens differently), the character )or characters) remain close enough to canon to make you say "JK could have written this guy"?


** linkffn(C'est La Vie) is like this for most characters. Its one of the things I love about it. The main character is pretty shitty though, so you've got to take the good with the bad.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me) Has the absolute best adult!Trio in FF. Captured their personalities perfectly while accounting for being aged.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Snape in linkffn(Prince of the Dark kingdom). He's still a bastard, and probably worse than canon all things considered because he's still a Death Eater in this universe, but he's less bitter here because he didn't cause Lily's death. He comes across exactly as I would imagine.

**** No. The story has seven books, much like the main series. Six are completed; seventh is WiP/abandoned.

** I'm going to recommend two stories. The first linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is meant to fill in the time of the Marauders as if it were canon. I think it does an amazing job of this. The events that happen in the story /could/ have happened in canon, if you suspend disbelief for a few things (like Wolfstar for one).

The second is actually the 'sequel' of sorts to /Casting Moonshadows/, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind)

/Marauders of the Mind/ is where it breaks away from canon events. It's set some time after the 7th book, and it's implied that the events of the books are all canon within the author's two story universe. Basically, /Casting Moonshadows/ is the author's attempt at writing her own Marauder canon, the events of the books happen, then /Marauder's of the Mind/ happens.

The reason these two stories are so incredibly good is that /they could totally be canon Harry Potter books/. Not only is great care made to not contradict anything that happens in the seven books, but the way the characters are written is so true to how they are written in canon it's unbelievable.

It isn't as noticeable in /Casting Moonshadows/, simply because we really don't know James, Remus, Sirius etc when they were Hogwarts age, but the way they are written makes it very easy to think that's how the characters would have acted in canon.

This is doubly true for /Marauders of the Mind/. Harry especially (in my opinion at least) is written so well it's really hard to believe that it isn't J.K. Rowling herself writing an 8th book.

Sure, the author makes some artist licenses when it comes to certain things, but the overall characterization is done so well the two stories are my own personal head canon for the Marauder era and post Deathly Hallows.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.
