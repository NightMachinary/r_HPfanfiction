** Much less Hermione Sue - the movies amped her both in looks and competency. The opposite for Ron, whom the movie-makers deprived of heroic deeds and good qualities to give to Hermione instead. They also gave his looks to the Twins and vice-versa.

Less Midget!Harry crap (he was relatively short in the early books, but by the end of the series was at the same height as James, who was described as tall several times).

Less Pissed!Off!Dumbledore. No Luscious!Lucius with long hair and a pimp cane. Snape surely would be much more of the petty, foaming-at-the-mouth manchild he was in the books and less of a melodramatic Byronic hero.

*** This was the exact snide comment I had in mind when I saw this thread's title, but I'm not actually so sure. There are a lot of fantasy fandoms which were bestsellers as books but don't have a significant fanfiction community. If you look at the "Books" section of ff.net, all of the big ones were movies or TV shows.

This hits particularly close to home for me for the Wheel of Time series. They were massively popular books, but there are a paltry 1.2k fics on ff.net for it. Filter for English language and >40k words and you're down to 25 fics, for a series that was a NYT bestseller since before the first HP book came out. I'm desperate for some good WoT fanfic.

**** Actually, oddly enough - no. JK Rowling said Alan Rickman is EXACTLY how she pictured Snape - which is why she wanted him to play Snape, and personally requested that he do so. She wrote Snape's physicality with Alan in mind, oddly enough.

So, Snape really does look the way he does in the film as in the books.

I find him rather broodingly attractive as well :P (But then, movies or not, Snape has always been my favorite character - and I only like the first 2 movies!)

Any clothing they want to wear is under the robe, not visible because the robe is closed. That some characters' houses at Hogwarts are easy to recognise is because some people take “house pride” and run with it which results in accessorising the robe, but at certain parts in the books there are also moments when some character's house is hard to tell because there's nothing in the robes (assuming unaccessorised) that would help you with this.

** If there was no visual media, I believe we would have more well written fanfics. This isn't because the movies weren't good, but they would be written by /readers/. Harry Potter is quite the ontaking for a reader and therefore I believe they would have a better understanding written word, grammar, and a basic understanding it written story development.

Edit: I should have said a higher ratio of well written fics, not more. My bad

** I realize I am going to be in the minority here but without the movies, we would not have as many good borderline great fanfics. Hear me out before you hit that downvote button. The movies reached MILLIONS of people that the books never did. The movies have been translated into more languages than even the books, are shown on international television to this day, and there is another movie to come. I can only imagine what will be written about Newt and his adventure.

Sure, as a trade off we have alot of fantasy fulfillment, but we also have an influx of fics that while based on movie characterization, we still get those fics. Personally I would rather have a ton of fics where around 80% are shit, than very very few where 70% are shit.

** It would be a lot closer to the mortal instruments in terms of fic numbers, I believe. Still a lot larger than the other book fandoms out there in terms of output, but nowhere near as huge as it currently is. Would those be of higher quality? I would say yes, but then again I am biased. However, I do not believe there would be as big a crossover following as before.

Here's the reason why-a lot of people get inspired by visualising things. They may have a favourite character in the books, but they would have trouble transposing said character if they didn't have a good grasp on said character's looks. One of the most popular fate/stay night fics ever called linkffn(In Flight) was inspired by the hair colour similarities between characters in either series. Seriously, that was it. Similarly, when Terry Pratchett picked up paul kidby to illustrate the discworld book covers, it became a lot easier to picture the characters-and led to more people foolishly thinking that fanfiction involving the discworld was a good idea (as if they could measure up to Pratchett himself. Heresy, I say). So as you can imagine, visualisation is Important for a fanficcers' community.

The biggest non-movie related book series with fanfiction on ff.net has close to 30 books published about it-and it's about cats of all things (Warriors stands at 20k+ in terms of fanfiction output). It's at spot #6 and the next highest has almost double the amount of fics attributed to it (The Hunger Games).

So without the movies, the HP series would have a smaller fandom. Maybe with a 100k+ fics if you're lucky, but still vastly smaller than the 3 quarter million fics on ff.net alone. And crossovers would be significantly reduced in terms of output as well-think maybe a quarter of what's currently available (though I believe that these would be of significantly higher quality compared to some of the dross out there) if that.

The movies, due to how they nailed the visuals, atmosphere and cast (mostly, what with some characters switching ethnicities at random throughout the movies-though that's become a theme in the production of HP content nowadays) made the fandom explode. It attracted newbies, dabblers and serious fanfic veterans from all over and coalesced them into one big, intense ball of crazy creativity that is barely abating now (9 years after hitting its peak-which continued peaking for Rowling knows how long).

We owe /a lot/ to the movies, canon or not.

And pardon me while I have a fangasm at the idea of seven eight hour long seasons of HP done in near movie quality. Who will sell their soul to an incubator for this? I cannot for I am adult and male.

***** (thinking/typing out loud)

i don't think characters have to be /moral/ to be likable. the complexities of his emotional landscape- his viciousness, eccentricity, ambition, history of abuse etc. are all interesting to explore. i don't really want him to be nurturing, nor to be neutral- i prefer canon snape that's clannish- he stans for his own team (slytherin). he's tragic, and volatile, but with a capacity and willingness to perform heroism. i like that his political allegiances are flexible- joining voldemort, then renegading for personal reasons, to the point of being willing to die for the sake of the world, save lives, oppose muggleborn discrimination etc.

more superficially, i like that he's powerful and his general skill-set. psychic magic, spell invention, unsupported flight, dark arts/dada and potions prodigy. sectumsempra was his signature spell. in the narrative, he functions essentially as the Token Evil Teammate and resident bad guy- he has a criminal past and is a spy within the DEs, the one dumbledore and the staff go to for help with Dark magic. i also just like his general aesthetic- all black everything, creepy portraits of people being tortured, weird potions substances. all very 'evil-genius'. i also like the whole 'prince' thing, and that the narrative adopts it to refer to him. it's self-aggrandising and pretentious.

on a narrative level, i like that he's linked and contrasted with riddle and harry. (the 'prince' thing and his history- hated muggle father and (speculated pureblood) witch mother- directly linking him to voldemort). his prominence and link with slytherin- (head of slytherin, same alliterative initials as salazar. though he himself is a half-blood, and includes that as a part of his own moniker. and directly opposes the descendant of salazar and the ideology; he also chews out phineas for using slurs, another pureblood who stans for him because he's a slytherin) and that it's through him that harry/the narrative acknowledges slytherin. that his reasons for renegading are specifically love, one of the major theme of the series, is something i find neat also.

in short, as a character: he has a tragic enough history to generate sympathy and drama, is ambitious and powerful enough to propel events forward, ruthless and eccentric enough to be interesting, and values personal relationships/romantic (idealistic) abstractions over any evil ambitions, making him dynamic enough to have an arc/use in different contexts (doesn't have to stay a villain, can have an arc, be an anti-hero etc.) the narrative treats him as Important and Great, so you can justify him remaining in that context.

***** I think you're missing the point. For reference, I don't even like Harry Potter as a character. I also don't "like" Snape. As a fangirl, I don't have any snape keychains, trinkets, or anything of the sort. Fanfiction is /more than liking a character,/ it's reading a well-written dynamic between characters. How can a writer create a story where Snape is himself (a complete unlikable asshole) and situations force him to develop an intimate relationship with a current or former student. If that can be done that's some pretty good fucking writing. And there is some damn good writing out there. Snape is a complex, witty, mean character- and a joy to read. *He doesn't have to be likable- he has to be complex, interesting, and well written. That's what we get out of fanfiction.*

******* Someone can be a fan of a character as a character, one who has depth and complexity and was well portrayed -- as someone who's interesting to read about. I'm a fan of Dr Horrible in this sense.

Someone can be a fan of a character as a person, someone with traits they admire and respect. I'm a fan of Isabella Swan from /Luminosity/ in this and the previous sense.

Additionally, with fanfiction, you can admire a character for their possibilities. How interesting a result can you get if you start from a canon-ish base and mutate it? I'm a fan of Draco Malfoy in this sense (but not the other senses).

When Octro said she's a fan of Snape, she didn't specify which sense she was talking about. But she clarified her position pretty well: she's a fan in the first and third sense, not the second.

You're insisting that only the second sense has any validity. It's generally a terrible strategy for arguing to try to force people to defend positions they don't hold and never claimed to hold. The only thing you end up proving is that you're unwilling to listen.

No, actually. In your first message you completely omitted that, and in your second it was presented but somewhat foggily. I don't want to be seen as scornful, but do try to work on how clearly you present your viewpoint when you strive to do it “clearly” lest you find yourself in such disagreements more often than you want to.

Just to add to it, yes, I like the portrayal of Snape as a character too. Not his character, because I find him to be someone I don't particularly care about, but his portrayal---just like the portrayal of many other characters---is indeed nice. I don't think that makes me a fan of his in any regard, though, so that might very well be the thing that caused the other commenter to take what you wrote differently than you intended for it to be taken.

Maybe it's just because whenever I read HP stuff I always put myself into Harry's place, but I find Snape's "love" (read: super weird obsession with a woman who never thought of him romantically) pathetic. Like, he basically attached himself completely to the very first girl that would have anything to do with him. Not even as a teen with hormones to blame, but as a child.

Using the word love implies that he cares about her, which he categorically doesn't. He made a deal with a dark Lord, where her entire family would be murdered, but not her. That isn't love. There is nothing about that, that could be even considered love like.

Harry shouldn't have named his child after Snape, he should have pissed on his grave.

On a less knee-jerk note, I think the stations of canon would probably be a little bit different, given the omission of many subplots from the movies. Lacking the movies, these would have been more prominent, and we'd see more fics with, e.g., snape's task in SS.

The community would also be a lot smaller and perhaps a good bit less vital. Sales of the books didn't reach preposterous levels until the films came out, so there would be many fewer ideas and stories floating around.

I disagree. The movies came only after the books already exploded into a huge phenomenon. I don't even live in an English speaking country, yet our kids channel had an entire day of broadcasts dedicated to Harry Potter when GoF was published - and that was before the movies. As I see it, the movies only jumped on the bandwagon. I suppose there would be less new fans, but HP would still dominate fanfiction because for many years, and well before the movies, it was the most popular series of books in the world.
