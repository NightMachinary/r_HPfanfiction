So, there is this thing in fanfictions where wizarding families all call eachother (and even themselves) as "Dark" and "Light" and "Grey" and "Grey leaning towards Dark" and so on. Usually with Dumbledore leading the Light and Lusius the Dark.

I can hardly find any that doesn't have words like "Light Family" and "Dark Family" and "Grey Family" and "Grey leaning towards Light Family"

It really annoys me how many fanfics use this consept and treat it like it's canon. I mean, can you imagine a wizard publically declearing "I am Dark!"?


** I think it stems from a lot of kids not noticing that in reality everyone believes they're right, so they think immoral characters would up and say 'I'm evil!' Like in a cartoon.

There is dark magic in the books which was just magic that had detrimental effects or was dangerous to use. Some one probably took that idea and ran with it to make 'light' magic (which just seems to be non-combat magic as far as I've read), and called morally grey characters 'grey wizards'- not very creative use of symbolism at all.

** in short? there is five reasons.

1. many kids (and adults) have not yet dealt with their Freudian shadow, the idea everyone has that dark side. so its easier to make it hugely separate
2. Lazy writing to provide a strong contrast, this is tell not show aspect. just telling you its dark etc or light so you associate it with the terms
3. edginess and -edge lord- issues. By making Harry often grey towards dark he can be -badass- yet not evil. so they can write it that way without having invest in #2
4. there is enough mention of dark ( Magic, creates etc) and they have read enough fanfics they liked that did it, well written outside the crutch.they don't realize their doing it
5. trying to be over angsty instead of egdy.

*** 1. Some things JKR comes down hard against don't seem to be objectively worse than some things she's neutral on. E.g. love potions vs imperius curse. Just off the main wizard street, there is evil wizard street, and it's just there. No one seems to regulate it or enforce it. They just choose to stay away from it. Plus, there is the fact that, especially in the films, the evil folk definitely have an aesthetic.

It contributes to the idea that being dark is ‘a thing' and not the same as being evil.

** I've seen a number of otherwise maturely written fanfics adopt this and it always strikes me as so incongruous with everything else in these stories. Malfoys and other usual suspects actually describe themselves as 'Dark' and don't think there's anything wrong with it.

The addition of Greys, most often written as 'Gray' (which, by itself gets on my nerves) also skews the politics far to the right, which could have interesting potential for the story, but the authors use it as a reasonable centrist position. Needless to say, it isn't, and failure to capitalise on what little potential this, otherwise restricting approach, can create is why these stories are often similar to one another.

** To me it's just a morality thing.

Wizards unwilling to really harm others with anything more dangerous than a transfiguration, pranking hex or a stunner are light. People like Dumbledore, most aurors or the Weasleys fit this bill.

Dark wizards are the ones who crave power and would do any reprehensible act like Ritualistic murder or casting the unforgivables to get it are dark. People like Lucius, Voldemort and most Death Eaters fit this bill.

Then theres people who are willing to hex the unholy hell out of people, cast to disfigure, cripple or even kill without resorting to the unforgivables such as Moody or Scrimgeour. Those I consider Grey. Willing to get their hands dirty but not without damn good reason.

** The only angle I could see this working is if the author defines 'Dark Magic' as purely a result of political compromises, the government's fear of losing control, and various social norms about how magic should be used. In that case, if 'Dark Magic' is nothing more than the state's boogeyman to keep control over the population, I could definitely see people that are against this, reclaiming the title of 'dark wizard/witch' as some sort of badge of honor.

And at the same time, those that are in favor of Magic being (arbitrarily) censored and restricted, would actually class other families in the opposing camp as 'dark'.

The thing is, since these families also tend to be in the upper echelon of the gov by the time Harry rolls around, I doubt they would publicaly call themselves 'dark', badge of honor or not.

** I think the simple answer is that JK intended initially to write a book for children with a big bad villain and people ran along with it. My headcanon is that people will refer to themselves as dark to let others know that they will use dark magic to achieve their goals but they do not consider themselves evil. Voldemort says during his first appearance that he doesn't believe in good or evil, yet (can't recall whether he addresses to himself as such but definitely his followers do) calls himself a dark lord. The grey thing is a fan fanon addition to identfy a neutral stance in the war.
