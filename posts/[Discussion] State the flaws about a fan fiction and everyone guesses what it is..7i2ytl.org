I'll go first- Why the hell would the Potter's suddenly survive and pay no attention to Harry?

And it's super funny. You want critique about HPMOR, you get it, you complain that's tl:dr. Isn't "/Those are literally the same two sources that every person who pretends to have read HPMOR gets all their info from/" ? Where's your smart, and potent rebuttals you've surely got if you meet those links often?

Oh wait. You don't have them.

Because you can't oppose that critique by actual scientist. Because you're pompous and pretentious idiot who thinks if he knows few obscure definitions and writes long paragraphs saying how everything opponent said is beneath him, or doesn't merit an answer, or whatever other bullshit you invent because you actually can't refute, is smart.

Cut the crap, because you're not doing anything but wiggle and weasel and cry and moan, go to your /hpmor echo chamber, and circlejerk each other about how smart, how wise, how rational you idiots are.

I don't really see what you mean by that. Some say it's a bad story which is an opinion (e.g. not something "objective"); and I don't see at all what you're trying to say by "within the Harry Potter universe", especially considering the story does /not/ truly take place in the Harry Potter universe but rather in a very extensive AU.

********** It may be an AU, but it still takes place within the Wizarding World, where magic has its causes, limitations and standards. A common argument against HP that people use is that plot happens because of convenient magic. This is usually easily disproven by piecing together relevant parts of the book, writings on Pottermore and JKR's statements.

HPMOR throws away a good chunk of how magic works because the writer is very smart and science is /obviously/ superior in a universe where laws are clearly different from ours.

***** The least bad.

But I see where you're coming from. In Harry's first year there was a lot of pushback against him. Yeah, he ultimately prevailed, but you could see Dumbledore and John and ultimately even Voldemort acting against him, so there was this sense of "back and forth" between them. I feel that's missing now in year 2 (Virgo Malfoy isn't enough of a threat), which makes the fic feels too self-congratulatory on Harry's side. Especially the latest chapter 40 boiled down to "Look Alex, Harry's awesome". Hopefully the dynamic switches back to year 1 style in next chapters.

**** Haha, I asked the same thing when I was reading it and was assured it starts to really diverge around year 3. I sort of disagree. Like I said, there are a lot of unique scenes and sub-arcs, but the meat of the story is basically a rehash the entire way. I think year 5-6 had some really delightful moments, but 7 gets pretty convoluted trying to come up with explanations of how a whole bunch of magic stuff happens non-magically when it was really never necessary to write that plot in the first place. I did finish it though and I remember the thing pretty fondly really, so if you can just sort of accept that you're going to be rehashing stuff I actually do recommend finishing it. I think the writing is worth the plot.

***** I have no idea how scientifically accurate it is but I've read a couple times that snakes have vibrating tongues, therefore a parselmouth has a built-in natural vibrator. I remember a theory that parseltongue is not a language per se but magic channeled through the tongue. If you touch a sensitive area, like the clitoris, with that it ought to feel pleasant. There are a few stories that have a parselmouth split his/her tongue while using that particular ability, giving you a unique experience down under.

Or, the easiest explanation, that someone speaking the language of snakes is basically doing very fast tongue movements far beyond the ability of a normal human.

** Revenge-porn fic written by a middle-aged male misogynist in which all the teachers get arrested, Harry is "smarter" than everyone and constantly tells Hermione how she should behave (and she introduces him to her parents instead of telling him to get bent), and at one point the author goes on a prolonged fetishization of 14-year old Hermione's areola using such mouthpieces as /Hermione's mother/.

**** linkffn(Triumphant, the Dreamer by Shadowblayze)

The beginning about their childhood is actually pretty decent. Heather and Harry even have a pretty well written relationship. Even the fact that Heather is a self insert character "reborn" as Heather Potter isn't a negative. It just goes out of control with the OC's who magically have what she needs pre-Hogwarts. And the time frame is beyond silly. She solves so many problems in like, a month. There was also some 'pureblood are more magical' annoyances but I was willing to look past.
