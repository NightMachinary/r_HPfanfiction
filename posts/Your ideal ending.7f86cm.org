Okay so in my limited time lurking in this subreddit it has come to my notice that some people (Yes I'm talking about you)prefer a completed fanfic over a better fic which isn't complete. Therefore what would be your ideal ending to a fic? (Please feel free to rant on how four favorite incomplete/ shittily ended fic should have gone.)


** It needs to tie up the loose ends and complete all the plot arcs (or maybe sometimes point towards a sequel). It's a very (very, very) unpopular opinion on here, but I think an ending can make or break a story. An unfinished story can't really be 'good'. It can be 'good so far' or 'promising' but it can't really be good until it has a good end. Likewise, that promising story can be ruined by a poor ending.

And all that is exremely subjective. People will have different opinions on what is or is not a good ending.

** [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] has some interesting ideas on endings. There really needs to be a balance between closure and a future. There needs to be a sense of where they go next without forcing it down a path that people might disagree with. There also needs to be a balance between satisfaction and realism. We want an ending that will make us happy but only if it makes sense within the context of the story. Endings will also be changed based off of if a sequel is planned. A case can be made that if the story has a planned sequel then its not the ending at all.

*** I do? I mean mostly I just dislike endings where everyone gets married and has a bunch of kids at like 20. I also feel like that's typically not plot critical and not what the point of the story was so why's it there?

**** I could have sworn this topic came up and you had a lot to say on how you wanted people to not feel completely satisfied or something along those lines.

** For me, an ending that wraps up all the key points in the story but leaves some questions. I tend to dislike perfectly happy gift-wrapped endings because I feel like they aren't realistic. As long as there is some sense that that everything isn't perfect, but still a strong sense of closure, I'm happy.

** One of the reasons why I generally prefer long WIPs/abandoned fics to complete fics is that satisfying endings are actually quite difficult. I feel like the vast majority of fanfic writers who manage to finish their fics actually make the stories worse by finishing them, because the endings are typically bad.

Incidentally the same holds for a lot of published fiction.

The problem is that a satisfying ending needs to be:

- In theory predictable, i.e. making sense in the context of what has gone before, with suitable amounts of foreshadowing such that you can look back in retrospect and see how it all fits together, but

- Not /actually/ predicted by the reader, because it's terribly unsatisfying when a story ends in exactly the way you expect.

This balance is incredibly difficult to hit. It makes me pity JKR in particular, because with a series as well-read and analysed as HP, there was no way she could achieve this. Any ending that was properly foreshadowed would have been deduced well before the last book, and as such would fail the "needs to be surprising in some aspect" test. Her only way of introducing the element of surprise which is required for a satisfying ending was to introduce new elements at the last moment, which of course results in the completely different problem of "deus ex machina".

** I like the endings which have an author's note saying the fic isn't abandonned just on indefinite hiatus. Gives me hope. :/

** One that actually exists. Beyond that, it's highly subjective on a fic-by-fic basis

** I hate open endings. Authors sometimes use them when they wanted to write sequel to popular story, often abandoned in the end.

I like bittersweet endings where it is not all good and happiness in the end. Sure I like when the main protagonist survives but there should be some sacrifices on his/her part.

** I like reasonably happy endings, but tragic endings make fics much more memorable for me.

I'm OK even with open endings but it needs to feel like the author made it intentional and planned it. When the author just doesn't want to continue the fic and abruptly closes everything in one chapter - it is a different story..

** I like endings where the main conflict is not resolved completely and leaves room for imagination. Like Harry wins against Voldemort yet people say that pureblood supremacists will never die, thus, giving the reader a hint that Harry will keep going.

** A happy ending - the good guys win, the world is a better place, etc., with a glimpse of the life of the heroes a few years after the end.

** The perfect ending depends on the story that precedes it. But it's important that the major arcs of the story have some sense of closure.
