I love reading stories where the war actually takes a realistic toll on the characters. I don't mind angst, as long as there are a few moments of humour to balance it out. I absolutely love Stages Of Hope, it's honestly my favourite fanfic (and I've read a truly ridiculous amount). I'm looking for fics that are complete, over 40,000 words, good spelling and grammar, and well written. Do you guys have any reccomendations?


** linkffn(11926465) is a WIP post-battle canon compliant fic that deals with Hermione's mental health after everything she went through that year. edit: oh wait, you said complete. forgive me pls.

** So, mental illness, yes, long, yes, mental illness as the result of war, no, complete, no. 2/4? It updates every week, so I'll post it and let you decide.

Linkffn(the art of self-fashioning)

Harry is somewhere on the asperger's spectrum and has almost nothing to do with cannon Harry, character wise, but the fic is certainly competently written.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
