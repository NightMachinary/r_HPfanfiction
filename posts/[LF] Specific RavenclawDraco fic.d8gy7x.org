:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This fic was on ao3, and the plot involved Draco getting into a horrific accident with one of Lucius' dark objects when he was a child that basically traumatizes him to the point where he can no longer tolerate even the idea of anything dark. He becomes a huge bookworm and gets sorted into Ravenclaw. Pansy was there during the accident and was also affected too I think? And Theodore Nott took Draco's place as the HBIC of slytherin. Also I'm pretty sure something weird was going on with Draco's eyes. Any idea what this is?


** I looked for Ravenclaw Draco out of curiosity after reading your post and found it by accident.

Hereee you go, the plot is identical I think.
