I am absolutely loving this fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651]] and I am finding it kinda heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time but can't find anything similar. Essentially, Harry travels to a dimension where Voldemort either didn't exist or was defeated years ago. Thus, his family is still alive and Canon Harry (with PTSD etc) suddenly has a loving family to support him. Any chance any of you know of similar fics? :)


** Linkffn(Too Far From Home) Is the closest thing I've read. Voldemort is still alive but he isn't hunting the Potters in particular, at least initially. Relatively peaceful interactions with the alternate family. It doesn't go as you would expect. Very heartbreaking, especially once the plot starts building.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*
