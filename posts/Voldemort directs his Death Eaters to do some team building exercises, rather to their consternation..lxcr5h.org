** "Lucius, you have to let go. We need you to trust that Bella is going to cast Arresto Momentum and save you the pain of a 20 feet fall."

Lucius turns to the place where he is supposed to jump, then at Bellatrix, who is smirking mischievously. He sighs and starts walking.

"Lucius..."

"Yes, my Lord?"

"Your wand," Voldemort says, extending his long fingers, "Leave it here. If you are to trust Bella, then you don't need it to make your jump."

Lucius' eyes widened, and with true panic turns around, hoping for support. When he doesn't get any, he turns back to Voldemort, "But, my lord..."

Voldemort just moves his finger from side to side, in a clear sign of disapproval, but without losing his smile, "Trust, Lucius."

"I just-- Perhaps if-- Is this really necessary?"

The Death Eaters, gathered around in a circle, exchange whispers and smirks.

"Let the peacock fly!" someone yells in the back.

Lucius turns there, but another voice from soon makes him turn in the opposite direction with a frown. "Lucius Malfoy? I say, Lucius Malfall... am I right, boys?"

"If I didn't know he isn't an animagus, I could have sworn ol' Lucius was a pussy," another raspy voice added, among the crowd.

"I hear that," Lucius said faintly, but failing to locate the culprit.

Voldemort ignores all the verbal encouragement and awkwardly puts his hand on Lucius' shoulder though, "Lucius, Lucius, Lucius," Voldemort said, "Trust makes bonds. It's based on these bonds that we build a collective awareness of who we are as a team. And we aim to be a self-motivated team with only the strongest and most diverse of bonds."

"Diverse?" someone shouted in an alarmed voice.

"Yes, whoever-said-that. Diverse," replied. "We welcome everyone as long as they prove to be apt with their wands. Black people..." he said turning to a black man at his left who gave a curt nod, "Women..." set his eyes on Bella, who beamed at Voldemort, "Old... and young..." he added, looking at Rookwood and Draco. "We all are a single team. And as a unity, we are more efficient."

"What about Mudbloods?"

And, all of a sudden, a lot of nervous voices came. Speaking all at once.

"Mudbloods suck!"

"Yeah, they suck balls. Hard!"

"We aren't letting Mudbloods in, are we? I wouldn't have joined if I knew..."

A horse-looking witch in the back yelled, "Oh, won't somebody please think of the children!"

"No, no, no!" shouted Voldemort, raising his hands. "I misspoke, good observation man-with-the-lazy-eye," Voldemort pointed at the mad who first asked about Mudbloods, "We hate Mudbloods. They are filthy worms and deserve to die. As such, they are not, in fact, welcomed in this team."

Quiet agreements and reassuring nods were exchanged. Some even sighed.

"Oh, thank Merlin," an old witch even said.

Voldemort turned his attention back at Lucius, "So you see now, Lucius. We need trust to keep our mission immaculate as it is. I need you to trust Bellatrix, as all these fine people trust me to pursue and slaughter Mudbloods. It's a chain of responsibilities. And you have to do your part."

Lucius still looked unsure.

"Oh, get on with it Lucy!" Scabior yelled. "Thought you had balls!"

Lucius glared at him.

Voldemort approached his face to Lucius, and spoke almost in a whisper, but still loud enough to be heard. "Are your balls working correctly, Lucius?" he asked, faking concern.

Laughs.

"I-- I beg your pardon, my Lord?"

"Your balls. Your testicles. Do they work? Or are they just ornament?"

"Ehm... of course they do, they do work, my lord," he said, eyeing his wife in embarrassment.

"Then, why do you let the men question your manhood?"

Bellatrix cleared her throat.

"Oh, yes, my mistake. The men and the women. This is a gender-equal work place. Bella has as much right as Scabior to question the functioning of your balls."

Lucius huffed, "It's just that---"

"If your balls feel better trusting Bella from a 10 feet jump, we can do it. 20 feet was pretentious anyway. Baby steps."

"Oh, no, there's no need---"

But Voldemort had already transformed the jumping platform to half its size. The men, and the women, were laughing again.

"Oh... alright..."

And it was like it that Lucius left his wand and dragged his feet up the platform. Mocking remarks followed him all the way there. Unfortunately, he looked not less hesitant up there.

"Lucius... we're waiting..."

"It looks higher from up here, my lord."

"Lucius, you're draining my patience. We can't do 5 feet. Stop being such a pussy and jump. Don't make me cast a Depulso on you."

"That-- won't be necessary... my lord..."

Lucius went closer to the edge, but then gave two steps back.

"I think I might be afraid of heights," he said.

A collective groan came from the crowd. Laughs turning to annoyance.

"Jump already!"

"Yes, don't be a pussy Dad!"

"I heard that, Draco!"

At the end Lucius did jump, but Bella mispelled the Arresto Momentum and the only thing that floated avoiding the fall were Lucius' pants. THe rest of him had a bad fall, and on his wails it was clear his shoulder twisted badly.

Voldemort gave Bella a look.

"I'm sorry, my lord. An honest mistake."

"Very, well, someone fix Lucius shoulder. I want him back at that platform in 2 minutes. Bella will do better next time."

Lucius turned to her with a frightened look.

** Wilkes shuffled his feet nervously as Bellatrix Lestrange pouted at their Lord.

"But My Lord," she said huskily, batting her long eyelashes, "I am quite certain that I could trust any Death Eater here to catch me, should I fall." Truly, although she was a beautiful woman, (who Wilkes most certainly did not imagine without clothes late at night, nope nope nope) it was a hideous sight to watch her try to be seductive. Something about the expressions she pulled was all wrong, he reflected privately.

"My dear Bella," the Dark Lord said, slightly tetchily if Wilkes thought, "In these final days of the war it is more important than ever that you trust your comrades. Now..." he carressed his wand warningly, and Bellatrix took the hint, huffing in frustration as she stomped back to her spot in the Inner Circle.

The Death Eaters arranged themselves in a circle. Their Lord, of course, would not be participating. It was below him, after all. To his consternation, Wilkes found himself in between that filthy werewolf Greyback and Rosier, who was well-known to be less trustworthy than a goblin army in the Ministry of Magic.

"The first activity," the Dark Lord announced, his voice rasping smoothly over them, "shall be creating a human knot. Join hands with your fellows across from you, one hand at a time."

The circle immediately began to bunch up. To his displeasure, Wilkes found himself holding hands with none other than Bellatrix Lestrange herself. His hands began to sweat nervously as he tried to avoid eye contact. Of course, it didn't help that her grip was like a starving acromantula grabbing the first prey it'd found in weeks. Death Eaters all around grumbled as they found themselves in similar predicaments.

"And now," the Dark Lord said with an air of amusement, "You must untangle yourselves." So saying, he sat back to watch the show.

Lucius Malfoy immediately began complaining about someone's sweaty hand. Bellatrix scowled at him. "You think you've got it any better? Look who I'M holding onto!" She said, gesturing to Wilkes.

"Well, hey!" He protested. "I'm not exactly enjoying this either!"

"Shut up you oaf!" Bellatrix hissed at him, baring her teeth wildly.

Wilkes gulped nervously. Bellatrix's temper was legendary, especially after she nearly cursed an outer circle member nearly to insanity after he stepped on the back of her shoe. Geirham never was the same after that.

One of the Lestrange brothers swore loudly as he attempted to barrel through someone's arms unsuccessfully. "I am a member of the Inner Circle!" He shouted at the unfortunate Death Eater. Stammering apologies followed this proclamation, but he ignored them in a huff. "So uncultured! I swear to Morgana, when we win I will assign you to guarding the muggle-baiting pens!"

On the other side of the circle, a woman shrieked. "My foot! You're standing on my foot! Get off me, you overgrown mudblood!"

"It's not my fault you're clumsier than an addled house elf!" Another woman shot back angrily. "You great toad!"

"Toad!?" How dare you call my fiancée a toad!?" A man yelled.

"It's because she is one," a man placed diagonally from him shouted back. "And she's cheating on you with Williams!"

"Why, you little hag!" The man roared.

Angry red sparks flew up from the side of the circle he was on. Suddenly, everyone was scrambling for cover and drawing their wands.

Bellatrix turned to Wilkes with a nasty grin on her face. "How's this for you, sweat hands!?" She screamed maniacally at him. She let loose a nasty curse that he barely managed to dodge. Luckily, someone else tried to get her in the back straight after. As she turned away to curse their brains out (literally - Wilkes knew the colour of that curse) he ducked behind a long table that had been convieniently overturned.

Behind it, another woman looked at him nervously. "Hi," he said tightly. "Sorry, mind if I-" he gestured.

The woman nodded in assent, and they turned to look back at the brawl.

The original couple who had started it off were dueling each other in the thick of it. The fiancé was unlucky that his fiancée was such a good dueler, as she was currently disembowling him while fending off the romantic advances of another, quite stupid, Death Eater. Who she promptly also disembowled. She was nearly decapitated by someone else when a loud bang sounded across the hall.

"My Death Eaters," said the forgotten Dark Lord severly as he rose from his seat. Wilkes felt shivers run across his skin.

"Truly, you behave yourselves so... poorly."

Bellatrix dropped her head in shame, followed by all the others. A guilty sensation began to grow in Wilkes's stomach. He didn't like it, he became a Death Eater to get rid of mudbloods, not feel ashamed.

"And poor behaviour must be... punished." The Dark Lord walked in front of the crowd. "With trust falls!" He announced, clapping his hands gaily.

The Death Eaters groaned collectively. Somehow, this was worse than being held under the Cruciatus.

** "So I use the Imperious Curse to make him catch me?"

"No, you just trust him to catch you without being forced to. That's why it's called a /trust/ fall."

"Hah! I don't think any of us even trust each other not to murder us in our sleep."

--------------

While I left the characters ambiguous, I was imagining it as Bellatrix being caught by Rodolphus.
