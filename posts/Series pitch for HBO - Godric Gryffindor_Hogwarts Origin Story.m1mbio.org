I created a pilot episode for a Godric Gryffindor origin story that explains his connection to Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin and their need to build a school that was more fun and inclusive. The full episode synopsis and season 1 storyline/pitch are below.

I created this for me and my Harry Potter friend (which is why I don't include Godric's name until the end of the pilot ... was supposed to be a surprise), but it took enough effort that I didn't want to just let it sit and collect dust. Wasn't a huge project though, and only spent over a week on it, so it's not completely polished. If anyone reads it, that'll make it worth it. Thanks!

** That's pretty damn cool. Although, I feel like Salazar would know a lot about the dueling tournament due to his cunning nature, so maybe have a scene in the pilot of him sucking up to Talia. Let him betray the Red Robes for a perfect little callback to how Snape betrayed his descendant

*** I think adding in that Snape like struggle between good and evil with Salazar would be a great character arc, would be fun to figure out the fine details of what really sets him off but I'm thinking maybe if he fell in love with Rowena or Helga or another character who choose a muggle over him.

Thanks for checking it out!

** Didn't read much of it because of my short attention span but seems pretty good would love to see it in fic format but I understand it may be hard to write.

*** Could write it eventually but currently working on another project and script was a lot quicker. I got the idea I heard HBO was maybe making a show, so I just happened to create it in script format for a tv show.

Maybe one day I'll write it out.
