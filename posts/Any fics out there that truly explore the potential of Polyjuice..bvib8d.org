** True potential of polyjuice lies in sex business, and don't even try to convince me otherwise.

If it was abused anywhere else they'd put everywhere something akin to those waterfalls in Gringotts that wash out all magical alterations to one's appearance.

*** And once again I want to point out to people how magically inept most of the wizarding world is in Canon. I'm pretty sure the reason why there is not a gringotts waterfall everywhere is because every piece of magic (polyjuice, self transfiguration) that accomplishes this is because only a very select few people can manage to do those things anyway.

And we as the reader only get to see the best of the best in Canon anyway. Most of the teachers, some of the death eaters, many Weasley members (in the forefront twins, Arthur and curse-breaker bill)

**** Well, the waterfall may be something hard to make, and self-transfiguration is said to be hard and dangerous - if you fail, you can die, so propably not many people try it.\\
But polyjuice was made by a 12 year old muggleborn that was slightly talented. If you can't outperform a 12 year old in something that is basically magical cooking then i have bad news about which side of the IQ bell curve you're on

******* I feel like that's where a lot of realism finally comes in. Let's take for example working with pcs. Most of us are only proficient enough but not really wizards with it. Some people can do stuff with excel for example that would blow your.mind and save hours off of your work week with certain codes etc.

And it's the same in the Canon books. Some people just don't do the extra mile to do or learn stuff.

*** Let's take a look at just a couple canon examples. It was used to fake Barty Crouch JR's death. It allowed him to stay close to Dumbledore for an entire year. It allowed Harry, and Ron to "infiltrate the enemy." There is so much you could use it for, from spying to faking you death, and all sorts of stuff in between.

**** Death faking is more iffy - you cant leave a body, and I imagine divination is a thing more developed than trelawney teaches. Where tf is scrying, magically created eyes and the spell version of extended ears? Soo much shit that makes sense but trelawney doesmt teach it, meaning she's probably just not FORMALLY taught divination, but a self-taught seer.

P.s. i realise that in canon, tea leaf reading and the like may be legitimate divination techniques, but we dont really see her teach anything else.

***** Iffy, not really. There is a current 100% success rate in canon. Sure it's only, beacuse it's been done once, but it's still a flawless success rate. Also I don't think divination is that focused a study, if it was we'd see more of it.

****** The body was tossed into the veil before the polyjuice wore off the dead body iirc.

And I think the aurors would AT LEAST use a point me spell, which seems to be a divination charm - i.e. in both schools - and probably have better investigative spells.

** Polyjuice, Imperius Curse and a Time Turner. Oh did someone you care about just die? Banish the corpse, go back 6 hours, stun whoever died and steal their hair, use Imperio on a random asshat from Knockturn Alley to make them act like the other guy and drink Polyjuice discreetly. Here you go, the person you cared about didn't die! It was that random guy from Knockturn Alley. Too bad someone banished the corpse before the effects of Polyjuice ran off, no one will even find the corpse.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** The Pureblood Pretense does do some things with Polyjuice, but it's not really a big focus. Female!Harry uses it to disguise herself as her cousin to attend Hogwarts, and she modifies it to last for months at a time. She later makes another modification to it so that it does a fusion between the features of two people.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
