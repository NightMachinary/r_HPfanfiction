:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't think a lot of it was written, but Harry is basically introduced into the world of magic through runes. He accidentally makes a rune after trying to draw his scar onto a piece of paper? Like it was drawn with blood because he didn't have anything else and because he was injured while cooking earlier in the day.


** There's actually a fanfic that tell the story of him finding his mom's old book of ancient times before he goes to Hogwarts

And along the way he becomes a runes prodigy :D

I just forgot the title though :(

I sorryyy

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
