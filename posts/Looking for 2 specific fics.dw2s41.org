:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First fic is a post war one where Hermione and Harry die in an accident and the others uncover details of the affair that they were having. I believe that Hermione was married to Viktor in this one.

Second fic, also post war (I think), Involves Harry adopting and raising Dudley's magical daughter. I can't remember the pairing in this one though.

â€‹

Any help would be appreciated.


** Second fic, I've seen a few of them. The one that came to my mind and that I could find easily is linkffn(2057828).

There's also a community on the subject of a magical Dudley's spawn: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dudley-s-Magical-Child/103232/]]
