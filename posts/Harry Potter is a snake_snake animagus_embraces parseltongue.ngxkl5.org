I'd like a story where Harry is either a snake, snake animagus, or he embraces speaking with snakes and is proud of it and uses it to his advantage. Please only complete stories, no slash.

*** Seems promising even though it features a marriage contract. Forced romance if I ever saw one... although /probably/ not as bad as a Harry x Draco fanfic - that didn't show itself as such until the fifth chapter - where Harry isn't gay but Draco is a veela who would die if not accepted by Harry. That's the worst premise I've ever seen, almost made me vomit.

  Harry is affected more by the abuse at home,that, a chance meeting with a snake, and a marriage contract send him down a different path. In the process of being Beta'ed. Under Edit

** Try Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond. Best depiction of parselmouths and parsel magic I've ever seen. Bonus points for various other cool magic and world building. And it's (as the name suggests) a soul bond fic featuring Harry and Hermione with a lot of Ginny and Ron bashing but a honestly good Dumbledore.

(unfortunately Harry is no snake animagus but something different and definitely more awesome)

*** I'm a bit put off by the description of the story - author warns there's a lot of romance. I don't particularly enjoy romance. Can you please tell me just how much of it is in there?

**** I would say it's a romance fic in the first place. At least Harry goes to Hogwarts to finally meet his soulmate with the intention to marry her. On the other hand it's quite a slow pace and there are many things happening without romance and the relationship between Harry and Hermione could also be called a very good friendship (at leat at the beginning and of you can ignore a bit of flirting)

  Harry Potter's life was not a very good one, but then one day that all changed, one day he found a snake in his cupboard. Slytherin Harry, dark/grey. There will be bashing. HarryxDaphne (pairing could change in the future).

** Lomonaaeren has one where there's a whole group of snake people/parselmouths and they want to teach him, but I can't remember which of their many stories it is

Kiera Marcos who was linked upthread has a lot of parsel related worldbuilding, and there is an older story on her site that has him learning from a mentor from Japan.

My brain is failing me here, sorry I can't think of others rn, because there's some really rad stories out there
