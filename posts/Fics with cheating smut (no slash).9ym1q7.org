And it isn't part of the main pairing, i.e. Harry/Daphne fic where Daphne has sex with Draco. I would prefer if the fics have the woman cheating, whether it be consensual or not.

*** May I introduce you to the sick world of smut-fictions? Where any and all fantasies one can think of exist, where werewolves knot, vampires get erections, male pregnancy is normal and rape is a fetish even the youngest seem to dream of.

**** And yet temporary sex changes are pretty rare despite two canon methods to do so, lactation is non-existent, the woman usually is the bottom (even if they are way more experienced than Harry) and good luck trying to find something with pegging in it.

There are many kinks barely represented, at least in stories without war criminals as love interests.

***** Well, instead of Pegging we get Futanari-Tonks fucking a 10 year old Harry, - I feel sick just remembering reading the synopsis. And I don't understand why such stories still exist. Even written forms of pedofilia are strictly forbidden by law, at least where I come from.

On the matter of pegging, do hit me up if you know any good fics :P

****** To be fair about the futa story, the age is implied in one line only. I've seen way worse on Archive when I was still naive enough to think "well, that sounds a little questionable, but surely, paedophilic erotica wouldn't be that easily accessible".

As for pegging, there's pretty much only Linkao3(23223).

There's also a Harry/Ginny one, but that's a race swap and I boycott those by default, so no idea how good it is.

  It was all Harry's fault, of course. He was the one with the gorgeous arse. Hermione just couldn't help herself.

  In a way, it really was Harry's own fault. It ought to have occurred to him to inquire further about what his girlfriend had in mind before he'd agreed to it so enthusiastically.

I have only skimmed through them but from what I can say: none of those authors knows how Anal sex produces stimulation for a man. Rather .... weird.
