#+TITLE: If Hogwarts houses would indicate what kind of esper powers a person is attuned/have, what would it be? For ex: Hufflepuff would be support, while Slytherin something along the lines of spying, scrying, subterfuge, and survival, Griffinfors with offense, as they always charge firt-head...

I'm not sure such things are being attributed to a house with pretty much none of those things?

*** Look at the Snape, and Canon didn't do a good job at how older years in the house live, and what schemes they employ...plus, judging the whole house because of trio of gits, is stupid, when even that could have been a facade if the books and films were more realistic.

****** Well, what I'm saying is, if esper powers you developed were based on the house you got into, powers that dealt with spying, scrying, subterfuge and survival wouldn't be Slytherin powers; Slytherin powers would be things that made themselves look pretty or gave them the ability to bully people better.
