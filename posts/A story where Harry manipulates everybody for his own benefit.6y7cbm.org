Like some version of Palpatine or something. No slash or a mary sue, or a 11 year old harry manipulating voldypants and dumblydoor and making them look like 5 year olds or any bashing.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
