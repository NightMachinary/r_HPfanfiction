Seriously. Yesterday marked the fifth time in the last year I have gotten a message like the following:

"Could you please hear and write some of my story idea's? And I was just wondering if you could send me the full list of anime, manga, cartoons, video games, TV shows, books and movies you like? Also do you write xover and harem stories with or without H e n t a i women?"

The user in questions profile claimed he was a 27 year old caucasian male in the United States of America. It also had links to 19 videos on youtube labeled things like 'Furry Sex 1' and 'Hot furries' and 'Hot Female Pokemon' along with twenty-three links to popular songs playing over clips of video game characters. I clicked on one at work (brave I know) and it was FFXIII with Evanescence playing. Noped right on out of that.

Annoyingly, I am not listed as one of his favorite authors nor do any of my stories appear on his favorite story page.

But seriously. Seriously?! I've written nearly 900,000 words of Fanfiction. By the time I finish LdS it will be at or over a million published words. I have more published words on FFN than the Harry Potter series is long. I realize that is completely and utterly pointless and irrelevant but I don't care.

In my stories, there is a grand total of three times sex happens on screen for a total of just over a thousand words. So point one percent of my published work is sex. Why in the world does one person, much less five different people, think I am at all interested in writing crossover harem smut for them?!

It's not like I'm not busy. Since December 1st I've published six freaking chapters. I'm trying to publish a chapter of LDS every weekend through the end of February! But oh sure I'd love to shit out your smut fic about how Harry Potter is actually the decedent of literally every Greek God and some other jibberish I stopped reading at because, of course, after I said I wasn't interested and found the message to be insulting, it just HAD to send me it's ideas. They're bad. And I feel bad for reading them.

There's plenty of smut on the internet already. And there's plenty of people who enjoy writing it. In case it isn't clear by the fact that I've never done it before, I am not one of those people. Stop asking! I'm working my ass off on free entertainment that really stopped being useful to me years ago. Can we talk about that instead. Please?! Or the Blackhawks? Or the Packers? Or the affect the Edict on Maximum Prices had on the Late Roman Empire? Or anything that isn't a Harry 'Zeus' Potter harem story?!

I don't want to degrade erotic literature. Everyone likes what they like. It's never been my cup of tea and I highly doubt it ever will be. But is this what people expect when I say 'hey you should read my fanfic, I think you'll like it,' to my friends? Is this why my family has told me they think it's too weird to read?

I mean I'm by no means thin skinned. I spent a summer answering customer service calls for a freaking cable company. You name it and I've probably been called it. But this is exactly what makes me want to stop. A buddy says I should feel flattered. Why? Because people clearly haven't read what I've posted?! Seriously, I feel so happy when I receive any review or any PM. Someone took the time to actually write up their thoughts on my stuff to me. It's an awesome feeling. I don't even mind bad ones because they often make valid points.

Sure, I think people clamouring for a Harry / Voldemort romance in LdS are a little kooky. But I write romances, so I suppose I should expect it when I write a non romance. But if they want that, then it means that they probably like little Emily Riddle. And I want them to like Emily Riddle. I need the reader to like Emily Riddle or the second half of the story doesn't work!

But this? This is just someone that expects me to jump at the chance to write their harem story for them? Like do they think think I spent four years of my life studying literary theory, the English language, and literature to write.....that?! I read that message and my heart stops. I stare at it. Is that all I am? It's amazing how three simple sentences can kill my motivation for Chapter Eleven.

But dammit I'm an adult. In an hour I wont think of it again. And unless I die at some point during the week, come Sunday, chapter 11 of LDS will go live. But for the next hour I'm going to be annoyed. I'm going to brood. And I'm going to wonder how in the last six weeks five different people have asked me to write a Harry Potter harem story. Did I wind up on some kind of list?!

And dammit they could at least read my crap and be like 'hey write a story where harry is a professional quidditch dude that sleeps with women." Because I'd probably think about that (Spoilers: I won't) because I at least like writing Quidditch. I'd be perfectly content writing saccharine fluff like VP's epilogue. I like writing that. I could write a story about adult Harry Potter playing quidditch constantly. I could write fifty of them and still be amused. But I'm trying to improve my skill and ability and I do not think that is the way to go about it!

But I'm never going to write something you can masturbate to. That's not the point of the sex scenes I've written, and I'm just never going to write something that's actually supposed to be erotic.. And please do not take that as a challenge.

I feel better now. I'm going to go crawl into a hole again and regret this as soon as someone asks for porn. Oh well, maybe someone laughed.

I don't know if that's better or worse than my mom giving me a gigantic stack of Playboys when I turned 13. I remember sneaking into my moms stash of '80s romance bodice rippers, and honestly they were /much/ more graphic than Playboy ever got.

Actually now that I think about it, I have no idea what my mom was thinking. Thanks mom, I'll learn a whole bunch about sex ed from the /letters to the editor/ section? Maybe if I stare at this vagina for a few more seconds, I'll understand the monumental importance of using a condom.

I mean, don't get me wrong-it was the coolest and most awkward thing ever at 13. Just seems real weird to me in hindsight.

** I have /in total/ one finished story and one WIP, which are not even very popular. I recently received a PM:

#+begin_quote
  Could you please hear and write some of my story idea's? And what I was wondering on what anime, manga, cartoons, video games, TV shows, books and movies do you like? Also do you write xover and harem stories?
#+end_quote

I was more then a little shocked. Why is this person contacting me? I have never shown any inclination of taking prompts, I am not prolific nor very popular. There was some back and forth, mainly me pointing out that there is no guarantee I will write any prompts sent to me, but they were welcome to do so, and them repeatedly asking what things I liked (so, they eventually qualified, they could send me only those prompts). The list of 'promtps' that was sent in the end was this:

#+begin_quote
  I have a HP/Starship Troopers: Invasion, Harry Potter/Stripperella, HP/Marvel Anime 2011, HP/DC Universe, Harry Potter/Percy Jackson, Harry Potter/Star Wars, Harry Potter/Power Rangers, Harry Potter/Gargoyles, harry being abducted by hot female aliens, Harry Potter/Resident Evil, Harry Potter/Pokemon, HP/Marvel, Young Justice/Harry Potter, HP/Transformers idea's and many others. So please pick one and I will give you the idea.
#+end_quote

Apart from the fact that none of this looked interesting at all, and was in fact not a prompt, for some reason it was that last line made me give up. 'I will give you the idea'? really? This is not some gift from on high, I am not going to give up my first born for the pleasure of reading your idea.

Anyway, rant over. I feel your pain, and I only received one of these PMs. I can not think how annoying multiple exchanges like this would be.

It was more or less 'you didn't give me an idea. You gave me a checklist of things you'd like in a story. There's no plot, no villain, and no real idea at all. There's no story there. It's just jibberish. And it totally demeans the work I put into the other things I do.

I would ignore people that tell you what to write. I often make suggestions in comment but I never expect the author to follow through with them, mostly they are a suggestion or something I would want to see.

In your recent story I would like to see a happy ending but I doubt it with the amount of blood Emily has on her hands. So I wont probably get what I want but I expect that. You don't get paid to write fanfiction. All you get is a review and most often not even that. So...how arrogant is it of a reader to ask for more...... The fact that you're writing is enough for me .

Agreed. I even go so far as to skip them almost entirely. I skim to make sure there's no plot points I might be missing. But there usually aren't.

I mean sure, I enjoy a good lemon from time to time. Sometimes it even fits well with a romance plot. But it usually doesn't fit with literally any other type of plot.

The epilogue was actually written after like chapter five or so. I'll have to tweak some things for continuity when the story is done. But given that I know how the story ends....well...

Let's just say I don't think people will be disappointed. It's not a VP epilogue, but it's also not a PBP or Letters epilogue. I honestly think the second half of the epilogue is the best fanfiction I've written. But the general public will not see it for a while.

Personally, I have read almost all of your stories and am really glad that you don't write lemon as I find it distracting from the story, even in romance fics.

Your rant reminded me of a fic I abandoned that I found very promising... what was it again? I believe Harry traveled back in time and used runes to force his teenage body to mature faster, however also increasing his libido as a side effect. It turned into a porn fest come ~30 chapters later and I nope'd the fuck out of there

I've never reviewed your fics and for all you know I've never read a word you or Rowling have written (I haven't) but I really think you should write me some futanari coprophilia in Hermione's first year, everyone's into that now right? Everyone normal I guess.

Preferably with Loona Lovegood in the harem so Harmony gets a third pairing with a couple of pokemon and I reallly don't think that's weird, I mean who doens't beat off to Gardevoir or Tangrowth every once in a while. It's 2017 for Arceus's sake. Dammit, now I have a boner. Anyway, since it's their first year the Gardevoir should be a ralts since they're hot and the tangrowth should be there instead of the troll so it's like the troll walks into the bathroom and its people but instead it's a tentacle monster and it starts molesting everyone. (this should also happen when they fall into the devilish snare) See? Good idea right? Don't bother answering. I know it's a good idea.

Anyway I can't write this because the keys on my keyboard are all sticky for some reason. So I have decided in my magnanimousity to gift it to you. Your deadline is next Tuesday. Chop chop!

I recommend you do the same, as---assuming that your approximation of those messages is indicative of their quality rather than just a parody of the content---the people writing you do not have a brain and can thus be safely ignored. Alternatively---if my assumption is wrong---you could just write on your profile that you aren't a porn writer for hire and then send condescending messages to those who miss that bit; petty but those who fail to show the ability to read and yet ask someone to write them something deserve to be mocked and you just might find it cathartic.

** Hey :)

I have never written a review because I don't really know how to express the amount of gratitude I feel after reading a work like yours. Honestly, I don't know how to write a good review, because when I look into them almost every one is talking s**t about the fic, and not trying to be even constructive in their critic.

I realise now that any mp, and any review matters, even the shitty ones, because it never occured to me that someone was gonna read them. I'm gonna try to write anything after enjoying (or not) any new fic/chapter.

Keep writing! I personally enjoy your work, I've read most of it (not crossover or other than HP), and your fics have kept me entretained too much time for me not to express my gratitude.

Thanks ^{^}

** Well if there's one good thing from this rant is that I read LdS as a result. Damn that story is amazing already. I won't lie and say I don't want to see Harry get with Emily in some facet, but at the same time I can see this sorry being more about Harry having a existential crisis based on the two sides influencing him. Although at the same time the first part of that statement could happen even though you said it isn't a romance. A story doesn't have to be a romance novel to have characters get together, and considering Harry and Emily's interactions thus far, a sudden switch to romantic wouldn't fit thematically.

Regardless of all that. I wish you luck in keeping up work with the story. I and many other definitely appreciate it. If you ever need anyone to bounce any idea off of freely free to message me.

*** Same Guy. Best part is his story idea:

What if Linfred of Stinchcomde (Son of Frey - descendant of both/either of the female Egyptian pharaoh(s) and their husbands...Hatshepsut and Thutmose II, and/or Meryt-Neith and Djet) had 7 children with Circe, Demeter/Ceres, Aphrodite/Venus, Tyche, Sif, Fulla and either Freya or Gullveig. What if Ignotus Peverell (Son of Hades) had a son with Hecate, and that son got with Iris. Mr Peverell and Iris had a daughter whose name was Iolanthe Potter (née Peverell - wife to Hardwin Potter). And Euphemia Potter (née Black - mother, grandparents, great grandparents, great great grandparents, and great great great grandparents of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and Legacies of either Hecate, Circe, Aphrodite/Venus or Odin - you pick) was the daughter of Ba'al or Zeus, wife to Fleamont Potter, mother to James Potter and grandmother to Harry Potter. Also Ralston Potter married a woman who was a descendant of Marcus Flavius Aquila and a Roman Goddess or Titaness, Hector of Troy and Andromache, and she belonged to the house's of Crouch and Lestrange who did not believe in blood purity. Also the Fleamont Family were direct descendants of Perseus and Andromeda and Henry Potters mother was the last and only living descendant to both the Fleamont Family and to Perseus and Andromeda. But now that line is in the Potter Family with Henry, Fleamont, James and Harry Potter being the descendant's of Perseus and Andromeda. Plus what if Lily Potter (née Evens - descendant of Rowena Ravenclaw {daughter of Athena - who had a vision/dream of Frey's warthog Gullinborsti and that is how she gave the Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it's name}, Helga Hufflepuff [demi-goddess daughter of Týr or Hermes...you pick], Salazar Slytherin [who got his Parseltongue ability from the snake gods Mehen and Apophis] and Godric Gryffindor - son of Zeus and great grandson of Thor - animals that once belonged to him was an Eagle, Griffin and a lion which he got from Zeus, Apollo and Rhea as a gift) was really Artemis/Diana or Hera/Juno by splitting half of her/their essence and Divine egg into a newborn Lily, with the Fate's punishing Artemis/Diana for her hunter's crime's, Or Rhea/Ops helping Hera/Juno to feel a true marriage. And finally Harry is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin by a squib (grandchild or great grandchild) who did not have the parseltongue ability or Magic and that squib's lineage goes all the way to lily/Artemis-Diana or lily/Hera-Juno and awakening her magic but with no parseltongue.

_

So you can have Harry spend a full week (7 days = 10 years) at the Lotus hotel and Casino while artemis/diana or hera/juno create and send a potion/elixir to Harry so that he can be healed by getting a stronger and better body build (young mathayus) and with 20/20 vision without his glasses. also you can deage harry between 14 - 16 years of age with that potion/elixir. so the Fleamont Family were Direct Descendants of Perseus and Andromeda and Fleamont Potters grandmother was the last living descendant to both the Fleamont Family and to Perseus and Andromeda. But now that line is in the potter family and Henry and Fleamont Potter were descendants of Perseus and Andromeda. Which means harry could also get either the lightning Sword (Clash of the Titans 2010) or Divine Temper (Clash of the Titans 1981) and the Twin Knives (Wrath of the Titans) that Perseus used. Also at one point in time one of Harry's ancestors (who got with a Malfoy who also did not believe in blood purity) got a sword called Narsil to fight a dark lord during either the English Civil War(s) or The War(s) of the Roses. and this person fought for the House of Lancaster {House of Potter and House's of Tudor and Lancaster being family friends and allies along with one day these house's marrying} and he/she won but with the sword breaking into many pieces. later when Harry is at the Lotus hotel artemis/diana or hera/juno takes the broken pieces and asks Hephaestus/Vulcan to reforged the sword into Anduril. She/They also ask Hephaestus/Vulcan to forge a new weapon, one is a sword by using 25% Celestial Bronze, 25% Imperial Gold and 50% Blued Brightsteel. And She/They also ask Hecate and/either Circe to use her/their magic to imbue the sword with fire that is the color blue. And when harry gets the sword he name's it Brisingr. The other is a bow and you can decide between Auriel's Bow/Dawnguard(made 50% Celestial Bronze and 50% Sacred Silver, 8 Celestial Bronze arrows - 8 Imperial Gold arrows and 8 Sacred Silver arrows - She/They also ask Hecate and Circe to use her/their magic to imbue the Quiver with the arrows returning) or Zephyr(made with 100% Celestial Bronze - arrows same on top)...you choose.

_

After the war harry wants to leave Britain for a while so he goes to Las Vegas to see what it is all about. But before he leaves he sets up a trust vault for his godson teddy and allows Andromeda to use the Black Family vault for everyday needs as he reinstates her back into the Black Family. So harry goes to Las Vegas (the muggle way) and he walks around till he sees the lotus hotel, and he is drawn to it for some reason so he spends a week in the hotel. Not knowing that 10 years have past outside and when harry leaves the hotel he gets an owl from Andromeda saying that he is needed back home. So he goes back to Britain still not knowing that 10 years have past, till he sees teddy is 10 years of age. and he sees a woman talking to Andromeda while they are sitting down in chairs and talking when they see harry. they both stand up and the woman says that she's his mother and that she needs his help. So you can have harry appear in either The Titan's Curse or The Lost Hero. And you can name the story Harry Potter and the Olympian Trials: The Titan's Curse, The Lost Hero or something else entirely it's up to you.

I have a degree in English Literature and can barely comprehend that.
