I don't know if it's just being used to a male Harry in canon (and obviously the majority of fanfics have a male Harry), or if I'm just plain sexist, but I can't bring myself to read fics that have a female Harry in them (and believe me, I've tried). Does anyone else feel the same way, or am I just being irrational?


** Most fem!Harry fics stink, and the few good ones are incomplete.

fem!Harry is obviously going to greatly affect the plot since several key characters are going to behave very differently toward her. And yet, most fem!Harry fics are nothing but slavish Canon rehashes, even if she gets paired with Draco.

It's the thoughtlessness of the worldbuilding and characterization that irritates me. fem!Harry would be similar but not the same.

There are so many changes that might occur: Maybe Petunia would see it as a second chance to convince a "little sister" that the ways of wizards is /Unnatural/. Maybe she would hate Harry's guts for looking too much like Lily. Maybe people would notice a skinny girl with secondhand clothes and family who doesn't like her more readily than they would a boy. Maybe Sirius wouldn't go after Peter because the subconscious reaction towards a goddaughter might be different than that towards a godson. Maybe her upbringing would make her solve conflicts in subtler, softer ways as girls and women must do. Or instead, she might grow up harder, meaner, to hold her own, to prove that she was strong. Or she might turn to comedy to shelter herself, I don't know.

I don't hate AUs or genderswaps or OCs or slash or anything really -- I just want to see some /effort/ put into it.

**** I really liked linkffn(The never-ending road) for this reason. It has been a while since I have read it so I don't remember too many details, but her character was just so good. She was definitely Harry like in personality with his headstrong desire to do what is right, the sassy attitude to deal with things and yet a lot softer, less confrontational, with feminine qualities and more subdued. I actually found myself relating to her which I don't usually find is the case for me when I read Hermione or another female or even another fem!Harry as a main character. Also it wasn't a canon rehash which is always nice to read. The supposed future pairing of this fic still creeps me out but thankfully for all that is written of it right now there is no pairing at all at this point and everyone is more or less acting in character.

****** I still recommend that you read it because The Never-ending Road is fully complete and there hasn't been any romance. It's very possible to read it as gen if you forget the future pairing. And if you want to skip any hints, you could still read up to the Prisoner of Azkaban part. Harriet is characterized extremely well in this story. I haven't found another fem!harry that actually feels like Harry.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF.

I see this as one of the most common arguments against genderswapping and I think that while it sometimes has a point, it also misses another. Slash and femslash are written to fill a lack that canon has. The same goes for genderswaps: a lot of fic writers are female and a lot of lead characters are male, so of course there will be stories where people go, "Hey, what if this was a girl's story instead?"

**** The thing is, Harry is never overtly male. He's said to be a male, but we never get a real glimpse into that. He doesn't automatically start noticing girls as a normal guy would, his gaze doesn't lower when faced with a pair of large breasts. Not to mention Hermione herself being a sort of lead character and an important part of the story. While I find her annoying, personally, I know many people that think Hermione is "WOMANEMPOWERMENTâ„¢".

*** The best advice I heard about writing female characters as a male author was "Don't write women, write /people./" My problem with the genre is that, aside from how external characters view fem!Harry, not terribly much /should/ change. And yet some people treat the genre as if chopping off Harry's dick "magically" makes him/her a better character.

No! Harry shouldn't be awesome for being a girl, Harry should be awesome for being /Harry,/ regardless if Harry is a he or a she. Gender /shouldn't/ matter; characters should just be awesome.

And yet so many fem!Harry authors loose sight of that. It drives me crazy.

** It depends: I can enjoy a genderbend Harry story or one where he suddenly discvoers he's a metamorphagus, because it's still the same old Harry I know and understand. It's potentially interesting how he reacts to suddenly having a female body - at least as long as the author doesn't magically turn him into a girl (personality-wise).

Fem!Harry stories though, where she was born as a girl and always has been a girl are often really weird. Maybe I'm sexist too, but I do not know this person. Growing up as a girl (especially with the Dursleys) must be so very different than as a boy and when the author often expects me to accept that everything is just the same (being friends with Ron and Hermione, the troll incident, etc etc) it's really weird.

**** I think the key difference is that the other series actually has the female ninja treated a little bit differently so the authors have something, one thing that they can see in the story and don't have to come up with on their own, that they can use to show that now something is different without concentrating on the usual thing. The fact that the world of that story has a fairly well-known technique that anyone or almost anyone can use that at the very least can give someone the appearance of someone of the opposite sex probably does help it a bit as well, what with the fact that it's used for comedic purposes in the series rather than anything pairing-related.

**** I think it has much to do with Naruto's personality, he is brash, dumb, impulsive but inside he suffers from insecurity. this translates to a girl who is loud and annoying but has a vulnerable side you want to protect, in one word it's Gap Moe. then the writers usually pair her with stoic characters like Sasuke, Shikamaru, Itachi or even Kakashi this creates a good contrast and a dynamic that allows a lot of fluff and comedy.

Check out Hokage's Bride, Protective Instincts, All Started with a Smell, My boyfriend is a trap, Teacup Tempest, Threads of Fate.

on the other hand Harry is a bit more serious than Naruto, and he tends to brood and he really doesn't have someone good to pair him with, from the top of my head the classics would be Draco, Cedric, The Twins, Neviile, Ron. really i can not think of any character that would have good chemestry with Harry without to resorting to OOC.

** I have a soft spot for Fem!Harry myself (I'm in the process of plotting out a Fem!Harry fic that'll be very heavily AU and feature Fem!versions of a lot of other characters)...

...but I'd say that for the MOST part you're not missing much by skipping the Fem!Harry fics. Most of them seem to be pretty uninspited canon rehashes where Harry's either the exact same just with some swapped pronouns and a different love interest, or a super-special-amazing-beautiful witch who's just so much better than canon Harry but somehow manages to have pretty much all the same experiences as him.

I think what I like the most about the idea of Fem!Harry is the concept of exploring how things would be different for a GIRL Who Lived. Just how would the wizarding world treat "Harriet Potter"? So few fanfics actually bother to explore this, and so many just write Fem!Harry so that they can pair Harry up with a male character without having to write slash.

Actually, the only fic I can think of that bothers to explore the difference is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry And The Mysterious Case Of The Girl Who Lived,]] which is... kind of a Fem!Harry story and kind of not. Harry's a boy in the story, but he's under some weird curse that makes everyone magical think he's a girl.

** Fem!Harry doesn't really bring anything significant to the table that regular Harry doesn't in my opinion. The most gendered thing about Harry is his friendship with Ron. They wouldn't become fast friends otherwise. Ron is usually ignored or bashed though so that isn't usually explored.

In theory, Snape reactions to a Harry that looks like Lilly could be interesting, but fics usually take it to a creepy place. Even that could be okay if the story portrays and acknowledges that its creepy.

except for The Red Knight, maybe. It's not Harry-centric, but he's fem, and it's not that irritating. And also a parallel universe, which might have something to do with it.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** I don't hate them by default, as it is easier for me to identify with a female character and we all (or close to it) want to identify with the protagonist.

That said, I won't consider something good just because it has the main character changed to a girl if it's a piece of junk, and is it wont to be with any kind of story the majority is junk. Also, forced pairings can go die in a fire. Ugh.

** I can only read them when they're kind of troll-ish. Usually, when they come off as a serious fic, the plot and character interactions usually come off as very forced. Obviously, that's because the author is doing the gender swap for a reason, and that reason is usually quite arbitrary but the entirety of the fic will be steered in that direction. Usually that's for a pairing that I have 0 interest in.

** I can only read stories with fem!Harry when she's not the MC and just a supporting character like in Rent-A-Hero.
