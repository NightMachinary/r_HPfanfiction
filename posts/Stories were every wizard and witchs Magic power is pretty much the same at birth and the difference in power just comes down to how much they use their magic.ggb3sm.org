Like Tom Riddle who did lots of accidental Magic and was well and truly on the way to controlling his Magic before he came to Hogwarts ends up being one of. The most powerful and talented wizard of modern times simple because he used Magic more threw his childhood.

So magicals that do a lot of accidental Magic or learn to control and actively use their Magic before they start their formal magical education have a head start that only continues to snowballs as long as they keep using Magic threw their lives.


** I want to see these fics, if someone then realised this and told their kid to use magic a lot (somehow idk) they'd become super powerful, then they'd just have to get the finesse down and they'd be frikin op

** Linkffn(New Blood)

Hermione assumes that magic is like a muscle and spends every evening doing as much as she can. It's got a very "magical core" type system where her daily training helps her get a super fast mana recovery rate. She also finds out that magical ability tends to grow a lot during puberty and attempts to use a modified questionable fertility ritual to cheat the system. Then she tells everyone that although her parents are muggles she's a super-pureblood because magic itself gave her her abilities.

She also makes a ton of money by scamming pureblood girls with MLM makeup.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** The fanfic â€˜Again and Again' by Athey touches on this because Harry keeps getting reborn so his power levels keep rising. It's not just about that but that is a main part of it. It's a Tomarry fanfic and a good read though it's not complete. Link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again]]
