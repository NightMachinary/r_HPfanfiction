I've kinda got a bit bored of school fics if I'm honest. I'd love to find some new fics, preferably Harry based, post Hogwarts age or plus would be nice but the only real criteria is not a school fic. I don't read slash pairings and am not a fan of harry/Hermione. Any ideas?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has a bunch of interconnected short stories (and some longer ones). linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is a good starting point, with Harry and Ginny and their three children moving into a new neighbourhood.

linkffn(The Impostor Complex) follows the Diary portion of Tom's soul as it comes to the conclusion that the original has lost the plot and needs to be put down. He's still not a very nice person and has a bit of a potty mouth, but he's trying to help the world.

And I'm not sure whether you'd consider linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) to be a school fic. On the one hand, a considerable amount of it does take place at Hogwarts. On the other hand, the sequence of events is nothing like canon; this is an adult Severus in his younger body, graduating alongside Lily, rebuilding their friendship, and attempting to use his future knowledge to bring Voldemort down permanently in the first war.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
