** "Is he really going to jump down that trapdoor without knowing what is in there?" Lee announced. "Doesn't he has any bloody common sense?"

"Jordan, language." Chided Professor McGonagall.

--------------

"I think Harry is right about that git being a Death Eater," Jordan said. "He really should stupefy the racist little shit from behind and show the dark mark to Ron and Hermione."

"Jordan!" Professor McGonagall snapped. "Don't insult one of my student, no matter how distasteful he may be."

** Lee Jordan narrates the duel between Snape and Lockhart in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1237073][Severus Snape and the Boy-Who-Lived series]] by seekeronthepath. A student offers her memory to Snape, which he shares with his friends on staff:

#+begin_quote
  /The Weasleys had found their Dictaquill, and set it up with ink and parchment, hovering in the air. “Ready, Lee?” one of them checked./

  /Lee Jordan grinned. “You bet I am.”/

  /“ - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear!”/

  /Jennifer turned her attention back to the stage, only to clap her hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh when she heard Lee saying, “And here we are, for the surprise Lockhart-Snape duelling match, which is shaping up to be the match of the decade...”/

  /She edged closer, listening avidly as she watched Lockhart's bow./

  /“Lockhart is confident as always, but Snape is not concerned. Will his skill with the wand match his sharp tongue? Lockhart is acting as both referee and dueller here - a risky proposition when up against our Slytherin professor. And on the count of three, they are ready to begin.”/

  /From the stage, Lockhart called “One - two - three - “/

  /“Lockhart misses his first chance to cast as Snape catches him with a Knock-back Jinx - starting simple, good for a demonstration match, and Lockhart is stumbling back, casting again - didn't catch that spell, haven't heard it before, but whatever it was, Snape dodges. Ooh! Not so lucky, Lockhart dodges green sparks straight into a Dancing Feet Jinx - it's a classic for a reason, folks, and Lockhart isn't countering it. And Snape's got him again! Tickling Jinx, yet another first-year favourite, and Lockhart's out of practice with this one too. No sign of mercy from Snape, and Lockhart isn't yielding - here we go, Snape's casting again - a Body Bind! And Lockhart collapses back onto the floor in an undeniable, resounding defeat. No need for a rematch here, folks: Lockhart versus Snape, Snape comes out on top.”/

  Severus Snape is committed to the welfare of his students, and providing them with a quality education. And since Dumbledore isn't providing them with the resources he needs, he's turning to other allies for assistance.An exploration of what COULD have happened in Harry's second year.
