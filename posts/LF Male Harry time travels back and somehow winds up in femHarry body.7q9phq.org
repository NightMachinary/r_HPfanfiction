Obviously would be some sort of "effect of time travel causing ripples" or possibly went to alt Universe where he was female, etc.

Completed stories greatly preferred.

Kinda what you're looking for. He does time travel back, and he does become a female, but he doesn't wind up in fem!Harry's body. Would definitely recommend reading this story though. One of my favorites.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  "Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, pity those who live without love." A Harry Potter from the future travels through time to change his past --- and loses himself. A Harry Potter from the present struggles with his destiny --- and must find himself. No, they can't cheat off each other. (time travel, ewe, badass!fem!harry, tsundere!fem!voldemort)

  Jamie has survived an entire year and has successfully kept her employment at Hogwarts. Now she has to deal with a family that knows who she is, a government that doesn't want her in the country, and people demanding to know when she'll get married. That, and there's also the pesky after-effects of throwing herself backwards through time.

** Oh wow! I just finished a story just like that today! However it's still ongoing actually from what I can tell, but it recently updated in November 2017 so I'm not that worried about it yet. The author somehow made the plot in a way that simply draws you in. I especially love how the author just stays away from any romance. Everything is just innocent and raw with human emotion.

** There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][/A Switched Chance/]], in which Harry and Hermione swap bodies when travelling back in time. This changes their personalities to such a degree that they take new monikers for their new selves.

Has some good bits of magical theory in the later chapters, but gets chapter updates so slowly that is barely distinguishable from an abandoned story.
