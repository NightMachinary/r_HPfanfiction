i mean why an AU harry who is friends with Hermione from day one has to fight Troll in first year?!

like he accidentally stumbles upon the troll and says "hey there! there is no reason for me to fight you but i want to knock you out with levitating your club or what so ever!"

please remember that the Events themselves mean absolutely NOTHING! only the impact that the said event has on your protagonist matters!


** Here's a random post from a random reader that likes to read trash stuff for that one good paragraph.

Sometimes reusing events in an AU can be quite good as long as it has a point, or the author is trying to use it to point to something, even if they kinda fail, like a Slytherin Harry going to his dorm in the dungeons with some friends on Y1 Halloween and finding the troll and some slytherin children die, the author probably wanted to say that Voldemort would sacrifice his followers heirs as long as he could remove Harry. Sure if you think enough about it then things stop making sense, but it's not used just to add "The Troll Event".

On the other hand, a complete AU can sometimes feel like you cannot really recognize the world and the characters and it would better fit as an AU. Like a Harry that is red haired and lives in York and he has been accepted to a prestigious Ice skating boarding school and he prefers that people refer to him as Jonathan, while his arch nemesis is Danny Mallory(he's name is actually Draco but Jonathan and everyone else calls him Danny) who goes to the Seymour Snake Academy where the headmaster is Mort "The Lord" Vol (named the lord because he's a bit of a diva and he produced 70% of all the plays in the last decade). In this case I would prefer an OC fic instead of trying to shoe-in something.

*** After suffering through thousands of awful canon rehashes, I've come to an opinion that it's /always/ better to be 'too AU' rather than 'not AU enough'. Excessive canon purism and such only lead to boredom and disappointment; excessive AUs might weird you out and you can /maybe/ accuse them of false advertisement if you squint your eyes, but it takes only a moment of your time to change your state of mind from 'enjoying fanfiction' to 'enjoying original fiction' and just continue reading without relying on assumptions.

**** I think there's a space for fics that are just a little AU but have decent enough writing that they summarise similar scenes well, while developing interactions and events that differ. The consequence being a butterfly effect where you started out with characters fitting with canon, but at some point (not forced, just general musing) that the reader realises that the characters have diverged from canon by an amount justified by events and their interaction with them.

I absolutely love this style of fic, though it is difficult to find it done well.

** After whatever change makes things AU in the first place, any further changes should follow naturally. If Harry and Hermione are friends from day one, that doesn't guarantee that something won't put her in the troll's path, but it's certainly possible that Ron's comments wouldn't have hit her as hard if she /did/ have a friend. On the other hand, maybe he'd say something else hurtful instead (like claiming that Harry's just putting up with her for homework help, or that she's just after his fame). As long as the series of events makes sense for the characters and circumstances shown without needing any contrivances or deus-ex-machina, it's fine.

** Yes! It's so disappointing when a unique, original fic has to go out of its way to twist things and fit them all into the same events as canon. Like, you changed stuff! Stuff will happen differently! Why are we still following these same events?!

** True. Sometimes fanfic is so 'Groundhog Day', when you're essentially reading multiple renditions of Harry's first year, each only microscopically different from the other. Sticking to basically the same script is something that many writers do, but an AU well told has creativity, imagination and a logical approach to the changes that might happen and their consequences. It's more hard work, but something different and new is good for the reader.

** I've read fics where Harry became a god before Hogwarts, then went to the school and literally destroyed the academic records for everything he did, flawlessly plowed through the TWT, then failed to use his superpower of sensing magic to prevent cedric's death and was "somehow" stunned from behind. And used for the ritual. By this point he'd perfected wandless magic and even did a token effort, but the ropes were "somehow" immune to fire and physical force. And instead of annihilating Voldemort in the duel he so graciously grants, he is groggy from the stunning charm, which was a super special version?

I've read fics where Harry routinely tortures people to practise dark magic, and then does the troll scene to save Hermione, conveniently forgetting all the evil magic he just learned to defend himself and using the levitation charm.

Never underestimate writers' ability to walk the rails of canon to the bitter end.

** The thing is though is that plans have momentum and unless AU Harry has drastically changed the entire wizarding worlds landscape the first 2 years Canon events are going to happen. Dumbledore is still gonna set up the forbidden corridor. Voldemort is still gonna use a troll or some other distraction that lets him investigate the corridor. Whether Harry goes to the corridor at the end of the year is really the only major event you can really change. And unless Harry somehow shakes up the political scene the law will still be passed that allows Arthur to raid Malfoy Manor. This will lead him to try to get revenge by planting the diary on Ginny. By third year butterfly wings have probably shifted the world enough to do just about anything but yeah the first two years are kinda set.

*** The great thing is that Harry not entering the corridor changes absolutely nothing. He did not save the stone at all. Without him Quirrell would have stood in front of that mirror until Dumbledore showed up.

But if Malfoy plants the diary, the Weasleys would still take their trip to Egypt to "cheer Ginny up" (because even though they may look good in comparison, they are still shitty parents) and Sirius still would have seen Peter on the picture in the prophet and he still would have escaped.

***** Just what I said. The Weasleys are not good parents. They give their children food and a roof over their head and do not abuse them, but apart from that? They don't care. They don't ever seek out therapy for their massively traumatized children. They do nothing to reassure their children if they get insecure. They use public humiliation as a method of disciplining their children. They let Ron suffer through almost an entire school year without the most essential learning device for a wizard. They do not it care if one of their children is really embarrassed, even if they could change what he is embarrassed about with no effort at all. They only cared about their only girl not being in a battle, not even a word to her one year older brother.

****** Molly had a lot to say about Ron leaving on the hunt in the first place and consistently doesn't want any of her children involved (as far back as the order of the phoenix). Her greatest fear is any one of her family dying. She just doesn't have control over them once they're adults and, most likely, becomes resigned to this and so tries to prevent the only child she has who is underage from joining the war effort. This is the same rule that the Hogwarts professors set out for under 17s.

We don't really know what support they seek out for their children, I doubt they'd tell Harry about it. Potentially, they are too poor to access support which is different to bad parenting.

Also, my understanding is that Ron didn't tell his parents about his wand and so suffers through the year. The howler makes no mention of his broken wand.

Howlers are an accepted part of the wizarding world, just like detention in the monster forest or "dodge the flying cannonball".

Additionally, even though Ron is mortified, it passes quickly. Fred and George treat them as a joke. It's really not that big of a deal.

As far as we know, he never told them that his wand was broken. He never even told any teachers, because they would certainly beat it into his head that you can't use a broken wand. McGonnagal especially - transfiguration is fucking dangerous, do you really think she'd accept a student who could accidentally shoot a transfiguration spell at himself? That sort of thing lands you in the hospital.

******* I guess we did read the same books, but you seem to think that if something is normal for the wizarding world it is okay, which is something I completely disagree with.

We are talking about a society that shits on human rights here, so yeah, in that context the Weasleys might seem like good parents, but no, they are not at all.

It is bad to send your children to a boarding school, when they are only 11 and only see them once or twice a year. It is bad to buy your kid shit clothing that it is embarrassed about and not change a thing about it. I am talking about what Ron had to wear for the Yule ball. His parents didn't even care enough to get the ridiculous frillies off. Not knowing whether or not Ron's wand was broken is even more neglectful than thinking of it as punishment. You have to make sure that your child has the supplies it needs while in school and of course check up on it.

" He never even told any teachers"

The teachers are neglecting their duties as well, that is basically what all of the books are about. There are enough thought experiments like "Imagine what it would be like if there was one responsible adult in the wizarding world".

I am referring to the last battle, Molly made a huge deal about Ginny joining, her other kids? Ahh, nope.

Too poor to seek out help? We are talking about Britain, not the US. And maybe, mayyybe if you're too poor to get your traumatized children (I am not only talking about Ginny, Ron as well) into therapy you should not go on vacation for a few weeks, because maybe the wellbeing of your children is actually more important than having fun.

"Have you ever met someone who openly discussed some very personal therapy with virtual strangers?"

Harry is a virtual stranger to Ron?
