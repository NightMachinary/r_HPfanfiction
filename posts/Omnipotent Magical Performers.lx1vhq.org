In the magical world there is a group of performers. I say performers, they don't do shows in any traditional sense. These people (are they even people?) just show up from thin air and start singing, dancing, and performing. No one knows who (or what) they are, just that they are incredibly powerful - possibly the most powerful beings in the universe. Despite their immense power, they never actively affect anything but their performances. These performances, by the way, are incredible (or at least that is what I have heard from the blessed people who have seen them). It is said that these are the best performances, that being in the audience feels like being blessed by the gods themselves. This may sound like it would be the most peaceful thing imaginable, that could not be further from the truth. These beings are insane, if they are gods then they are gods of chaos. They never harm their audience, but they certainly freak them out.
