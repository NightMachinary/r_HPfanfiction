4. The Flamed Goblet
5. The Lost Prophecy
6. The Memory Pensive
7. The Elder Wand


** These are actually pretty good! I like 'the lost prophecy' more than OOTP. and think the memory pensive might be more appropriate than HBP. However 'elder wand' isn't as exciting as 'deathly hallows.'

*** I swear that for most of Book 5 the fact that there is a prophecy is a secret? Finding out what “weapon” Voldemort is after is the driving mystery of the book.

*** I feel the Church's prosecution on Witchcraft would be a greater factor in the story if Pullman wrote it.
