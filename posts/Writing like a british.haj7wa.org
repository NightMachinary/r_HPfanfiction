Im writing a fic and want to make it to geel authentic enough.

But beyond some particular british words, I dont know what exactly to do. And I have read before that there exists an difference on structure of american and british fiction. But I didnt completely got it.

What do you recommend me? Or what tips could you give me?


** Hi! In fanfic writing, this is called 'Brit-picking' your writing (it's a play on words for 'nit-picking', get it?). Its when you go through your writing and add in the linguistic and cultural differences. I'm American, so an easy Brit-pick that I know is that Americans say 'trash can' but they say 'rubbish bin' or just 'bin'. So if I were writing something, I'd know that all instances of trash cans need to be changed to rubbish bins so that my characters sound like they're in the right country.

[[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Britpicks.htm][Here's]] a great resource for brit-picking a Harry Potter fic that might help you. There's a lot on there about cultural differences, not just words. I thought the food and clothing sections were interesting.
