*** Most fics I've read were before 2009 (I just recently rediscovered this forgotten hobby of mine during the lockdown). I don't remember ever seeing this trope. Could you give an example because you made me curious now?

** Don't know if it counts but there is a passage in Significant Digits (chapter 35) where Quirrell got into the Chamber long before Harry did, and spent months talking to the Basilisk. That filled a significant gap in the AU in which that story was set.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
