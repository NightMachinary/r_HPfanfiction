** Wealth. Land, gold, property ownership. Humankind values material wealth because it is essential for their survival; to trade, to grow food, for protection, so forth. It's no wonder that those who possess a lot of wealth would be considered prestigious.\\
But house-elves are not humans; they have powerful magic that lets them simply multiply their food and summon up whatever comforts and defenses they desire. They have no need of material wealth, and instead value more righteous concepts as prestigious, like selflessness and compassion.

Except for Dobby. The one now known as the Robber Baron.\\
Dobby does not value kindness, or even material wealth; he values revenge, and taking what others hold prestigious from them. He and his inner circle, elves who have been abused by dark witches & wizards, move like shadows in the night, stealing away human wands, their purses, the bricks and furniture of their homes, and even their children.\\
The Robber Baron seeks nothing more than to leave Magical Britain barren; to tear it to the ground, seize every last coin and iota of dirt, and turn the inhabitants into his destitute, desperate playthings.

Dobby was not always so cruel; once, over a century ago, he was a kind and ambitious young house-elf, seeking to prove himself by making the world a better place.\\
Looking for a wizarding family to serve, he happened across Octavius Malfoy, who presented himself to the world as a fervent philanthropist, a charitable soul to be admired by all house-elves. Eager to reward such a seemingly kind-hearted soul, Dobby approached Octavius with the offer to become bound to the Malfoy family, trading away his freedom solely to show his commitment to selflessness to other house-elves.\\
But as soon as Dobby was magically bound into slavery, behind closed doors, Octavius Malfoy showed his true colours, a bully and scoundrel whose wealth was unjustly taken from innocents, a torturer and murderer who took great pleasure in tormenting and humiliating poor Dobby in between preying on Muggle victims.\\
Whipped and flogged, burnt and Cruciated, Dobby, trapped by the slave bond he once hoped would be prestigious, had no choice but to struggle onwards, through demeaning make-work, through excruciating torture, through watching dozens of Muggle and muggleborn victims with no chance to save them.

Decades passed; Dobby's metaphorical leash passed from Octavius to Abraxas Malfoy, from Abraxas to Lucius, and it would have passed to Draco Malfoy, if not for the actions of Harry Potter and his sock.\\
But this Dobby holds little gratitude towards Harry Potter; after decades of exposure to the Malfoys' cruelty, all while they put on a philanthropic, kindly face to the public, he is cynical and believes that Harry only sought to brighten his reputation in order to conceal darker deeds. Nevertheless, the now-free elf is interested in Harry Potter, interested in testing the boy and his friends to see how far he can be pushed before (what the Robber Baron believes to be) his true nature reveals itself.
