#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** There's something like that on ficwad

Only it's not exactly in front of everyone (there's the trio, most of the Weasleys, Mcgonagall, snape, Dumbledore, ministry people)

But it does book 1 and 2 and 9 chapters of the third book
