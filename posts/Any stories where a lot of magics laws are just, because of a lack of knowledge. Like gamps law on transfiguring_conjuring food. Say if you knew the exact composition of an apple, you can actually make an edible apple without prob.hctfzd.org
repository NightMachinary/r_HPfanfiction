** I think that Linkao3(689909) had Harry doing something similar with food. He also transfigures things by changing their molecular structure instead of doing the standard spells, and if I remember right at one point he accidentally blows himself up by splitting an atom? Its been a while so I could be misremembering how that happens. The explanation for why his magic is different is that Harry learned real Latin as a child instead of the fake Latin that Hogwarts spells are based on, so he has to make his spells follow different rules.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

If magic is "just another type of energy", that means that it's a part of the universe, and ergo, interacts with all other parts of the universe, like the universe tends to do. What this means is that the universe wouldn't make any sense without magic, and the muggles would know this.

As for your second point - magic definitely actively evades muggles. Dementors for instance can't be seen by muggles, and they aren't created or built, they just spring up around misery. Additionally, I disagree with the notion that it's somehow explainable through physics or chemistry or biology. It's magic, therefore it follows magical rules.

And that's chemistry and physics, two fields that are almost intrinsically linked. Any chemist could make sense of that explanation, even if they'd shake their head at it, but magic is only "energy" in the faintest, most conceptual sense of the word.
