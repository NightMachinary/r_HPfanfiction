:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok y'all this ones a doozy.

There was a fic say about ohhh 12 ish years ago that I'm searching for and it was incredibly specific and I haven't seen anything like it since.

It was a Harry/Snape where they got together distressingly early (hindsight). Fem!Harry, can't remember if the name was switched to Harriet or not. Anyway it also managed to weave in the four horsemen of the apocalypse via Hermione, Draco, and I /think/ Blaise? As the other horseman.

It wasn't light by any means and Harry ended up having a baby stupid early. Also there were a crazy amount of classic literary references.

All in all the fic was massive, I'm pretty sure ~800k words but my mind might be playing tricks on me. There's also a sequel with a much plainer title which is also escaping me. Maybe something to do with butterflies?

Anyway I'd really appreciate the help finding it, I think I originally read it on ff.net but their search functions are awful. Thanks!
