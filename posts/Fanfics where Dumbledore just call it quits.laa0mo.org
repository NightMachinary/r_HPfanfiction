Tired of dealing with a corrupt and incompetent Ministry which doesn't even believe Voldemort has returned much less tries to fight him, Dumbledore withdraws from Magical Britain and watches it burn


** “Dumbledore, I've had enough of you spreading these lies. You-Know-Who has not returned, you're just trying to stir up the people and steal my job” “You know what Fudge...fuck you. I'm out. Good luck, I'm off to the Bahamas. Laters you bunch of simpering cockwombles!”

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.
