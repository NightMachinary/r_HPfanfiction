Andromeda doesn't want Tonks to date Remus (for age, employment and general happiness reason), and so Andi decides to use reverse psychology to try and push her towards Harry (mostly as a joke and also due to a number of other reason) this backfires as Tonks runs full force for Harry

*** Is this decent? I thought I read it already, but I remember reading something much shorter than 80k words, which leads me to believe I dropped it.

Edit: Yeah, now I know why I dropped it. Christ.

***** Outside of the whole creepy "My mum told me I shouldn't date a 14 year old so I'm going to go date and fuck Harry" thing:

Tonks literally falls in love with Harry within the first hour she meets him, and begins calling him "hero" (despite Ginny telling her Harry wants to be normal like the day before) and other pet names in every other sentence; Dumbledore and Molly bashing, and Dumbledore is apparently torturing Hermione.

****** Honestly, I don't think that any of that is bad (I go for volume of fics over quality, generally) but I am concerned about the supposed torture...

**** I was Convinced this was like another story I remember of Hermione's Parents inviting Hermione and her boyfriend over and it basically takes place from Mr. Granger's point of view with him moaning his daughters choice of Harry over Ron since Harry has no family, rides around on a damn motorcycle in road leathers like some biker gang member, has no job and no way to support Hermione (with no idea Harry was rich in the Wizarding world)

I looked for that one before hand and got nothing and so when I remembered this one I mixed the two up

****** No it isn't this one thank you though, in this one Ron is the boyfriend and Harry comes to the rescue stealing Hermione away in the end.

In the one I'm talking about Mr. Granger knows Harry is Hermione's boyfriend but doesn't approve of him due to a incomplete understanding of his background. Like he thinks Harry is broke and mooching off Hermione, that he drags Hermione into Danger.

  HHr Oneshot! There was not a shot in hell that David Granger was letting his daughter get back on that death trap of a vehicle, and he certainly didn't want her anywhere near Mr. Harry Potter.

  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons.
