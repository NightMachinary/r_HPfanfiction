There are so many abandoned fanfics that I'd love to see finished and I'm sure many others share the sentiment. For some of them, I wouldn't even mind seeing being rewritten since I cared mostly about their concept or main idea. Maybe this post could become a list where people can comment links to ffs that are abandoned and we can uovote those we're interested in?


** This needs to be a pinned subject that is constantly updated. Its so heartbreaking when you get a good well written fic and its abandoned, especially a series thats abandoned.

** All Kathryn518 works. They are not abandoned but updated very rarely, like once a year.

Wizard of Harrenhal.

Havoc side of the force(again slow updates)

*** I'm pretty sure Wizard of Harrenhal is completed, unless you're talking about a fic other than the one written by disobediencewriter.

** I'd never rewrite or finish a fic without the expressed permission from the author. After all, they spent the hours writing it.

*** Uhh, but... isn't rewriting or continuing/finishing a piece of published fiction without express permission /exactly/ what fanfiction is? Well, I suppose /ideally/ fanfiction doesn't copy plot. That's hardly the reality though, methinks.

**** The reason we are capable of writing Harry Potter fanfiction is because JK has allowed it. If she hadn't it would have been taken down from the sight

The individual about you is talking about plagiarism . “the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.”

Each story written on fanfiction belongs to the author who had created that plot. To take that plot and story and say that it is your own creation will get you in trouble, unless you have the explicit approval of the original author to that plot line/fic.

Does that make more sense?

**** Rowling partly wrote to make money, which she did.

Fanfic writers are doing it for their own pleasure (and skill). As they aren't earning anything for doing it, I find it wrong to steal the plot/writing.

Its one thing if your fic has a similar idea of another, or is motived by x fic. But straight copying it? We don't even do that for Rowling.

***** To each their own, but I really don't see a reason to differentiate between writing fan fiction about original fiction versus writing fan fiction about fan fiction. /shrug/

Also, I don't think there's any reasonable person who would defend plagiarism. Dunno why that's being brought up. My comment about copying plot was just referencing the all-too-common phenomenon of writers essentially rehashing canon with a few changes.

To be explicit: of course no one should plagiarize, and of course any fan fiction written should always credit the original work(s).

** Linkffn(3855817) I read this as an 11 year old in middle school. I only found it last week. It absolutely destroyed me to see that it was not complete, but it brought back SO many memories, most of them awful about how fanfiction was my only friend, but memories of being so lost in books that I didn't care. This went off on a tangent, whoops
