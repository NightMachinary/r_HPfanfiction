It was titled "Marriage of Convenience" and I recall reading it on FF. I recently tried to search for it and realised it had been deleted so I was wondering if anyone happened to have it. I read it a lot so I remember quite a bit.

It's exactly what the title states.

It starts off with Narcissa bored in the common room, as the Carrows unsuccessfully to capture her attention. Lucius appears and he throws galleons on the floor to get the Carrows away from her so he can ask Narcissa to this fancy restaurant.

at the restaurant, they're served emerald slivers of dragonmeat and then Lucius asks her to marry him (I think).

Lucius is interested in Narcissa bc her sisters will be their salvation either way. If the Dark Lord loses, then Bellatrix forced them and their true beliefs really align with Andromeda, and if the Dark Lord wins, they along with Bellatrix will be his most faithful. But he also thinks he could easily come to love her.

Although their marriage starts off nice, the lack of an heir leads their relationship to sour and Narcissa ultimately, secretly takes drastic means. After numerous (?) miscarriages, she seeks out an old witch who tells her to bring her the blood of a unicorn or a dragon egg that will then be used to make the fertility potion. Narcissa at first says the witch's demands are too great but when the witch says she won't have a baby then, Narcissa agrees to bring the latter. Upon taking the potion, she'll have to lay with Lucius at a specific time like a full moon or something.

A few months later, Narcissa is several months pregnant. At first she meant to reveal it to Lucius once she was sure the pregnancy had kept, but he pays so little attention to her that she just never tells him. The pregnancy causes her to be very sick and she's lost a lot of weight/had a lot of nausea/dizziness/fainting spells but again, Lucius doesn't notice anything.

Narcissa passes out though and IIRC she comes to in her bed, Lucius having found and carried her. He seems sincerely worried and they have an actual conversation for the first time in a long while. Narcissa learns that he just started using a cane bc of a duel with the Prewett brothers while on one of Voldemort's missions. Because their conversation is going well, she decides to reveal her pregnancy. But Lucius misunderstands and becomes furious, saying he thought she just couldn't get pregnant and that he had felt bad for her. He thinks the baby is someone else's bc they haven't slept together in months. He's angry and he swipes his cane across her vanity, shattering her cosmetics.

Although Narcissa first is scared, she becomes angry too and protective, and she turns her wand on Lucius forcing him to still. She tells him viciously that the baby is his, that she had been prepared to slip him something so that they'd have sex at the right time but he'd been so drunk she hadn't needed to do anything.

I don't exactly remember how but Lucius calms down a bit and they somehow end up in bed together and he tentatively places a hand on her round belly and they ultimately make up with each other and it turns out their relationship wasn't completely loveless after all.

(edit: lots of red flags, huh...)
