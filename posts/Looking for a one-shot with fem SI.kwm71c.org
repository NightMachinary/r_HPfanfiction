I'm looking for a one-shot I read a while ago with a female SI that takes Harry to the ROR and rants to him then tells him a little bit about the future, pretending to be a seer. Anyone know the name of this fic?

***** Some SI aren't actually SELF inserts, but just OC from our world or really any world other then the fandom they're inserted into.
