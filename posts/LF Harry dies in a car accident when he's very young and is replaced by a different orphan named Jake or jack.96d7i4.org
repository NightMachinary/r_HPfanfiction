For the sake of time I'm just gonna call the replacement harry, he gets a bunch of James memories implanted to he acts like him. Dumbledore lets remus know so he doesn't really like harry, there also some sort of oracle cult that has Harry's love interest as a member but then she gets kicked out. Harry, after finding out the prophecy sort of starts doing things to get stronger like implanting wand cores into his hands and such, he also talks to a harry from another world. I know this isn't the best description but it the best i can remember from one of the first fics i read


** Is it Harry Potter and the other path?

** I've read the fiction, but can't find it. Some details I remember, that might help someone else track it down: 1. In the first chapter, Harry is living on the street going by the name of "Jack," juggling and fishing coins out of fountains to make money.

1. He travels every summer during Hogwarts, including to Greece, where he meets the Oracle Pythia. Pythia knows his true identity, but doesn't tell Harry.

2. Harry calls his friends the Marauders or New Marauders. Remus hates Harry, because he knows Harry is really some random orphan that had James' memories implanted after the real Harry died in a car accident.

3. In the last chapter, Harry visits the orphanage where he grew up (before Dumbledore took him and implanted him with James' memories). He learns that Jack is his true name,.
