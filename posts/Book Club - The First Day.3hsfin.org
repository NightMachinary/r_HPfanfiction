As a reminder: you can submit recommendations via the button in the sidebar. I don't get that many and in an attempt to vary the kinds of fics featured I often just pick something I've read before.


** Little0bird is one of my favorite authors, and a major contributor to my headcanons.

While the first few chapters are a hard slog, I read a lot of fics where the author tries to rush the characters through grieving in order to get to the plot, or manufactures some sort of external conflict to keep the plot interesting. Little0bird allows the characters to sulk and brood, which isn't always the most exciting thing to read.

There is conflict and anger, but it doesn't feel forced into the plot in order to keep the reader interested. She gives them time to grieve.

I also like how she doesn't portray the recovery process (and other internal character conflicts) as a straight line. I think that's one of the things that makes her writing feel very realistic. The characters have setbacks and bad days. I feel like Ginny/Harry were age-appropriate, they made mistakes and were still figuring things out. I honestly could have done without the whole angsting over their physical relationship, but maybe that's just me.

One thing that's great about The First Day and other fics of hers with a similar structure (More Than Words, Questions and Answers, etc.) is that the ensemble cast allows her to sort of check in with the characters as needed. It's like their lives are 85% dull banality and 15% conflict/drama/problems, and she shows us 25% of their lives.

** The First Day is very good but it also exemplifies the main problem fics that adhere to the book ending and comply with the epilogue tend to have: not a lot happens. It is very very good though, it manages to deal with multiple characters, both main and secondary without a problem and makes them interesting in their own way without overshadowing each other.

I think that was kind of the point. It's a slice of life fic. It was about dealing with the aftermath of canon, not introducing a new plotline really.

I thought the characterization was really good. It's been a few weeks since I finished it so it's not fresh in my mind, but I remember particularly liking the characterization of Ron.

** It has been ages since I last read /The First Day/. Back then I loved it, especially since it gave me more Harry Potter after Deathly Hallows ended.

Now, while rereading, I can't help but feel a little jaded. I am one of the many who didn't really liked Rowling's epilogue, but I liked /The First Day/, not because it was action packed or anything, but just because it gave me another shot of HP.

Let me just say, the writing was really great, but (when reading it now) there is always in the back of my mind the absurdity of Rowling's names and pairings.

*TL;DR:* Characterwise it totally holds up, canonwise I didn't buy it anymore.

*** I get that. I'm usually pretty EWE myself, but I don't really mind epilogue compliance if it's well written.

*** Do you mean the pairings/names seen in the epilogue, or the pairings/names JKR later revealed?

Because I know that little0bird holds to the epilogue, but she alters Bill/George/Percy/Charlie's branches of the family tree.

**** Both. Little0bird's deviation from canon is a good thing, though.

** I liked this fic. Its a change of pace from what I usually read. I think sometimes life after a giant adventure is harder for a hero to cope with. I saw what happens to Harry in this happen to a few blokes I know that we're in the gulf wars. Normal life takes time to adjust to after you've seen a lot of trauma. I love how ron and Harry both thought things were going to be peachy after the war but they aren't. Great fic

** I read it a month ago so I don't really know all the details anymore but I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of these kind of fics, romance, a good story and also just normal day stuff. While it didn't become my new fav fic it became a solid 8/10 fic for me which I enjoyed reading and I will read it again sometime.

** This was one of the first stories I've read since getting in to HP fic. On the one hand I really do enjoy seeing how things unfolded for the gang following the last battle, now that I've re-skimmed for this book club I find it lacks a little in terms of plot for me. I like slice of life and recovery stories but I think the author does a bit better in subsequent stories in the series with pacing and plot. The characters ring very true in all this author's work too, so I am that much more forgiving of anything else.

I will say this definitely has a fond place in my fic heart, even if I've read some more engaging stuff since. I think it does a good job of showing the characters cope with all that's happened, but also how they are developing as adults too.

** Finally got around to finishing The First Day, I really liked it. I enjoy slice of life stories, and this one was really emotionally moving at some points. I didn't like the few time jumps (minorly distracting), but I did like how it focuses on each and every one of them.

The one thing that /really/ bothered me was Katie's choice bear the end. I wish there had been some kind of resolution or closure to that part, but eh. That would've put it over a year.
