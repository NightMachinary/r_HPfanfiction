What an exhilarating ride. I am in no way a competent critic, and would probably have to reread and annotate to put together a somewhat coherent review, so here are just some of my brief thoughts, and a recommendation. Everything below is relatively spoiler free.

First for those who haven't read it, Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived takes place in the Secret World of Alex Mack universe, one without magic, in which Hermione Granger, after attracting the attention of a secretive agency with her impressive talent for hacking and data analysis, is invited to a specialized school in Scotland for the genius, skilled, and rich, where she meets Ronald Wellesley, son of Mariam and Arthur Wellesley and grandson to the Duke and Duchess of Wellington, and Harry Potter, son of 007 James Potter. A very..unique premise, to be sure, but extremely intriguing,

Plot: It is a rehash of canon, but with a unique and refreshing twist that is executed very well. The author is either very knowledgeable, well-researched, or both, and is creative in translating the world of magic with witches and wizards into a consistent secretive community with pseudo, but still realistically grounded technology and highly trained agents. At some points it's even a bit self-indulgent, but I had far too much fun to care.

As nitpicks, some of the names I find a tad silly, and the epilogue disappointed me just a bit, but only because I had my own vision for it.

Character: I think they are rather well done. All characters develop and grow, and their arcs are concluded satisfyingly. The trio are hugely upgraded, but not overly so, and in a manner logical to the premise the author has set up. Hermione is a nearly unprecedented genius who borders upon being a Mary Sue, but has significant flaws and makes mistakes that carry heavy consequences. Ron is a better strategic and tactical mind and gifted in martial arts, but still blunders with emotions and retains an inferiority complex due to his extremely successful brothers. Harry is prodigious with weapons and a natural agent, but reckless and brash. Together they work seamlessly, an almost suspicious serendipity.

Side characters, such as Ginny and Neville, prove themselves very capable as well, and vital to the plot. Even relatively minor characters, such as Alicia, Lavender, Romilda, and Pansy, are fleshed out with their own history and skillsets. These aren't the average teenagers who happen to possess magic, but are either the children of nobility, or children who have demonstrated potential.

As a side note, Dumbledore is done so very well here. Saying more would probably reveal too much.

Writing: There are extended lengths of heavy exposition, the dialogue is dense, and the technobabble is intense. I did find my eyes wandering a bit during some of longer paragraphs, but it pays dividends to remember the little details. However, the writing is not without its charm, with healthy doses of wit and humor that made me snort and laugh out loud at times. There are some impactful moments of emotion too, where I teared up a bit, with only one notable exception (though in hindsight is forgivable). There is also a small feminist undercurrent, but it's not distracting or over righteous, and makes sense, since it is written from Hermione's perspective.

All in all, an enjoyable read, and easily one of my favorites. If you've read it before, please share your thoughts; I'd love to discuss with you. If not,I highly recommend it, though it is lengthy, with over half a million words and two hundred chapters.

*** It depends on what you like. /League of Extraordinary Women/ was a good read, but not particularly memorable. /Secret Return of Alex Mack/ is a neat premise, but it's also a very long megacrossover with a lot of obscure franchises (at 1.2M words) that drags on without a clear conclusion, and the author's "Girl Power!" tendencies, which are in many ways refreshing, sometimes slip into outright misandry, IMO.

** I absolutely love it. It's one of the few fics I have reread. It's really interesting to see how the characters have been altered and how that fits into their cannon personalities, especially to read the Weasleys/Wellesleys as rich for once. It's fun to imagine Harry "I don't kill people that's the Death Eaters' job" Potter and Albus "death is but the next great adventure" Dumbledore mowing down people with Uzis.

Despite that, it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's really refreshing to get a good balance of humor and darkness in a fic.

I love how each of the characters have their own skillsets and specialties, but I would have loved to see that even more. Hermione's skills are a bit too broad and I think it would be really cool to see those skills spread around. So sure, make her be a great hacker and gadgeteer, but I think it would be cool to see those skills in Luna and the twins respectively. For Luna, maybe the Quibbler is an online forum and the things she believes is from that forum; I would have loved to see tinfoil hat! Luna (and it would give them a reason to introduce Luna when they did). As for the twins, it could set them up to start their shop for gadgets, or set them up as Team Potter's agent Q.

How to hold interest through two hundred chapters heavy with exposition and six-syllable words. Some of the comedic scenes are absolute gold, and then you have some darker scenes so visceral it honestly shocked me.

I agree with you that some of Hermione's many talents should've been distributed among the side characters. I thought having the twins become gadgeteers was obvious, but [[/s][Spoiler]]. Team Potter never used Luna for her Quibbler connections, but [[/s][Spoiler]]

*** Harry Potter to me was never really about magic, but the characters. Hogwarts would never feel the same without the beloved trio or the huge bevy of secondary characters that made an otherwise poorly planned fantastical world riddled with logic gaps and plot holes enjoyable.

Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Live do each character justice, even with the changes. ESPECIALLY Dumbledore, who is absolutely done better here than anywhere else in my opinion.

** I read this about 6 months ago and absolutely adored it. Like you said, it is a rehash, but I still was completely incapable of putting it down. I couldn't wait to see how the author would explain things in a techno sense rather than a magical one. I really loved the characterizations (especially of the minor characters). The kids did seem crazy smart, but considering it's a secret spy school I could forgive that.

** It was enjoyable but I actually gave up after 4th year (I do plan to return at some point).

My main complaint rests on the main character-'Hermione'. She felt bland and largely uninteresting (it /has/ been a while since I read it and it may improve later on). I also found myself lacking characters to truly empathise with, I liked the characters in general-but I didn't feel connected to them in the same way I did to the characters in the original text.

This became a problem the further I read, I enjoy fics (and stories) that take me on an emotional journey and although I was enticed by the plot and the world, there wasn't any moment where the story made me feel something. Character plights meant nothing when I wasn't attached to the characters.

Overall, I thought it was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to other people-if only for the world which is very interesting and well developed (it actually got me into Polo for a short period of time-and for that matter it lead me to research a lot of history which is never a bad thing)-but I don't think I could ever re-read it (when I do finally finish it)

*** I think that's a valid criticism. The author instills such confidence into these characters that you can't but feel that everything will be fine in the end, which eliminates any sense of stakes or urgency. This is especially noticeable in Hermione, who seems to know EVERYTHING. Personally it never really bothered me, but I can see why it bothers you.

Still, I urge you to continue and finish. Hermione has plenty of depths hidden behind all of that technical prowess evident from the very beginning, but perhaps becomes more apparent in the latter half.

Fifth year is admittedly self indulgent, but I couldn't stop laughing. Imagine canon Umbridge trying to control a school of disgruntled teenagers trained in espionage.
