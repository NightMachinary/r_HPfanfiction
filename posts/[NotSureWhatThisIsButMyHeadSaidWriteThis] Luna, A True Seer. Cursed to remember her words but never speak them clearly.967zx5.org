** See, the problem with ever the fuck you've decided to do with your post flair, is that no one has any goddamn clue what the point of this post is.

Is this a Prompt? Are you looking for a specific story? Are you requesting a story with this premise? Is this just useless Meta?

What the hell?

*** I don't know. My brain decided to say fuck it, your creating a reddit post. You obviously decided to read the flair and the title so unless you have severe mental condition, in which reddit content isn't the stuff you should be browsing(not healthy for the mind these days), then you should know what this post is about.

Have a good day sir/mam/it/troll/bot/thing May you continue to have pleasure at other expense

**** u/FerusGrim:

  I don't know.
#+end_quote

You literally said this in response to me asking what this post was about, then followed it with

#+begin_quote
  [ . . . ] unless you have severe mental condition [ . . . ] then you should know what this post is about
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  sir/mam/it/troll/bot/thing
#+end_quote

Why am I a troll/bot or any of the above because, due to you not properly utilizing a flair, I have no idea what you're asking for? Typically when people post something similar to what you've posted, people will respond with stories that kind of fit the premise requested. But you didn't /ask/ people to do that in your post description, your title doesn't reflect what you want, and your flair is useless.

I'm not attempting to "have pleasure at your expense" or anyone else's. I want to know how to properly respond to your post, assuming it's a post meant to be responded to.

No clue what you identify so I wouldn't know how to /properly respond to your comment/

Why else would you make fun of a person's post than to

#+begin_quote
  have pleasure at my expense
#+end_quote

With your response

#+begin_quote
  useless meta

  no one has a fucking clue
#+end_quote

If you don't like the content, leave. No one needs haters on this subreddit for people having good natured fun

****** I, at no point, made fun of your post. "Meta" is a literal flair that we have to discuss the subreddit itself, which you weren't, thus it would be "useless" Meta. That's why Meta was capitalized.

  If you don't like the content, leave.

I haven't even commented on your content, let alone state that I didn't like it. I'm asking /what you're looking for/ and explaining that properly flairing is not only *literally rule 8 of the subreddit* but helps facilitate the responses that you want.
