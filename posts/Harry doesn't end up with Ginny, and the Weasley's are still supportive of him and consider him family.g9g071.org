As it says, looking for stories where Harry isn't with Ginny, but the Weasley's still consider him family.

Doesn't matter the plot, or who he's with.

No Lord Potter, no Harem Harry, no OP Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine but I'd like for it to be believable enough.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual.


** preposterous. If he doesn't marry Ginny, then how will Molly steal his inheritance?

** I like this.

One of the most touching moments in canon was Molly passing on her brother's watch to Harry. It's a shame that so many fanfics depict her as some sort of thieving shrew.

** I gotchu linkffn(9406877) it's a few chapters in where it shows up. Harry is bi but romance isn't the focus, and honestly it's mostly about family and friendships. Also has Parseltongue that actually serves a purpose in the story instead of being a house trunk locking mechanism. And where Harry has titles but he hates them because of responsabilities. And actually interesting OCs. Honestly it has a lot of cool things going.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

** I know a few stories like this, I am trying to remember them but plots blur after a while.

Delicate - linkffn(2926255) - A misunderstanding and drama between the family in the beginning but they work things out and still treat each as family.

Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift - linkffn(7969757) - Another story where Harry isn't with Ginny but the family is supportive.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A well thought out and interesting world-building story that also delves more into the magical culture. It does start out Ginny and Harry but they end up breaking up yet the family is still supportive.

There are more but I can't think of them at the top of my head.

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.
