** Not really seduced as in romance, but seduced as in comes to like/appreciate/not be entirely disgusted by the dark side. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] is a Hellraiser cross oneshot. The buildup is amazing, and the whole thing is well written.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn?t mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry?s brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
