** There is a fan theory that Crookshanks is in fact the Potter's cat... which explains why he immediately attacked Peter, and was so friendly with Sirius.

*** Now I wish of a fiction of Crookshanks heavily featured after book 3. (There probably exists fics like that but I actively avoid fics with Hermione as one of themain characters).

** Oooh, in ffnlink(Accidental Animagus) Harry's new family visits his original house and they find his parents' cat. It was very sweet but the poor dear was too old to go to Hogwarts when time came.

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.

*** Good premise. Read through the whole thing, and it's a shame that the author hides updates behind review walls. And they hardly go through the effort to correct grammar and spelling mistakes.

**** It has it's flaws. But it's a unique story, and relatively well written. So, I'll take it. My only complaint with it is long wait between updates.
