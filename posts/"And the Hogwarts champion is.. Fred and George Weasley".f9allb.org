Basically the twins succeed in getting their names into the Goblet, and they put both on the same paper so nobody knows which one the Goblet actually selected. So both have to compete together. The other schools aren't pleased.


** Not exactly this prompt but something similar happens in Oh God Not Again I believe. On mobile and can't remember author so can't link easily sorry

**** Legit, it is literally used exactly once in Canon, offhandedly at that and I don't think that the greatest pranksters since the Marauder's would be so pedestrian as to use a running joke that doesn't even mess with anyone for even a second

***** In an ideal situation and a good story, they would constantly switch up their names, do different things like saying "We are Grorged, prepare to get pranked" in unison or something. Repeating the same joke over and over again isn't funny or witty, but it falls right in line with the nonsensical ideas people have about twinspeak or pranks.
