I spent the past 3 day binge reading this whole Weasley Twins series and I am happy to say that this is one of the suspenseful, heart racing, excitement inducing series I have ever came across! The comedy is hilarious and on point. Seriously, there are a lot of scenes that simply made me laugh as expected from the two mischievous pranksters. I adore the writing as well as the story telling that kept me on the edge of my seat. I actually felt offend on the author's behalf that they don't have as many favorites or follows for such a unquie series! This author even started from the Twins' first year for Merlin sake!

The author characterized the Twins wonderfully and made the story telling in each part their own. Not centered around Harry. They kept and great distance from him in order to show how the Twins see their world. This is exactly what I look for in a story. To make the story its own. The cannon characters and OCs have their own personalities that I cannot help but be interested in. The author even somehow ingrained the Twins' stories into cannon while making it so that they have to face their own unique antagonists! It's usually just Voldemort or Death Eaters, but this author spread out their story to different places/countries as well as other characters and utilize them to move the plot forward. And the author made it so it is engaging! I absolutely love it! There are so few long fics where the Twins are the protagonists despite their reputation of being favorite characters. Which are supringly difficult to find too. Anyways, I really look forward to read more from this brillant series! I absolutely recommend it!

Edit (To make a point):

  Despite its rocky start, the author does get better in terms of grammar considering they had started the series around 2005. The more recent stuff is way better I admit. I read this series more for the story.

  I kind of got desperate to find stories involving the Twins perspectives on things since those type are really difficult to find. I usually give the writer the benefit of the doubt because of that. If it helps, you can try skipping the first book and read the 2nd part instead at least. If not, that's alright. I simply wanted to share this series considering the lack of readers. It is so they could at least get more opinions to help them get better in writing.

** Anybody else with a more nuanced review? I'm a bit unsure if I want to commit to such a long story and would appreciate more opinions.

*** The very first line of the fic is a monstrous, clunky run-on sentence. Not a good look.

From a quick skim, the writing is mediocre and it badly needs editing, so I'm not going to bother reading unless someone else gives a concrete rec.

** So obvious obviously the first two stories are not canon but are the third and fourth stories Canon retreads?

*** The third and fourth stories does have cannon parts in it, but really only uses the parts where they showed up in the book. The author kept the Twins interaction at a distance from cannon overall. In between that, the Twins have their own story that is almost completely different from Harry's story and branched off to their own plot.
