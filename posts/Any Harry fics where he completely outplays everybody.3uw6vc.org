Most of the fics that come up here are mostly Mary Sue's or Harry is the lord of everything and has tons of money or Harry's some kind of equal at the age of 12 next to Voldemort, or he absorbed all of voldemorts abilities thanks to the Horecruc inside of him. None of that drivel please.

Give me a Harry that is weak or just average for his age but to have a brand of cunning and smarts to ruthlessly curbstomp his opponents. None of that idealistic moral shit that goes around.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  In which the most cunning Slytherin isn't actually a Slytherin, and Harry Potter is far more than a normal schoolboy. The Dark Lord marked him as an equal for a reason. Third-year AU.

** Yeeeah, you're looking for What Would Slytherin Harry Do. Well, as I recall, he's not exactly average, but he definitely gets by with smarts and cunning.

If you don't mind a bit of crack, I'd recommend checking out nonjon's The DA Missions as well. He's... well, it's crack. It's silly, but the focus is on the audacious missions.

He gets by with plot armour. He does extremely stupid things which the author for some reason regards as cunning, and the universe bends to him in ways that wouldn't happen in canon.

**** This, basically. I found some of the parts hilarious, but, frankly, after a few months of this sort of behaviour, /nobody/ would trust him.

/The Green Girl/ has the same sort of problem with respect to a Slytherin!Hermione: people seem to like her, trust her, protect her for no good reason.

** I would love to read a story like that! A lot of fics use Harry as a punching bag, constantly getting shat on by everyone around him, always being the butt of jokes and the victim of manipulation.

It's one of the things I can't stand; the anti-Gary Stu!

** Possibly [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]]. He's very secretive and manipulative (in a good way) in this story, he's near Dumbledore level of secrets and yet still not the smartest and he has a ton of people helping him.

Keeping in mind it's DracoxHarry and very long. It's my favorite though because Harry's not an idiot nor a genius but he is smart and he is very human.
