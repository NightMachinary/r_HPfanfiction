I'm looking for stories that feature magic as a more... integral part of the story. Where it feels like an actual part of the story rather than a layered on farce added afterwards. Stories like "Firebird's Son" for example.

Or just where magic is a part of life rather than a tool to help with it. Imagine a scene where an underage pureblood and a muggleborn live their daily life. The pureblood would just... pull things to him. No walking across the room to grab that shirt and doors swing open as they approach. It would be very nice to read a story where the characters themselves are different in their usage. Not just Harry using his awesome powers of plot, but characters like Draco, Ron, Nott, or other normal people who were raised around this casual magic.

Thanks for reading!


** It is not what you ask for, but the thing I really like about [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][stories]] [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][is]] exactly this description of the “normal magical life”.

**** linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) has been finished, but its sequel (which should explain some unanswered questions) linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian) has not been finished, and it will (I am afraid) never be finished.

** I haven't written it yet but this is something I hope to explore in one of my fics! Kind of the merits of Muggle technology Vs magic in daily life. I'll link once the next chapter is done (at... some point)
