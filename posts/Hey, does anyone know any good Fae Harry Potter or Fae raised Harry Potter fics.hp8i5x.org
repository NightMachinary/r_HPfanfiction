** To the Waters and the Wild is the only one I know that I currently remember. It's HP/LV slash and it's one of those 'Harry is naive and enthusiastic and nice to everyone' fics. It's not bad, but it's a bit... odd. If I remember any more that are better, I'll post 'em here.

EDIT - I suppose Have Chrome, Will Travel counts as well, but I don't really count them as Fae so much as I haven't read the thing that inspired the fic.

** Old Magic by ulyferal [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6373388/1/Old-Magic-WIP]] has Harry Potter being raised by the old ones with Hagard's Mother as his primary caregiver in his early years. It has 68 chapters & almost 270,000 words, it's was started in 2010 and is not finished yet, but it was updated in January 2020.

Do you like crossovers, I have not seen one were Harry is raised by or is fae but have you looked into Harry Potter/Merry Gentry crossovers.

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** Elflocks: linkao3(23395243)

A first-year retelling with a Fey Harry. I don't really know how else to describe it.

The story's in a series on AO3, which I'm hoping means more years will eventually be added.

  Harry Potter has non-human blood. In childhood, he is contacted by his kin and given support and instruction. How will these changes affect his Hogwarts career? He is not the bold Gryffindor saviour people were expecting. He is ready to love the wizarding world, but will it love him back?I expect there to be pairings in later stories, and for the rating to rise.

** I have not read this one yet. Someone recommended another story by this writer on a different reddit post and I always go looking at what else the recommended writer wrote so. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12899000/1/James-Stormcaller-and-The-Walnut-Court]] Abandoned by his Uncle after one magical accident too many, a more inquisitive and adventurous Harry sets out to learn about the magic of nature in the Forest of Dean! Along the way, he meets spirits, magical creatures, fairies, and learns of a hidden world. AU/Shaman!Harry "Foxes! Fairies! Ghosts! Songs! Tree-house! Land-lady!" "VERA!" "What?"
