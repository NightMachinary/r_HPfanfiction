I think he is like the character who has the most presence after the trio


** I think part of it is that his accent is hard to write correctly, so authors just don't bother, or stick to canon dialogue.

*** Came here to say this. One can pretend Fleur has been practicing her English, but Hagrid is stuck with his annoying-to-write accent. It is easier to just avoid him.

** He is the second biggest exposition machine in canon, that's why he has so much presence. The biggest one, Hermione, actually has many notable moments outside of it. Hagrid has like two. So unless you are doing a complete canon rehash, it's hard to justify Hagrid's presence most of the time. The time that could be spent developing other side characters that can actually make a difference in the story.

** I think most of it stems from the fact that, in stories where politics and defensive magic are important (which is a good percentage of HP fanfiction), Hagrid can't really contribute much to the plot. I mean, he isn't really supposed to use magic and he doesn't really seem to really care about politics. (Plus, he considers himself to be Dumbledore's man, which can make him seem as unfavorable/idiotic/naive in Dumbledore bashing stories.)

** I'm still waiting for the fic where Hagrid is actually #1 secret agent, like the one where Lockhart is an Unspeakable. He's just really really good at maintaining his cover.

- Has the magical umbrella that totally doesn't have a working wand inside
- Spends his life around hilariously dangerous creatures without permanent injury
- Dumbledore trusted him multiple times with Harry and even the Philosopher's Stone
- Yoinked Harry out of Knockturn Alley
- Survived Azkaban perfectly fine
- Accidentally bred creatures perfect for the Third Triwizard task
- Giants mission
- Was the one who took Harry in the escape from Privet Drive

*** There is a fic where he's an immensely good Occlumens/Legilimencer. Can't remember the name, but it's relatively well known.

*** What people know about hagrid is he got kicked out of school during his second year.

what they dont know is that dumbledore personally trained him magic in secret to help him compete his schooling.

Hagrid has since become one of dumbledores most trusted confidents,\\
how does he keep up the act, he merely reviews his memories from his early years at school and acts like he used to as a kid
