So this is just a though i had, and i have a couple more thoughts too.

First of all, James, oh Jamesy poo. According to Harry potter fanfiction, the potters have this thing called "potter luck" so why did he die? Couldn't his luck save him? Even if the potter luck isnt in the canon story, why is he still dead in most Fanfictions?

Second of all, most Fanfic lore, states that Lilly and James were really powerfull and smart. If that was the case, they could have come up with a better defense strategy than just to rely on the Fidelius Charm.

1. Dumbledore was the secret keeper to Grimmauld place, why couldn't he have been the secret keeper for Godrics Hallow? Voldemort clearly feared him, and there was no way to infiltrate the Hogwarts castle until like 6th year when draco used the vanishing cabinet. So the risk of dumbledore being used as secret keeper was low.
2. They could've made an escape plan in case Moldyshorts came knocking at their door. Like, these two in canon were so stupid that I bet they didn't have a Fire escape plan. The escape plan could have included, idk a cauterwauling charm to let them know someone entered the area, then that would give them time to fetch their wands, or if they were outside at the time, a trap to distract voldemort to get enough time to get their wands. Then, they could have either Apparated with Harry out of there, or if they had Anti apparation wards, James could have turned into prongs and take them out of vidinity so that they could have apparated out of there.

Again fanfiction lore states that James Potter was an auror so he should have known to to this and not rely solely on a Fidelius Charm.

I do not know guys let me know what you think! and anything else i missed?


** . . .

1. Nothing in canon says that James was an Auror, that's pure fanon. At best, he was an Auror trainee since the formation takes /year/ after school (at least 3 I think), but the most likely option is that him and Lily just joined the war effort straight out of school without taking any careers and relying on James inheritance to live.
2. The Potter luck is also pure fanon, and is generaly used to descrive Harry's luck, or his ability to land in the worst situations (Acromantula's den, in front of a Mountain troll), and leave with almost no lasting damages, James has nothing to do with it.
3. Fanon created several theories to explain why Dumbledore wasn't the Secret Keeper, chose the one you like the most. Maybe someone can't be the Secret Keeper of several location and Dumbledore was already guarding a Secret, maybe James and Lily insisted that one of their best friend, brother, guard the Secret . . .
4. I remember reading an interesting theory that said that the Fidelius relied on trust to work. Because of it, placing any aditional protection other a Fidelius would mean that you don't trust the Fidelius, weakening of even destroying it.

Well, What I think, is that the Potter Luck is a Double-edged Sword. In case of Harry, while his luck saved him many times, it is shown to be one of the things that really put him in those situations.

About Lily and James being smart, well, Voldemort was smarter. He also had all information about their wards including the Fidelus thanks to dear old Wormy, and he caught them unawares. Any additional charm or ward they may have put on the house could have been systematically disenchanted by Voldemort, and he also took down the Anti - Apparation wards and then put his own up so that they cannot run.

Also, there is no mention of James being an auror anywhere in Pottermore.

Because the Marauders trusted each other more than anything, and at that time Sirius's Suggestion that they use him as a decoy and Wormy as the real secret keeper sounded very much good to them.

Don't you think Voldemort didn't think of that? Or he didn't ask Wormy about the Potters' Protections? Wormy was a goldmine for info on the Potters. He would've pointed out the loopholes in their defences, and if Magic leaves a signature, he would've masked Voldy's.

And they didn't even expect that Wormy would change sides. They had no way of knowing, and that was why none of their escape plans would work, anyway.
