Please link the fic below


** Probably the one I am still working on. I know that's stupid and selfish, but taking an idea and bringing it to life, solving the problems that come up, etc. It's very fulfilling in a way that reading somebody else's work just isn't sometimes.

** Linkffn(Antithesis)

I really liked how, well, good the writing was! It was also a rather realistic description of Harry/Adrian's feelings.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13460508/1/Harry-Potter-Master-of-Malicious-Compliance]])

This one... was just funny. And there is something so amusing about >! Harry drawing /inappropriate/ things in Tom Riddle's diary.!<

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) great subversion of typical tropes, incredible worldbuilding, super unique plot, pretty much everything has a rationale, no obvious plot holes like canon, great characterization.

** “Harriet Potter Is”

Don't let the fem!Harry throw you off! It's only 5900 words and I promise you won't regret it. I reread it all the time.

This is a Slytherin fic that sticks true to Harry's canon character: loyal, noble, and compassionate. It explores what it means to be a Slytherin and shows how Harry consistently defies everyone's expectations to what they think a Slytherin is and what the Girl-Who-Lived should be. The literary allusions are so well done and explained at the end in case you don't catch them all (like me, lol). There's inspiration from the Bible, the Jungle Book, and Aesop's Fables.

My favorite part is:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Harriet Potter is seventeen and she is dead.

    She is dead and she is looking at a screaming, bloody thing beneath a railway station bench and the man with the white beard who is standing next to her is saying /beyond help from you and I and help given to those who deserve it./

    /Come, Harriet/ says the man with the white beard.

    /Fuck you/ says Harriet Potter, and picks up the thing from underneath the bench.

    It screams, and burns and stings in her arms /(you knew what I was when you picked me up)/ but she doesn't let go. It is a shrieking, blood-smeared thing; it is a child with dead eyes saying I can talk to snakes; is that normal for someone like me?

  There are stories with snakes that bite and say {you knew what I was when you picked me up} but this isn't one of them. This is the kind of story where the abandoned child walks in the jungle beneath the branches full of hissing things and tells them {we be of one blood ye and I}. Harriet Potter is eleven and she chooses. (genderswap/Slytherin Harry au) Don't copy to another site.

Both are smart/genius Draco, which is really interesting. I like that adaption of Draco. One story is slash and one is pre Draco/Ginny

** Linkao3(conditionally by lomonaaeren) I just love it, it's a reasonably realistic take on Snape Is Harry's Dad and it's very well written

Or

Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) once you get past the first 8 chapters it turns into an excellent 5 part complete series. I just find this one very fun

Or

linkffn(a second chance at life by Miranda Flairgold) first and still one of the best Harry Goes To A New School (love these kinds of stories)

Or

Linkffn(bloody skies by Toki Mirage) shit summary, excellent fic. Love the world building, there's also an epilogue on her livejournal which is hot. Another Harry Goes To A New School fic

** linkffn(scorpius malfoy and the blood runes)

It's a next-gen fic that is the first in a 8 part series and I love the plot and the characters.

It has probably my favorite character in all of fiction in it. Just no that Maurice is my boy.
