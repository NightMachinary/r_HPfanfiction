(I apologice beforehand for any mistake I make while writing this - I'm still not sure about how to use Reddit, or if it was enough writing "fic search" at the title):

I'm looking for a Sirius Black fanfic I read quite long ago - maybe one year ago or so. There are a few things I remember from it: it was the marauders era, there was this girl Sirius was in love with (she was called something like Ali, or Abby, or Addy - something like that, I think). She had a life of abbuse, her father used to abbuse her, but no one knew. I remember this scene where they were playing with some kind of spell and a ball of truth? the guys, Lily and this girl were playing to throw a ball and then asked for questions, and when Sirius throw the ball to Peter and asked him if he were a virgin, the girl took it by error and had to confess she was not. She later told Lily that she was r***.

If it rings a bell, please let me know :)
