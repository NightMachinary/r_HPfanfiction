According to the wiki, Albus Dumbledore was born in 1881 -- so when he faced Grindelwald in 1945, he was 63-64 years old.

But, what if he was a lot younger? Assuming that he is still a brilliant wizard -- far ahead of his time -- what if Dumbledore was instead 23-24 years old? If Grindelwald is the same age as in canon, this would put a different spin on their relationship.

And what about the rest of the series? Being born in c.1921, this would mean that Voldemort is only around five years younger -- and also changing the dynamic between the two mortal enemies (e.g. did they know each other at Hogwarts?). Furthermore, by the time of the books (i.e. 1991-1998), Dumbledore would be in his 70s and (maybe) not the Headmaster.

I'm interested in what changes this would bring, especially the least expected and indirect ones.


** Then he would be professor ozpin from rwby! :)
