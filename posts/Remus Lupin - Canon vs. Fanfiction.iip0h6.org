He sighed.

“That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he --- er --- accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.”

“You're not leaving just because of that!” said Harry.

Lupin smiled wryly.

“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. . . . They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you. . . . That must never happen again.”

The above is a quote from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Up until this point in time, virtually no one in the Wizarding world knew that Remus was a werewolf. A common occurrence in HP Fanfiction is that EVERYONE knew that Remus is a werewolf. Even in today's/yesterday's thread regarding the bashing of Remus.. it felt as if everyone had forgotten that originally in canon Remus was not known to be a werewolf.

Here's my issue with a lot of the points made in that thread -

Remus couldn't visit Harry at the Dursleys because he was a werewolf. Yes he could have.

Remus couldn't hold a job due to being a werewolf. Sure, he couldn't have held onto a job at the Ministry of Magic but he could have easily worked privately or even started his own business. Heck, we know him to be supremely gifted in magic keeping up with James/Lily/Sirius/Severus and helped create the Marauder's Map. He could have started his own version of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes (yes he didn't have the 1000 Galleon gift from Harry but still). He could have been a private potioneer or charms master if that wasn't an option.

Remus could have done so much more. He wasn't as constrained by his identity as a werewolf as most of us think due to no one KNOWING he was a werewolf. He would have faced zero to no prejudice - he might have even garnered sympathy for publicly being known as a close friend to James Potter and Peter Pettigrew.


** His constraints were due to his own self-loathing more than anything.

*** Yeah definitely, I just feel like we've all forgotten his actual circumstances.

Do you think he should have done more than he did? Or did his friends' deaths hit him too hard? Again, everyone's different but I feel like 12 years is plenty to move forward and to at least help with the legacy left behind by his friends.

******* It's glaring if one thinks about it, but explainable:

- Remus, good man as he is, is not a teacher by heart - Harry however is
- to add difficulty, Harry (unlike many of his DADA students) had an awful shitload of trauma that the dementors (or rather, their boggart forms) could dig in to. This was shown at the beginning of third year with Harry being the only one of the hundreds of students being knocked out cold... there are not many others having experienced trauma that comes even close, the notable exceptions being Neville (lost his parents), Ginny (got possessed by Voldemort himself) and Luna (lost her mother, but arguably she has come to peace with this unlike the rest!).
- students point out each others' failures, support each other - especially when it comes to the "find a happy memory" part this comes into play. Finding a memory in a sea of trauma is /hard/, especially when the guide (Remus) knew next to nothing about Harry's life to indicate possible locations.
- Harry knows (unlike Remus) freshly what /his/ main difficulties learning the Patronus were, so he can look for these in his students
- Harry is not the brightest wizard when it comes to learning spells!

************ If anything this makes me feel WORSE about Lupin. After reading the relevant chapters again.. Harry asked Lupin near the beginning of December for help with the Dementors and lessons didn't start until after Christmas break. It's excusable as a kid to not want to ask for help but for Remus to 1. Not proactively offer help after his best friend's son almost dies to the same issue twice 2. Not teach about Dementors in a class where he's focusing on "dark creatures" when Dementors are probably the most relevant dark creature for that school year... Is upsetting.

I mostly focused on the time limit to show how egregious it was for Lupin to teach so poorly. Point still stands that Harry taught an entire class in near secrecy in a shorter time frame than Remus teaching Harry one on one. In fact, after reading through Order of the Phoenix again, Harry started teaching the Patronus AFTER April and the entire group successfully learned the charm BEFORE OWLs. Harry only managed to cast the spell successfully DURING his last exams in third year after starting lessons the first Thursday after classes resumed after Christmas break. My point, still stands that Harry accomplished the same task not only much faster but also with a much larger group.

************* It's suprising how many issues people have with him and how they don't bother me at all. As for your point, I'll have to say I disagree because Harry was practicing with a boggart while the DA had nothing to practise on so that was easier. Hermione does struggle with this spell when faced with real dementors. But to each their own. I never believed Harry's teaching ability when it showed up in OOTP so I'm not very nice to him I think.

I think the problem most people have with Remus stems from their own personal life and how they view abandonment. People see and compare Remus to Sirius. Sure, they're both flawed characters and we see things mostly from Harry's POV, but we can clearly see how Sirius wants to do his best for Harry at great personal risk while Remus is just... not there?

*************** No. I prefer Remus's method. And I know what their issues with Remus are.But I personally despise Sirius. I know he loved Harry. But his only redeeming trait to me because it seems that the rest of the world can burn or at least that his only role is that of Harry's protector. I don't have much interest in that and generally think that Sirius was actually an asshole and not a very good friend to Remus and Peter. Being a good godfather doesn't compensate for his general unpleasantness. He is held up as a standard, well, he loved Harry, but I kind of still hate him and think he gets too much praise for that one role. I prefer Remus, who is realistically flawed, but at least comes across as a kinder person in general and who does feel like an adult to me. And I actually do think Harry should have found a boggart to practise on or something, but like I said, that's just my view that there were other factors and that time limit isn't proof to me.

*************** I'll add some more about my reasons for preferring the more difficult method. I care not about how long it takes, but how confident I'll be when faced with the real challenge. And to be honest, it wouldn't count that I can cast a patronus when I'm with a bunch of mates if I have no idea whether I could cast it when the dementor is there. It's the same when at university we had difficult exercises during classes while those during the actual exam were far easier. I found them easy because the practice was difficult. If I were Harry, I'd want to practise with the dementor because otherwise I'd spend most of my time dreading meeting the real thing as the only practice I had was in a classroom with a bunch of other kids. As for Remus and people's issues with him, I think it's also a matter of people tolerating certain flaws and not others. Ron is also criticised, often the same people will point out that oh Hermione stayed loyal. Well, her main secret is pretty much that she is supposed to be a queenn in the sense that she isn't challenged the way Ron is. And then people complain that those characters are flawed while insisting they like flawed characters. My conclusion is that they like characters whose flaws aren't very significant in terms of how they affect other characters. People prefer those characters who are badasses and handle things successfully. I've come across a few other books that had,say, characters dealing with alcoholism. And people complain how the characters were just too whiny or something along those lines. They would seem to prefer a story that is about a person not being affected by the difficulties in a way that would make them unlikable or weak. The same people would most probably give that stupid and useless get over it advice.And people do compare Remus to Sirius, the same way they compare Ron to Hermione. And I still don't see what we achieve by repeating that one of them did something better than the other. They are different characters and it's not surprising that Sirius loved Harry. He simply transfered his love for James onto Harry. After all, James was his best friend. Being Hrry's godfather undoubtedly added to his desire to care for Harry. but it's a bit funny when people insist they understand they are different, but still want Remus to act like Sirius in a way. Rowling wasn't going to give us two characters in the same role. And I actually don't see what is the point of having Remus in a story but in a role of an adult who does reach out when one of his flaws is that he does shy away from relationships. And in the end it all comes down to whether they like the character or not. Those who don't then go looking for some imaginary flaws or find that some tiny action is a bad thing after all. When even canon doesn't address it, I never know what to say to such people. Because Iknow whatever I or anyone else might say, their answer will be oh but still.

  Remus now lived a hand-to-mouth existence, taking jobs that were far below his level of ability, always knowing that he would have to leave them before his pattern of growing sick once a month at the full moon was noticed by his workmates.

  ([[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin]])
#+end_quote

He wasn't famously known as a werewolf. He was just revealed as a werewolf every time it became clear that he became sick enough to miss multiple days of work every full moon. He got away with it at Hogwarts because he has access to Wolfsbane Potion to mitigate the damage and because Dumbledore had the whole staff covering for him.

So the "zero to no prejudice" you mention would have lasted him at best a few months, during which he would have been seriously ill several times. That's not enough to build a career and a financially solvent life

​

#+begin_quote
  Remus couldn't visit Harry at the Dursleys because he was a werewolf. Yes he could have.
#+end_quote

Did anyone even say that? The arguments I saw in the other thread were that Vernon/Petunia wouldn't want ANYONE magical visiting Harry, that he might not know how to find Harry because he'd never met Vernon Dursley and didn't know his name, and that it would have been weird for a friend of Harry's parents to insert himself into Harry's "new" family when Harry didn't know him from Adam.

​

#+begin_quote
  Remus couldn't hold a job due to being a werewolf. Sure, he couldn't have held onto a job at the Ministry of Magic but he could have easily worked privately or even started his own business.
#+end_quote

Easily started his own business when he barely had the money for food and didn't have the money for clothes that weren't rags? */Easily/*?

It‘s hard to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you don't even have boots.

​

#+begin_quote
  Remus could have done so much more. He wasn't as constrained by his identity as a werewolf as most of us think due to no one KNOWING he was a werewolf.
#+end_quote

Except everyone knew within a couple of months. It's not a condition he could hide. Tweenage Hermione worked it out even with Dumbledore covering Lupin's back and paying for expensive medication.

​

By all means, hate on Lupin for not working harder to reign in his crazy friends in school. Or for running around loose in the Forbidden Forest as a werewolf with only said crazy friends to protect the world from him. Or for not outing Sirius as an Animagus when Sirius went to prison or broke out of prison. Or for not pointing Dumbledore to the hidden passage that allowed Sirius to sneak into the castle when Sirius was a fugitive. Or for not writing to Harry during GOF. Or for entering into a flirtation with Tonks when he wasn't prepared to follow up. Or for marrying Tonks when he didn't feel ready for marriage or fatherhood. Or for (briefly) walking out on his pregnant wife. Hate on him for his bouts of cowardice and self-pity. */These are things he did canonically. These are his canonical flaws./*

Or hate on him for pretending he was unable to hold a job and when he totally was and for imagining prejudice where there was none. You're free to hate on him for whatever you like, of course, but liking to hate on him for non-canon reasons won't make them canon.

​

/TL; DR: He was impoverished and the physical effects of being a werewolf were real, as was the prejudice. He couldn't hide the furry little problem for long enough to lift himself out of poverty. He has plenty of canon flaws to hate on without making stuff up. Though it's every fan's right to make stuff up, that doesn't make it canon./

*** To be honest it wasn't my intention to bash on Remus - just to help remind the community that he wasn't "outed" as a werewolf publicly until the end of PoA. However, the more I think about it the worse I feel about him and there's a bunch of inconsistencies regarding his character and backstory.

For example, in the link you yourself provided, Remus Lupin's father

#+begin_quote
  Lyall Lupin was a very clever, rather shy young man who, by the time he was thirty, had become a world-renowned authority on Non-Human Spiritous Apparitions.
#+end_quote

and his mother

#+begin_quote
  Hope Howell, a beautiful Muggle girl who worked in an insurance office in Cardiff, had taken an ill-advised walk through what she believed to be innocent woodland.
#+end_quote

both seem to be pretty well off financially. I know wealth in the Harry Potter universe has always been pretty inconsistent but I'd say it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say that 1000 Galleons wouldn't amount to a huge dent in their finances especially if it's for their son.

No shade to the Weasley family but if the twins were able to scrounge up

#+begin_quote
  ‘We'll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,' said Fred, as he and George quickly pooled all their money
#+end_quote

along with all of their expenses on experimenting for their Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes AND still have enough money left over to play house in the gambling that went on in Goblet of Fire as two children in a family of nine with only one bread winner who was pretty much marginalized at work and known to not make much money... one extremely world-renowned wizard and someone working in the insurance field would have a lot more savings and money available to them.

Furthermore, I quite frankly just don't buy your first quote

#+begin_quote
  "He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job, when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am.”
#+end_quote

Being said from Remus' POV I feel like it's a bit disingenuous. I don't understand how he could have been shunned all of his adult life for being a werewolf WITHOUT Lucius Malfoy or any of the parents of the then current Hogwarts students knowing. Lucius Malfoy, the man who we know is well connected and was part of

1. Getting Hagrid sent to Azkaban seemingly without a trial.

2. Getting Dumbledore sacked.

3. Sentencing a Hogwart's Hippogriff to death.

either did not know Remus was a werewolf while every other adult knew or did not care that a werewolf was teaching in Hogwarts UNTIL Severus "accidentally let slip." It just doesn't add up. There's no way it was an open secret that Remus was a werewolf.

So I think I've managed to state my reasons for why I believe he could have easily, yes easily, started his own business and again if we're going off of pseudo-canon

#+begin_quote
  His mother was now dead, and while Lyall, his father, was always delighted to see his son, Remus refused to endanger his father's peaceful existence by returning to live with him.
#+end_quote

the literal only thing stopping him from living a more productive life is not going to his father for help and refusing assistance. Like I just can't wrap my mind around it.

If we're going off of canon we can really only make assumptions since we just don't know enough about his past and his relationships.

Also sorry I fell victim to the thing I was trying to help people out of. I guess I just read too much fanfiction where Remus being a werewolf was the reason why he couldn't visit Harry in any capacity and thought I saw people echoing that thought in the other thread.

To sum it up I just wanted to say that:

- He was impoverished largely due to choice and depression.
- No one knew about his furry little problem otherwise it wouldn't have taken Severus literally outing him in PoA for it to become public knowledge - also note that Severus spent a minimum of 18 lessons (Remus should transformed 9 times in the school year and a day before and after for rest) beating it into the students' heads that Remus was a werewolf which made Hermione suspicious but I'm not sure if it was explicitly stated she knew for a fact or if it was confirmed after the events at the Shrieking Shack.

TL;DR: I actually do like him as a character but that's because he's inherently a /flawed/ character and that's okay. I think it's great we have different interpretations of the books since books are just a portal to our own individual imagination right? Life would be too boring if we all had the same interpretations for every book, movie, poem, etc. out there.

Edit: Also he could have just visited Harry at the Dursleys, not take him away, just make sure Harry was doing okay. Furthermore, if Sirius was able to find him within a week or so of escaping AZKABAN, I'm sure Remus could have done the same.

**** 1000 galleons was the prize to a wizard tournament, which means it's probably a lot of money. Sure, Remus could ask his dad, but I wouldn't ask anyone for $1000 without having a plan, plus you still have to feed yourself during the creation of your business. Assuming he had money, Fred and George had a ton of free time and summers to plan their business. Remus was worrying about paying bills and finding jobs, and not eating someone once a month. Of course he could have done something had he worked or focused enough, but it would have been really, really hard.

***** The problem with the currency in Harry Potter is how inconsistent it is that's why I used the example of how much money the twins had in Goblet of Fire - instead of comparing it to actual items.

1000 Galleons is roughly 30 times the amount of money the twins bet against Ludo Bagman. We don't know exactly how poor the Weasleys actually are BUT we do know they're considered poor. With all the experiments and testing for their products prior to the end of Goblet of Fire I'm going to assume they've spent probably 10-20 Galleons on supplies.

50 Galleons between the two twins means each sibling probably got around 25 Galleons throughout the years. That's 175 total Galleons in the hands of the Weasley children. Unless a person's family is pretty wealthy, a week or two at a minimum wage job will probably garner more money than all the money from allowances combined. What I'm trying to say is that a lump sum of 1000 Galleons isn't a lot of money. I can't see any way it's more than a year's salary.

Did Remus not have a plan going forward while he was at Hogwarts? It's not as if he didn't know what life would be like after Hogwarts even disregarding the war with Voldemort. Again like I said, he CHOSE to refuse help from those who offered it to him. I'm not sure but what did he do between Hogwarts and Voldemort's first death? Did neither James nor Sirius nor any of his other friends help him out? Did he solely focus on the war effort? I just can't believe he had less of a plan than the Weasley twins.

I don't know I'm just upset at how it feels as if though Remus just wasn't proactive at all and just let things happen to him when he had so much potential as a character. Why did he not have a plan? He had a decade to figure something out before becoming an adult. I wish we met more werewolves that weren't like Fenrir. I think we only met one other?

****** $175 is a lot less that $1000, and $1000 is less than a years salary, but $1000 is still a large amount of money to both ask for, and to put down on a risky business venture. I agree Remus should have thought about his future, but he probably thought, or suspected that he would die in the war. When he didn't, the only people who ever accepted him were gone, and he found himself alone, broke, and having a really hard time getting a job. Even if he did have plans, most people would shut down after that traumatic happened. Its frustrating how he wasn't proactive, and with a lot of work he could have moved forward, but Remus' situation was a euphemism for AIDS. I appreciated that JK Rowling (who sucks now lol) showed the reality of an incredibly unfair situation. You can be smart and talented, but the system being against you and bad circumstances can really mess up your life in unfair ways. And in the end, he ultimately chooses to let someone love him and dies happy, for what he believes in. Obviously, it would have been cool to see other werewolves, and know what Remus was doing behind the scenes, but it was Harry's perspective, so it wouldn't have made a ton of sense...

** You sound unfamiliar with chronic illness. Even with wolsfbane, he was unable to work a few days a month. Without it, his health must have been even worse. Even if there were no prejudice against werewolves, it's very difficult for a person with a chronic illness to keep a job, much less run his own business. I know someone who was running her own business just fine until she got a chronic illness. You can't just choose to be healthy for the sake of your business.

Now add in the prejudice: He had to limit his interactions with people in the magical world so people wouldn't suspect his condition. That means quitting jobs before people started to get suspicious of his pattern of absences.

That leaves employment opportunities in the muggle world, where he has no qualifications, not even the British equivalent of a high school diploma.

As a separate point, canon is vague about how Lily's blood protection worked, but I wouldn't be surprised if it kept Dark creatures like werewolves away from Privet Drive, or if Dumbledore added some generic additional protections that had the same effect.

*** I'm just going off of what I remember and can find in the books - I'm not really associating lycanthropy with real life chronic illnesses.

These quotes are from the PoA book and are the reason why I feel as if Remus was only unable to work at most twice a month due to his condition:

#+begin_quote
  “Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month."

  “Where's Professor Lupin?” he said. “He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a twisted smile.
#+end_quote

I can't find a lot of other instances where they mention how long it takes Remus to recover but I can't imagine him becoming a Prefect while missing 3-5 days of classes a month - especially since it seems as if his friends (Peter, James, Sirius) were great students. Sure they were great at magic and aced exams, but I can't picture them taking great notes, if they took notes at all.

** Also, imagine how hard it would be to raise Harry alone. Once a month, he has to lock himself up for an entire night until dawn just so he could transform into a werewolf while he has a toddler in the other room. There's a constant fear of losing control and biting or killing said child. Said toddler needs to grow up with his frail father's friend patching himself up everyday, and then there's also the fact that he's the Boy Who Lived. He also couldn't hold down a job, and however large Harry's inheritance is, it's eventually going to run out. Now, observe said guardian also trying to teach, moving places constantly and Harry's education being next to nothing. His life was hard enough on his own as it were already, imagine a child too. Coupled with his own self loathing, crippling self esteem and stigma of being a werewolf, Harry would've also grown up damaged in /some/ way; there's just no escaping it. Cut him some slack.

I don't know about anyone else but I'm a firm believer that if Remus had wanted to, he could have located Harry within a week - and that's being generous, he should realistically be able to figure out Harry's location in at most two to three days. All he'd have to do after is well, as you said, "encourage" the Dursleys.

***** I don't think Remus knew Harry that well when he was a toddler to look after him. The whole "Uncle Remus"-thing is fanon.\\
I mean yes, the Potters and Remus were very close friends during school - but it quickly got much worse after that. We know that Remus did undercover missions with the werewolves during at least the last year of the first war. He was suspected to be the spy and Remus also wasn't mentioned in the letter from Lily to Sirius where she tells him about Harrys birthday and the visits they get. So I always assumed he wasn't there. All that means for me that Remus likely didn't know little Harry very well. So Harry was a nearly unkown child to Remus. In combination with his own issues - which probably didn't get better by being with actual monstrous werewolves during the war - I clearly see why he didn't got involved with Harrys childhood.

****** I never suggested that Uncle Remus was a thing - I only suggested that he should have and could have checked up on Harry from time to time. The Potters and Remus if anything only got closer after school, you know, fighting a war and all that. Sure Remus was suspected to be the spy but so was Sirius and that's canon. Everyone was being suspected at that time because there WAS a spy and no one knew who it was.

Even if he wasn't always there, it's not like Remus never met Harry as a baby. It wasn't until after the prophecy was made that the Potters went into actual hiding under the fidelius charm. He didn't have to be involved, just do what McGonagall did once or twice and that would have been fine.

Unless you can point me to a passage - because I just skimmed through the books - I have to say that the whole "Remus did undercover missions with the werewolves during at least the last year of the first way" is FANON. This is a huge reason why I made this post in the first place because everyone's confusing canon Remus with fanon Remus.

#+begin_quote
  Members began regarding each other uneasily, and Sirius Black suspected that his friend Remus Lupin, who was frequently undercover among Voldemort's werewolf allies, was a spy.
#+end_quote

Is straight from the fandom wiki and it has a reference number linked to PoA but nowhere in PoA mentions that detail.

Edit: The following passage is from The Half-Blood Prince and is why people keep confusing fanon with canon. Remus was a "spy" among the werewolves only after Harry's fifth year. He was not mentioned to be a spy for the Order at any point before this.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, I've been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.” “What do you mean?” “I've been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin. “Werewolves,” he added, at Harry's look of incomprehension. “Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.”

#+end_quote

The prophecy was made before Harry was born.\\
"/The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies..."/\\
Approaches means he wasn't there yet when the prophecy was spoken.\\
I already mentioned the letter; that letter also shows that the Potters were in hiding long before the fidelius charm. Even if I made the mistake with Remus being a spy in the first war you can't deny that Remus wasn't even mentioned by Lily. So even if Lily and James were important to him - he was suspected a spy - even if he wasn't the only one - and he often was on Order of the Phoenix business, so he wasn't there much when Baby Harry was around. This is also somewhat supported by this entry at Pottermore:\\
/"Remus was in the north of the country on Order of the Phoenix business when he heard the horrible news that one of them had murdered the other, and was now in Azkaban, a traitor to the Order and to Lily and James themselves."/

Also even if he wasn't with the werewolfes the war messed him up pretty good: /"The death of James Potter, along with his wife Lily, at the hands of Lord Voldemort, was one of the most traumatic events of Remus's already troubled life."/

My point is: I don't think it was the right thing to do that he never checked up on Harry. I only said it's understandably considering he didn't know Harry that well and what we know about him and about depression and war-veterans in real life.

******** Oh sorry my mistake, I got my time mixed up - I just can't fathom there being a world where Remus never met Harry before the train ride in Harry's third year.

I just.. if one of the most traumatic events in a person's life is the death of two of your closest friends, would you really not spend a day or two checking up on their son in twelve years? Like I totally understand and agree with you that he was not in an okay place and was heavily traumatised by the war but still. If anything I feel like Harry would have become an obsession of sorts similar to what Sirius experienced in that Harry became a figure that was a.. key? connection? hope? reminder? of better times and low-key tricking himself into thinking Harry was James and that the past decade never happened.

I know you said you don't think it was right that he never checked up on Harry but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Snape couldn't look Harry in the eyes for a long period of time (see HBP) because he had Lilys eyes.I can imagine Remus reacting more like Snape than Sirius in the sense he couldn't bear Harrys sight directly after the death of his friends and without a close bond to Harry it makes sense for me that he didn't look after him. He even kind of avoided him in the beginning of POA - Harry had to beg him for help.

*** Oh no, I don't imagine Remus taking in Harry would have been a good idea at all. There's just too many problems with that which you've mentioned. I do disagree with a few of your points though mainly that Harry's inheritance would eventually run out although that's getting into the realm of math and coinage which Rowling was never the best at.

I still do think that Remus could have held down a job. We've never been all too exposed to the job market one would have had in the magical world however but I feel like going free-lance making different versions of the Marauder's map for lets say private estates, the ministry of magic, etc. all over the world could have been doable. In the muggle world however, it isn't too uncommon in the real world to have a semi-flexible work schedule since Remus would know at least a year in advance which days he'd need to take off and he can communicate that with his employers ahead of time. Again this is just an assumption but if he required 2 days per transformation to prepare and recover enough to get back to work that's only 24 days and he could have worked out a system to work on Sundays which I personally have done a few times when I needed to do something on a weekday during work hours.

**** I disagree, because you make it sound very easy. Fred and George got extremely lucky that Harry gave them the 1000 galleons. Otherwise, I bet they'd have worked a few more years for that shop. There's also the fact that the Marauder's Map is almost definitely an illegal object. Being a werewolf, you'd expect a few raised eyebrows as to why in particular be knows that exact niche artefact. I'm not discounting the possibility, but it's really difficult nevertheless. There's also the fact that we don't really know who was the mastermind behind the map, and their little artefacts. Finally, whether he attempted it or not in canon is unknown but if he did, he was definitely unsuccessful.

Why would the Marauder's Map be an illegal object? It's like the ultimate security system. Can you imagine how useful that would be in major wizarding locations?

I agree that Fred and George were insanely lucky and fortunate in that regard but like you said, they could have worked a few more years for that shop. Remus had 14 or so years to do so and it isn't as if he didn't have any connections.

Also true, we don't know who was behind the map but he definitely had to have been part of the process. I just feel like it could have been a potential avenue of business where he could have been a freelance worker.

****** While true, why couldn't he hold down a stable job prior to that? My point is that since he seems to be loving hand to mouth, then he would've been ratted out a few times.

Maybe because it kind of keeps track of where everybody is, their name and basically no privacy as to where somebody is? It could be used as a security system, true, but it can also be terribly abused and exploited, just like with everything else, sadly. Besides, it's taking years until he could map out a place larger than Hogwarts.

Okay...Remus didn't have connections? If he did, somebody would've supported him and Dumbledore could've helped him before 1993. But the matter is that Remus didn't have support, all of that died with Lily and James, mostly the latter. For example, Emmeline Vance could've dropped new robes that weren't patched and frayed every once in a while...or Dedalus Diggle could've helped him set up a house elsewhere. But this begs the question of why magic couldn't help Remus, which really upsets me. I mean, his ratty briefcase could've been fixed with a bit of charms and transfiguration, just like his robes.

True; there's a Pottermore entry written specifically by Rowling which says that the map was testament to the *four* friends' talents. Funnily enough that includes Pettigrew. I like to think somebody cast the charms, somebody else explored the castle to get the geography right, one drew it out and the other cast their personalities into the map.

*** It's.. weird. We've seen quite a few reactions regarding werewolves and they pretty much cover the spectrum. The first reaction we see is probably from Ron when he finds out Remus is a werewolf and it was pretty bad to be honest - although the situation definitely didn't help.

#+begin_quote
  Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, “Get away from me, werewolf !” Lupin stopped dead.
#+end_quote

Afterwards we see Remus resigning due to the parents of Hogwarts students not wanting a werewolf to teach their children.

We also see a newly bitten werewolf at St. Mungo's being consoled by doctors that he could live a normal life. Although at the same time Molly is worried if it's safe that the werewolf is out in the open despite having met and associated with Remus knowing he's a werewolf for more than half a year already.

I think he definitely could have explained away his absence. Also am I the only one who thinks most Wizarding jobs outside of the the ministry of magic... aren't necessarily 9-5 jobs where you work Monday to Friday? Like they have magic and house elves. He could have worked for Gringotts with the goblins, I doubt they'd care he's a werewolf. He could have been one of the many self run stores that sold wares he enchanted/charmed himself. Yeah it's canon that he couldn't hold a job and wasn't in the best financial situation but I just don't understand why that was the case. Heck we can even go with the fanon approach and have him open up his own business and set his own hours. Sure he would exploit the fact he has access to magic but if it's between that small insignificant grey area and being a step into poverty..

All I'm saying is that yes anti werewolf prejudice was pretty intense but no one knew he was a werewolf and if the only people who found out after 20 something years were his literal dormmates who lived with him 24/7 two of which James and Sirius were known to be quite smart (and only after two years), Snape but only due to Sirius' "prank" which was essentially Snape being sent to Remus when he was a werewolf, Hermione who did all of the assignments on werewolves that Snape forced onto his classes, and the greatest wizard of all time Dumbledore, I reckon Remus is pretty good at hiding the fact he's a werewolf. Literally NO ONE else knew he was a werewolf unless he told someone and I don't recall that being mentioned in the books. Sorry for the word vomit and rant.
