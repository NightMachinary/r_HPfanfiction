So I was thinking of re-reading 8th year by holz9364 yet found that it doesn't exist anymore, its a bit of a shame as it was sort of a one of a kind fic. Anyone know what happened to it?

Cheers :D

**** Lots of reasons. among them: more freedom (FFnet does not allow explicit works), a tagging system, preference, they've suffered abuse, etc....
