** I agree with the other two comments.

Maybe ask for the personality instead? Non-slytheren ice queen or non-slytheren noon malfloy pureblood? Of course she is played so many ways you have to specify which personality you are looking for...

** I have to agree to 24thfox24.

But you should check X-Overs, maybe where the plot is in the other world and some of the Potterverse characters are included. Hope you're lucky in your search.
