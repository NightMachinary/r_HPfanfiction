I love the Weasley's, they are my favorite family. Even when I was in high school, I went through a huge phase of Slytherin Harry stories, I'd read even the ones that would bash the Weasley's, even though I hated that they did.

I've read some Harmony that ended up bashing and/or making it so Ron was no longer their friend. Which I just don't see happening in canon. I could see Ron and Ginny becoming jealous over Hermione and Harry's relationship, but I can also see them getting over it and accepting their relationship, I do not see the Weasley's ignoring or hating on Harry and Hermione.

But the few Harmony I've read, ended up bashing on the Weasley's, which I did not care for at all.

Another thing that I have issue with, is that too many have Harry without a backbone.

I highly expect Harry to argue with let's say Ginny, if the two of them disagree with each other. I highly expect the same thing to happen if Harry is with someone else. But the few Harmony I read had Harry without a backbone, agreeing with everything that Hermione said or did, even if Harry didn't really agree with her, he just did it because he didn't want an argument, which I just don't see happening.

Harry and Hermione are both stubborn people, in different ways, but still stubborn. If one did something the other didn't like, I'd imagine them to argue, just like with the whole potions book that Harry had.

So I do NOT want Weasley bashing, Ron and/or Ginny being jealous or upset is perfectly fine and in character, but I do NOT want them ending their friendships with Harry and Hermione.

Another thing: I do NOT want Harry without a backbone. If Harry and Hermione disagree I'd expect them to argue (if it's a bad disagreement), I do not expect Harry to just agree, just so they don't argue.

No OP Harry, Harry smarter or stronger then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable and because he worked for it.

The plot itself can be anything, Horcruxes can or doesn't have to be a thing. Can be set during the Golden Trio Era or the Next Gen.

Anyone can be the main character, can be any length, can be old or new, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

For other pairings: I'm fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** Easy recommendation.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I would love to read a simple opposite of the usual Weasley bashing. Namely, bashing of /purely/ the twins, with the rest of the family being friendly.

*** Very few writers are going to bash only the twins. Too many of them find the Twins' antics "funny" and "cool", and besides that, Harry needs to be best friends with the twins so that they can show how much better friends the twins are to Harry (compared to Ron) and leave opportunities for Weasley bashing.

I wish there was a fic where someone calls out the twins bs while leaving the rest of the family alone, but I also wish I had a million dollars.

Yeah...you aren't going to find many unless Ginny and Ron are completely absent from the fic.

  Hermione lifted up her ringless left hand and waved her fingers in front of him. Comprehension finally dawned on Draco's face. You want to get engaged? he asked astounded. Bingo! A postwar fic. DMHG

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. Rated M for later content.
