** Hello everyone.

I am an ALT in the JET Programme. I live in the ど田舎 (どいなか, doinaka, the deep countryside) in Japan. To pass my time, I've been writing a blog where the protagonist is an ALT at Mahoutokoro, the Japanese equivalent to Hogwarts.

You can find the site [[http://www.mahoutokoro.com][here]], but the first post to the blog is [[http://www.mahoutokoro.com/?p=7][here]].

You can also follow this on [[https://twitter.com/Mahoutokoro][Twitter]] and [[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008448692326][Facebook]].

I appreciate you checking out my story, and giving me feedback.

Also, I couldn't find an FAQ for this forum. Are there any rules about frequency of posting, self-promotion, etc.?

I intend to post a new entry once a week, but as I 'ramp up' with backstory leading to the first day of instruction, my posts will be a bit more frequent.

*** I've some questions not related to fanfiction.

Is it this company [[http://www.jet-uk.org/index.php]]?

Are you enjoying it? My friend is saving up to do the jet programme next year and I was thinking of doing it the year after if he enjoyed it. How advisable is it to start learning japanese before getting there and do you know if having tattoos is really an issue? (My friend has about 4 and they're all terrible, but I didn't say that shh.)

Thanks

**** I am starting my third year on JET. While it is the same as the site you linked, I am from the U.S., so our induction is a little different than the U.K.'s.

I enjoy it - but as I said in my introduction, I live in the doinaka - the deep country side. I have no neighbors and I have to drive an hour to get to a major city.

Each situation is different, though, and everyone has different experiences.

Definitely work on your Japanese now - it looks better on your application.

As for tattoos, I have one on my back. I rarely show it, and when I do, the people are kind of 'impressed' - which is to say they find it interesting. When I go to onsen, I have to wear a big bandaid to cover it. When I swim with my students (a real blessing in the summer time) I have to wear a swim shirt to cover it.

If the tattoo is on your forearm or somewhere overly visible, you'll likely have to keep it covered while working.

Good luck!

****** Sure thing!

One piece of advice: If you're going to do this, make sure you have an exit strategy! A lot of people come here and have no idea how to get back home. That is, sure, hop on a plane, return home. But they have no plans for after Japan. Have something in mind and cultivate that plan (or find a new one if need be) while in Japan.

*** A few points:

- get rid of the blog and post your story in an actual fanfiction-site! I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]]

These sites exist for a reason and have dozens of features (like chapter-support, automatic notifications, search functions etc.) that a blog does not have. Your blog is painful to read with chapters in reverse order etc.

- The story is told in first-person (that means using words like "I" and "me"). That is horrible!! Try to rewrite the entire thing from a third-person perspective instead.

- Do not EVER write dialogue the way you write a play.

#+begin_quote
  me: ...

  SF: ...

  me: ..
#+end_quote

NO! bad author! NO!

- About the story itself: I don't feel the "wizard-vibe"... Chapter 1 is just about a guy going to Japan and talking to customs. No wands, no floo, no wizard hat, no nothing. If you didn't explicitly told me this was supposed to be a HP story I would have never guessed it. Then what's the point? I want to read about magic, not about some guy taking a plane to Japan.

Overall I did not like it, both in structure and in content.

**** Why did you think wizards in Japan would have floo? Or wear those ridiculous pointy hats? Do you expect magic to be the same internationally? If so, why bother reading a story about magic in another country?

There's nothing wrong with fictional diaries. There are famous pieces of literature in that format. Whether this story will be awesome or not depends on how well it will be written.

As a muggle reader from Japan, I'm interested in knowing how Japan looks like from a foreigner's eyes, someone who isn't used to both the country and magic. Everything will be a new discovery for him, right? I'm looking forward to getting to know all of those surprises he will surely have.

While I don't think the story lacks "wizard-vibes", I must agree the presentation could be better. It would definitely be better if there was a chapter list. I think Twenty Fifteen isn't a theme suited for displaying stories.

***** [[/u/canaki17]],

Thank you. You summed up my point in telling the story perfectly.

And I agree, the format is pretty bad. I'll have to do some digging into a different WordPress theme in the near future.

[[/u/frix]],

If you want to read a great first person narrative about magic, check out [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Sorcerers-House-Gene-Wolfe/dp/B008D74YXQ][The Sorcerer's House]] by Gene Wolf. Not HP related, but an incredible read none-the-less.

And I'll work on the dialogue as well.

Truth be told, I have countless half-written stories as well as one huge one that I eventually want to tell. I am using Mahoutokoro to stretch my writing muscles before tackling the one I really want to tell (which also is not HP related).

I appreciate the feedback!

If he wants to go that route that's also fine, but he should at least make notice of it. Like have the foreign wizard point out that there is no floo or that it works differently etc. But he can't just flat-out ignore it.

If he wants to do the "fictional blog" (like a fictional diary) then he should go for it 100% and stick with a fictional blog. Right now there is this weird in-between format that is neither story nor blog and it doesn't work either way.

** IMO, rename the school. No school in Japan is going to be named Magic Place. 光線魔術学園 maybe? I assume it's a boarding school.

Also, remove all actual Japanese from the story unless you're using it as something that the reader isn't supposed to understand (e.g. the commercial scene from Lost in Translation) or it's really, /really/ important/relevant to use the Japanese word over the English one. The whole "foreign language (English translation)" writing is extremely jarring and prevents any kind of immersion in the story. That includes honorifics. A lot of readers aren't going to know what they signify and aren't going to care either.

TL;DR: setting your story in Japan is cool, being a weeaboo about it is not.

PS I was an ALT for two years in Kumamoto. Feel free to PM me if you ever need advice from a 先輩. :D

*** I didn't come up with the name of the school, Rowling did. It's mentioned on Pottermore and a few other places.

I want to somehow keep the Japanese vocabulary in the story. I agree that the way I do it is less than ideal, I think I can eventually use hover text or some such to keep it in.

That's...super disappointing, to be honest.

As for the use of Japanese, it's your prerogative, but as a reader, I would nope out of a story that did that so fast. It just screams "dude whose only exposure to Japan is through a monitor in his parents' basement," which obviously isn't even true in your case. Hats off to you if you can manage to pull it off, but I've /never/ seen it done well.

***** Disappointing name? Yeah. When I finally translated it (and after several failed attempts where it kept coming up as "Magical Plants" - had to ask a friend of mine for help with it) I was really, REALLY disappointed.

There is a little bit of info from Rowling about magic in Japan.

- Preferred wood for a wand is from a cherry tree

- The Japanese National Quidditch team plays at a secret location hidden within the grounds of Himeji Castle. The Quidditch 'pitch' is actually a massive koi pond and the grounds have Cherry Blossom trees that are eternally in bloom.

There's also some info about past and 'present' Quidditch players, a mention of local team in Japan (local to one of the cities, separate from the national team) but I cannot find it in my notes at the moment.

I did about three months of casual research into this before I started outlining. I think I found all the canonical info about magic in Japan.

One last comment about the use of Japanese language - at some point I'm going to start introducing Japanese spells, and they're not going to be Latin based like they are at Hogwarts. Thus, I am trying to find a way to integrate and explain these magic phrases into the story.

****** Jesus, Rowling spent a grand total of five minutes researching Japan, apparently.

Having the spells in Japanese is totally reasonable, IMO, I just wouldn't want to read it in dialog/prose, personally. I'm pretty fluent if you ever want help coming up with decently realistic sounding spells.

******* Thanks! I may take you up on that here and there. I'm decent with romance languages, but Japanese? It's a mystery. Been here two years and I can barely string together two words.

Likely I am just used to the directness of Spanish, French, and Italian and the "indirectness" of Japanese often leaves me wondering who or what the subject of a sentence is. (Also, dammit! Just say 'no' to me, don't tell me it's difficult, tell me you won't do it and then tell me who will - grrrrrrrr.)

I lived there for three years, but have been speaking Japanese for...shit, almost 17 now? Spanish can fuck right off, though. I was so happy to drop that class in high school once I found out that Japanese was a language I clicked with.

********* I'm jealous of anyone who can master Japanese.

Part of my issue with Japanese is that I live in the middle of nowhere. I am literally on top of a mountain with no neighbors. It's a ten minute drive to the closest conbini, thirty to the closest supermarket, and an hour to the nearest shinkansen station (my town has no train station at all).

I had asked for a countryside placement as I'd be forced to use my Japanese, but man, there's no one around to talk to.

I recently started studying karate at a dojo 'near' to my house. The fuckers keep trying to talk to me in English. SPEAK MOTHER-LOVING JAPANESE GODDAMMIT!! Even when I reply in Japanese or translate what they are saying from English back into Japanese, they respond in English. What the hell??

My GF - who is Japanese - likes that I speak a little Italian. In fact, it's partly why we started dating. She's going to backpack Europe in March and was nervous about the language barriers. I told her I speak Spanish (pretty well) and French (poorly, though I lived there for six months - and those were the best six months of my life) and a smattering of Italian. Then I jokingly said that I'd be happy to be her tour guide.

A week later, she asked me to join her in Italy for the last leg of her trip to Europe! Things have progressed nicely from there.

I was told that my style of flirting would never pay off here in Japan... looks like I was misinformed.

I have another thought about this:

Rowling runs an empire. When she puts her mind to it, she generally has a lot of detail to make things seem real and steeped with history.

But when she throws out small little things on twitter, etc., she doesn't seem to research it much. But where would she find the time?

Having said that, I am surprised she doesn't have a team of people on speed dial to call for cultural and linguistic questions like this.

"Hey, I need saintly sounding character from Swaziland, I need a name that communicates his giving nature."

or

"What do you imagine they would call the school of magic in China?"

There are people who would kill to do that for free let alone to get a bit of pay for doing it.

One thing I am thankful for about Mahoutokoro in general: While the name is horrid (and there's a massive plot point in my story that will cause a name change ALSO it's located in Kumoshima - Cloud Island (or Spider Island) ), Rowling really hasn't delved much into Japan and its relationship with magic. That allows me a HUGE amount of room to build up that mythology.
