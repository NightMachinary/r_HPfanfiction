** It's down but if you were in the middle of a story you can still access via the official ff.net app: [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fictionpress.fanfiction][android play store]]

For apple, I have no idea what you people use.

*** AO3 my good man! Nigh impossible to actually find a specific fic, but rather good at finding other, less well-known works.

**** AO3 is better than FFN when it comes to filtering gen, f/f, m/m, f/m, etc., but the tagging system /can/ be a bit of a pain, especially with the overabundance of nonsense tags. (Informative in theory, mostly twee in reality.)

Definitely needs better genre tags like FFN, though.
