I'm a bit confused whether or not a diffindo can be launched at an enemy

or is it just a close contact thing like when Harry decided to jump in the freezing lake thing and cut it with a diffindo

Or is it both and you choose with either wand motions or thoughts. If it was wand motions I'd say a slash through the air to send it and whatever motion slowly if close


** In GoF Ron uses it to attempt to cut off lace from his robes, leaving them a mess. Harry uses it to cut a strap on Cedric's bag (from something of a distance), and later to cut off the cover of a book. To me these sound like using scissors, and in Ron's case, not particularly sharp ones.

Of course, spells are pretty flexible, and can be used in different ways and in varying levels of power, depending on the caster's abilities - see for example Harry using the Severing Charm to break ice in DH.

But for the spell's "default" behaviour, I'd lean towards "like scissors".

*** Okay that does sound like it and I'd take a guess and say the amount of power used matters on the ”sharpness of the scissors”

So diffindo = big ass pair of invisible scissors

** It would probably work to cut people, but probably not to the extent of chopping off limbs and I don't think its be used like that much, after all there's many many more effective ways to hurt, kill or incapacitate with spells.

*** If Severing Charm is good at hurting people then I don't think Snape is gonna invent Sectumsempra which basically does the same thing

**** Wasn't /Sectumsempra/ different in two major ways, though? I mean, for one, it was a dark curse and resistant to the healing magic Harry attempts on Draco, and it was more like a series of cuts all over the body instead of a single slash or blade.

**** I mean, you can stab someone to death with nail scissors if you /really try/.

Doesn't mean it wouldn't be easier with a bigger knife.

Sectumsempra is a bigger knife.

*** I dont think that is what diffindo is for either. Sectum sempra would probably be able to cut off limbs though

** Diffindo is like invisible scissors, quite controllable but not that powerful and easily reversed through reparo. Sectumsempra is like a giant invisible sword, and it cannot be easily reversed.

*** Ok that's a good idea

Someone already told me that diffindo is just a big ass pair of invisible scissors and I figured the amount of power used would equal the ”sharpness” of the ”scissors”

Sectumsempra being an invisible sword makes sense but I don't know if I want to debate with you whether or not vulnera sanentur is an easy spell

** Yes, the famous Cutting Curse in so many fan fictions is in my opinion a pure fanon, and it doesn't really exist. Whether the Severing Charm is better for cutting textile (although Harry broke ice with it, true), or whether it could and whether it is used as a weapon, there is no answer for it in canon. My hunch is that there is something like that (the first reason for any invention is to use it as a weapon or for sex), but I don't think the Severing Charm is it.

*** Or it could be an example of a spell being made for one purpose being used as a weapon. I read a fic where it went over the entrail expelling spell being used on livestock and was perfectly acceptable until it was used by dolohov.

**** It was a butcher/renderer spell.

Like in Fanon how the Bloodboiling curse was for people suffering from Hypothermia.

**** Yes, somewhere somebody mentioned (firmly in fanon, the canon says nothing about it) the idea, that Cruciatus curse was originally invented for medical purposes.

***** I've always been doubtful about the unforgiveables being originally for medical purposes just because they are the only unblocakble spells and “you have to mean it”

****** I think a lot of people consider that Harry used the Cruciatus curse without the necessary hatred and will to cause harm, yet the curse still worked to knock down bellatrix. So that could be taken that the curse itself had some purpose (medically to do with nerves?) and was only when someone used it intentionally to do harm that it was discovered how horrible said curse was.

******* Consider the incantation - crucio, or "I torture" in Latin. All the other medical spells we hear have clear "healing" vocabular as their incentation, but this one has "I torture"? Can't see it having its roots in the medical field.

***** Yeah, no. The Unforgivables require extremely specific emotional states - Hatred, Dominion and Cruelty - and I don't see them used in the medical field or really anywhere except by dark wizards.

Like, the Cruciatus requires you to want someone be hurt unimaginably hard /without reason/, the Imperius curse requires you to want to divest all free will someone possesses, and the Killing Curse requires you to mean death for no other reason than pure hatred, and all three cause damage or corruption to your soul.

*** Yes that is why I am asking this because I want to write a fic but i dont know whether or not to make diffindo the only spell that ever gets used in a fight due to the simple motions or to just make diffindo able to cut paper and parchment easily and other thin materials like cloth and maybe ice
