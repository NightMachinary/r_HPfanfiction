:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A really long time ago I read a nextgen fic that was published before DH. So it was Ron and Hermione's daughter with Draco's son but they had different names. "Rose" was pregnant and at one point she apparated leaving the baby behind and ended up in the hospital. I've been trying to find it for ages.
