So i'm in quarantine rn and really bored. i'm almost out of things to read. if anyone knows any fics where the main character uses original magic, ancient rituals, blood magic, wand lore and things like that? i don't care about ships however i'm not a big fan of slash. the only criteria i have is that i'd like it to be finished. thanks for anyone who answers.


** Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Lots of innovative magic, although less ancient and more modern. Ritual components determined by computer algorithm. Light spell modified to create deadly laser beams. Rune clusters that move around individual atoms to synthesize custom molecules, including highly volatile chemicals. Giving the Marauders's Map a proper UI with zoom, search, record and playback. International magical infrastructure maintenence. Wand lore plays also a part.

*** Oh I really liked the Arithmancer series! I was actually writing this request with it in mind. Unfortunately, I've already read it. But thanx for your reply anyway.
