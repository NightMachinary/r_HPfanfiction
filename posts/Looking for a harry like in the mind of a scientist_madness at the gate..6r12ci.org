**** Gotcha, I perhaps read just the subject part, and it reads like an ad.

Have you tried Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality? linkffn(5782108)

******** That is of course your right, but honestly isn't there enough negativity going around. If you don't like it just don't read it, it is one of the best parts of having free will.

********** Fair point, but this isn't a fanfiction review, this is a request for a fanfiction that means certain criteria. Whether good or bad, the request was to fill the criteria.

My point is, if you feel you don't like the story that much that you just have to say it is garbage, at least put a story down that you consider better that fits in with what the request is. Otherwise you are just wasting the time of the person asking for help.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

****** It sounds like it would fit, but trust me it doesn't, he is in no way rational. As the story goes on he starts becoming more and more irrational, while acting like its rational.
