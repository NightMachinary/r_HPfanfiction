The lost empress of LV/HP fanfic just updated +3+ 4 new chapters of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] today. There go my plans for vacuuming.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/25/Again-and-Again]])

I believe this links to the first new chapter, as i remember chapter 24, but not 25. On the other hand, that would imply 4 new chapters, not 3 as the op stated.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
