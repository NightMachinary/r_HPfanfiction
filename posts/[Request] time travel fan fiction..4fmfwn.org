I was, and still am blown away whenever I re-read or think about Harry and hermione's time travel in PoA, particularly the part where Harry thought he saw his Dad. I've been fascinated ever since I first read PoA when I was 12 with time travel (a mark of how much the HP franchise influenced me and million other kids) and seen all kinds of movies like Predestination, The Time traveler's wife, Triangle, Timecrimes etc etc etc.

So what's the best time travel related HP FF that you guys have read? Don't mind complexity one bit, don't go easy on me.


** I'll get the obvious ones out of the way:

*Backwards with Purpose:* linkffn(4101650)

I /personally/ don't care for this fic, but there's little to criticize about it as far as writing is concerned. Every time it's mentioned, it's referred to as the "gold standard" of time travel fics, so while I disagree, there's a good chance you'll like it.

*Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time:* linkffn(4068153)

This is certainly a case of not going easy on you if that's what you're after. Highly unique fic with a lot of merit, but the writing can be a little hard to get through at times. If you like something a bit more "out there", this is certainly worth looking at.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

**** It's nothing to do with the technical side of it, the writing is undeniably good. I'm just very bored by it, I find it an uninteresting setup that's handled in an only marginally more interesting than usual way.

I also find some things about it weird, like how two people in their twenties can remain physically attracted to one another despite returning to their 10 year old bodies. It doesn't give me a 'squick' effect, it just probably deserved more of a comment in the story than Ron's "We've become very perverted, haven't we?"

Again, if you like the setup, you'll like the story. I just... don't. That's all.

** EDIT: something wrong with the bots, link to the fics directly now

Time travel is my favorite HP fanfic setting, and I like following stories:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]*, linkffn(5511855): Harry went back 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. I like this one even better than *Backward with Purpose*.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]*, linkffn(4740107): Ginny went back alone, and finished off Voldemort in a very efficient way.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]*, linkffn(10687059): is mostly from Hermione's POV on a time-traveling Harry, and how she came to terms with what Harry did.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]*, linkffn(10972919): someone died in the 2010s, turned up in young Tom Riddle's head as Jerry (Harry?), and started guiding him towards world domination.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9757451/1/Three-Turns][Three Turns]]*, linkffn(9757451): Harry & Hermione time travel to the Marauder era.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]*, linkffn(8581093): One of the best Hermione in Marauder era story.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]*, linkffn(10871795): A great story showing how 'Hermione traveling back to Marauder Era should have worked'.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]]*, linkffn(3735743): Snape's second chance with Lily.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6548167/1/His-Greatest-Wish][His Greatest Wish]]*, linkffn(6548167): Another Snape/Lily story, with heavy James Potter bashing though.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]*, linkffn(4536005): is quite hilarious.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
