*** Definitely would try that OP.

Sure, this sub is home to plenty of great writers, but [[/r/writingprompts]] should hopefully have a larger, more diverse pool of authors who might take on the prompt.

#+begin_quote
  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

***** That sounds hilarious and like it could be really good. Is it actually good or would I just be wasting my time? That fic isn't exactly short.

****** It really entertained me at first, but eventually Harry Lockhart became too perfect for everything- standard "richest man in the world, solves every problem with ease, etc." It was fine early on, but it got way too grating about halfway through. If that's your kind of fic, go for it, but it's not really "actually good."

*** Yup! One of the rules in their subreddit is to not post the links in the case of brigading for at least up to 24 hours. Thanks for sharing, though - I'm sure it's fine so long as /I'm/ not the one doing it, and there have been some pretty awesome responses to it I'm sure the people here would like to read. :)
