** Wards are magical protections, usually placed about a dwelling or an area (or perhaps an object, like a trunk).

I've gotten the impression, over the years, that the idea of wards originally came from the Dresden Files. Though it could have another source, wards are definitely employed in that series.

Thinking about it, Hermione used wards around each area they set up their tent during the Horcrux hunt--though I'm not sure they were ever actually referred to as such. I think that what she employed might have just been referred to as 'protection spells' (or something along those lines).

Good to know that about Dresden. This very question has bugged me for ages.

And [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Anti-Disapparition_Jinx][anti-disapparition jinxes]]. Cannon doesn't seem to make much of a distinction between the different terms, unlike fanfiction were the term "ward" has a very specific meaning.

*** The Wheel of Time talks about wards, predating the Dresden Files by ten years. It's another candidate for the source of the term in HP fandom.

** Earliest reference as a spell that I recall is the Advanced D&D spells '[[http://pandaria.rpgworlds.info/cant/rules/adnd_spells.htm#Guards%20And%20Wards][Guards and Wards]]' and '[[http://pandaria.rpgworlds.info/cant/rules/adnd_spells.htm#Glyph%20Of%20Warding][Glyph of Warding]]' (published c.1978).

Where the designers drew their inspiration may have come from classic fantasy fiction of one sort or another (Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser; Elric of Melnibone; Chronicles of Amber), but the term comes from normal English- 'you stoke the fire to ward off a chill'. It's also the root word for Warden, an official who keeps the borders intact.

** In canon, they're not remotely well described. It's never said whether they were based on runes or charms or were enchantments or anything like that. But they were mentioned: Hogwarts' wards (anti-apparition among others), 12 Grimmauld Place (Fidelius, unplottable, others), Potters residence in Godric's Hollow (Fidelius), Shell Cottage (Fidelius), Burrow (various), World Cup (notice me not muggle wards), Number 4 Privet Drive (blood wards), Malfoy Manor (various), St. Mungos (muggle notice me not), and during the camping trip Hermione and Harry put up dozens of wand based wards.

So they exist in canon, but not much is said about them, similar to how little is said about arithmancy and runes, which is what makes them fun to play with.

** I always wondered this as well, since in the books protective magic on a place is always called an enchantment, not a ward. But stories somehow end up using things like pentagrams and runes to imbue magic into things rather than spells and wands.

I suppose some people wanted arithmancy to be useful and ancient runes be more than a dead language, so they borrowed magic systems from other works of fantasy to craft wards, were enchantments didn't seem good enough. Some stories give this magic to goblins as a replacement for wands, and others use it to represent old or lost magic that's more physical to describe. Some of it is done well, but others not so much.

Personally, I go with enchantments that alter the natural magic imbued within objects to keep and hold spells for extended periods of time. While individual magic spells can enchant objects temporarily, it wears off rather quickly.

** Wards do exist in canon: the Janus Thickey Ward of St. Mungo's, for example. ;)

While "wards" as such are fanon, something functionally equivalent to wards certainly does exist even if they're never referred to as such. Apparition is impossible in Hogwarts, making it plausible to believe that /something/, some spell or whatnot, is preventing wizards from doing so. Whether it's in actuality a charm, an enchantment, a spell, a curse, or a jinx, a whatever is immaterial as whatever it is seems to act how one might expect a ward to act: as a bit of magic that provides areal protection from a potentially invasive agent. Harry's mother's blood protection on Number 4 is another example, as is Snape's /Muffilato/, the /Repello Muggleton/ from /Goblet of Fire/, and the /Protego Horribilis/ cast by Flitwick in /Deathly Hallows/.

** The magic-system in Harry Potter is very poorly worked out. It barely goes farther than "here's a wand, now do some magic by chanting in pig-latin". But nothing is explained further than that, like "how does one make a broom?" for instance is never touched upon.

So many fanfic-authors borrow aspects from other magic systems that are more deeper and much more detailed. "Wards" is one example of a widely used magic-system in many popular fiction stories. I believe the "Dresden Files" makes use of them.
