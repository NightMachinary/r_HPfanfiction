  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso][recnac transfaerso]] Very old fic that helped get me into fanfictions so it holds a special place in my heart.\\
Harry transfers the cancer of a family friend into himself due to low self worth then through the story learns to live since his time is limited.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][browncoat, green eyes]] was the first crossover i read. Firefly/hp harry in the firefly universe but its quite well done and funny. even all these years later ham cubes make me chuckle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][old soldiers never die]] Was the first harry utilizes the muggle military fic i read. Harry is given an old pistol from uncle vernon in order to kill the freaks and things spiral from there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][finding home]] hp/avengers crossover. im a sucker for pretty much all of this crossover type but this is a good place to start on them. Harry is not aging, leaves the wizarding world and ends up finding he enjoys making things and tinkering. ends up running a garage in new york where he meets tony stark and shenanigans happen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][i see the moon]] one of my absolute favorites. hp/avengers again but this one is harry's mind is broken after the war, he ends up traveling with hulk/bruce banner. NOT slash, bruce tries to learn about his friend and help him as travel. It is a really amazing and sad thing to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long journey home]] I am a huge sucker for alternate history and or time travel stories and this one is the best imo. Fem harry ends up thrown way back in time after the war and the story takes a look at various time periods such as when she is in england around the time merlin, or when dumbledore is trying to track down rumors of an immortal witch in america, or when she traveled to the indus river valley civilization. There are also interludes of her back in modern day england.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de sangre]] Takes place in the last few years of hogwarts where harry interacts with a female voldemort and learns things are not exactly as black and white as he thought the more he learns of her past. Its really well written and doesn't give any easy answers or ways out. also the author is a cheeky bugger who posts here on reddit so that's fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12117770/1/Who-Will-Fill-a-Coward-s-Grave][who will fill a cowards grave]] a good modern example of robst's writing with a bit of a darker of a plot than normal. Its not everyone's cup of tea but many like his harry/hermione pairings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11251745/1/The-Power-of-Love][the power of love]] fem slash fem harry/hermione. Its the best example of that pairing, its well written and feels like its dealing with teenagers finding their way in the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11675231/1/Shiver-me-Timbers][Shiver me timbers]] hp/star wars crossover. Earth is hoth a long time into the future after a disaster happens. Typical immortal harry idea. Harry wakes up far in the future during the battle of hoth and ends up stuck with the alliance for a while. Its an interesting and funny take on what would happen from there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12343855/1/The-Swallow-and-the-Dragon][the swallow and the dragon]] hp/the witcher crossover. ciri portals to england to find harry hiding out and being somewhat emo back around 6th year summer. she pulls him out of his funk and gives him some motivation to fight but she moves on not wanting to bring the white hunt down on earth. War is finished and harry decides to track ciri down back in the world of the witcher's but shows up too early by hundreds of years and tries to set the stage to help her when she comes back.

Edit: There are a bunch more that i really enjoyed but ill leave it there for now. cheers.
