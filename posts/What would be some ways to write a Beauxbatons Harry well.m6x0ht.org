Like lets say that instead Harry, somehow, or another, manages to get a letter to Beauxbatons first instead of Hogwarts. How would you write such a story well?

Obviously it's a Fleur x Harry fic but a slow build one and one that doesn't focus on it until the second half when Harry's at least fourteen or fifteen. The implications though are there though

Nevertheless how would you write this well?


** I'm guessing Harry might have some language difficulties that leave him isolated and confused at the beginning. I imagine his BWL status is kind of overlooked, and he's floundering a little bit - maybe about to get kicked out because of poor grades until one day people realize he's a Quidditch prodigy. And then somebody decides to do something about it. Maybe he becomes close friends with a half-goblin or some other marginalized or bullied individual. He's kind of shocked when he learns he is famous in Britain.

** Don't assume Harry being a boy at Beauxabatons is special. It's a co-ed school.

Harry is going to likely have steep competition for Fleur's affections from older and more attractive boys.
