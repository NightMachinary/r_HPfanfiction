While Sirius falling through the Veil is one of the most important, and tragic, events in Harry Potter's life, I couldn't help but wonder, what would have happened if someone else fell through?

Suppose Bellatrix was blasted through instead of Sirius and now Voldemort is down his most vicious fighter?

Or perhaps Lucius, which infuriates Draco far beyond the embarrassment and resentment he had in canon?

Does anyone know any stories like that?

** I believe it's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Future's Past) that has almost all (if not all) of the Death Eaters get thrown through by a clever trap Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna create.

I haven't read this in forever, so I'm not certain if I'm correct here, but I believe there's quite a bit of Ginny bashing here. Maybe Ron too, but again, I don't remember. I believe Ginny is just outright psychotic, delusional, and deranged.

*** Judging from the bot, it looks like you are right about the bashing.

300,000 words is nothing to sneeze at though, and I have to admit I'm impressed that it's been updated over seven years.
