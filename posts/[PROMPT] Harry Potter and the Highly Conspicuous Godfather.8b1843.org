Write a short scene where Sirius' Animagus form is, rather than a dog, a large, exotic, or otherwise conspicuous animal.

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Short scene: 200+ words long
- Sirius' Animagus form is different
- Takes place sometime during the third book

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- Nobody noticing Sirius, regardless of how absurd the form is.
- the Auror department being really confused by his escape ("/Sir, it would appear that Black utilized a War Elephant in his escape/")
- a fitting, new Marauder name
- Luna Lovegood accurately identifying Sirius
- The form being an obscure animal that wizards dont think could be an animagus because they think it's a magical animal
- A Flashback to when the Marauders first learned animagery, and their reactions to said form


** Harry saw a flash of movement from an alley across the street, and raised his wand. The word '/Lumos/' was on the tip of his tongue when, with a loud BANG!, a massive, purple, triple-decker bus appeared.

"Welcome to the Knight Bus! The Only Mode of Transportation for a Stranded Witch or Wizard, only 11 Sickles - what're ya doin' on the ground?"

"I fell over."

"What did ya fall over for?"

"I didn't do it on purpose! I saw something over ther-"

The bus-boy turned towards the alley and blinked. A large giraffe, hunched over awkwardly, was staring at them with the expression of a deer caught in headlights.

"Will you be wantin' to bring your, eh...?"

"That's a giraffe."

"Are you bringing it, though? 'Cuz that'll be another 11 Sickles. 17 if it wants hot chocolate."

The giraffe leaned towards the bus-boy and spat 17 sickles into his hand.

"Alright then, get right on, sir. Where are you going?"

The giraffe looked pointedly at Harry who blinked again. "Erm... Diagon Alley." He fished his own money from his pockets and dropped it in the man's hand.

"Alright, then, giraffe. You might want to duck - actually, do you mind the open top level?"

The animal shook its head slowly.

"Right. Erm... sir?"

"Stan's the name. Stan Shunpike."

"Can I have a levitation charm on the giraffe? Just get it onto the top level of the bus."

** "Uhm, Harry, what was that?" Hermione wanted to know as she watched Malfoy's retreating back, a suspiciously yellow liquid dripping from his robe, while Crabbe and Goyle looked like they had fainted dead on the spot. Honestly, couldn't she leave the boy alone for five minutes without him getting into some sort of trouble?

"I just showed him my snake," Harry replied far too calm for that statement. The Gryffindor witch missed a step and immediately went through all interactions between Harry and other boys she could remember. While his friendship with Ron looked normal, the one with the Weasley twins made her pause. They seemed just a little too friendly with each other, so something must have happened after the Quidditch practices. That still did not explain his sudden interest in Malfoy however. Or why the Slytherin ran away while his goons fainted. Harry couldn't be that well endowed, right?

"Oh Harry, that's alright," the brunette soothed as she drew him into one of her patented hugs. While unexpected, there was nothing wrong with her friend's attraction to other boys. However, since he also had the tendency to sneak glances at her own breasts when he felt like she wouldn't notice, Hermione concluded that Harry had to be bisexual while already coming up with a list of suitable dates who were better than Malfoy.

"Uhm, what?"

"It's fine, I don't judge you."

"I... I don't understand," Harry mumbled from somewhere in her mane while wrapping an arm around her neck. Honestly, what else had he expected, that she'd run away screaming?

"Don't move?"

Now it was Hermione's turn to be confused since she could feel both his hands on her back, and yet there was an arm around her neck. However, before she could ponder thing further, something long and red entered her peripheral vision and she found herself face to face with a red snake which appeared to be grinning widely. While definitely a comical expression on a reptile, it still took Hermione a lot of effort not to scream. Or to shriek. Or to squeal. Or make any other embarrassing noise when you suddenly found a Red Milk Snake wrapped around your neck.

"Hermione, meet Sirius, /Sirius, Hermione/"

The reptile replied with a hiss and the witch found it both fascinating and very creepy to watch her friend talk to a snake. The one time in the duelling club had been a little too chaotic for an in-depth study and now that she was watching Harry's tongue move in a completely inhumane way, she felt the desire to write herself on the number one spot of his dating prospects.

"Where did you get him?" she asked slowly, still a little wary of the animal.

"At the edge of the forbidden forest. Apparently, he lived there for a long time since he actually knew my parents. You wouldn't believe the stories a snake could tell you."

"So you found a... how long is he exactly?"

"I don't know, probably around two yards."

"You found a two-yard snake and decided to adopt it?"

"Sure. Besides, he's a lot nicer than the last one I talked too. And not venomous."

"Harry, just because it's not a basilisk... You know what, it's only Tuesday and I don't want to end up grey before we graduate from Hogwarts. Just keep her away from my bed, alright?" Hermione sighed and chose the path of least resistance. There were many reasons why her friend should not keep /Sirius/, but she was not getting paid enough to worry about that. Well, she was not getting paid in the first place, despite that /keeping Harry out of trouble/ was a full-time job. Especially with Sirius Black still on the loose. But that was a topic for another day, especially since Sirius, well the snake named Sirius, was surprisingly good at neck massages. Perhaps she should even get one of these magical snakes for herself.

"So, have you taught him any tricks yet?"

** "Ah, minister, what brings you to Hogwarts on this fine day?" asked Dumbledore jovially as he lent back in his chair.

"I know that you know what's going on, Dumbledore," the minister blustered. "And I demand an explanation."

"I'm afraid you have me quite at a loss, minister," said Dumbledore carefully. "Unless you are talking about those foul creatures that you insist on stationing at my school, I don't know of anything that you should be made aware."

"It's that new pet of Hagrid's," the minister spat, his face now turning crimson. "It is causing havoc in the village and they keep blaming me for it."

"What new pet is this?" asked Dumbledore, now intensely curious. "I must confess that I haven't noticed anything unusual on the grounds."

"That's because it's not on the grounds," the minister fumed. "It keeps running down into Hogsmeade, stealing fruit and molesting people."

"Steali- molesting people?! What on earth is this creature?" asked Dumbledore, a look of astonishment on his face. "You are quite sure of this?"

"Of course I'm sure," the minister fumed. "I personally went to investigate down in Hogsmeade and they have reported their kitchens being raided every night and every single piece of fruit stolen. The creature even had the audacity to leave banana peels in a pattern that looked like it spelled the word "Kong" in the main street."

"As terrible as those crimes are, I must insist you tell me what you meant by molesting people," said Dumbledore, more confused than ever. "What have they said about that? I can't allow children out of the school if there's any danger of that."

"Well, I, err, nobody else has complained about it," said Fudge slowly, dropping his gaze to the floor and shuffling awkwardly.

"Then why did you say such a thing?" asked Dumbledore slowly.

"BECAUSE IT TRIED TO SHOVE BANANAS UP MY BACKSIDE!" Fudge roared, spinning around and lifting his robes where the remains of many bananas were smeared all over the seat of his pants.

"I see," said Dumbledore, choking back a laugh. "I presume you saw the creature during your experience?"

"Well, not exactly," said Fudge, breathing deeply. "I was walking up to the school to discuss this with you when great, hairy arms grabbed me. One hand, paw, thing went over my face as it held me up against it and the other tried to shove the bananas up... Up there!"

"So, it has arms, you say," said Dumbledore slowly, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "And writes the word "Kong" in peels which it gets from stolen fruit. I have never heard of such a creature. You didn't happen to catch a sight of it after your, umm, unfortunate experience?"

"I was in shock," said Fudge. "Never, ever, in my entire life have I been so disrespected."

"Of course, of course," said Dumbledore soothingly as he stood up from his chair. "I must have been horrific. Now, how about we go down to Hagrid's hut and see what we can find. Don't worry, I shall personally guard you to make sure nothing penetrates your defenses."

** /Death Omens: What To Do When You Know The Worst Is Coming/

"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you. You'll start seeing death omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death." the bookstore assistant said mildly, "Don't pay any attention to the one next to it.

Harry paid attention anyway: /'Oh, SHIT' Omens: What To Do When You Know Something Even Worse Than Before Is Right Behind You/

This second book had a picture of a very large, very menacing moth on the cover.

"Although I'll admit, you're very unlikely to see a giant moth anywhere, not unless you watch those muggle Godzilla films," the assistant added.

--------------

*Later, a very rainy quidditch match...*

If a Legilmens were to read Harry's mind at that moment, their head would surely explode from the sheer profanity running through it.

It wasn't enough that there was an escaped mass murderer after him or that the madness-inducing monsters that failed to hang on to him before were now stationed around Hogwarts, oh, no, it had to /rain/ on his favourite thing, Quidditch!

A rumble of thunder in the sky accurately reflected Harry's thunderous mood at that moment.

But then the sky lit up, illuminated by a flash of lightning, and in that moment, Harry saw it; not the Snitch, but a /thing/, perched on top of one of the Quidditch pitch's towers like an oversized gargoyle (or technically, grotesque).

It was...no, he was imagining things.

Another flash of lightning. He wasn't imagining things. There was a giant moth.

A big giant moth.

An /abso-fecking-lutely GIGANTIC/ giant moth.

And it was in the air with him.

...There were very few things that could take Harry's mind well and truly off the Snitch during a Quidditch match, but an oversized moth fluttering its way through the rain and hail (towards him) did it.

** Hermione stared at her friend, who held his new pet, while cradling her own new cat.

"What. Is. That?" She asked pointedly.

/That/ happened to be a meter long snake, covered in brightly colored feathers (red, orange, yellow, green and blue) and a pair of crumpled bone white horns on its head. It's tail had many long white feathers that were flared out like an exotic bird's, and it had several taloned wings along it's body, which it was using to otherwise hang onto Harry. Silvery grey eyes regarded her with what frighteningly looked like mischievous interest, which was a tad unsettling coming from a snake

"This is Featherduster, I think he is an offshoot relative breed of the quetzalcoatl."

"And why did you name it Featherduster?"

"It was either that or French Maid, since those were the only things in the picture he indicated when I asked what his name is. That and his tail looks like one. There's some... translation issues, I think, since he's a South American species or something. The accent I'm hearing is hard to understand in parceltongue."

"Where did you get a picture of a French Maid?"

"My cousin's not so hidden stash."

"Wait, what about Hedwig?"

"She didn't like him at first, but they got along the next day. I think she established the pecking order, as Featherduster was missing some feathers that morning."

BREAK

"Is that a crumpled-horned snorkack?"

Harry looked up at the young doe-eyed blonde staring unblinkingly at Featherduster. "I'm not sure. Why don't you come in and tell me about it and maybe we can figure that out."

"Okay." The blonde replied before entering the compartment and sitting down across from him, ignoring Ron who scooted away from her (and tried yet again to get /farther/ away from Featherduster). "I'm Luna Lovegood, and you are Harry Potter. A pleasure to meet you."

"Er, yes, well, this is Hermione, Ron, Hedwig my owl, and this is Featherduster the lapwarmer."

"So how did you escape?" Harry asked now that they had a moment of calm.

"Well, I've been able to leave my cell for years now, being so small, but I could never get past the wards that'd plop me right back on the island every time I tried to fly away. Figured it would be best to not get caught trying, so security would stay lax. Anyways, after I found out the rat was still around, I tried and tried and tried, until finally I was so tired I just landed on the docks. Scared me near to death when one of the guards grabbed me though. Turns out, he he thought I had gotten blown in by a weather system and horribly far from home, so he took me back to Britain at shift change and I vanished as soon as I could. After watching him get yelled at my his boss, I almost wished I had done a song and dance routine like that one frog I remember seeing on the telly."

**** I thought it a nice touch that one of the guards helps him escape by not thinking it strange that a South American "magical" snake ends up at Azkaban. Didn't feel up to Luna ousting Sirius, so had Hedwig do similar off screen instead (threatened him, then got an explanation from him as to why he was there). The "accent" is Sirius's bad attempt at speaking snake: not enough experience to get the words right. And I thought it funny to have Harry guess his Marauder name wrong (which would help hide him from Remus and the twins).

Edit: thank you for the praise.
