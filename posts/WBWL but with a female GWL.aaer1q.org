I think it would be pretty interesting to see Harry in the classic WBWL scenario but with a female Potter instead. The interactions at Hogwarts would be different for one and Harry could perhaps have some different views because of his parent's abandonment.

And if this does exist, does the fact that the GWL is, well, a girl actually change something substantial to the story?


** There is a cracky Fem!Harry story where Cassandra (Fem!Harry) is the lovechild of James and Lily while James was married to someone else. They have a daughter at roughly the same age, who later joins Hogwarts. Not sure who was the GWL in that story, but it definitely has some "right/wrong daughter of James" moments.

Cassandra and her sister get along splendidly and work together, even forming their own Hogwarts house

Warnings for crack and not so serious, exaggerated Dumbledore and James bashing. Also, the first few chapters are really dark while the rest is fluffy crack.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Hold on are you looking for Fem!Harry is the true GWL but her parents think it's their other child?

Or are you looking for Male!Harry who is the true BWL but his sister thought to be the GWL and Harry has to deal with that?

It's still a WiP and has f!hp/Voldemort, but it's actually not that bad. It also has no james and lily bashing. It does have a few issues with Dumbledore.

**** The author can get their kink going (in this case, H/Voldemort) without pesky things (like thinking of a plot) interfering.
