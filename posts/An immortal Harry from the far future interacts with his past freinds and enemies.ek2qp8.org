**** Do you know, is it much like other fics by this author? I've read Harry met tom and enjoyed it(kind of) but sisyphus bored me pretty quickly. I found the depiction of death!lily unique but i felt like her character wasn't going anywhere.\\
And what's up with the pairing? If not a threesome, is it first one pairing then the other?

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

It's FemHarry and the time travel happens on the front end (Harry gets sent to the distant past and is immortal so just lives life until modern times) but it is pretty much what you are looking for.

** Linkffn(10709411) Is kinda like that, only it's temporarily immortal Harry (something like 2350 years) and he goes back in time from the present to the distant past, and his past self in the present interacts with his future/past friends and enemies. Similar with linkffn(10182397).

Warning: Basilisk Born contains a really OC Dumbledore, who is not the greatest. At all. Best to give it a go, and see if you can stand it.

Nightmare Man is proper Evil!Harry. Not Dark, or grey, he's just evil. And sometimes really wholesome.

** linkffn(on a pale horse), obviously

linkao3(The Graveyard Is Empty Because The Ghosts Are In My Head) - abandoned, gen. The beginning (when Harry is back in time) is full of tropes (he's lord potter-black-insert-many-surnames-here, I almost dropped it there but I was curious and read further) but actually after Gringotts it's pretty good.

  War was never something that was finished in a day, but for Harry Potter, his life seemed to fall apart in one.Death's master was not a title anyone would want if they knew the consequences, but Harry didn't know this, being busy with his trying to stay alive in the midst of a war.So when the Hallows claim him as their Master, what's he to do but go a little insane?
