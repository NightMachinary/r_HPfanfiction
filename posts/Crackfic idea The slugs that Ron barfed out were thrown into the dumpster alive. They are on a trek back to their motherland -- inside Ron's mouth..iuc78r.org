** It's even better if you write it all serious, from the perspective of the slugs, and never mention exactly where they are going until they get there.

*** Imma do this. As in, in the next few weeks. This is amazing.

Update: /Motherland (A Slug's Tale)/ is now a cover saved in my drafts on Wattpad :)

Update 2: I have written the first bit of Chapter one. Do you guys want a preview?

Alrighty I got a yes, so here ya go:

/Existence./

There had been nothing, no thought, no feeling, just an absence of self, and then It was /there. Alive./

It was then violently shoved out of a pink tube. It lay cushioned in soft green that it could tell was breathing and living underneath It, and couldn't care less. It sat there, reveling in this new sensation of being alive, when a second thing, similar to Itself fell into the green, and It couldn't help but think, /Sibling/.

Sibling apparently heard It, and responded with a nod, seeming to like it's new name; that is, if either of them had had the mental capacity to truly appreciate a name.

Yeah that's all I got so far, I'll update later.
