I am writing a fanfic and one thing that I want to change is not having the Dursley's move out, instead they remain at their house and either Professor Mcgonagall or Snape come to pick Harry up.

I still have plans of Hagrid meeting Harry at Diagonal Alley. His friendship with Hagrid will remain the same as cannon on my fanfic and he will still receive Hedwig as a gift from him.

I also want to clarify some things:

- Adults will be more sensitive to Harry's situation. They will speak to him about James and Lily, their life at hogwarts, their friends and in what classes they were best. This, plus Hermione's nagging, will make Harry take more seriously his school life.
- Snape won't be a twat. Snape's animosity against Harry will be lowered. It is unbecoming. He won't have love for Harry but will see him as just a simply another incompetent student at the beginning. When he sees Lily's talent in potions on Harry he will simply explain things better to the whole class to allow Harry a chance to develop his potion skills without giving away any favoritism.
- The Dursleys are not dumb. Harry has lives with them for years and everybody knows about the second kid of living with them. They do make sure that Harry has his own clothes and that he is well fed, to keep up appearances. It will be their death in social standing if police came to them for child abuse. They don't love him and make him do a lot of chores.

But I am struggling with three points:

- How would Mcgonagall/Snape react when they see Harry did not grew up in a loving environment? There was no physical abuse, emotional abuse only. Harry doesn't wear Dudley clothes on my fanfic, he has his own, the Dursley's wouldn't allow to have him embarrassing them in public. He had his own room and he ate enough (if they malnourished him others would notice and that's a shame they won't accept). But Harry did have signs of emotional abuse. Low self-esteem, social withdrawal, etc.
- In cannon, Hagrid gives Dudley a pig tail. That sets a deep fear on the Dursley's that would make them treat Harry a bit better for their fear of magic. What would Mcgonagall or Snape do to achieve the same?
- They still meet him on his birthday. Snape would surely ignore that fact so I don't worry with him. But Mcgonagall wouldn't forget, would she bring a gift for Harry? A cake? Or maybe she buys him something at Diagonal Alley?


** I think McGonagall would be the best and more logical choice as I can't possibly imagine Snape accepting to go because a) it's Potter's son b) it's Petunia c)it's not his job to give letters to Muggle-borns/raised and introducing them to the wizarding world. Now, I'm sure Petunia remembers McGonagall's face clear as day, but I think she would be more willing to talk with a woman of normal size and who has a certain grasp of Muggle fashion if a little outdated (at least it's the 1940-1950s she would remember and not the 1960-1970s, so that's a relief) to a giant of a man dressed in rags and with unkempt hair and beard.

I don't think McGonagall would or could do much about Harry's situation considering you bettered it from canon and at the time child abuse laws were more loose and the wizarding world seems to at least lack as much knowledge about psychology than the Muggle world had in the 1990s if not less so. I imagine she would be displeased, but that would be that. If there was no cupboard, meaning no second room for Dudley, no too large hand-me-downs, and if he was properly fed than even modern child services wouldn't have much leg room to stand on if Harry's relatives just don't love him. They do what they're required to do for him to be physically healthy, give him decent lodgings, decent clothes, decent feeding. Tough luck, kid.

The reason Hagrid gave a pig tail to Dudley is a bit caused by the former's immaturity. He's very far from his thirteen year-old self, but he's still a child at heart and it's glaringly obvious. Vernon insulted Albus Dumbledore, the man who supported Hagrid when everyone else was against him and let him have a place in the wizarding world despite his expulsion and the snapping of his wand and a decent and stable job. Hagrid clearly idolises the man and his a bit childish personality causes him to perform partial Transfiguration on a by-standing child. McGonagall would never do such a thing and the situation would need to get drastically than in the books for her to even begin to think about using magic on Muggles in such a fashion. What we must remember is that Hagrid never had much contact with Muggles and is pretty much pure-blood regarding his knowledge about the Muggle world. The man's one hundred percent a product of the wizarding world, no questions asked.

Minerva, on the other hand, was raised in the Muggle world by a Presbyterian priest and a witch who appears to have renounced her magic for her marriage and only told her husband and daughter about magic and her being a witch when Minerva received her acceptance letter. Minerva also had immense love for a Muggle man and would have married him if it didn't mean taking the same path her mother had taken two decades prior. She would never use magic on Muggles like that because she is much more mature than Hagrid, but also because she sees Muggles as human as any witch or wizard. It just wouldn't happen.

Finally, I guess McGonagall could maybe give Harry a small present, but she would give it to him in Diagon Alley. I'm pretty sure she would think it be wiser than giving it in front of his relatives. As for what the present is, that's for you to figure out.

*** I mildly disagree that it is not his job to give the letters to muggle-borns. We know from canon that McGonagall visits Hermione Granger and her parents, but we have no clue how it is handled in general. It could be McGonagall alone doing the rounds, but it could also be split among the head of houses. I personally find the latter to be more likely, bc it is more efficient this way. Approx 20-25% of students seem to be muggle-born, that is about 10 students each year. If 4 teachers do 2 students each it is done in a few days while it would take one person closer to 14 days - 14 days of precious holiday time.

**** Actually, from the 34 students we know of in Harry's year, only 3 are stated to be Muggle-borns, and that's a year that should, in theory, have a large number of Muggle-borns compared to the other years in terms of ratio.

****** I mean, you can only take this list with a very large grain of salt. It says Hannah Abbott is Muggle-born when her family is part of the secret 28, Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner are noted as a Hufflepuffs despite being in Ravenclaw in the books, Seamus is noted as pure-blood despite being half-blood. So, you can't really base off yourself on this only.

*** It could be Snape. It's easy to say that Mcgonagall was too busy for the start of the new term and Dumbledore trusted Snape more to do it. But yes, I do prefer if it is Mcgonagall.

On this case, Harry did manage to get the first school letter without Vernon finding out. For lack of a better idea, he sends a reply back asking for help and discretion because his relatives hate everything not normal, that's why Dumbledore would send either Mcgonagall or Snape. Hagrid is not... very discreet.

Thank you for your input. But how can I terrify the Dursleys into not making Harry's life more difficult when he comes back? Mcgonagall will notice how much work Harry does at home and will be worried if he doesn't get much time for home assignments.

**** I guess she could say/threaten to come back if she learns Harry isn't let to do his school work in her severe and stern tone with her lips thining. Minerva, we have to remember, is almost old enough to be her mother but has the vibe to be her grandmother. She could also the table into pig and back trick and let her actions speak for themselves if necessary.

** Snape isn't just nasty to Harry. He's nasty to everyone. He was Neville's boggart. He was the one who made Hermione run crying to the Hospital wing over teeth. The twins warned Harry that Snape was nasty. He had years to get over himself and stop being a cunt but didn't. Snape himself didn't have the greatest home life as Snape apologists so frequently bring up, and so if you're making Harry's life better than canon, Snape is just going to see Harry as spoiled for having better than Snape had. Snape doesn't see reality he sees what he wants to see. His spitefulness and general all round awfulness is pretty integral to his character.

McGonagall works. She knew both James and Lily well. She probably knows Harry's birthday but I doubt she'd get him a present, she never did in the books. Unlike Snape McGonagall tried her best to be impartial and such a blatant display of favouritism would not sit well with her. Harry's trip would be less magical and more efficient. He might, at best, get an invitation for some tea and a chat at a later date once he's settled into Hogwarts.

*** I am definitely not a Snape apologist and Harry's environment was better in him just having his own clothes and room. He was emotionally abused and he will show it when he arrives at school. Snape will definitely notice but he will not do a 360 an be nice to Harry. He will just... ignore him. See him as another ignorant kid in his class. He will not pick on him. When Harry shows talent in potions, Snape won't say anything about it but will remember Lily. He will just keep pressing the whole class harder since he won't be able to come clean and give special tutoring to Harry alone he will take it to the whole class as an indirect way to nurture that talent.

Snape will still do the nasty remarks every now and then, I just want to tone it down a little bit.

**** May I ask the question what you are trying to achieve with this change? What purpose does it serve? In canon Hagrid showing up is a big "bang" moment, this giant of a man makes an impact that is fun and shows that things are about to change for Harry. You would not get the same effect with McGonagall, so you better have a good reason. Don't do it because you can, do it because it advances your plot.

Please don't feel attacked, I just want to give constructive criticism.

***** I don't feel attacked! Really, discussion is what I wanted when I posted this.

See, I will do it mostly because this Harry will more independent and smarter and sneakier when he wants something.

The Hogwarts letter? It was addressed to him. So he read it alone and he replied to it.

I also wanted to make things a little bit more logical. It's Harry Potter we are talking about. Why would they send thousands of letters if he doesn't reply? They will definitely send someone to check him out.

I also want Mcgonagall and Flitwick to pay more attention to Harry. I am not talking about favoritism, I am talking about them being more sensitive. In this case Mcgonagall will be pained to see the hating environment Harry grew up so she will definitely tell him stories about James and Lily, specially James since he was a transfiguration prodigy. At school, she will recount her thoughts on Harry - that will cause Flitwick to tell Harry immediately about his mother, Lily, and how she was a prodigy on charms and potions.

I know Harry it's told this in cannon, but in this story I will try to make it more special. This will cause Harry to not want to let down his dead parents memories, he will do his best at Hogwarts and become a top student just like them.

I understand the importance of Harry meeting Hagrid. They will definitely meet in Diagon Alley, and they will spend a couple of hours together since Mcgonagall had to run some urgent errands.

This is my objective, it definitely isn't original - it's hard to come up with an original idea that doesn't border on lunacy with so many great stories around - but I have a lot of time thanks to a country wide quarantine and I won't be able to do this later on when I get back to work.

****** What are you trying to achieve with making Harry smarter, more independent and sneakier? What is the purpose?

Harry being more independent and sneakier is a common trope in "Harry gets sorted into Slytherin" fics, making his sorting into Slytherin more believable. In these fics the abuse is generally ramped up though; forcing Harry to be sneakier prior to getting his letter just to survive.

So making him sneakier while making the Dursleys less abusive does not make much sense to me.

McGonagall paying more attention to Harry - if you want this to happen, you need to make her pay more attention to all of her students. I've made this argument in other posts before: I personally believe that Albus Dumbledore being Supreme Mugwump and Head of the Wizengamot as well as being Headmaster of Hogwarts leaves him very little time to actually be Headmaster of Hogwarts. As a consequence it is likely that McGonagall is actually tasked with running the the school as Assistant aka Acting Headmistress on top of her regular teaching duties, leaving her no time to look after Gryffindor house.

I think you'd benefit from lurking at [[/r/Teachers][r/Teachers]] for a bit to get an idea what real-life challenges teachers face. Once you realise that McGonagall is in-loco-parentis for around 80 students and do the math how much time she approx has for each student outside of classes, it become obvious how little time for meaningful interaction the Hogwarts teachers have for one single student. You'd have to make Harry much more attention-seeking (trouble-maker?) to get the sort of attention you envision.

******* Sorry it took me so long to reply. I really appreciate the thought you have put into this and that you have taken your time to comment.

My end goal, could be resumed in having a Gryff Harry with Slytherin tendencies. We know the in cannon the hat wanted to place Harry in Slytherin because he had ambition and a thirst to prove himself - but then Harry got himself in Gryffindor and we saw little to nothing of that Slytherin qualities the hat saw in Harry (at least that's my opinion, I very well could be wrong and failed to see subtle signals that pointed to a Slytherin Harry in cannon).

My goal in having Mcgonagall picking up Harry is to try and give a good reason as to why Harry in the story I am writing would be more focused on his studies and give him a push towards trying to fill in the shoes that his parents, head boy and girl, left behind, while trying to rescue a bit of the significance Hagrid had in Harry at the beginning.

Why go through this and don't place Harry in Slytherin if that would make things easier for me? Because character development, I guess. Harry will struggle in trying to emulate both his parents so much he would miss the importance of being oneself. I want to build a setting where Harry will understand that he will never be his own man if he tries to blindy follow the steps of his parents, once he achieves that he will be able to reach greater heights and surpass both his parents.

You gave me a lot to think about, I focused so much in Harry that I was about to miss the importance of understanding secondary characters - who will be key in Harry's development.

Again, I appreciate this, and if you have more thoughts you are willing to share please do so.

******** No need to be sorry. This site is used by people in all time zones around the planet, so expecting a fast reply all the time would be unrealistic.

Personally I think Harry is pretty sneaky. Dobby and the sock in CS is absolutely inspired and tricking Ron into thinking he had had Felix Felicis in HBP is outstanding as well. I bet he cheats in exams just like any other student (except Hermione) as well. To me he already is a Gryff with Slyth tendencies in canon, so I don't see the point in making him more so.

Might be a bit of a pet-pevee of mine, but I dislike authors altering Harry's character to suit their narrative. Altering events that then cause a ripple effect and change Harry's character in a certain way is fine and can be a great tool. But for no reason? No thanks. If I want to read a HP fanfic about somebody in Gryffindor who is smarter and more ambitious than Harry I'll pick up a story about Percy or Hermione.

Filling in the shoes and struggling to emulate his parents and finding his own path - it is funny that you want to tell a story about Harry along these lines, bc it is a common trope for stories featuring Draco Malfoy. In the early books Draco looks up to his father and his greatest ambition is to live up to his parents expectations of him. He wants to be like his father and struggles with his own identity because of it. The authors then explore what happens when Draco decides to finds his own path, either before or after Voldemort.

(I remember reading an AU with Draco in Gryffindor and Harry in Slytherin that played with exactly this, this was fun.)

I think your story will be interesting to read.

********* I guess I do want to do something similar with Harry that many authors do with Draco.

It just makes sense to me: an orphaned kid that got placed with relatives that don't love him and emotionally abuse him and gets repeatedly told by them that his parents were good for nothings that got killed, suddenly realizes that all was a lie and his parents were powerful wizards that died fighting a Dark Lord? Harry will take that as finally finding an oasis in a desert, his parents were somebody! They died for him! Because they loved him. Harry will find solace on that, he will nurture that sentiment and will defend it with ferocity. He will want to make his parents proud - his parents were talented and became head boy and girl? He will strive to achieve that. He will study hard and take his classes seriously. His parents didn't agree with pure blood movement? Harry will hate that. His father hated Slytherin (James did in his early years) That plus how obnoxious Draco is will make Harry dislike Slytherin.

For trying to tread the same path his parents did, Harry on his first years will see the world black and white.

Harry is parselmouth, a Slytherin ability. It will be interesting writing how Harry will react to it. My story will make use of parseltongue, so Harry will have to change and walk his on path.

I will make parseltongue magic based on healing / warding magic - two useful abilities that Harry will have to make use of if he wants to survive. In the end, Harry will be responsible of finally destroying the stigma of only dark wizards being able to use it (tho it won't be a work of a couple of years). He will realize that there is grey in the world, that not all Slytherins are bad and some can be nice and fiercely loyal if you treat them right.

So yeah, my plan is to change Harry's personality but not without a cause. Dursley's emotional abuse, his parents' legacy, parseltongue - I hope to be able to use these and more to explain Harry's personality changes and his journey in getting out of his parents' shadow.

I will try to follow the book's main plot lines but the story will be largely AU because of what I explained above.
