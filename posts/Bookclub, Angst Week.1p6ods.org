Hi everyone, this Friday will begin the reading for Angst Week.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/][The substitute]] by BajaB, this story was nominated by (I think) [[/u/_perrs]] but it looks like their account has been deleted, however it was the story most up-voted by you.

This fic is much shorter than last week, even so please read to at least chapter 4 before joining the discussion thread.

The discussion thread will open next Friday, the 1st November.

Also, as suggested last week I will pm the author and see if they will be interested in joining the thread.

Last week was great, I want to give a big Thank You for all those who contributed!


** I'll start reading tonight as it is pretty short. I'm happy I haven't read this one. I didn't feel like reading the story last week again, but couldn't participate in the discussion thread either as it wasn't fresh in my mind.

** Angst is not my preferred genre, but I'll try it out.

Also, I totally didn't see any voting thread anywhere. Would it be viable to have them in the discussion thread or something, so it doesn't get lost?

*** I did mention it on last weeks thread but no one added any stories, so I made a separate thread and mentioned in the edit. Next week I'll make a thread called Crime Week, hopefully it'll be more noticeable.

Why not wait for the discussion results first? It wouldn't be good to accidentally invite the author to nothing but crickets chirping (as a potential outcome).

*** Good point :) I'll wait. There didn't seem to be much buzz in the 'voting' thread.
