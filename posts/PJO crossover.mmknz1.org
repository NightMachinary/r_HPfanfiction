Things I want

- Percabeth main ship
- PTSD from Tartarus

Things I don't want

- People saying Percy and Harry look the same cos they both have green eyes and black hair
- Hermione easily guessing that they are demigods
- Them being bad at keeping it a secret that they are demigods
- No Annabeth bashing


** Yeah what the hell is up with the amount of Annabeth bashing? So many crossover fics are tagged with the Percabeth tag only to be like /"Oh yeah, that? Totally just a past thing - they now hate each other because Annabeth betrayed Percy in every physical way possible."/

Like seriously, what the fuck?

Anywho, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25529848/chapters/61943107][The Law Of Change And The Lack Thereof]] seems to be by far the best crossover of this type that I've come across. It's still pretty early in the plot so it's possible the demigod thing /might/ come up later, but unlikely.

It is very, very much an enjoyable read and I cannot suggest it enough.

*** Not only crossovers. In order to pair Percy up with other characters, writers make Annabeth a POS bitch who cheats on Percy and dumps him instantly

**** It honestly baffles me, and makes it harder than it should be to find a decent story to read.
