I see a lot of fics that try to deconstruct the way magic /works/, but I can't recall any that ask the question of what its origin is, or if there even is an origin at all, and just accept it without question. Are there any fics in which the characters don't just take magic for granted?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] It kind of delves into it as Harry performs rituals and the author goes into a fair amount of detail about ancient forms of magic. Even if it's not quite what you're looking for it's a great read.

**** Would you be interested in having the German bits corrected? There's a few errors, f.E.

"Meister will fräulein zu sehen." should be "Meister will Fräulein sehen", at least, which is still weird enough that it probably fits the strange speech patterns everybody uses for elves.

"zu" + verb is an infinitive clause, but here "sehen" is a modal verb. In English both are constructed with "to", but in German only infinitive clauses rule "zu".

***** Thank you! There are probably more than a few errors as this fic was written so long ago. I'm actually having it properly beta'd for the first time right now, so I'll make note of your correction.

** I would say that linkffn(Spellcaster; Oathbreaker) Spellcaster and Oathbreaker both deconstruct magic and go down to its origins. Not sure if they're what you're looking for.

*** Yes, I'd figured Methods of Rationality would delve into that. I have as yet been unable to get past the first few chapters though, and honestly I have no real interest in it. Maybe I'll give it another shot though, hopefully it gets better later on.

**** it changes sharply two or three times. the first few chapters are tons and tons of exposition and a bit of funny; but if you didn't like chapter 5 where he's interacting with draco, then you probably won't like it until about chapter 30. I'm sad so few fanfic people like it, the things that are good about it are quite good. The things that are bad about it, on the other hand, are in fact really annoying. Once it gets out of the weird "teaching mcgonagall" stage, it becomes more of a typical "mary sue" thing for a while, like what you get in "summer of badassery" fics. Also, it turns out the author does, in fact, know how children work, and there is a very good reason he's a child genius. It's just not obvious at first.

As for your request, he gets into it a fair bit, but then moves on to having to actually do shit. It isn't just a "let's be nerdy in the hp universe!" fic, it's that and also "oh shit I need to actually fight".

So I dunno, I'd say read to maybe ch7 or so if you ever consider giving it a try again.

Also, is it actually the case that it's hated here?

***** A lot of people consider it to be a self-masturbatory fix it fic that the author uses to explain everything he doesn't like about HP; some feel more strongly about it than others. Personally, I just don't find it gripping at all. It falls into the category of fics that I tend to avoid (anything that involves Hogwarts in some way lowers my interest quite significantly).

****** It's a Bildungsroman. The purpose of hpmor is explaining and teaching about bayesian rationalism with a huge helping of scientific realism (or perhaps naturalism rather, I haven't read it in a long time) and empiricism.

/Sophie's World/ is similar in aim, but not at all style.
