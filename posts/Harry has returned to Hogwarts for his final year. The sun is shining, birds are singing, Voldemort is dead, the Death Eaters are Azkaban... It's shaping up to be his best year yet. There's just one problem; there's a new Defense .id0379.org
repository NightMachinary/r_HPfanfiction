I'm picturing someone who seems to be almost comically evil and is constantly freaking Harry out, but is entirely innocent.

Or someone who is so perfect that they seem too good to be true and Harry just can't let it go. The more Harry investigates and the more he finds that the professor is 100% squeaky clean and saintly, the more suspicious he gets.

Anything goes though.


** The group was walking down the halls, Harry in a bit of a snit, "I'm telling you, Prof. Megamind is evil. Who names their kid Megamind? It's a made up name, just like Voldemort!"

"Er, mate... I think you just need to relax. I er... give permission, go snog my sister."

"... permission?" Ginny fingered her wand.

"Relax?! He wear black leather with spikes! Our teacher's assistant is literally, named Minion."

"Honestly, Harry."

*** "It's like Malfoy all over again - no - worse even! He did a song and dance number about how it's 'Good to be Bad'!"

Ron looked at Harry skeptically, "Mate... he did that with Luna and Winky."

"He has a plan tacked to his wall labeled 'My Evil Plan to Take Over Magical Britain'!"

"Really Harry, did you even read it?" Hermione said, "It's just a gag about how he's going to be such a good teacher his alumni will elect him mister for magic. That's hardly 'evil'."

"THAT WAS VOLDEMORT'S ORIGINAL PLAN!"

** Imagine that she is this little old lady who is defs older than McGonagall and walks around with a cane and calls everyone “my dear” or “dearie”, but in class she seems to cast defense spells with alarming dexterity.

Harry finds this extremely disturbing, because how can some rickety old lady be so spritely? Is she possessed? Is she using Polyjuice potion? And why is she so sweet ugh he's getting Umbridge vibes even though she's actually nice.

Harry starts tracking her on the Marauders map, but everywhere she goes makes perfect sense. However, soon he realizes she disappears on Saturday mornings, and he has MAJOR 6th Year Draco flashbacks and is determined to catch her in the act of doing something dark.

Sure that she's cooking up something in the Room of Requirement, he hides out there every Saturday morning, until one day he's there just in time to see her arrive!

She makes a door appear, and Harry manages to slip inside after her. However, as soon as he looks up, he realizes he has made a grave, grave mistake.

Because the Room of Requirement has simply turned into a cozy-looking cottage.

And the old lady professor is now snogging professor Slughorn.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I feel like this would be the perfect thing for Voldemort to come back to life after getting 1000 years if therapy in the afterlife, with full Soul and his wish fullfilled because dead things don't die twice, and /finally/ get to be the DADA teacher he always aspired to be, except he doesn't want to also overtake the world.
