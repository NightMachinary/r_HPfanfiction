Recently I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus]['Hail Odysseus' by Brennus]]. I thought it was really good until I hit chapter 8, when Harry and Ginny did it... in a, ugh, particular way...

Immediately I was thinking "That's... no thanks." And I exited out of the fanfic.

So what was a part of a fanfic that made you stop reading?


** There's a top three for me and I can stand most of the stuff but there is:

- The fic is advertised about how different Harry will be but follow cannon religiously; if you're advertising a Hufflepuff! Necromancer! Harry but it only begins on chapter 32 and I have to read PS and CoS again...( Snape asks about the draught of living dead, bezoar and wolfsbane, Quirrel stutters and Hagrid talks about Fluffy.);

- Hermione went to the library for one hour, came back with the location of the Holy Grail, the recipe of the philosopher's stone 2.0, the secret album of the Beatles and a law saying Harry must have fifteen wives (is she the only person that knows how to read?) ;

- Daphne accepted Harry's invitation to a date and explained the laws and pureblood culture, in a icy way, without blinking, because it's normal for a teen to be so political that Churchill and Thatcher would think it's too much;

** A few stand out for me:

- If it'd get a failing grade as primary-school English homework, I am not reading it.
- Any time I read the name "Hadrian", I nope out /real/ hard.
- "Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm". Aaannnndddd that's me noping out of Bonds of Blood and wishing I could erase my memory.
- I remember a Harry/Fleur fanfic where, with zero indication up to that point, Dumbledore and Ron suddenly start scheming to arrange an "accident" for Fleur so Harry can be love-potioned to impregnate Ginny like a good boy. I outright felt /betrayed/ by that fanfic - it was actually good up to that point.

I can see a someone giving their kid a fancy name that they immediately shorten to appease grandparents and such.

**** I have literally only seen the name 'Hadrian' being used in cliché-ridden "Harry has 9001 titles and/or an overpowered creature inheritance, Dumbledork is hiding things from him, the Weasleys are after his money, luckily he was nice to a goblin once" bashfics, none of them worth reading.

Also, if you /have/ to give Harry a 'formal' name purely for paperwork, use Henry or Harold. Those are names that /actually/ make sense for a 'Harry', Hadrian would make sense for an 'Adrian'.\\
Don't use Harrison either - it's a patronym, not a formalization. The name Harry predates Harrison by a few centuries as a first name, and by at least one generation if you count the /last/ name Harrison (as in, Harry's Son).

*** Often times, Mpreg is because they want M/M couple to have blood-related children, related to both parents. Mostly so they can look like both the parents. (Draco face with Harry eyes for example)

I don't read those because it often times author implies some stuff about the importance of genetics in someone personality that I wildly disagree with. And it also implies that blood family is better which makes me angry.

And authors don't intent to do this, usually. Which tell me that they didn't really think things through, and weren't careful with their word choice and/or phrasing. And this is rarely a sign of a good fanfiction.

  Harry ran a hand over his face, while surreptitiously breathing in deeply. At once, his keen sense of smell detected various feminine odours: delicate soaps, fragrant shampoos and even a few dabs of a flowery perfume from the dark-haired girl. He also smelt hints of a more earthy, irony smell.

  Concentrating on that scent, he realised that the dark-haired girl and the one with short light-brown hair had both started their menstrual cycles, while the nervous-looking girl with long, straight brown-hair was right on the verge of it. The small, giggly blond child who sat nearest to the door had yet to have her first period, however.

Undisclosed character bashing

Stories without warnings for pretty triggering things. Reading a fic with a sudden r*pe scene is unpleasant. As that is something I avoid in any fiction I consume.

Too much whump. I'm never in the mood to read 10 chapters about Harry recovering from being severely, far far beyond canon, abused by the Dursley's. in which he curls up in Sirius' arms and cries like a small child, even though he's 16 now.

Completely unnecessary relationship drama used as a lazy plot device, usually an absurd lack of communication causing a misunderstanding. This tends to have no impact upon the overall story and just wasted two chapters.

Complete OOCness with no warning whatsoever. I don't mind ooc if it's been disclosed, but I don't want to start reading a fic and suddenly Ron's calling Hermione a mudblood, Harry cries at the drop of a hat, Hermione is an all knowing goddess and Draco simps for her.

** The end of my attempt to read Prince of Slytherin came in two parts:

*Part 1: Hermionewank grandstanding (Chapter 8)*

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's eyes flashed dangerously, and she whipped out her wand. Startled, Jim fumbled for his own, but Hermione simply turned and walked to the stairs leading up to the dorms. There, she pointed her wand up each staircase and, to everyone's astonishment, shot off a series of loud popping fireworks before yelling "ALL PREFECTS TO THE COMMON ROOM FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING!"

  Seconds later, dozens of older Lions, including all six prefects were pouring into the room, where an angry Hermione Granger was standing atop a coffee table surrounded by the rest of the First Years who were staring at her in amazement. She still had her wand out and looked ready for battle.

  [...]

  Harry stared slack-jawed at Hermione as Neville finished his tale. No wonder Jim had seemed so subdued as he left the Headmaster's office. "I hope you won't think it forward of me, Hermione, but will you marry me?"

  "Back off, Potter," said Neville with mock gruffness. "I saw her first."
#+end_quote

*Part 2: Mugglewank Worldbuiliding (Chapter 9)*

#+begin_quote
  Any potions other than the ones for literacy and numeracy had to be purchased privately and at significant cost. There were lots of options for language potions, but only a few for natural sciences. The most popular one, designed for people who wanted to pursue studies in alchemy, gave the drinker a complete understanding of the field of Muggle chemistry ... as it was understood in 1893. The physics potion was so out of date that it was actually counterproductive, leading the unwary drinker to think that fires were caused by burning phlogiston and that vacuums were actually full of ether.

** Bad grammar/spelling

Ron/general Weasley bashing

Dumbledore bashing (Slightly more leeway if it's meant as a joke, and not intended as serious criticism/sendup of the character. Some stories like to hide their bashing in alleged jokes, and it's never not super obvious.

Magical cores. Seriously, this is the MOST made-up thing in the Harry Potter fandom.

"True names"

"So mote it be"

Weird pairings of side-characters that make no sense canon-wise.

Characters knowing things they couldn't possibly know at that point in time, but the author knows, because they've read all of the books. IE, Ron referencing Thestrals during Year 4, when he didn't know jack about them until Year 5.

Characters being overly-wordy or verbose, especially for their character. Not that deviation from original flavor is an absolute deal-breaker, but Harry shouldn't sound like he's being written by J.R.R. Tolkien, and Hermione shouldn't sound like Mr. Spock.

More than a single, short paragraph to describe a simple scene or character appearance. Leeway is given for complex scenes that require more explanation, but don't dwell on minutiae.

Dwelling on minutiae. As opposed to the last entry, this concerns drawing out a subplot, or exchange that should, realistically, take a few pages to solve for many, many chapters.

Making the bad-guys cartoonishly evil. Delores Umbridge, Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, they're already evil enough on their own, you don't need to turn them into a cross between Cobra Commander and Skeletor.

Making the stupid characters stupider. Fudge was already a massive tool, you don't have to make him dumber and more prone to evil influence than he was. We had an entire book dedicated to why the Wizarding government in Harry Potter sucks, you don't need to invent new ways for them to suck.

Obvious political screeds. Doesn't matter what you're trying to convey, if you're trying to big-up or bash a group that, realistically, has nothing to do with Harry Potter, stop. Get help. I don't find it enjoyable to try and pick out the good bits from a story that reads like bad fanfiction for God's Not Dead.

Snape bashing. He's already enough of a jerk in-canon, don't Flanderize him, especially since he's not really a bad-guy.

Snape idealization. Likewise, don't try to make him out to be some perfect angel, he's not. He's a massive dick in-canon, to Harry, and many others, and is a former Death Eater. Give his choices some weight, unless you're writing a "What if Snape was in Gryffindor and part of the Marauders" fic, in which case, I need you to link me that, because I want to read all of it, provided it's good.

James Potter bashing. Typically goes hand-in-hand with the above entry, especially in Severus/Lily fics. Yes, he was a jerk to Snape, but Snape is also kind of a jerk in-canon. Don't turn him into a rapist, don't turn him into a pureblood supremacist, don't have him become a more evil Death Eater than Bellatrix Lestrange, and don't make his parents evil, either.

Crossovers that retell a story from a different universe with no changes except the character names.

Making all of the female characters fainting damsels. Seriously, this is one of the most irritating things in otherwise good stories. All of a sudden, otherwise competent characters become unable to fend for themselves. Hermione has a tendency to freeze under pressure, but Ginny? Come on, she's a bonafide action-girl in-canon. That doesn't mean every girl has to be hypercompetent, but come on, just write them the way they were in the books.

Female Blaise Zabini.

Blaise Zabini being one of Draco's minions (Hi movies!)

Inconsistency with canon, be it of the story itself, or Harry Potter as a whole. New words for things that were referenced, but barely identified? That's fine, like "wards" and any name for Hermione's parents. Don't introduce elements from other magic-systems into the series without a damn good reason, AND making them conform to the magic-system of proper canon, especially in series that are like "Okay, everything up to X book is canon" or "everything up to X part of X book is canon." By all means, deviate, and expand, but don't introduce stuff from Fullmetal Alchemist or Septimus Heap and try to hodgepodge it together into making sense. Likewise, don't have massive gaps in the plot, don't have plotholes that could've been explained in a sentence, etc.

I cry at how older fics have bad grammar. Like a story with a good plot but does not have good grammar is such a turn off. I really hate the people who don't use paragraphs and punctuation, just generally bad formatting.

I don't like how some people tag a pairing but they break up in the first chapter and move on. Same with how the author doesn't tag the pairing but it's part of the main plot.

** There are a few things. If it's badly written, it's hard to keep going. If it's super creepy (like Hail Odysseus, or some time travel ones) towards very young characters, I can't read them.

If it bashes characters to an extreme, it needs to have the rest very solidly written for me to keep reading it - hyper dumb, manipulative Dumbledore in particular is a huge pain to try to parse. Otherwise, a lot of the Indy!Harry tropes can be painful, because they're just a power fantasy that isn't interesting to read - but that falls on the writing quality, IMO.

Otherwise, fics that drag on too much with nothing happening can get frustrating. I don't mind more slice of life type content, but if it stagnates (or it's meant to have a plot), it can just... lose interest.

That Harry was remade into something else by Bellatrix's torture for days and physically altering him into something hotter, with his equipment ridged by Bellatrix 'for her pleasure' was something I could somehow still stomach.

I am pretty sure he is made to involuntarily have sex with a younger girl who is also clearly a victim. He gets saved, and gets in the care of female classmates.

There is quartet or quintet of perky witches that were nursing him back to health with little to no success. I dropped the fic when one of those witches was turned on by Harry who was clearly wasting away and raped him while he was barely conscious, and his physical condition magically improved. As if he were an incubus. She and her nurse-friends had to rape a barely conscious torture victim in order for him to get better. All while being incredibly turned on by getting to do that to Harry.

That was where I dropped it, after continuing it for far too long. It was gruesome and the story stayed with me in a way I wish it didn't.

** It's going to be a long list..., lately, I had really big trouble finding something to read.

- bashing - it stopped being funny long, long time ago, and now it's just very repetitive,
- goblins - if the author takes too much time to describe goblins and Gringotts, and has Harry say "Good Morning" to a goblin then, it's time to get out because it's probably going to be one of the many "Harry takes the world with goblins' help" fics.
- Dumbledore the manipulator - the premise of the story has to be really, really intriguing for me to read a fic where Dumbledore looks even a little bit sketchy.
- Harry trains to defeat Voldemort (he jogs when he's at the Dursleys to get fit because magic is all about getting fit). The same goes with Harry shopping sprees or Harry making a list of things he needs to do to defeat Voldemort.
- Snape being friendly to Harry, Snape takes pity because Dursleys don't like Harry.
- Rituals. Overcomplicated magic that the Golden Trio learns in the span of a few hours or a day at most.
- too much of muggle world.
- Romance at the age of 11. Children acting like adults talking about politics, inheritance, and of course, marriage.
- Nicknames: Prongsie, Dumbles, Voldyshorts, and other ridiculous names. Also, Harry has a different, more distinguished name like Hadrian or Harrison or something like that.
- "BAMF!Insert the name of the character" in the tags.
- Death Eaters are secretly good, misunderstood guys or they had a very good reason to join Voldemort that did not involve bigotry.
- Drarry, Snarry, Snamione, Dramione, Tomarry, Tomione, and other, strange pairings.
- Chambers of Secrets used as a room for secret meetings of Harry's secret group of friends.
- a wall of text.
- repetitive mistakes in names of characters and places: Regulas Black, Nivelle Longbottom, Minevra McGonagall, Pavrati Patil.

The only non-canon ship I read is Dramione (for that good ole Draco redemption arc - Drarry shippers can also relate) --- but none of the age gap ships make any sense to me (Snarry, Snamione, Tomione, Tomarry, Lucius/Hermione, etc). I also hate Harmony because it feels too incestuous to me because Romione at least has tension and jealousy throughout canon but Harry and Hermione treat each other like siblings.

In terms of Dramione, if it's fluff right from the start pre-dating/marriage, then I exit out because it's way too OOC for Draco to immediately drop his prejudices.(slowburn is the best course of action).
