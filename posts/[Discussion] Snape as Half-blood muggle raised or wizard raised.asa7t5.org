Why is it that most writers write that Snape is a Pureblood who is completely ignorant of muggle things. I am reading Mutant Storm right now (BobMin) and one of my Favs is Yet Another Snape meets the Dursleys and they make him completely ignorant of the muggle world and how it works. I don't understand that, yes we didn't know he was a half bood until 6th book, or that he was muggle raised until 7th. I get that, but even newer fics make him muggle technology and muggle population ignorant. I see him growing up watching Yogi Bear and other cartoons on Saturday, going to a muggle primary school and learning history. Do you think he was muggle raised or did Elene 'home school' him?


** Maybe some fics take it too far, but I think it's likely that Snape left the muggle world behind as much as possible after he entered Hogwarts. Growing up muggle did not create happy memories for him. While this won't leave him clueless about muggle society it does have the effect that he's basically clueless about the developments in the muggle world. The world changed rapidly between the 1970s and the end of the series and for someone who basically lives apart from that you can quickly lose feeling.

***** ...You know, I didn't even spot the questionable portmanteau you could read into it. I assumed that if it was anything it was some weird mashup of "No-maj" with "Muggle" or something like that.

** Well, before it was revealed he was a half-blood and all, people just assumed he was pureblood because of how he acted and the little bits we did know about him. So a lot of older stuff will portray him as pureblood and quite ignorant, so if you pick up an older story to read, know it'll have some funny ideas that are essentially AU even if it doesn't say so.

Then there's just to consider he's probably quite out-of-the-loop with muggle stuff by the time Harry comes into the picture anyway. He did join Voldemort, after all. For that to happen, I imagine there had to be some major experiences with muggles and the muggle-world that ruined them all for him to agree that blue purity was a good thing.

I also kind of doubt he kept up-to-date with it after he joined up with the Death-Eaters and even after the war ended, he was still stuck in the magical world for 9-ish months out of the year because he was a Professor at Hogwarts. I also doubt he was all that interested in keeping up with the Muggles in those three-ish months he had off. He probably had other things he wanted/needed to do that pertain to his teaching career or just being a wizard in general.

** I don't think Snape was homeschooled, his father would likely want him in a "normal" school like all the other "normal" kids his age. I also think Snape would be well-versed in Muggle world, he did live there for a big portion of his life, and based on his memories, he probably didn't have any contact with the wizarding world except his mother before he went to Hogwarts. And just because he hated his father doesn't mean he hated everything Muggle. Although I can see him rejecting everything Muggle while he was trying to fit in with Death Eaters (though he still probably listened to some Muggle rock while brewing when nobody could hear).

Adult Snape also lived in his childhood house in a Muggle town or at least spent his summers there.

A lot of people seem to think that Snapes might not have owned a TV. Honest question, how likely is it for a poor family in England to not have it in the late 60s and 70s?

** I don't know if he'd watch cartoons on Saturday (especially something as Amercian like /Yogi Bear/): don't forget he's a lower-class British kid in the 1970's, not a middle-class American kid from the 1990's. And yes, I do find it likely he was "homeschooled," inasmuch as he was schooled at all prior to Hogwarts.

But he shouldn't be entirely ignorant of the Muggle world either, of course. You're right.

**** Hell, that's if they even have a television set. It's not a given, depending on quite how poor you want the Snapes to be.

**** Well I doubt he'd be watching Top Gear, whatever else he was watching.

The original series didn't start until 1977, when Snape was seventeen and the revamped series didn't start until 2002.

Snape grew up in the 60s, and enough is written about him to know that he hated his father - from joining the Death Eaters to considering himself as a member of the Prince family. Snape also came from a low class family. Put both of these together, and you get some sort of domestic violence and/or abuse aimed at either Snape or his mother.

From all of that, we can safely say that an American cartoon like Yogi Bear made no appearances in the Snape home. That is, if they even had a TV.

*** Okay I get the Yogi Bear thing! Sheesh, my point was that people like to make him a moron when it comes to simple muggle things. I don't even thing that PureBloods are that stupid when it comes to using muggle things, such as pens, paper doors ect.

Snape, as much as most people dislike him, was a very intelligent man and some of the writers make him stupid about all things muggle. My example fics of Another Snape meets the Dursley, has him cuting up the felttip of a marker to make it into a point so he could write with it.

** A fic that does the opposite is A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro. Snape has his canon backstory, but does keep up with the muggle world.
