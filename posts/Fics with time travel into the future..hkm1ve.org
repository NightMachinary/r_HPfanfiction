I am kinda tired of Harry going back in time . Even more tired of Harry going back in time and de-ageing. I am kinda interested in future wizarding world. So any fic where post Hogwarts Harry gets thrown into the future ?


** I get you. Those are good, but usually they end with people staying in the future two days and getting their memories erased. (Same case with Marauders traveling to Harry's time). I outlined a different take where Harry/Ginny/Hermione/Ron at the start of fourth year travel like 25 years into the future... and they didn't know how to return them... and were stuck there for a year or so. I had like 5 chaps but put it down to rework on it, hopefully will get some time to finish it.

**** Read a couple of them, obviously plus Lily. Will give a look to see if I find them , don't usually save links. They were also about erasing their memories and returning them. Bittersweet, because they knew they were going to die but happy the future was better blah blah... I also made an attempt at this, Marauders + Lily to start of third year, I have 3 chaps and like it a lot, though I also brought it down to rework.

** There's crossovers like that firefly crossover. This is something I've been wanting for a while. Something like Harry gets thrown forward in time in his 4th or 5th year and shows up after the remains of the order, including Hermione or Ron, are losing hope.

** Um, Browncoat, Green Eyes. Sort of? This is the firefly crossover somebody else mentioned. linkffn(2857962)

Another option would be Balancing Destinies (also sort-of), but you need to read Altered Destinies first (which is backwards time travel). So, he goes to the 30s in the first instalment, builds a family, and returns to his original time 10yrs later to a completely different world and all his kids grown up with kids/grandkids of their own. Warning: first couple chapters of AD is rough AF, but it turns into a great fic. Also blatantly ignores some canon things because it's pre-DH (and pre-HBP too I believe). Pity the sequel is incomplete. linkffn(3155057; 4150901)

  Sequel to Altered Destinies: Harry returns to his original time to find the wizarding world changed due to his actions in the past. Not only does his family and friends await, but so does a new prophecy. Reading AD first is required to understand!

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
