** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game]] is a really popular one and was pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12591080/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Critical-Game]] is regularly updated and an interesting read.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

*** Seconded; I was hooked because I'm an RPG Glitch/Cheat Code/Console Command Abuser as well, since I love finding ways to break the game and OP the characters early on so I can focus more on the story and less on surviving encounters/random attacks

Get to the part where he finds the two teenage hoodlums and see if you can put it down; that was the clincher for me in knowing that this was my type of fanfic. I've since been on a gamer-HP fichunt, but haven't come across any that have tickled my fancy and/or met my expectations quite like Exploited - you could say this fic ruined me when it comes to this genre, so maybe read it last if you have other recs XD

10/10 for Exploited -- too bad it's on hiatus; plus it's very slow-going as far as HP-canon plot goes and the stats start to take up a lot at the end.

But at least it's super different than all the "The Gamer" crossovers, where the gaming aspect becomes completely unoriginal during the first chapter of pretty much all the other fics.
