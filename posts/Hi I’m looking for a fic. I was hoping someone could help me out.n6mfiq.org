:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a Other Boy Who Lived fanfic, but Harry (I think he had a different name but I can't remember) was sent away when he was young to live with an aunt who owned a bakery. Harry is a necromancer, and he has to help bring back ancient Irish/Welsh gods. I remember one of them was the Greenman. There is a running commentary from spirits in the story. Also, Moldyshorts comes to live in the town and Harry's bakery becomes very popular among the Death Eaters.

Any help would be great! Thank you!


** I think this one is a Harry/Marcus? And he's friends with Barty? I forgot what this fic is ðŸ˜…

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.
