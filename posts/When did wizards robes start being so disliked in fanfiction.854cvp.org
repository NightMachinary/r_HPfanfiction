I mean really with magic wizard robes don't seem that bad. Did it bleed over from the movies?(still disappointed that we never got to see some of Dumbeldore more exentric robes in the movies, and from the look at the new trailer we probably never will)

And with magic haveing one big piece of clothing like a robe is more convenient if you are going to put magical protections on your cloth a robe is so much better. Not to meantion that with transfiguration you can transfigurer your robe into what ever outfit you want.

So why the hated on the robes?


** I imagine it's because robes don't show much skin. How can you have Harry examine a girl's legs if they're covered by long robes? It's hard to imagine wizards robes being sexy. And wizards seem to wear them all the time. People might also suggest that long robes might not be easy to run in and would be therefore bad for a fight. (Elite wizards don't need to move to win a fight of course.)

I personally think it's fun to have them look strange to muggles and the long pockets will enable you to tuck your wand in the pockets. (No, keeping a wand up your sleeve wouldn't work unless you have a particularly short wand; my arm from wrist to elbow isn't even 8 inches)

I suppose “flick” can mean in any number of directions, but anywhere but “up” for me is uncomfortable and that direction forces my hand /away/ from where a wand is hold be coming from.

******* Elementary, my dear Watson! - Teleportation! The wand is not physically ejected into your hand but teleported into it (that's at least how I imagine it!) and teleported away when the user repeats the motion with the intent of storing the wand (remember: Intent and visualization is everything with magic - well, except esoteric stuff like the Patronus!)

******* They said flick the wrist, but I saw the motion as moving their entire forearm, in either a downward or upward motion. The holster would eject the wand and the hand would close around it. Took some practice, obviously, to avoid your wand just flying right past your hand before you could grab it. Or maybe magic accounted for that too and would let it only fly far enough out for your hand to grab it.

Thus maybe the holster teleports the wand into your hand and stores it away by teleporting it away? This way the holster can also store very long wands without a problem because it's no longer there physically but in "wizard space"

** Ignoring robes and all the fashion possibilities they have - those don't all have to look like vatican monk robes - is somewhat of a pet peeve of mine. I have stopped reading fics in which the author continuously rants off about robes being "old-fashioned".

Newsflash: Look at the red carpet, or dinner parties. A lot of these women will wear what is defined as a "robe". A shitton of modern cultures still wear robes as an everday fashion choice.

But no, instead we're presented with a protagonist who clads himself in oh-so-progressive muggle clothes. As we all know, the pinnacle of modern progressive values are H&M clothes dyed and sown by the ever faithful hands of cambodian +slaves+ textile factory workers.

I'll stop this rant before it starts...

As with plumbing, I have the feeling that this too was some individual's solution to inadequate hygiene charms and not wanting to freeze their arse off taking a dump that only spread after it had been properly wizardised and its muggle origin somewhat concealed.

Not even every muggle likes wearing jeans and a shirt, so why should wizards? The 'system' we see in the books is completely in line with what we know of wizards. They don't follow muggle fashions and if they have to wear muggle clothes they find something they like and then stick with it or they follow the advice of other wizards on what to wear. Heck, you can see the same pattern in muggles. It is just more pronounced in people from a culture that voluntarily limits its own interaction with the muggle public.

** Because the series is slightly inconsistent on the level of segregation between mages and the rest of the population and the level of enforcement of the Statute of Secrecy, so people resolve it however they like. Fashion is one of the bystander casualties.

The general implication is that they're quite segregated, and segregation is the primary method of enforcement. Within a mage area, you can use magic and wear robes, and Muggles won't notice thanks to the protective charms. This predicts that people won't need to blend in with the Muggle world pretty much ever, and fashion will be entirely divorced from the Muggle world except insofar as Muggleborn mages become fashion icons -- approximately never, I'd guess. The fact that Arthur Weasley knows so little about Muggle things despite being enthusiastically interested likewise implies heavy segregation.

On the other hand, the series starts with people in robes celebrating in Muggle areas. This implies a larger level of integration, as do the Leaky Cauldron, the entrance to the Ministry, and Platform 9¾. Also, the Blacks, for one, owned an attached house in London, and they had a front door, implying they used it. And that opened right into a Muggle neighborhood. Similarly, Horace Slughorn had no problem hiding out in Muggle houses.

A common way to resolve this issue is to say that Arthur Weasley and most other purebloods are just bad at Muggling, and there's a lot of integration for everyone else. This means most people need Muggle clothing that's up to date, comfortable, in good repair, etc. It's not particularly affordable to get two full wardrobes, so the natural thing to do is to wear Muggle clothing most of the time and robes only for formal occasions.

Then the movies came around and gave us Muggle attire for the Yule Ball, making robes a way to indicate that you're a stodgy pureblood and nothing more.

** I imagine those much beloved robes being put on a pedestal in this thread to be like Mickey's in Fantasia or Dumbledore in the first two movies.

I actually don't mind Gambon's look in the later movies, but I find the idea of robes as taken straight from fantasy-themed RPGs that look like a dress with long sleeves to be profoundly meh. I like the costume design of the movies, both the original series and FB.

Yeah, plus what they did with [[https://images.pottermore.com/bxd3o8b291gf/6800yfOrIWi8gaeQGEW0K2/e74579f9b0f17d53718e9a4de3935d4c/KingsleyShacklebolt_WB_F5_MidshotClaspingHands_Promo_080615_Port.jpg?w=665&h=665&fit=thumb&f=top&q=85][Kingsley Shacklebolt]] was dope.

** Well, I never liked them - just like I never liked the Jedi-Robes in Star Wars (I prefer the EU pre-Ruusan Reformation Jedi who wore Battle-Armor and even used other weapons beside the lightsaber!) - and I can understand why people write muggleborns and even halfbloods not liking them either (Would you want to wear a dress instead of normal pants? I'd be ok with robes, if the "robes" were like a trenchcoat you wear over normal clothes, but that's just the movies and the real robes look well like robes (kind of like Victorian-Era or earlier clothing, but for wizards!) and you probably don't wear normal clothes beneath them!)

Also: Bad in a fight (you might trip over them...I mean even the damned Jedi do ditch the robes when they start a duel (Obi-Wan drops his robes when he engages Anakin for example and Mace Windu ditches his robes when Jango Fett sets them on fire before the real fight starts!))

** I don't like the robes because I have a hard time imagining what they look like. And what I do imagine them as, I don't like the look of. Maybe a robe-type thing over some other clothes? But I like pants, man.
