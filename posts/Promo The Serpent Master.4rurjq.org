I've posted this before but it was a while ago so I thought I'd post it again. The Serpent Master is a next gen fan fic set in 2019, focusing on three OC's, Jenny, Will and Cleo. While it is focused on OC characters, canon characters are a major part of it as well and poke their head in now and again. I'd been going through some stuff since the last chapter was updated, but I'm back now (with a new chapter) and hopefully I can carry this on. Please read and review! Thanks! :)

/"Set two years after the epilogue, The Serpent Master details the exploits of Jenny, Will and Cleo, as they uncover the mystery of The Serpent Master in their first year at Hogwarts."/
