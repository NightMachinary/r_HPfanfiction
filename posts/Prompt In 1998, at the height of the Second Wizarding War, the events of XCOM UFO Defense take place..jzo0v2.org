So, this is the original XCOM, from way back in 1993. This game is far, far darker than Firaxis's series. Its extremely common in this game to either lose all your men on your first mission, or to have to treat your soldiers as expendable. One of the most common strategies in this game is literally suicide bombing. Because that is all that you have to work with sometimes.

Assuming magic is a universal force, that means that the aliens have Wizards as well. They have both advanced tech, and more advanced magic than Earth's wizards.

Imagine this: A war so terrible, Voldemort and the Death Eaters have to work with their hated enemies, the muggles and 'muggle-lovers'. A war where at any moment, a UFO could land, outside of XCOM's detection range, and kill everyone in the area. You can't outrun them, you can't hide from them. You only have the small chance that an XCOM squad reaches the area before the aliens slaughter you and everyone you love.
