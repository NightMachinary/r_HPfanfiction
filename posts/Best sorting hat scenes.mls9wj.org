Stuff like Silent Humanity and Catalyst come to mind. What others are out there that you'd recommend?

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** The absolutely best sorting hat scene I've ever read was in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard series]] by mad_fairy. First story linkao3(10824855)

This is a very long series that stars with a mild Naruto cross-over (I've never seen Naruto and could follow it with no problems) before eventually going into a full-on Avatar: the Last Airbender cross-over.

If you just want to read the sorting scene, the setup---which is the actual good part---is at the end of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10824855/chapters/24082074][chapter 6]] (search for the word "boat" to jump to that scene, about 3/4 of the way down, and read through the end of the chapter). The sorting itself is at the beginning of chapter 7, but it won't make sense (or be nearly as entertaining) without the lead-in.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
