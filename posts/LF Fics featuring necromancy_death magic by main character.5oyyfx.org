I am looking to expand the Necromancy community I set up a while back. Necromancy must be a major theme, and the fic must be over 40k. Preferably well written.

** It's only 33k at the moment but I'd thought I'd mention Linkffn(Blood Crest) where young Harry is an apprentice learning some Necromancy.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(Princess of the blacks by silently watches) gets a lot of flak around here because it has a mary sue of a main character and a crapton of disturbing stuff in it.

Its also well written, well planned and is an interesting read if you dont mind the above. The detail in the rituals it describes are great and the fight scenes had me at the edge of my seat.

The author has finished three books and is working on the fourth and final one in the series.

*** Well planned, well written Mary Sue OC with a crapton of disturbing stuff is probably the best way to describe this fic, and I'd recommend it too.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
