The banter/going back and forth with words, teasing or clever insults. It can be friendly or not.

I love stories with good banter, but it's so difficult to find. It can be between Remus and Sirius, Dumbledore and Snape, Snape and McGonagall, Harry and Draco, or anyone at all, I'm not particularly picky with who does the bantering.

It can be a minor thing in the story or a major thing. The plot itself can be anything. Horcruxes can or don't have to be a thing.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be in any era.

No OP Harry, Harry smarter and/or more stronger then in canon is fine but I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it.

No Weasley Bashing. Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual et cetra. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

Can be older or newer. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine. Can be onshots/drabbles/multichapters.

But before he made it to the table, he was stopped. "Hello Potter." Harry sighed as he turned around and faced Nott, who was backed up by Crabbe and Goyle.

"Do I know you?" Asked Harry in a bored tone.

"You should, you sent my father to prison," he sneered, Crabbe and Goyle cracked their knuckles threateningly.

Harry raised an eyebrow towards the two, "You're scare tactics won't work on me, so get a new act," Harry was vaguely aware of people watching including the teachers, since they weren't arguing or fighting they didn't have a reason to interfere, or maybe they were too shocked that a Slytherin besides Malfoy was the one confronting Harry.

"You think you're so tough..." mocked Nott.

"No I don't," supplied Harry.

"That you're better than everyone else..."

"Actually I think everyone's equal," replied Harry.

"That you can do whatever you want and get away with it..."

"If you check my records you'd see how many detentions I've received," Harry smiled.

"Got a comeback for everything, don't you Potter," snarled Nott.

"I love a good bout of banter," shrugged Harry, "Voldemort's lackeys are somewhat lacking in the subject, so I take what I can get." Nott, Crabbe, and Goyle along with almost the entire Great Hall that were watching now, looked stricken at Voldemorts name.

Nott seemed to get angry, "Lackey! Lackey! That's it Potter, I challenge you to a duel, noone insults my father!"

Harry raised an eyebrow, "And you are again?"

"Nott," He snapped.

"And you're bothering me why?" Asked Harry curiously.

"I'm challenging you to a duel!" yelled Nott.

"And you are?" Inquired Harry.

Nott seemed to boil over with irritation, "Theodore Nott Jr. Son of Theodore Nott Sr. The man you sent to prison."

Harry raised an eyebrow, "No need to yell, I just asked who you were...er...," Harry looked towards him questioningly.

"Nott!" He sneered.
