Hi, I'm looking for a fic that I read a long time ago. I don't remember much from it, but there are some things I remember: Harry is acting as a grown up version of himself (Lord Slytherin) and as 'just Harry' going to Hogwarts. He switches between his younger self and his older self. In one of the first scenes, I remember him making an alliance with and dueling someone, I think it was Daphne's father. I remember Harry being sorted into Slytherin and he dueled some older Slytherins as Lord Slytherin cause they picked on Harry's friends or something. I know it isn't much info, but I hope someone knows which fic I'm talking about.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
