** I'm actually seriously considering this idea.

I think it could work well, if you made Filch a Vietnam War vet. That gives you something more to work with than just 'Old Squib who dislikes kids.'

He came to work for Hogwarts in '73, so say he was a General or some other form of commander, who was Honorably Discharged due to injury in the line of battle, and that would give him a lot to teach Harry. Weapons handling, dedication, how to follow orders, how to lead, confidence and strategy, survival and probably other things as well.

It also goes a long way towards explaining his bitterness. To go from being someone so widely respected, and a life of structure and discipline, where his orders are obeyed, to being mocked and mistreated by schoolkids, many who probably wouldn't know a hard day if it bit them would be enough to make anyone cold.

As well as that, Harry would grow up in the safest place of all, and know Hogwarts as his home. It'd probably be good for both of them.

I like it.

**** Thanks, edited. It's almost 1:30 AM, which doesn't help my ability to spell.

***** Oh and It also would make some sense why Filch would raise Harry...

Given that his Ancestor was a key supporter of Wizard involvement in WW1... It's possible he could kind of see it as a way of repaying the favour... Raising the Greatgrandson of the man who first allowed Wizards to be involved in muggle wars..
