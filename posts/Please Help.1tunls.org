I've run out of things to read, and sites to find new fanfic. My ships are Remus/Sirius, Sirius/Hermione and Remus/Hermione. Time travel or not, doesn't matter. Any good recommendations out there? Thanks.


** Have you wandered through [[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/browse.php?type=categories&catid=143][GrangerEnchanted]]?

** Have you read my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8776626/1/Patronus-Totalus][Patronus Totalus]] ? It's Remus/Hermione AU when they're a bit older and still fighting the war. I know I already posted it in this subreddit, but maybe you haven't seen it. I'm not into slash and have never read Sirius/Hermione (I don't really like Sirius to be honest). I liked this Remus/Hermione but it's well known so you probably read it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6969879/1/Time-Interned]]

** Have you ventured into Remus/Hermione/Sirius? I know that was the next step for me. But, recommendations in case you somehow haven't found these.

--Warning- these range from G to M. There is smut here.--
