** I could see [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]] as an original short story. It would be pretty darn easy, just substitute Wizarding War for a real-life war, maybe build the world a little more to give some context.

** Alexandra Quick linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) could definitely be repackaged as an original novel pretty easily. The magic system would probably have to be changed slightly, but other than that it's quite independent from Harry Potter.

**** Magical boarding school thing wasn't invented by Harry Potter. Just look at the Wizarding School tvtropes page. A good half or more of those are boarding schools.

Sure, Harry Potter might be the most popular example, but it is far from the first or last of its kind.

** The only one can think of is Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, linkffn(4068153). That is because the author has gone into writing professionally and borrowed a bit of the themes/scenarios for the first book of his Reminiscent Exile series. But besides the few borrowings, it has a completely different system of magic, characterizations, and he has done some serious world building in it.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]] came to mind, since it reads like a historical drama with a little magic thrown in. Minister's daughter finds out she's actually a witch during the Salem Witch Trial era--could easily be the premise to an original story.

Most fanfiction with original characters still read differently from published fiction because of the lack of initial worldbuilding, but it's nothing that someone determined couldn't fix.

** Not very many because a lot of writers write Fanfiction. I mean they write a story with the assumption the user base who will read the story already understand the basics, in other words they don't write original pieces of work with elaborate world building, they merely repackage old stuff with a new spin.

As I am here I obviously love Harry Potter Fanfiction so I have no problem with that but for this question all bias is thrown out the window and my answer is a pretty accurate one.

I feel that the first two could easily be converted to its own book. So much world building, completely different characters. The main thing it would need is its own unique backstory.
