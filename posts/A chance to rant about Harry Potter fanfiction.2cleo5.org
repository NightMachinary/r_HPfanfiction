Hey guys, I see a lot of post about people who are angry about certain fanfics and noticeable cliches /cough/ Harry Potter-Black Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw /cough/ so here is a chance to rant about any fanfics that peeved you off or cliches that really get to you and just make you want to rant


** Okay, since I'm known for slash, I shall rant about Slashy Cliches.

Everyone's Gay: Really? In the U.S, only five percent of men are gay. Therefore, in a population of 500 students at school, there would only be 25 gay kids. NOT THE ENTIRE SCHOOL. C'mon, let's be realistic. In my school, there was only two openly gay kids out of 350. I'm being generous with 25.

Everyone's Okay With Gay: In a lot of fics, everyone is perfectly fine with homosexual couples. However, the Wizarding world is stuck in the Victorian Era! Up until recently, WE HAVEN'T BEEN OKAY WITH HOMOSEXUALITY. If the WW can't get over blood purity, WHY WOULD THEY BE OKAY WITH PEOPLE BEING GAY?

MPreg: No, just no.

** I hate the "perfect" and submissive portrayals of Hermione in Dramiones. Most start with her having her heart shattered (usually by Ron, usually because he was a cheating jerk who winds up with Lavender or Pansy - WTF?!) and she just happens to meet with Draco at work/Diagon Alley/Hogwarts. He suddenly goes slack-jawed, steam shoots out of his ears, stomps his foot, and he pants like a bad 90's cartoon male seeing a hot chick. She went through this transformation where she suddenly has mega boobs, a tight waist, perfect shape, her face is like a model's, and her hair is suddenly straight or super tame.

And then she gets all quiet and submissive, never fights back, just cries whenever something goes wrong, and she hardly uses her brain. And you're left thinking "where the fuck did Hermione go?"

I hate it. Absolutely hate it. I already hate it in general when people mess up characters, but they go to extremes with Hermione, Ron (who always becomes some giant and abusive prick for no reason), and Draco. It makes me want to throw my laptop out of the window.

*** Same thing with the "he's not all bad, I can change him!" fallacy with Hermione/Snape that requires both of them to be out of character (not to talk about how the ship is fucked up in so many ways in the first place).

It's funny that I see a lot of complaints about Dramione below "often" having characters go ooc. It's impossible to have Dramione without having characters go ooc, so I don't know why they read it in the first place if they want a realistic ship.

I think I've only (tried) read one fic of each, both recommended here, and they just made no sense. If you need to change characters to the point where they're not recognizable just for the ship to work, why make it a harry potter fanfiction in the first place?

**** I think that it can work if one "matures" the characters while staying true to certain vital aspects of their personalities (I.e. stubborn, passionate, Draco's arrogant, Hermione's an activist). I don't mind seeing some changes that make sense, like Draco going through a "realization" that what he was taught by his father was not right. It makes sense, especially in post-war fics. But when characters do a complete 180 and make zero sense, that irks me.

So, some plausible changes (that can be explained) are fine for me, but when people go to extremes it is a huge turn off.

And I totally agree with the gross factor of Hermione/Snape fics. Not only is the age gap disturbing, but he would never go for her because she's not even a redhead. Har...har... but yeah, just icky.

** Things I really hate when reading fanfiction:

Hermione in Dramione fics written as an emotionally inflexible, shrill speaking, super bossy, I-am-better-than-you, my-opinion-is-always-right menace. I know she is some of these things some of the time but all of these things all of the time? It gets to be too much. I hate how a lot of authors portray her this way.

Draco in Hogwarts Era (at least) Drarry stories written as this crying, insecure, whimpering, lovesick, vulnerable, sniveling mess of a man when it comes to Harry. I only see him written this way in Drarry fics, where in Dramione, he's written as a much stronger character.

Hermione in Hogwarts Era Snape/Hermione stories written as this wise relationship expert even though she's like 18 years old and never had a significant relationship before. Authors write her much, much more mature than what she should be.

But I also hate when they play Hermione to be this huge like mega-virgin goddess and super submissive (esp in Dramoine fics).

** Very petty and ridiculously specific moment of rage related to bad mathematics:

I was reading yet another Harry harem power fantasy (in a moment of weakness) and the author describes Harry at the well-seasoned old age of fifteen, whipping out his equipment for the first time, and for Hermione's first time, and described said tool as '3 inches thick and 16 inches long, making Hermione coo with delight.'

Rrrrrrreally.

Advised the author to travel to their local grocer/butcher and use a measuring tape on a 3-lb tube of ground beef and then tell me why anyone who isn't part-centaur would think that's something they're looking forward to inserting into a bodily orifice, much less all three, especially for the first go.

My propriety/decency filter has been damaged for a long time, as demonstrated in my written works.

I read the passage and said to myself, "No, Hermione wouldn't 'coo', she'd scream for Harry to put that monster away and then drag him to Madam Pomfrey for treatment of an out of control Engorgio or for using a switching spell on Hagrid... or Firenze."

The real stumper to me- if the author is male (as one would suspect), just how low is their self-esteem when they're in the shower facing their personal reality and they come up with those numbers for what they /wish/ they had?

HPMOR? Can't STAND it. Harry's this entitled little shit, who knows much more than humanly possible in the FIRST FIVE CHAPTERS, and he treats everyone like they're his little slaves and playthings. Sorry, but no. All the theory about the Magical World that could possibly be thought of, would not get me to ever try that story again.

Luna being a brainless little twit? Uh, no.

Hermione being a doormat, or overly girlish? No. Sorry boys, but Emma Watson was not actually what book Hermione looked like.

Draco Malfoy turning good too easily. (Note: Dramione fics can be AMAZING, when they follow character personality.) Draco Malfoy is a coward, raised by Death Eaters. He's a stubborn little shit, that would have to go through some SERIOUS soul-searching (or whatever) before Hermione would ever even consider him someone that she'd like to date.

It would be more of a perversion to treat him like magical beardy Jesus the way canon generally does.

- He let the war with Grindelwald rage on for quite a while just because he didn't want to face Grindelwald.
- He knew what Tom Riddle was long before he became Lord Voldemort, especially after the first opening of the Chamber of Secrets, and he did nothing.
- After Harry was orphaned Dumbledore dropped him off at the Dursleys' with nothing more than a note. He had no authority to do so. He's a schoolmaster and the head of a legislative body, not whatever the wizarding equivalent of a social services worker is.
- He basically groomed Harry to be willing to sacrifice himself so that the horcrux in him could be destroyed.
- He left three teenagers with the task of finding and dealing with Voldemort's horcruxes by themselves.
- He was grossly negligent in his duties as headmaster of Hogwarts.

  - He hired: 1) a man who frequently belittled and terrorized the children under his care and 2) a man possessed by Voldemort, a clearly incompetent buffoon and a death eater in disguise as DADA instructors.
  - He hid bait for Voldemort in a school full of children, secured by an /obstacle course/ that was potentially lethal and yet still was defeated by a group of preteens.
  - When the Chamber of Secrets was opened a second time he either let a basilisk run free in the castle or a thirteen year old actually figured out what was happening before he did.

The problem isn't people writing him as a scheming dickbag, it's that most authors can't write a complex, flawed character that's kind of /is/ a scheming dickbag.

**** The thing that annoys me is the fanfiction cliche of him doing everything /for the greater good/. He obviously doesn't - in fact, his problem is that he does the opposite. Instead of trying to help the most people, he is actually willing to risk everyone's lives on convoluted schemes to save one person's moral conscience or because he does not yet have solid proof of something that he knows is true (like early Riddle's maleficence).

Sometimes in fanfiction you get dialogues where these things are presented in juxtaposition without anyone noticing the contradiction - "You decided to die, to have Hogwarts invaded by Death Eaters, have Bill Weasley almost become a werewolf, and leave the critical characters in the dark - all so that you could save Malfoy for the greater good!". That sentiment doesn't make any sense. Clearly Dumbledore's motivation, however fucked-up it is in practice, is not "the greater good".

In fact you could write a fanfiction where Grindelwald's supposed "greater good" became so repulsive to Dumbledore that he went way too far in the other direction. It would make more sense of what he actually does.

  for the greater good
#+end_quote

many works of fiction have already explored this theme to the point where most readers know it to actually mean "for my particular set of, often misguided, ideals". Hence most authors use it in that sense and don't bother explaining it in the same way that most authors these days might mention Nazism without also bothering to describe it negatively - the expectation is that all readers would already know that part.

I've been reading fantasy/fiction for over 20 years and I don't remember a single novel where "for the greater good" was used verbatim and actually meant what the phrase says instead of the opposite.

****** Whenever I have read it, it's meant "the ends justify the means", implying a willingness to endure smaller acts of morally questionable nature to achieve a larger objective (which the reader may or may not agree with). And with that meaning it comes up in novels all the time - it's a classic 'villain' signifier to be so convinced that their goal is worth the sacrifice, particularly of others. But that's not the opposite of what it says, and it's not the only form of villainy,

I've never heard it diluted just to say "for my particular set of ideals" - it implies more than that. I mean, no one says "No, we must read him his Miranda rights - /for the greater good/" or "I insist on due process - /for the greater good/" or "Give the child back her teddy bear - /for the greater good/" because these are the sort of 'minor' things that the antagonist would sacrifice to achieve the greater goal.

And the problem with Dumbledore is that he frequently seems to risk his declared ultimate 'greater' objectives in order to get relatively insignificant ones. It doesn't fit the ends justifying means deviousness of "the greater good" at all.

He knew some of the victims personally and either a) wanted proof Lockhart definitely did it, or b) wanted Lockhart to succumb to the curse over the position. It wasn't a decision that could in any way benefit the students. He even USED Harry's fame, without his knowledge or consent, to get Lockhart to take the job. At least with slughorn, Harry knew.

Edit for those reading: check the wiki page on Lockhart. I consider books, interviews, and Pottermore to be canon. This information was provided in Pottermore book 2.

  WHY IS DUMBLEDORE ALWAYS A SCHEMING DICKBAG?!
#+end_quote

Honestly, there aren't that many options.

Harry's guardians:

- The Dursleys are actually decent guardians. Dumbledore spoke to them before leaving Harry with them. He checks up on Harry on occasion. He doesn't think Voldemort will return within the next couple decades.
- The Dursleys refused to take Harry. Dumbledore placed him with another family. He doesn't think that Voldemort will return within the next couple decades.
- Dumbledore raises Harry. He suspects Voldemort will return soon, so he teaches Harry to be a warrior capable of defending himself against Voldemort and eventually of defeating him.
- Dumbledore wants Harry to be abused for some reason.
- Minerva McGonagall is strongly biased against Muggles, or her assessment of the Dursleys is in some other way highly suspect. Dumbledore is blindingly oblivious to the possibility of child abuse, despite his day job focusing on children.

Harry's training:

- Dumbledore thinks Voldemort will not return and start the fight again until well after Harry graduates. If you go this route, he will stick to this until mid-1991 with very high probability, until mid-1994 with high probability, and until the Department of Mysteries battle with low probability.
- Dumbledore wants Harry to fail.
- Dumbledore trusts the prophecy to keep Harry alive until some nebulous unspecified power automatically kills Voldemort. This Dumbledore has faith in the prophecy, the sort of faith that motivates parents to pray for their dying children rather than providing actual medical care that could easily save the kid's life. But instead of dooming one child, Dumbledore is dooming hundreds of people. The fact that it works in the end does not excuse his negligence.
- Dumbledore trains Harry as best he can. This can reasonably start as early as Harry's fifth birthday or as late as Voldemort's reincarnation, but earlier is better.

If you want to stay close to canon, Dumbledore is either evil or insanely negligent.

That said, a lot of fan fiction does a poor job of making an evil Dumbledore.

** I am really peeved by the people who want to write Dramione fics, but want to keep it canon, so they turn Scorpius and Rose in carbon copies of their parents and have them make out. I've only read one Rose/Scorpius fic I enjoyed and it was because the characters were their own people and their relationship didn't develop in a predictable "I hate but I love" pattern. When people pull the same shit with Scorpius and Albus I also get a little peeved. Let them be their own characters!

Also, fanfics written for porn's sake really bother me. Yeah, a sex scene can be appropriate, but 98% of the time it isn't and it's just the author typing out their fantasy (and typing it out poorly, I might add). It feels kind of disrespectful to the canon and to the characters.

And finally, angst gives me headaches.

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention my concern over /any student ever//Snape. It's creepy. It just is. Why can't Snape find happiness with someone who's actually age appropriate? Teacher/student relationships make me uncomfortable in general, but with Snape it's just... so messed up. The thought processes that go behind those ships make me extra distressed.

On the subject of the ping pong speech, let me copy what I have written before

#+begin_quote
  Bloody fucking hell does it piss me the fuck off! a lot of fanfic writers giving Fred and George (which they at one point will insist on call Gred and Feroge) this bull shit ping pong speech type. Sure after the first fanfic it can be overlooked, but after the next 80 it makes me drop the fanfic quicker than Voldemort pulling the killing Curse. Not only is this load of Hippogrith excretation popular in fanfics the fact that Fred and George are so one dimensional and annoying as fuck.

I want more mpreg but make it reasonable. If I can write a scientifically viable mpreg fict without it being buttbabies or magic on a shaky idea of human physiology at best, I am sure SOMEONE can manage it without turning the mum-er-dad to be into a hermaphrodite. I have read ONE fict that works it out and it glosses over the birth without making it obvious. And has a reasonable explanation why it happened.
