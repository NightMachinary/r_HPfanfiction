A story where a self-insert is put into a story with an OC in it. To make it even better, you could even drop them off at a point of no return in the story where the canon knowledge is no longer viable. You could also, instead of writing up an extra character, simply take over from one of the many unused characters in the story, a random Hufflepuff even. I'd like to see an author suddenly find himself in a story with the monster they tend to create.

Edit: I need more practice at flairing.
