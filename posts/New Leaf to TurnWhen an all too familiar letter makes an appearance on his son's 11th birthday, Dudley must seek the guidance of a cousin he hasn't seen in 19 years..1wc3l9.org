** Already read it before. Really like it. I wonder if there are more fanfics similar to this.

  Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486190/1/Fortunate-Son][Fortunate Son]]? It's unfinished but it's meant to be Dudley's book.

** I love a good Dudley fic, and this is probably one of the best of the "Dudley's daughter gets a letter genre as a standalone story. A few other authors work Dudley into a larger plot, but this is a nice take. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]] is another good one.

** I never liked Dudley that much, I read fanfics that he appears, and, either he is good or bad, since he didn't do anything important I didn't care. But this... I never thought like this, and it seems like a wonderfull idea. It is 2:30 AM here, and I was almost sleeping when I saw this post, now I have to finish this story before I can sleep. Thanks for the link :)

** I'm currently at chapter 4 and I'm loving it! I've recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2053712/1/][A Muggle In The Magic World]] and the poignant ending was making me sad. Now this story seems to have a happy ending (it does doesn't it?), thank you.
