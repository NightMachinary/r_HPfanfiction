Would prefer no slash and for him to not be in Gryffindor, or even no attend Hogwarts at all.

Thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185][Harry the Hufflepuff, by BajaB]] comes to mind ( linkffn(6466185) )

There is one that I can't remember the name of. Harry sort of goes on vacation (or runs away from the order) or something and always follows the advices of weird merchants (who might be related to the Black family). I think he manages to intimidate the mob in Italy, catch a serial killer in France and many other things just by stumbling into situations and not really giving a shit. Somewhere in Swiss, a bunch of Death eaters transport themselves by portkey to his location while he was admiring the view from the balcony of his very high hotel room and they end up squashed on the pavement. I think Bellatrix dies in the same fashion by transporting herself to a coin Harry just used in a vending machine (goriness ensues whilst Harry walks away whistling).

Damn it's annoying when this happens. Please someone tell me I'm not making this up XD

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** linkffn(2559745) This is a non-slash apathetic Harry. It doesn't conform to any of your other preferences. But I think this fic is a great read.

  Harry Potter is 16 years old. He already defeated Voldemort, with the help of his Godfather Sirius Black. Now he is in for the biggest challenge of his life: attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
