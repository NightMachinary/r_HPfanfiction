As the title says, recommend me the fics that are popular because of its quality. Suggest me the long mainstream ones.


** Some very good selection in this thread. I'll just post this one as no one seems to have linked it yet. A great crack fick where Harry gains most of Voldemort's memories the night his parents die and he thinks that he is Voldemort himself.

** I don't know if it's very popular, but I've seen it recommended a couple of times: linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshough) Adult Harry and Ginny move to a muggle village with their small kids and befriend a muggle family. I love it when the muggle and magic worlds meet, especially when it's presented in a way that totally makes sense. My only criticism would be that I found it really hard to connect and sympathize with the POV character, but that's just me I guess.

** Some that Kdbvols missed are:

Steve and the Barkeep - This is /the/ definitive MCU crossover. Not exactly long, but honestly? It's perfect.

Just A Random Tuesday - A slice of life fic from McGonagall's perspective during 5th year and probably the best of its kind, easily. Hilarious too, her internal dialogue is a riot and there's this one scene with Snape and Trelawny...

Grey Space - A what-if pre-hogwarts fic. What if Hogwarts started later, and Harry really did go to Stonewall High? It's fantastic, and truly in a league of its own.

Stages of Hope - This is probably the gold standard for dimensional travel. Inside you'll find a bit of crack, a bit of seriousness, and a fair few onions too.

The Man Who Lived - An alternative to 'Exile' for a Draco redemption fic (I'll link that one too since it's famous for a reason). Exile is great, don't get me wrong, but it didn't make me stay up way too late at night reading either. Warning for slash along with various triggers, including racism and police brutality along with the ones you'd expect.

And the Wolves All Cry - This, like the MCU crossover, is shorter than you'd probably like, but it's /heavy/. This fic is dark, its dystopian, it's tragic, and it feels longer than it actually is (but not in a bad way). It's also a bit hard to put into words what, exactly, you feel after reading it. Sort of like Antithesis, in a way? But not. Just read it.

Browncoat, Green Eyes - An excellent example of the perfect fusion fic: it's funny at times, does a decent job explaining the crossover to people who have never seen Firefly (but really, you should: it's a SPACE WESTERN) and has a solid plot. If you disliked A Black Comedy, don't fear this offering from Nonjon: there's a good chance you'd like this one.

The Wizard of Harrenhal - Now, I'm a crossover junkie. Love the hell out of them, and will read them whether I'm aware of wtf is going on with the other fandoms are not. And the GoT/ASoIaF fandom is a damned wasteland, crossover-wise. But then there's this one. It's not famous, or heavily recommended, but again: wasteland of garbage. This is the absolute best I've come across, so if you're interested in reading how Harry turns the politics of Westeros on its head, give it a shot.

.... that should be enough, ya?

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) Unfortunately left unfinished, but a really well-written AU about Harry being sorted into Slytherin. I'm a big canon nerd, and generally averse to AUs, but this one is worth the read.

Also, I'm not sure how popular these are, but Thirty Five Owls by Letterblade and Cauterize by Lady Altair are both excellent, concise character studies. Thirty Five Owls details communication between Dumbledore and Grindlewald in the decades after their duel, and Cauterize explores the scars left on the survivors of the Battle of Hogwarts.

Id suggest more but kdbvols already stated the rest of my favourites. As he said, you should really try a Cadmean victory. No joke, my all time favourite hp fanfic, if not my fav fanfic over all.

** Here are some of my selections. As is probably clear from the selected fics, I tend towards Harry/any female other than Hermione or Ginny fics, and tend towards independant!Harry fics as long as they're good. Most of these are complete and took "long" in your request to mean >100k words.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) - Harry/Fleur, starting summer before 4th year. Recently starting to become less well regarded, but a great fic regardless.

linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) - Probably the most controversial that I put here, and still in progress. The pacing is very, very slow, but mostly because the world-building and depth of characterization are so fantastic. WBWL, Slytherin!Harry

linkffn(Green Girl) - Hermione as a Slytherin, one of many fics by Colubrina that puts Hermione/Draco together.

linkffn(Novocaine) - Another ongoing fic, Harry/Daphne taking the Wizarding World by storm following the war

linkffn(Grow Young With Me) - The last ongoing fic on this list, Harry is a shell of himself following Ginny's death, leaving him a single father of three. Harry/OC

linkffn(The Arithmancer) and sequels - Hermione-centric fic where rather than being amazingly well-read, she is a mathematical genius who begins Arithmancy her first year.

linkffn(Stepping back) - following Sirius's death at the DoM, Harry is sent back in time to stop Voldemort from ever rising in the first place. Harry/Bellatrix. This ever-so-slightly edged out linkffn(Delenda Est) for this trope, but both are fantastic.

linkffn(Honor Thy Blood) - By the same author as Stepping Back, another powerful figure rescues Harry from the graveyard after the Triwizard Tournament and helps him to embrace his potential. Harry/Daphne, but probably the least romance-heavy fic on this list.

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) - Harry absorbs his father's memories as a side-effect of the dementors at the end of third year. Harry/Fleur

linkffn(Letters) - Another Harry/Fleur, (didn't realize how many of these were on here,) but again, it's fantastic and the most well-liked fic by a generally well-liked author, TheEndless7.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Survival is a Talent by ShanaStoryteller is phenomenal [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826][Here]].

It's a rewrite of the entire series from CoS based on the idea that Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates (so Slash). The characterisation is just so good and the slow development of a friendship between Draco and Harry, as well as the extended Gryffindor and Slytherin friends is just so worth it. Plus they have to sneak around for quite a while and the chapters are super long so reading it is quite the journey. It's still a WIP but the sheer amount that has been written so far will keep you going for a while. The writing is just so good and the way they change and rewrite the books is just so well done.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
