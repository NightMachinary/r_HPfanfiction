Hi! I don't know if this is the right place to ask that. Sorry if it isn't. I was reading a pretty good fanfic about Lily and James the other day called Turning Tables. It continued with a sequel “My kind of love”, but it randomly stopped at chapter 8. Does anybody know if there is anywhere the next chapter of it? Thank you! Here is the link to the last chapter [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9308014/8/]]


** Looks like it was abandoned, sorry mate. It happens.
