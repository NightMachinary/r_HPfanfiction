:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In Harry's first year in Slytherin. He shows his magic on the train He became friends with Draco Malfoy and the some of Slytherins. He shows off his magic on train ride to Hogwarts. He is abused by Dursleys. He hates then people touch him. He is naturally talented in magic and powerful ,but not on the level of Voldemort or Dumbledore . He's visits the Greengrasses for Christmas or on his Christmas break . He also saves Daphne from being molested. He competes with Daphne and potions. He gets a mysterious book by Tom Riddle for Christmas. Daphne compares his personality to Grindelwald because in the way he describes magic. Daphne and he go out there Voldemort. She kisses him on his cheek. He still plays Quidditch. I think there's might be Ron and Hermione bashing. This all happen in the first year. No marriage contract with Daphne or any too. Harry has a problem with eating full meals. Also the fact that Harry is small or tiny for his age.

** So I am no expert here and you're better off waiting for the Indy!Harry fans. However, even with so much info as this has, I wouldn't be surprised if there was more than one fic out there that hit all these marks.
