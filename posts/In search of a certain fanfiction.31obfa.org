So I am looking for a fan fiction my friend read a while ago she forgot the name of the title but remember the story was an AU where Harry grew up in the wizarding world and was best friends with Draco. The story started off with Harry as a child then progressed through his years at Hogwarts. Harry and Draco were romantically involved in this story. Would be a huge help to anyone who may know the name of this story to share. Thanks.


** An AU where Harry is best friends with Draco and they're eventually paired off? I'm pretty sure you'll need to be a little [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&g1=2&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=6][more specific]]
