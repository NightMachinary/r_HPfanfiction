What do you like and dislike about it?


** I like it when it is used as an obvious parody in a crackfic. I dislike it when someone tries to use it in a serious way, because seriously... dafuq?

*** Yeah, the only time I've ever liked it was in some crackfic I can't remember the name of. I just remember Fred or George giving birth to puppies because they screwed up one of their experiments. It was so random it was funny.

**** Pretty sure that's nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the world is Harry Potter]] or the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477165/1/The-Untitled-Cheekquel-Project][Untitled Cheequel Project]]

I generally can't stomach the mpreg, but here, the complete fic if so absurd, that it's just another humorous event.

**** Well, the anatomical and genetic impossibility ruins the suspension of disbelief. It takes away from the complexity of gay relationships. But it all comes down to the fact that a story line about a man dealing with pregnancy is so far away from anything in my life, that I just don't know how to empathize or connect with it in any way.

** I suppose that /anything/ is possible with magic, so I can't really fault it on some sort of believablity index (even though it strains even the most generous canon credibility)..

So I suppose it suffers from the same sort of inherent flaw that Mary-Sue / Harry-Stu characters do, when inserted into a fic:

It /always/ feels like it's done for the sake of the author, like a wish-fulfillment or projection, and /not/ done for the sake of the story.

*** That.

I (gay guy) like to read slash fics for obvious reasons. Some of them contain mpreg. And a really small percentage of those is actually remotely believable. But mostly it feels like some twelve-year-old fangirl is sitting at home, /squee/ing at how cute two guys are together. And then one gets to be pregnant because first, one always /has to be/ the replacement girl for the relationship and second, no relationship can be fulfilled without some biological kids of both partners and a dream wedding of some sort.

I sometimes read overly mushy romace stuff as a comedic guilty pleasure, but mpreg is often done so badly that the entire rest of the fic sours. There are other cliches, like blood adoption, which are far better suited to gay couples needing kids for their /perfect love/ (which in itself is kinda off).

** I never read mpreg unless I'm beta'ing and someone springs it on me. That being said, the thing I dislike most about it (out of so many things) is when the pregnant man is written all weepy, clingy, passive, submissive, out of control and in need of protection. I once had to read this treatment of Snape and about tore my eyes out.

** I guess I'm neutral, I'm normally in to darker or time travel so I haven't really come across it that often. It won't really make me stop reading unless one of the characters becomes a wimpy take care of me cry baby.

Before the last Harry Potter book came out (or possibly a little bit after) I was really in to Draco!Vella stories and I mean really bad ones. At that point in my life MPreg just was whatever as long as there was still good scenes

** It's completely unrealistic. It's kind of like making Harry shit lightening, and not in a comedic way. If it's serious, I'm squicked. If you wanted to write a story about two men having children, why not make it plausible and have them adopt? War orphans, at that? Or make it so that they have to have a surrogate, and amp up the drama? It's just lazy, unimaginative writing, to be frank.

**** Pretty much. Men were not designed to birth babies. End of story. I don't care how well written, how well thought out an m-preg is, it's still an abandon ship moment any time I come across it as a serious plot point. I could probably get into well written slash (girls, if you haven't seen or put your mouth on a penis, just put the laptop down), even though that's not my thing, but when it comes to men excreting children it's an automatic "abort". Pun intended.

** It's not the physics of the matter that bother me; Far more implausible things have been done with human transfiguration than giving a man a womb.

The thing that annoys me though, is the way the authors seem to just sticky-tape male pregnancy into the potterverse without any consideration for what that does to the setting. Wizarding Britain is fairly patriarchal; who gets the power (lordship) when two men marry each other? If magic can obselete the female reproductive system, can magic do the opposite? Can magic get a woman pregnant without a man? Could you grow a baby in a magical artificial womb, outside of a human altogether?

But no-one ever explores these sorts of questions. It's always just the power of 'a luv/sole bond', or an offhand comment about how 'wizerds are different then mugles'

** What I like about it: the suspension of reality, the idea that anything is possible in the wizarding world, that sexuality is not an impediment to having a family (if a family is desired at all), that it's an opportunity for a man to experience something that, in another world, would be physically impossible. It doesn't seem far-fetched to me that a man can get pregnant in a world where they can also transfigure themselves into an animal or take a potion and become someone else.

What I don't like about it: clich√©d pregnancies with weird-ass cravings, gigantic mood swings, protracted weeping about body image, the thought that someone who's pregnant is suddenly fragile, over-the-top morning sickness, rampant hormones, and the pregnant guy turns into the diva from hell. Those are wish-fulfillment stories and I don't care for them. Give me a realistic pregnancy and I'm all over it.

** Some day I'll write an Mpreg story involving magic, where the happy couple follow the clear instructions they find in a book from the Black library at Grimmauld place. The designated-gestator (d-g) will be just aglow with joy over their expression of union- the perfect accessory to their perfect love.

A week later the 'd-g' will be bunched over in a fetal position as an obstruction is preventing any other material from leaving his digestive tract. He'll be in pain for hours, because the 'father' is off having an affair with the dark and dangerous rival, because /he/ isn't whining the father's ear off about how bloody uncomfortable he is every ten minutes.

Thankfully, the pain ends and the d-g can finally relieve himself, for he has produced an egg. A squishy thing, reminiscent of a rotted cantaloupe. Referring back to the book, he'll hurriedly arrange for the egg to be put into a bread warmer, just in time for his wayward husband to return home and ask, "What happened to the baby? What did you do to /our/ baby?"

If the resident house-elf hasn't thrown it out, they'll be running back and forth to Knockturn Alley, looking for borderline illegal substances to keep the growing egg alive.

Think it'll have a readership?

** I guess I like, at least from an outside view, that it mixes up gender roles and disconnects pregnancy from gender and sex. I don't like it because it anatomically disgusts me and I don't see a reason to try to get over that disgust. Other people can read what they want, but I see no reason to personally. I don't really like fics where people get pregnant in general, since wizards should have infallible prophylactics, and fics where they don't impede on my suspension of disbelief. I guess if there was a relationship, between two guys, or a girl and a guy, and they chose who should get pregnant, that'd be okay. What I don't get though, is why if you have a spell that can alter male anatomy enough so that a uterus and related organs fit in why can't you create an external uterus that can hold a baby so neither of you have to carry it for nine months? Maybe I'll write a fic about that...
