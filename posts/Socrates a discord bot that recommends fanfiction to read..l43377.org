I've made a bot that reads favourites from your profile on fanfiction.net and recommends stuff for you to read.

Features:

- long recommendation lists scrollable with emoji
- can read full profile while creating recommendations(past 500 favs limit)
- can ignore fandoms and fics and hide them from stuff recommended to you
- has a mode to show fresh recommendations instead of top ones
- can roll random fics from recommendations for you to read
- can limit wordcount of displayed fics, filter out dead fics and show only completed ones
- can show recommendations from exact fandoms and crossovers you want
- can show only recommendations published in exact years

You can check the bot in [[https://discord.gg/dpAnunJ][#botspam]] on my discord server or invite it to yours with [[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742050608235937916&permissions=337984&scope=bot][this link]] .

To start the bot on your server:

- issue !permit on the channel you want it to answer on (you need to be an owner or an admin),
- issue !prefix new_prefix to set a prefix you want the bot to use. So for example if you want the bot to answer to commands starting with ~ instead of ! you will need to say !prefix ~ The rest of the commands you can see with !help. (obviously with the chosen prefix instead of !)

If you have problems with the bot, ping me on my [[https://discord.gg/dpAnunJ][discord server]].

P.S. The bot is now verified by discord and can join however much servers are requested.

P.P.S (I hope one AD for the bot in 2 months is not too much)


** It's a great bot but does it still work? I remember putting it in a personal server of mine and now the bot in unable to refresh its suggestions. I have a feeling it's because of the recent updates to [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] which made the website more secure against bots in general.

*** It should be working. I've made a fix to pass cloudflare. You must have tried it in the very brief period when it was still unfixed.

**** I tried the !fresh command just before posting my comment to check whether it was fixed or not. It didn't work and said /"Could not load favourites from provided user profile."/

***** did you provide your ffn id prior to doing it with !recs ID? If you inv me to your server I can see. You have to init the bot first with your ffn profile to use it

** You have definitely given me reason to do a rigourous cleaning of my favourites list so I'll get better recommendations.

** UPD: I've realized that I had slash filter enabled in my bot by default. This was not intended, if you read slash and was wondering where is it in your recs: check again, it should be displayed now.
