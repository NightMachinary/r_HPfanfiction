What does Indy Harry mean?


** Independent Harry ... it usually relates to bashing of Albus Dumbledore and making Harry standing up to him.

*** Also, it typically involves Harry emancipating himself at age 15-16 and living on his own terms.

** It's a term for fanfictions that were especially popular after the release of OotP. They usually, but not always, contained:

- Dumbledore who was manipulative or/and outright evil

- Frequent bashing of established characters, most often Weasleys, Snape, McGonnagal

- Order of the Phoenix as an organization was mostly a joke

- Harry who after 5th year become extremely powerful, through study, inheritance or any other convenient plot device (traditionally, it can shift by a year or two, but usually indy!harry stories are set after 5th year, though there are some set after 4th year)

- Harry romanced either Hermione (if she was not bashed) or an older woman like Tonks (who was the favourite)

- The focus is put on Harry and his struggle against the adults who know better, rather than on Voldemort, although he is present, most often as a side-plot

Overall, there are many characteristics that define indy!harry fanfics. I just gave the most prominent points. The term is mostly redundant now, unless discussing older stories. As a genre indy!harry is mostly dead, although some try to keep some of those characteristics alive, sometimes with success (TheBlack'sResurgence can be a good example of a recent author whose fanfics fit the mould fairly well, but they lack most of the plot points that defined Indy!harry in its glory days). The fandom has evolved after all.

** Added thanks for asking. I thought it was a Harry that was a globe trotting archeologist, probably post Hogwarts, ala Indiana Jones.
