Does anyone have any recommendations for harry teaching at a magical school (i.e. Hogwarts, ilvermorny, durmstrang or Beauxbatons.) Preferably a well written complete or still updating story. Bonus points for time travel to the marauder era and/or fem harry.


** There was a really good one where Harry was a divination professor

** Personally, I quite like linkffn(Wind Shear).

The teaching part is quite small but still nice and well done (except McGonagall IMHO, sadly).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I liked him teaching in Delenda Est! Although he doesn't do a ton of actual teaching. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

** Jeconais has Harry teaching flying at Beauxbatons in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]]

Its a Gabriel Harry pairing, and like all Jeconais's stories, very good.
