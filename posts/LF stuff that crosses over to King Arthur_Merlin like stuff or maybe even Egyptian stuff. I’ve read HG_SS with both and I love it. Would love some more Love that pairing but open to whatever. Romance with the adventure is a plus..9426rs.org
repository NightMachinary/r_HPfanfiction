#+TITLE: LF stuff that crosses over to King Arthur/Merlin like stuff or maybe even Egyptian stuff. I’ve read HG/SS with both and I love it. Would love some more! Love that pairing but open to whatever. Romance with the adventure is a plus.

** I don't have any recs myself, sorry, but this sounds super cool. Which HGSS stories have you read with this kind of theme?

Edit: in terms of action-based stories with this pairing, I do love Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time by Aurette. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7948797/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Crystal-of-Time]]

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
