I am asking in regards to my own. I have lots of plans, but don't know how long it will take me to write a substantial amount. But still, i really want to publish to hear people's thoughts.

And with that in mind. Where should I publish? I found most of those I've read at harrypotterfanfiction.com


** Also consider your time commitment and what you require in order to finish a story. Ideally, I would complete a story before posting, because I find that there's a noticeable cohesiveness to stories written completely before posting, but I know that that's not going to happen for me. I write serially and I've actually never written chapters in advance. I have a limited time for writing, and I just don't write enough to stockpile any writing, or else I still wouldn't be posting the story I started two years ago, because it's still not done. I probably wouldn't be writing at all if I made myself finish stories before posting! And that would've gotten me nowhere. Plus, feedback along the way is important for me, especially because I was a novice writer.

Note though: I also make sure to finish what I start - this is something very important to me - so if you go this route, /try/ to be confident that you're going to finish your story before posting.

I find that most people like weekly to biweekly updates, and when I started at HPFF, I posted every two weeks. Nowadays I try to post once a month, unless it's hectic at school. HPFF forums are quite friendly to newcomers, and there are a lot of fellow authors happy to welcome you into the community.

Seconded. However, unless you join a community/forum that is geared towards concrit, don't expect very detailed feedback from readers. It's rare and as valuable as gold.

Also seconded about finishing what you start. That's important--you want to build trust with your readers. Weekly or bi-weekly updates are best. If necessary, monthly updates work. Readers will understand if you have a life-emergency (I lost my job and spent six months extra-ing, which led me to take a hiatus from Even Unto the Seventh Generation). However, if you disappear for long periods of time /regularly/, they will get less invested. They'll forget what they read in the last chapter, or decide to wait and see if you follow through on the story/mark it complete.

Re: Serial stories--lots of 19th Century authors published serially and created classics. However, often when modern readers read them they struggle to get through the filler. ;-)

** Hmm... I'm not sure how to answer the "where should I publish" question. I've been publishing on fanfiction.net simply because it is the largest site. I was hoping that would mean more traffic for my stories. However, it's also easy to get lost in the shuffle. I'd appreciate other people's opinions.

Right now, I'm working on two multi-chapter stories. I started both with detailed outlines . . . and the one I intend to be longer/possibly lead to sequels has a 25 page handbook to go with it. However, I've been updating the stories as I write them, chapter by chapter.

The upside to that is that I get instant feedback. The downside is that it can be hard to keep control over the direction your story goes--and if I mess up, then I've already got readers. Readers who will surely spot my mistakes . . . eek.

The best advice I've heard is that your multi-chapter fanfic should be completely written and carefully edited before you even start posting. Then, you release it chapter by chapter on a regular schedule. That way, you build an audience who is never disappointed by your lack of an update.

The other option is to write several chapters ahead. I would think that might lead to some of the same problems as the chapter-by-chapter approach, though.

My ambition is--once I finish at least one of the two multi-chapter fics I'm doing now--to write a fic from beginning to end before I start posting . . . That seems like the smartest choice to me, unless you are a very new author and know you need instant feedback to help you get your writing where it needs to be for a book-length fic.

There's my too-long answer.

This is my stance, for two reasons. (1) I realised that the stories I never finished writing were the ones I let people read before they were complete, so I've developed a superstition regarding that. (2) I'm prone to reaching later chapters and realising that I need to edit something in an earlier chapter. Point in case: the monster fic I'm working on right now was at 170K words/47 Chapters and almost finished when I realised that there was a huge plot hole that required me rewriting Chapters 3-10 to fix. Just yesterday I finished rewriting those chapters... only those seven chapters turned into thirty. I'd never have been able to do that if I'd been posting as I wrote it. (Subsequently I'm also freaking out a little because by the time I'm done it's probably going to upwards of 250K words and I've never written anything this long before.)

Also, as you said, having a finished fic that's released on a regular schedule allows you to build an audience who knows an update is coming, which keeps readers happy and happy readers (presumably) leave reviews. (Hopefully happy reviews.)

*** Not too-long at all. And yes, I am a very new author, so I might not go the same path as you.

On some level it acts as encouragement as well. So far I think about what I want to write, then throw it away and go searching for a new fanfic to read.

But thanks for the advice.

**** alexandersvendsen,

I'm a very new writer, too, so I have not taken my /own/ advice in this case. I wish I had. I'm doing the write-it-chapter-by-chapter-with-an-outline route. When you go chapter-by-chapter, if you get readers, you end up feeling pressure to finish chapters/update regularly. That can lead to anxiety/deteriorating work.

I know people get very attached to whatever form they write in, so I'm going to state this as diplomatically as I can, with the disclaimer that everyone does their own thing and the following is just my opinion:

If you are quite new at writing, perhaps it would make sense to try some longer one-shots. I've been surprised at the luck I've had joining challenges at HPFC on fanfiction.net. There have been several that have inspired some (I think) good short stories in various styles that I've linked to here. They've given me a chance to try to create different voices for very different characters. Two of the stories have been from the POV of people with serious mental problems (sociopathy and PTSD), which I'd never have tried otherwise, yet think will be invaluable for creating antagonists or layered characters in the future.

Doing that also allows you to practice making a well-structured story and getting feedback fairly quickly. It's a good route if that is what you need right now.

One thing to consider, though, is that challenges often lead to really short drabbles (under a thousand words apiece, or even around 100 words). There is nothing wrong with short pieces (I run a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/66100756/1/][100 word challenge]], in which the point is to paint a vivid scene in as few words as possible so you can polish your writing). Writing super-short stuff gives you a chance to work on characterization/voice/style, which is important.

However, if you want to have an arc to your story (ie, a plot) rather than just showing a single event, you need more length (imho). That is not intended to negate the value of ultra-short drabbles, just an observation about style/form.

I've found that, to write a /structured story/ that has a real journey or even just a nuanced character, I (personally) require at least 1500 words (for a super-simple plot), on average between 2000 and 3000 words, and for my most complex and second-best received one-shot, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8918215/1/The-Wonder-Years-The-Diary-of-Hal-Dursley][The Diary of Hal Dursley]], 7,600 words. That is the story for which the most people have asked for a sequel--which shocks me, since it's entirely based around an original character/Dudley Dursley. Neither Dudley nor OCs are popular!

Don't be scared. Write. If you don't put your thoughts down on page, then you'll never get the story out of your head. Plus, if you don't write, you'll never get the practice you need to get better.

**** Sorry if this is a silly question--but what kind of protocol do you have in mind? I think the two biggest things are:

1) Have a beta or two, or if you can't find one, edit, re-edit, and edit again until you are sure that you have cleaned up your story and it is in pristine condition. Then, even after you upload it, keep rereading it and fixing the mistakes. Cause you're gonna find them.

2) Don't hold a story hostage. IE, never beg for reviews or say you won't update/continue a story unless people give you reviews.

** Since I have not written anything in half a year....until last night and today! I can comment on this...

My first story I wrote like 100k words in 2 weeks before I started posting, but that story idea had been simmering for over a year before I ran out of stuff to read and decided to try my hand. It ended up 560k words and 80 chapters long. I posted the rest of my chapters as I went...I tried for a long time to stay at least one chapter ahead before I posted one so that I could fix any small mistakes. But generally I needed the feedback as incentive to keep going.

Now I have multiple stories, WIP...and it drives me nuts!

Post as you go, Save up and Post all at once, whichever. But whatever you do...don't pull a GML and post several stories and then leave them abandoned for months. I'm mad at myself, I can imagine my readers are angry with me...

For anyone who is interested, as an aside, Hogwarts Shuffle! is getting a new chapter tonight or tomorrow.

btw: I write without any beta, and it shows....not sure if I want one, never had one, but if anyone knows my stuff and wants to give it a shot let me know.

*** JustRuss- did you just put yourself forth as the model of bad fanfiction writing habits in the third person?

As for the posting options, the decision has to do with your writing habits. Do you have a clear idea and a sure sense of the whole story, but just want some clean up advice? Finish it first and then send it to a beta and then post it. You have the chops to be a published writer and probably should focus your next story to be original fiction.

If you're like the rest of us, you don't know what people like and what isn't clear about your style. Maybe you have several different paths to take and want to focus on the one that the audience responds to.

In that case, take advantage of the serial nature of fanfiction. Treat each chapter like an episode of a greater series. Some episodes will suck and others will rock and a few will simply be regarded as a comedy/fantasy spoof chapter and you can kill it for the bad idea it was. Betas will help you post work that is readable. If your English skills are awesome (or you have entirely too much faith in Microsoft Word's grammar/spelling checker), you can do without. Your readers will pop that bubble if needed, otherwise you can post as fast as you can write.

That said, your story will never be great if you don't have an ending in mind. Maybe you think a character will be better with extra powers or a difficult relationship to handle- great. But it's not really a story until the problems get resolved, and if you don't have in mind an awesome/epic/tear-jerking moment to provide the culmination of that story, you'll never get to it. That awesome moment is the carrot that both readers and writer have as a payoff for the effort put into reading/writing it.

short version: post when you have some chapters finished and know what the next ones will cover. That way your readers become part of the writing team. BUT Don't start a story if you don't have a plan to end it.

**** The episodic writing style definitely works well for fan fiction, I agree with pretty much this whole post, except that if other people are like me...I watch entire series/seasons in a marathon (thanks to Netflix and Hulu and unfortunately do the same with fiction.

**** Excellent advice!

The only problems with this method are that:

1) Readers could start to abandon ship without giving feedback that you've jumped the shark.

2) This may be just me, but I hate-hate-hate it when I see A/N's in which an author /begs/ for feedback OR asks the readers what direction to take a story. Unless a story is superbly written, I'd probably stop reading there with the assumption that the author doesn't have a plan or the story will die as soon as the author runs out of ideas . . .

*** What is a GML? ::curious::

Good advice.

The only thing I worry about in terms of writing a long fanfic is that I like having a beta for the story. I've got one for . . . if I were writing a multi-chapter all the way before posting, I worry that I wouldn't be able to find a beta who'd go with me the whole way before I finished editing and started posting.

I found my current story-beta because she liked the first few chapters of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8286839/1/Even-Unto-the-Seventh-Generation][Even Unto the Seventh Generation]] and answered my plea . . .

I'd think you're more likely to get a beta to stick through the process if they have the whole work to consider up front, but then most betas aren't in it because they love editing- they want to know what happens in your story before others do.
