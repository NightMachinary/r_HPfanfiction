#+TITLE: A lot of people are fond of making the dark arts illegal because they’re too strong, the ministry is scared of them, them being addictive, or something along those lines but are there any fics where dark arts are dark and restricted because the wounds they make are resistant to healing/very deadly?

*** Isn't it canon that all magics which only intent is to inconvenience someone are technically dark magic (from jinxes to curses), but the really dark ones are just those curses that either don't have a counter-curse or have ones that are either barely known or difficult to cast in a timely manner? Like the sectumsempra scene in 6th book, Harry almost cleaved Malfoy in half with a single slash of a wand and a word, while Snape took some time of careful wand-waving and reciting incantations over and over to reverse the effects.

**** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_charm][Yes to the first bit, not quite to the second.]] It's rated by harm done by the spell, not by ease or availability of counter curses.

** Yeah, there's a 7 book series that works on this basis. The first one's called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
