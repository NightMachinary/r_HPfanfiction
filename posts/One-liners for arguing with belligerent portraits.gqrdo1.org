Got a bit stoned tonight and started imagining scenarios where one of the less restrained members of the Order, such as Ron or Tonks or a more Indy!Harry might clap back against the likes of Walburga Black or Phineas Nigellus. I don't know if they're all winners, but here's what I've come up with so far.

"Bold talk from someone lacking a third dimension."

" Vincent Van Gogh over here can Vincent Van go fuck himself."

"If you're so smart, how come you're dead?"

"I'm not sure who has the worse grasp of perspective here, you or the hack who painted you!"

"Right, if I wanted to argue with a simulacrum made of old shite, I'd have saved us both the trouble and squatted it out myself!"


** "OH yeah!? Well watch this!" /leaves and does whatever they want to do because they're not a painting stuck to a wall/

** What about just modifying the painting? Make Phineas look like he was the first to pass out at a frat party.
