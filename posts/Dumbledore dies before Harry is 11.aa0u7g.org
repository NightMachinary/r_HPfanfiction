** I can think of only one: Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li. Dumbledore gets killed by Voldemort sometime before Voldemort goes after the Potters. Still in progress, but I found it to be a fantastic read. linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

** I feel like this would be a good "oh, and also..." for an SI, Peggy-Sue, or whatever else kind of story would have a recollection of canon events.

Starts with the MC waking up as Harry Potter the day his Hogwarts letter arrives and starts all the usual shenanigans to get to Diagon Alley early and whatnot only to then find out they're in an AU with no Dumbledore and just... blue screening on what to do.

*** Bonus points if the MC doesn't like Dumbledore but is implicitly relying on him being around to keep Voldemort and his forces in check while they can enact their own plans.

**** Would also make for an interesting set of Butterfly effects as some of the various plots and political shenanigans proceed apace while others veer off since depending on how long Dumbledore's been gone, there's likely any number of plot points that could reasonably occur "on schedule." Easiest example being something like the Tri-Wizard Tournament which could have been in the works for years via various committees. What the actual tasks are though might vary wildly from canon without Dumbledore's participation. OTOH, "Harry's" first year at Hogwarts is right off the rails unless Dumbledore died literally days before term started... in which case you have the "...did Tom do that?" subplot.

***** Totally! I wonder who would be new political leader meanwhile. Could things get better or worse faster? Would Umbridge and Fudge have this much power later on too? There's a lot of ways stories could go.
