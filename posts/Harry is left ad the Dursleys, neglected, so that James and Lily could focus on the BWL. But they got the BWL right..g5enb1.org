We know the typical trope, James and/or Lily abandon Harry so they could focus on his twin, the Boy Who Lived, and train him to be the Champion of Light and defeat Voldemort. In contrast, Harry is left with nothing, to be abused by the Dursleys, perhaps even has his magic (unsuccessfully) stolen and transferred to his brother or something.

Then, of course, it turns out that Harry is the real Boy Who Lived, while his brother is a fake.

It is this last part that bothers me a lot - it shifts the emphasis away from the fact they they abandoned/mistreated one baby in favor of the other, to the fact that they chose the wring one. There's also the implication that the real BWL actually deserves to be cared for more.

So do we have a story where the non-BWL twin becomes the hero, and the prophesy simply remains unfulfilled.


** I would like the idea of them beliving the child was a squib and rather then letting a kid grow up connected to a world they could never be apart off, James and lilly decide to give the young boy to the dursleys with James giving a massive stipend to them pay for his welfare and upbringing

Because when the Pureblood movement got going in the 17th century, one of their chief tenets was that if you couldn't use a wand, you weren't a /real/ mage, so all the brewers and rune-carvers and beastmasters and astronomers and arithmancers and diviners and alchemists who had hitherto done at least a couple of years at Hogwarts at the part of the school Helga Hufflepuff used to run - she was a firm believer in the proposition that your hedge-practitioners were just as valid as the fancy-dan wand-wavers - were left high and dry.

All that talent fucked off to the muggle world, and as a result the magical world got stagnation while the muggles got the Enlightenment.

Lucius and a few "dark" families controlling the Wizengamont to push their political agenda is a travesty but Harry claiming 10 Lordships and doing it is righteous.

Obviously their motives for abusing the system are different and Harry is doing to better society but rarely does he do any kind of work to actually fight monopolies and corruption.

When considering these two:

1. James and Lily thought John was the BWL, and so cast Harry away to focus on John. They were wrong, and Harry was the BWL.
2. James and Lily thought John was the BWL, and so cast Harry away to focus on John. They were correct.

I maintain that both cases are equally tragic, and in both cases their actions are equally reprehensible.

However, more subjectively, I feel like many fics (sure, not all) use the "they were wrong" part as if it makes the situation more reprehensible.

** Some thoughts I had:

Harry turns up at Hogwarts' Sorting. His brother, who knows that he had a brother but didn't know anything more because he wasn't spoken of at all, is astounded, as are their parents.\\
Unsurprisingly, Harry is apathetic at best, bitter at worst about being cast away, considered a squib or not, and pretty much wants nothing to do with his birth-family.

Plot direction #1:

One of his brother's friends has a crush on Harry, and wants his brother to try to hook them up. His brother likes the idea, since it'd mean he'd be in his circle of friends. Unfortunately, Harry is already dating someone, and this perceived interference strains things even more.

Plot direction #2:

Harry does his own thing and pretty much remains distant from his birth-family and their attempts of reconnecting. He's genuinely not interested.\\
His last conversation with them, their real final attempt to reconnect with him, ended up with him heatedly calling them a bunch of c*nts in their Seventh Year.\\
Years later, Harry is working in the DoM as an unspeakable, is married to the love of his life, and life is going well.

He ends up being a magical version of Indiana Jones with his wife, recovering old artifacts, smashing dark cults, et cetera.

His brother, in the meanwhile, is an auror -- and is pretty much kept on safe duties. His life is unfulfilling and uninteresting, and it's /killing/ him.

When he's roped into the latest hijinks and is forced to be involved in one of his estranged brother's misadventures, he can't help but feel envious.

Lily and James are surprised and saddened to find out that their second son is married and that they're grandparents, and that they never knew.

Best revenge is living well, after all... even if it was unintentional revenge on Harry's part.
