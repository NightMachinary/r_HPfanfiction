Sorry if this has been asked before but I wasn't having much luck searching around.

I really want to know of any good - well written - stories that are new characters/new ideas/not our usual HP bunch.

I don't like worrying about out of character writing or it changing how I view the characters I fell in love with during the books. But I very much miss just reading about something that exists in this world.

Whether it's before, during, or after the HP series, I don't care. I just want to be able to go back into the surrounding world and magic that Rowling created without having to mess with my mental image of the core characters.

Please link me to any stories or sites that you might know of for this! Thanks!!

The characters have their own plots adjacent to the series and very rarely crossover (although fair warning post-series they do more). It also explores the Wizarding world beyond that of the series and is just overall very well written (fantastic and loveable characters, interesting plots and

  Amidst a struggling Muggle economy, two children are delivered questionable letters by a woman with a pointy hat and broomstick. Could there really be an entire Magical world, just out of sight, offering a chance at another life? Or do the same mechanisms that steer the Muggle world remain, regardless of wherever you go?
