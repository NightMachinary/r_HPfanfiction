*** Runestone Path is Harry bashing if anything. Any character the author doesn't like says something even innocent, Harry throws a temper tantrum like a little bitch. Actually Harry in that book seems like the fantasy of a guy who is unable to befriend other guy, is desperate to get laid so he only focuses on girls but he always ends up friendzoned, yet he is deluded that they are somehow in love with him. Also the story might have some cool scenes but overall is a poorly written power fantasy so I don't get its popularity.

***** It seems strange that 2 couples in the order gave birth right at the end of July, almost as if they conceived their children at the same time. Why people would even consider having children when they were fighting a war is strange to begin with, even more so when they were losing that war. And Halloween is exactly 9 months before Harry and Neville's birthday.

Maybe there were other couples in the order that died or their children were born too early or too late to be possible candidates of the prophecy.

It's impossible for many women to all give birth at the same time, but if you throw a dozen darts at a board while blindfolded at least a few will hit the target if you know how how far away the board is.

** Well that's a recipe for alcohol poisoning.

The two that immediately come to mind are Harry Potter and the Time Mage, which opens with Vernon beating Harry half to death with a cricket bat and possibly trying to rape him? I don't know if he did, I closed to fic at that point.

The other one is Harry and Albus' World Tour, just something about the way its prose was written made it painful to read. Every time anyone said /anything/ you'd get a round robin of everyone in the room explaining their thoughts on it, it just made the flow of the story grind to a halt every few paragraphs.

** Thankfully, I tend to stay far away from any stories that have bashing in the summary.

It definitely depends on if you care about who is paired with who. But I don't care too much about pairings. Though I will read stories with pairings.

And thankfully authors do a good job at telling people beforehand if a character is bashed.

** I've seen many stories that have amazing premises... but they typically always include bashing and awful tropes or something just plain weird, like feminising Harry in the narrative to the point he's an OC or SI (bait and switch).

There was an interesting story that had Harry arriving in Equestria... he promptly had his gender switched, gave herself a new name, suddenly found males attractive (despite branching off from DH), and it quickly became apparent this was an SI that began with a bait and switch.

Sigh.
