Hi everyone,

​

I would love your help. I'm doing a pretend harry potter convention/festival for a university assignment around participatory culture, in particular, fanfiction of Harry Potter.

​

So I'm going to pretend to have guest speakers, panels, workshops, and would love anyones help to point me in the right direction of well known harry potter fan fiction/ authors. Can be in terms of Wattpad, Tumblr, etc storytelling or videos, podcast, etc.

​

I've got a few ideas, but would love some more. Even ones that are PG rated but advocate for diversity (eg. Writing about people with disabilities, same sex couples, etc)

​

Many thanks for anyone that can help :-) it's a great community out there, hence why I chose to do my assignment on it!


** Do you need them to still be accessible? A few of my favorite authors have been inactive for over a decade.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]] is strongly anti-elitist (Pureblood aristocracy/establishment), anti-racism (blood purity), and anti-slavery (free House-Elves).

You may want to read his short fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]], in which Neville Longbottom disagrees with his friends' aggressive postwar reform agenda

I think it will be interesting too look at the political-social environment of Wizarding Britain *without* the rose tainted glasses from the childhood, especially in backdrop of today's rather volatile real world situation.
