Random Hogwarts students with bad grades end up in a series of puzzle rooms that they have to fight their way through to get to classes.

** I honestly really like the idea, that the puzzles will be enough to challange but you will never die

hogwarts will bring out every students potential with tough challanges every day but students most belive they will die or they will not give it the best effort

**** I guess. Glados and the Lab always have a way out for you to find. The Labyrinth is more like the unholy child of a tunnel, a slime mold, and an antlion.

** I read something a bit like this once. Hogwarts was mad at Harry for some reason and made getting anywhere really difficult. Tripping, rearranging his positioning inside the castle, the moving staircaises, activating non-convinient secret passageways and stuff like that. Harry stuck like glue to other students to get to casses on time.
