Harry Potter spends his childhood being raised and under the tutelage of Gyro Zeppeli, a master of the mysterious phenomenon known as the Spin, and the last member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Zeppeli. Before attending Hogwarts, Harry is taught the ways of the Spin and learns how to horse ride like his uncle.

*** Yeah, I imagined it in which Gyro was born in the same year as Lily, Snape, and the Marauders. His family was killed by Dark Wizards, so he had to flee to Britain. This is when the Evans find him and take him in.

** I raise you all old man Joseph/adoptive younger sibling for Jotaro; for one there's an easier explanation of his relationship with the Joestars(maybe Erina/Lisa Lisa had a sibling who had either a child or grandchild who married into the Evans) given a shared English heritage. Over the course of the plot Harry would definitely pull out the your next line is/Joestar secret technique, and perhaps after the events of part three Harry decides to learn Hamon/resolves to get a stand after Voldemort's return or suspecting the Power he knows not too be something else after hearing the prophecy: in fact I've got a Stand in mind! Name: The Phoenix Touch. Type: close range/semi humanoid. Stats: Power:C Speed:A Range:C Durability:B Precision:A Developmental Potential:B. Ability:Energy redirection and excess environmental energy absorption, allowing for increased striking power, limited regeneration of self and others, and limited ranged attacks unless going up against ranged opponents via reflecting their own assault. Secondary Ability: Magic, albeit uncomplicated and improved instinctual ‘spells'. Main Attack method: Punches, kicks, and scratching via talons. Design: The Phoenix Touch resembles a shorter and slimmer green eyed lighting bolt scarred Magicians Red with a Phoenix's color pallet, tail feathers, intricate designs resembling runes and various symbols(including a silver snake with red eyes curled around the scar, a wand on his right hand, and the Hallows symbol over where the heart would be)across the body except for the head(which is bare save the scar and snake), pseudo antlers on the head, hooves on the feet, and retractable talons on the fingers. Name Origin: The Touch by Stan Bush with Phoenix thrown in there for good measure due to Harry's connection with Fawkes, the timing of manifestation, and the stand's abilities/appearance. Stand Cry: Soli(derived from Lumos Solem, the sunlight charm)/Avada(when angered or when striking with full force amplified to the max, first half of the killing curse).

*** Not sure what you mean by Harry getting a Stand due to "Hamon/resolve". Stands manifest only when someone is pierced by the Stand Arrow, or an ancestor gains a Stand which allows descendants to get one. based on what you said, Harry would have to be pierced or an ancestor had a Stand. Phoenix Touch seems like a cool Stand, but its ability to use Magic makes too OP. And why does Harry have a connection with Fawkes?

**** A: I was thinking that the manifestation would be some combination of the Joestar Curse, sheer willpower(see Kakyoin and Heirophant Green), and begging to the Speedwagon foundation higher ups for access to their Stand Arrow. B: TPT can only preform basic spells(aka nothing above second year level) and ‘accidental' magic. C: A combination of having a wand with his feather as a core and Fawkes' tears in Harry's bloodstream. As far as balancing TPT is a close range stand in a long range world, and so without redirecting spells(which can't be done to the Unforgivable curses and anything instantaneous) it can't make much of an impact except in the initial portion of the Battle of the DOM and the Battle of the Lightning Struck Tower until Harry learns how to use the ranged Sunlight attacks briefly mentioned in my initial comment. There's a reason Developmental Potential is a B, Harry's not getting access to all of TPT's abilities off the bat.

***** A: Why would the Stand manifestation be from a combination? Its pretty much canon that Stands come from a hereditary or the Arrow. Its safe to imply that Kakyoin had an ancestor who was pierced by the arrow. It cant just be sheer willpower. Also you mentioned the Joestar Curse, implying that Harry is Joestar. But he isnt by blood or name. Just because he descended from someone who is related to Erina/Lisa Lisa, doesnt make him a Joestar at all. And the Joestar Curse is just a term in which the Joestar family was effected by Dio's action throughout history. That doesnt necessarily lead to Stand manifestation, and Harry cant be Joestar like I said.

Edit: Also, if Harry were to gain a Stand, he runs the risk of Voldemort gaining a Stand as well. Their minds and souls are connected at some degree, considering the Horcrux in Harry. Voldemort with a Stand would just make everything worse.

****** Good point on the Kakyoin situation. As for the Curse, if I went that route it would be Joseph awakening Hermit Purple that would begin TPT's awakening only to be cut off by Joseph's (brief) death in Part Three, resulting in a similar situation to Joskue and Crazy Diamond's spectral appearance in the beginning of their part. Although, if I write a fanfic based off of this idea I'll probably go down the Arrow route to avoid confusion and give Stands to other Harry Potter characters.

******* Wait what? What does Joseph awakening Hermit Purple have to do with Harry getting his Stand? If you're making it that Harry is somehow related to the Joestars by blood, then all of them would gain Stands at nearly the same time. Right after Dio pierced his (Jonathan's) body with the Arrow, all living Joestars were effected. Except for Holly and Josuke since they didnt have the strength to fully wield their stands at the time. In this case, Harry would be 9 years old during Stardust Crusaders. He most likely wouldnt have the will to manifest TPT like Josuke. Only until after Dio was killed, Harry would gain his Stand along with Josuke.

Edit: Harry would have gained his Stand 2 years before going to Hogwarts

******** As you mentioned above, Harry isn't directly related to Jonathan and so would begin to awaken due to Joseph having a Stand if I went that route(which again, if I ever write this fic I wouldn't do).

********* Even if you do write your fanfic. I recommend not giving Stands to Harry Potter characters. At this point it would seem like that everyone and their mothers has a Stand. It seems more better to have Harry have this unique power. Not only that, but you have yo be careful when making your own OC Stands. There's a few Harry/Jojo fanfics on FF where HP characters have Stands. You dont what to make your OC Stands too similar to other OC Stands.
