For example, I don't want Harry to travel back in time and just stay there. I want stuff such as time paradoxes or a person existing through multiple points in time without causing a fluctuation, that is the opposite of Eloise Mintumble. Artifacts other than the time turner Hermione had that can go back years or even go /forward/.

Anything is welcome as long as there's a focus on time shenanigans.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

*** Can you give a short summary of this fic? Spoilers are fine.

I see this recommended quite a bit but couldn't get into it much, and that summary at start is useless

**** Harry's wish causes Regulus to survive, which introduces the Black Phantom to the first Voldemort war, which causes Regulus and Lord Black to free Sirius shortly before Harry's original wish, which causes Sirius to turn back a month where he becomes Lord Black and frees his younger self with his brother, then he turns back again and prepares evidence against the Dursleys which allows him to adopt Harry the day after the wish.

A whole lot of time loops that complete themselves, stacked into each other. Oh, and James Bond makes an appearance.

**** Regulus lives and gets Sirius out quite early on, and then there are time turner shenanigans as Sirius uses the "Power of the Blacks" to fix the world for his godson. It's quite well written for its genre and a lot of fun once you get into it.

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

It takes a bit to get to it but the time travel part is really interesting I thought, and it's a great fic

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time doesn't exactly push temporal mechanics to the limit, but it has more than just a jump back. I wasn't all that impressed by it myself, but many people like it.

** Harry potter and the temporal beacon by willyolioleo is exactly what you are looking for.

Features multiple time travel movements in a intentional groundhog day like event that doesnt stick to one time period.

** I know a fanfic called Too many Travellers but I didn't find it that good.

If you are craving that kind of story then watch the not fanfic Steins;Gate. It is the best time travel story that I have ever seen (And I have seen /many)/ and has everything you have asked for, executed perfectly. The consequences of time travel only come at episode 13 though, but once you reach that point it is worth it (The previous episodes are for world building and that does not mean it is boring there).
