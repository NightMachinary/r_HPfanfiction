When Fudge belittles and dismisses Dumbledore and Harry in the Hospital Wing, denouncing them and their claims of the Dark Lord's return, everyone involved was left scratching their heads on a few things: what would be Voldemort's next move, what are his future plans and how could they convince the Ministry of the truth (before it was too late)?

Albus, as well as many others in the Order, surmised that he would take time to recuperate his strength and forces (relish in his return to a physical form) before announcing his return to the public. In all honesty, Dumbledore believed that if he thought he could get away with it, he'd absolutely remain in the shadows and never announce his resurrection to the public. A long battle of spying and cold warfare expected in the Headmaster's immediate future...

Except the Dark Lord himself comes on to the Wizarding Wireless with [[https://youtu.be/eeq8klpLDBI][this]] not two days after the graveyard incident, standing in the Ministry Atrium itself atop a pile of Auror'a and others who saw fit to strike back at him.

Yeah... needless to say it was a very different, and disturbingly effective, campaign the Dark Lord ran from there onwards.
