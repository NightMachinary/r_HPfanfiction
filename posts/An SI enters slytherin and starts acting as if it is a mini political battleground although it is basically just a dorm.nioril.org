I'm just imagining an SI claiming to be the slytherin prince or something like that and everyone else thinking he is just crazy.


** "But... what are the house rules? Where's the solidarity?" asked the SI.

The Slytherins stared at them. "My guy... we're teenagers... do you seriously think we'd voluntarily follow extra rules?"

"But how do you determine whose the superior political force? How do you know who is the truest follower of the great founders legacy?"

"OK but consider this--that sounds like it involves extra work. If I wanted to to extra work I would have joined Hufflepuff."

"Don't you need to prepare for politics later in life? Sharpen your tongues and strategies on a smaller battleground?"

"No? Politics has nothing to do with that. You just need to have the right family and a lot of money."

"It's true," chimed in someone else, "Wizengamot seats only cost about 20,000 galleons"

"Besides, most of us really don't care about that sort of thing. Politics doesn't require a fourth of the population, and frankly I'm more interested in Binn's lectures."

SI made a strange whimpering sound, and muttered something about seizing power. Everyone ignored them.

Later, they were admitted to the hospital wing for magical exhaustion, since they'd convinced themself that magic had shortcuts and had had a breakdown involving the inability to cast wingardium leviosa and several overpowered lumos'.

** I adjusted my robes and remembered everything I had read and re-read from the books on genealogy and proper forms of address before the start of term. I'd only get one shot at this...

Malfoy was sitting on the floor of the common room next to Crabbe, I walked up trying to practice the walk I had found in the book on pureblood etiquette and cleared my throat. Malfoy looked up.

'Oh, hi' he said 'is your leg okay? you're kind of limping.'

'You should go see the nurse' Crabbe piped up with a grin 'I bet it's good for skiving off a few classes'

I was shaken but rallied quickly

'Heir Malfoy' I began, 'I formally seek an alliance with you and the noble houses of Malfoy and Black, for there is much I can offer and a pact between us would be of great benefit'

Malfoy stared and then, to my surprise, he burst out laughing.

'You're hilarious!' He exclaimed, between giggles 'Anthony wasn't it?'

'Antonine Perevell Slytherin-Black'

'Well Tony, I'm Draco and this here is Vince,' He smiled and Crabbe gave me a half wave 'we're playing exploding snap why don't you sit down and jump in for a round'

I didn't understand, I was sure I had gotten the wording exactly right, maybe I had messed up the walk?

I dumbly sat down as Malfoy and Crabbe shifted around to make room for me on the carpet and idly reached for the cards as I desperately tried to figure out how I had gone wrong. I just had time to register that the card I had picked up was the 9 of staves before it exploded in my face.

** *"Fellow Slytherins! We need to stand united against the rest of the houses. We need to have each other's backs. We need to prove the teachers that the patron saint of our house, Salazar, was not wrong to select us the purebloods as his apprentices. Yes?"*

"Professor Snape gives us points for showing up to his class. He's pretty nice and that usually helps us win the House Cup."

*"Uhm... OK. Any other questions? Yes?"*

"Who's Salazar?"

*"Salazar Slytherin, the founder of our house, the greatest wizard of all times."*

"Why was he the greatest? Did he invent any cool spells?"

"I bet he invented the Jelly-Leg Jinx and the Tongue Tying Curse."

*"Well that's not actually the point but..."*

"So then what makes him the greatest?"

*"Guys, I thought you were supposed to be cunning and ambitious."*

"Oh... so the guy is just trying to suck up for brownie points with the prefects."

*"I am not. I am trying to inspire you. To get you to be the greatest witches and wizards of your time."*

"Cool! Will you teach us how to make prank jinxes?"

*"No! I'm trying to unite you under a powerful wizard's leadership so that we can one day rule Magical Britain."*

"Why a wizard and not a witch?"

*"Because I am a wizard."*

"So you're going to teach out how to rule Magical Britain?"

*"Not by myself but together with you, my friends."*

"How can we be friends if we don't even know your name?"

*"We'll support each other. We'll create a network of allies and we will raise up in the ranks of the Ministry."*

"Dad says that the Ministry sucks."

*"Well there will always be people hating us but we will rule our world."*

"Will we get to choose who wins the Quidditch professional league?"

*"I suppose we could do that too."*

"Now you're talking. I'm going to make a law that declares the Tutshill Tornadoes champions for all eternity."

"What? The Holyhead Harpies would totally deserve that title."

"Fuck you guys! I'm going to make the Chuddley Cannons champions."

*"Guys... guys... this is not about Quidditch! This is about so much more than that..."*

"What's the point in ruling Britain if you can't make your favorite Quidditch team champion?"

*"Money... influence... power..."*

"Daddy is rich."

"My parents said they'll buy me a Firebolt."

"I'd like some money. How many galleons do you think I'll get if I sell a full collection of chocolate frog cards?"

*"Uhm... not sure. OK. I get it, your family's rich. But what about power and influence?"*

"Crabbe and Goyle are pretty strong. Not sure we could beat them."

*"Fuck this shit."*
