Marauder era stuff! Anything really but if you know of any give that have good Sirius and lily friendship I always enjoy that. I like stuff that has an angsty Sirius either him running away or him being alone after the prank. Definitely love Sirius centric stuff:) xx


** -They're Hiding Inside Me linkao3(12540852) has Sirius run away from home.

- Pot, Kettle, Black linkao3(13095258) is just post graduation and has a little bit of Lily & Sirius friendship. Very angsty for Sirius.

-The Year of the Rat linkao3(84554) is a marauders fic from Peter's perspective.

- The Age of Lies linkao3(13281801) is a post graduation AU where Regulus lives.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  Peter had learned from an early age that magic was about intent first and foremost, and if he wanted something badly enough, he could make it happen.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.
