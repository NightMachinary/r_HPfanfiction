  Have you ever realized that all you know about Hermione is what she said about herself and what she did in front of others? And that the trio is much too lucky for it to be natural?

  Some days I'm just so happy to be alive. Then again some days I'm lying on my back, bleeding from my forehead wondering weather I screwed over the pope in a past life. Today is not a happy day. HarryLuna, Hermione Bashing, Powerful Harry...

  Ron Weasley has spent his life overshadowed. So when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, he's just not sure how he feels. But he does miss him so very much.

  You can never have too many brothers, Ron decides, for the very first time in his life. And there's always room in the Burrow for another Weasley, even if only an honorary one.

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

#+begin_quote
  With Sirius Black on the loose, Harry and Ron arrive for their 3rd year as rambunctious, loud, obnoxious teenagers. Sounds normal. Why, then, is Albus Dumbledore so worried? Is it going to be just a normal year at Hogwarts? Is it ever when a Potter is involved?

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.
