I'm looking for a fic I read years ago. It's fairly short, maybe 5 chapters, and is set in the Founders' era. Salazar Slytherin is a werewolf who is found injured by Helga Hufflepuff, and he becomes friends with her, Godric Gryffindor, and Rowena Ravenclaw. The Chamber of Secrets is actually where he gets locked away during his transformations, and the basilisk is there to keep him company. (He may have been blind too, which would explain why he's safe from the basilisk's stare.)

In the end, there's some argument between Godric and Salazar, but it's not about Muggleborn prejudice---I think Salazar was afraid for the Muggleborns' safety, because of the basilisk or Dementors or something. Anyway, students overheard some things they were yelling, and the rumors became recorded history.

Applying various search filters to FanFiction.net didn't help me find it, nor did Googling key words. Does the description ring any bells?


** Never mind, I found it! Of course it would turn up /after/ I posted a request.
