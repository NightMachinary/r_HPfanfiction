From what I remember, it was the entire year of Harry's from all different timelines.

At one point in the first chapter, somebody asks the year who has time traveled, and they all raise their hands.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  "Okay, how many of you are self-inserts?!"...

  One raised his hand and then clambered up onto the table, "Quick show of hands to answer Crabbe's question!" his tone of voice held that slow, easy cadence of someone used to being obeyed.
