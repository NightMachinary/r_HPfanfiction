I'm rereading The Sum of Their Parts and got to musing about Harry leading the campaign to exterminate the goblins and made me want to read a story where the enemy is so evil that even Hermione agrees they all need to die.


** Linkffn(lucky harry) its also posted on hpfanficarchive with the more m rated scenes left in. But later in the store harry does do some genocide. Not saying against who cause spoilers.

  An accident at the age of six turned out to be a lucky thing for Harry Potter. It could get him all the things he had ever dreamed about and many things that he could have never imagined; girls, adventure, a home, and love.
