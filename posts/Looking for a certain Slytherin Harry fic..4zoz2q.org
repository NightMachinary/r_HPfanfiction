  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** linkffn(8517195) Harry didn't use his magic to make them kneel though. The way he described it was that basic human instinct is to follow to orders of the bigger predator in order to survive. Since he is the biggest predator, they were all forced to kneel.

  In 1895, the last time he was defeated, Count Dracula made a prophecy. His legacy would live on in the boy of lightning... His four mistresses set out on a quest to find this boy, and finds him in the boy known as Harry Potter... Rated M for Gore later on. Vampire!Godlike!Harry

** It also sounds a lot like this one, Linkffn(11191235) a fic that starts off fairly badly and cliche, but turns out to subvert all of them very well to be its own unique fic. The very best portrayal of Lockhart I have ever seen. Harry also takes control of the top players in Slytherin and I believe he changes Marcus Flint for the better (don't quote me on this)

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
