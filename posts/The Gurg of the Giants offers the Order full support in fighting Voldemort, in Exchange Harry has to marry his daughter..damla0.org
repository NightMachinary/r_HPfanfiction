In most fanfics where Harry has an arranged marriage, there never seems to be an actual reason why the marriage was arranged in the first place, and it pretty much always results in Harry reluctantly starting to date this extremely attractive and intelligent person, who also has a heart of gold.

This prompt is basically about what if someone who actually has something very desirable offers the marriage contract with a woman who is very much not desirable. It doesn't have to be Giants, beings like Goblins, Vampires or even Mermen would also do.

**** I'm sure it wouldn't be as horrible as you think it would. Just make sure any dialog sounds alright when spoken aloud and you're already ahead of the pack.

I wish more authors would just read their work aloud to themselves before posting it. Its easier to pick up weird wording or sentence structure if the story is read aloud.

I am a slow reader and really try to dig in to what is being said. While I read I am hearing the character speech in my head as if I were listening to a really good audio book or a film. I sometimes catch myself making odd faces that go along with what I am reading which I admit is horribly embarrassing.

** Harry took a sip of the scalding tea, set the mug down, and fixed Hagrid with a stare. The half-giant shifted, appearing as uncomfortable as Harry himself felt.

"Please, Hagrid. You're the only one I can ask for advice."

"Blimey," Hagrid murmured, stroking his scruffy beard. "I want ter help, but just 'cause I'm part giant don' mean I know all about... well. Never was attracted to anythin' bigger than meself."

A noise like the rumble of thunder resounded outside, and Harry shivered. The interior of the hut darkened as a shadow loomed over the window, and when he turned toward it, he found himself under the scrutiny of enormous yellowish eyes of his bride.

"Haree," she bellowed, causing the window to rattle in its frame, "nookie nookie."

Swallowing, he turned helplessly to Hagrid. "See?"

"Ah, tha'll happen. Yeh better, uh"--Hagrid fidgeted with his cup--"take care o' tha' itch before yer wife hauls yeh away an' takes care o' it herself. Me dad kept Skele-Gro on hand fer a reason."

"That's the problem," he cried, casting a fearful glance at the enormous face behind the window. "I don't know /how/!"

"Don' know how?" Hagrid's face colored. "Merlin's beard, I reckoned tha' at yer age... Well, I'm not the best person ter explain, but..." Forming a ring with his index finger and thumb, he stuck the finger of his other hand through. "Like tha', sorta?"

"I--I know /that/ much," he sputtered. "It's just... That'd be like sticking a broomstick through a Quidditch hoop!"

Hagrid opened and closed his mouth several times before chuckling nervously. "Right. Right. This ain' somethin' I like ter remember, but I heard me dad use the Engorgement Charm on his..." His beady eyes flicked down, and when Harry only gave him a blank look, he added a pointed jerk of his chin. "Should work a treat, jus' don' overdo it lest yeh pass out when yer blood rushes down."

"Oh. /Oh god/." Harry's cheeks heated, and he looked away, inadvertently locking eyes with his bride.

She gave him a gap-toothed smile and slapped the wall, causing the bundles of herbs suspended from the beams overhead to sway. "Nookie nookie!"

"No one would blame yeh if yeh changed yer mind," Hagrid said, blinking through the dust that fell from the ceiling. "It helps havin' the giants on our side, but yeh sacrificin' yerself don' sit right with me."

"It's... it's alright." Taking a deep breath, Harry rose to his feet. "This is for the greater good."

"Great man," Hagrid murmured as he strode resolutely to the door. "Yer a great man, Harry."

********* I mean if a giant's vag is big enough to actually walk into it, then there's really not much else you could do. I doubt the size difference is actually that dramatic, though. I think Hagrid's described as twice as tall as a normal man, so between 10 and 12 feet. Grawp I think is 16 feet, and is on the small size of giants. So an average giant is probably about 20 feet tall. So it's definitely feasible to have sex with one (male human and female giant, anyway), it would just be odd due to the size difference, and I don't see insemination happening easily (unless they used a turkey baster or some shit when they actually wanted a kid, lol).

** All i saw at first was "The Gurg of the Giants offers the Order full support in fighting Voldemort, in Exchange..." and my first thought was "Harry's hand in marraige." I was close. So close. Though thinking on it, perhaps the Gurg thinks a son born of the Boy-Who-Lived and a giant will make an immortal giant heir, or the Giant knows that Wizards have the brains while giants have the strength so having a wizard husband for his daughter could strengthen the giants and grant some legitimacy.
