*Summary:* Sirius Black has Moonlighted as an actual Grim for years. Then, that fateful Halloween, he calls in a favour from Death. Now It's been ten years since anyone has seen or heard from Harry Potter, And when he fails to appear at the sorting in 1991, Chaos ensues. Hermione Granger was always different, but between magic and her new friend Harry, just how much will her life change? As years go by, and they grow closer to Harry's return to the Wizarding World, the question becomes: How will the Wizarding World react to a Harry Potter raised by his favourite â€˜uncle': The Grim Reaper himself.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him.

  In Alio Mundo - In Another World. When Sirius arrives at Godric's Hollow something stops him from running off after Peter and suffering for twelve years in Azkaban.

  When S.H.I.E.L.D. dumps everyone's secrets post CA:WS, Natasha discovers who her biological family was and that she wasn't born Natalia Romanova, but Mallory Evans. When she goes looking for her family, what she finds is a 6 year old Harry Potter and for the first time in her life she has someone who is all her own. Together, with the family she chose, they decide to raise him as their own. This is the story of how the avengers raise a young wizard, and how they teach him and each other how they all deserve the love and comfort having a family can offer.

  The time has come - Harry Potter, the prophecized Chosen One, turns 11 years old. It's time for Albus Dumbledore to become his savior, who takes him away from his abusive, neglecting relatives and introduces him to the Wizarding world. But... there is one, small problem. Dumbledore's whole plan is falling apart, when it turns out that Harry Potter doesn't need a savior. He had been given out by his relatives the very day Dumbledore put him on their doorstep. Now, he lives in the Gaunt Shack with his foster Father. He is a well-trained Wizard. He doesn't intend to go to Hogwarts. He speaks only Parseltongue. He is agressive towards any uninvited stranger.Dumbledore is an uninvited stranger.

  Harry's relatives died in a car crash. Dumbledore, who wanted to keep Harry safe and out of the Wizarding World, decided to take Harry to America. There, Harry is put under the care of S.H.I.E.L.D. Harry meets and trains with Natalia and Clint under the watchful eye of Phil Coulson. The Americans aren't sure what to make of the boy who refuses to speak. AU. No pairings.
