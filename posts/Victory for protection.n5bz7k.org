I've had this idea bouncing around in my head for years: What if Harry, early on, offered Malfoy victory in exchange for protection? It's not complicated, the truth of Harry's upbringing is literally all Lucious would need to absolutely ruin Dumbledore and his entire political movement: "The muggles are *exactly* as horrible as we've been telling you all along, and if you want proof, /look at what they did to your hero/."

Are there any fics out there where this gambit is addressed?


** Well in CoS we learn that Harry's strong dislike for the Dursleys is known throughout the Wizarding world (I mean Ernie knows it so its no stretch of imagination that the rumor has spread far and wide) As such I think youre overestimating the power of truth. This is basically "DEs learn Voldemort is not pureblood and abandon him" but in reverse.

You would have to assume the people in the Wizarding world are kind of thick to not know that unpleasant muggles exist, just as unpleasant wizards do.

As such your prompt requires heavy suspension of disbelief to achieve a dark!Harry due to abuse or being too cushy with the Malfoys. Which is a known trope with quite a few really good and emotional works to it, that did not take a shortcut to give the blood purist movement any relevancy.

*** That an adolescent dislikes his guardians is not by any means a shocking revelation, and most teens go through a period of not liking their parents much. So Harry's dislike of the Dursleys would have been attributed to normal teenager stuff and ignored.

That's... really optimistic of you, but not at all how prejudice/stereotyping works on perception. I mean, a person might think that way, but people just don't. Example: loads of Jewish people are stuck in shit jobs just like the rest of us, but come up with a list of half a dozen Jews in power, and suddenly you've got mobs of people yelling about a conspiracy to take over the world. An individual person can be calm and thoughtful, but the masses, which is what politicians generally work with, are fearful, superstitious, and prone to turning savage at even a hint of blood. Vocal minorities can and do shape the policies of the passive majority.

You seem to have made a couple leaps/assumptions, and I get that you're just following tropes, but there's no reason why this would be at all a matter of turning Harry dark, or boosting blood purity. In fact, politically, it would work better if both of those were explicitly avoided. The specific issue is that muggles are dangerous, and for that to be played up as much as possible Harry needs to be the hero of the light. Malfoy needs to frame himself as a moderate, as the man saving a child from abuse and exposing those who enabled/enforced it.

From this chaos, comes a comprehensive victory. Harry is the last hero the light can look up to, and malfoy has influence over him. Muggles are framed as dangerous to society and magical children, and that's fertile ground for all kinds of change. The man in charge of hundreds of children is exposed as a child abuser, and you can bet his staff are all under investigation; guess who has pull on the school's board, and can claim credit/further influence from this?
