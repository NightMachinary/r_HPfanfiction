Are there any stories where instead of simply showing off how awesome the new and improved Harry is, the narrative focuses on the hilarity of the resulting situations.

For example instead of:

#+begin_quote
  When Harry entered the Great Hall with his harem, the senile Dumb-as-a-door rushed to confront him. "Harry," he shouted, spitting liquid-imperius-drenched Lemon Drops everywhere. "You need to stop, submit because it is for the GREATER GOOD!!^{!^{!"!!"}}
#+end_quote

something more along the lines of:

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter-Gryffindor-Merlin walked into the Great Hall followed by his harem, Albus Dumbledore knew that he was in for a headache. Harry, bless his courageous heart, accidentally stumbled into a marriage with no less than seven witches and two of their mothers by saving their lives because he tripped over his enormous manhood and bumped into a Death Eater. This redirected the Fiendfyre into his companions while stopping the raid. Of course, everyone only saw the upsides, but Albus knew that a harem was something truly terrible. The paperwork involved required several tons of forms, the running costs of the steam bath were outrageous and all the peeled grapes were a sure way into bankruptcy. And now he had to find a room to accommodate the newly minted Lord and his retinue since the old harem room was currently used by the merfolk's cross-species breeding project. How was he supposed to explain that mess to the Board of Gouverneur?

Please, no m/m main pairing and preferably Ron/Hermione or Hermione/"any male Slytherin" in the background.


** It's not as bluntly crackfic as the second sample but I recommend the Where in the World is Harry Potter trilogy linkffn(2354771)

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] has easily the greatest and most original Dumbledore plan I've ever seen. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a serious fic or not but it has one of the funniest first chapters I have ever read. Pretty sure there was a lot about weird situations, like him time-turnering so that his girlfriend can possess his second body and pretend that she's alive in front of the wizamgot (or however it's spelled).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi is that a Baby]] definitely does this. tl;dr Naruto crossover that embraces how ridiculously stupid Naruto powers are and doesn't focus on the fighting bullshit. Also has one of the greatest Dumbledores ever (non-manipulative, just batshit).

*** In the vein of Itacji, is that a baby, is Harry Potter and the Sun Source linkffn(4532363). Harry is a mix of a ridiculously OP martial artist and pretty gullible. It's well written and humorous.

#+begin_quote
  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with
