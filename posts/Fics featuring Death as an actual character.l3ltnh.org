Bonus points for Harry/Death relationship, and anything with Death from The Sandman.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** None of these are Sandman-style Deaths.

/On a Pale Horse/ is a fun crack fic with an ancient Harry-turned-Death summoned by the Order to defeat Voldemort. He and the human/canon Harry become very close (but not in a sexual way). linkao3(8446057)

/Death and the Boy/ is a lovely fic with Harry turning into Death upon reuniting the Hallows. Features him being Death and 'raising' the scarcrux-turned-little-boy. linkao3(1115380)

Quine's /The Master of Death/ is one I've enjoyed, though the details are fuzzy and I need to reread it. It's a WIP with a Harry/Death relationship. linkao3(17672156)

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.CURRENTLY EDITING/REWRITING

#+begin_quote
  When Harry goes back to Hogwarts for a so-called Eighth Year, he's told by McGonagall that he has to share a room with Draco and that they had better both behave or else they'd *both* be expelled. Rather than grumble, both try to make the best of the situation with Draco providing (non-sexual) comfort each night when Harry has nightmares. Slowly, Harry grows ever more confused about the gorgeous Slytherin.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

  My own response to Reptilia28's challenge. Harry died in the battle with Voldemort. What happens when he meets the Grim Reaper? Especially when the Reaper isn't happy with him. Rating changed to more appropriate one. HHr. Other pairings as they come.

  When the bargain was made, the odds were stacked against them. That was nothing new to Snape and Potter. But when even Death gives them a snowball's chance of surviving, can they succeed? EWE HP/SS

  Harry and Hermione get back together after several years apart, even though he's now the "Master of Death". She'd been removed from Hogwarts by her parents after second year. He takes her to the castle where he now teaches to meet his friend for tea. One shot minor crossover with Discworld.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
