A fanfic reader ends up in the HP world, plans to become super powerful by learning wandless magic, occlumency, legilimency, becoming an animagus, etc, etc but then it turns out that just the normal Hogwarts curriculum is already difficult enough, and trying to learn any advanced skills is basically impossible for him.


** I want this, but not as comedy. I want it a slow burn epic.

A Moral: competence with many advanced spells is less valuable than mastery of a few basic spells applied with versatility.

*** I get the sense that this is what Taure is trying to do with Victoria Potter. She's a bit of a prodigy and then something goes wrong and her cockiness blows up in her face and forces her to learn and grow.

But it's only second year at this point so if we get to that fall it'll probably be a while.

*** Um, no? In canon, none of the main cast were particularly ambitious or power-hungry, except /maybe/ for Hermione if you squint your eyes hard. OP is asking for an explicit juxtaposition of a protagonist that actually /wants/ power but finds it difficult to achieve. Something like one of those crack-ish one-shots where arrogant fanon!Harry gets owned by canon!Dumbledore, or whatever.

**** Their description said trying to learn powerful magic. Outside of the Patronus charm, every time Harry tried that in cannon, he failed. So sounded like they were asking for that.

To each their own, obviously. I just assumed that most people probably don't write fics like that, because people don't usually want to read that. People go into Fanfic to get away from their MCs getting shit on by the world.

OP isn't gonna find a story like that on this forum, is my best guess. It sounds exactly like cannon, or a story that'll be so far down in the rankings, that it'll be impossible to find.

***** He doesn't really seem to give much of an effort to learn magic outside the curriculum besides, as you said, the Patronus charm. Most of the more powerful spells he uses or attempts to use seem to be just from observing other people using them, or otherwise using them on the fly.

As far as we know, he never practiced his use of the Unforgivables before trying them for real, with mixed success. Episkey and Sectumsempura were likewise used without prior practice, while both succeeded. Besides that, his most-used spells are just stunning, disarming, shielding, and summoning, which are all standard to learn.

Overall, Harry gives off the impression of someone who is fairly talented, shown by his ability to succeed with new spells out of hand and get above-average grades without much studying, but does not apply themselves very much. The closest we get otherwise is his failure in learning Occlumency, though it's arguable that his instruction in it was sabotaged

***** Nah the main difference is that OP wants a fanfic reader to end up in the HP world think magic is easy and can be super powerful just to find out that it's a lot harder than they think.

***** Well to be fair if you don't change canon by much with addition of some limiters any half-competent person that knows the series better than average would abuse the beejesus out of even the most innocent canon spells and spellcasting mechanics of the normal curriculum.

And since canon indicates that magic power level == IQ or at least mental fortitude anyone older than 11 thrust upon the magical world should fare at least reasonably well - unless you want your protagonist to be dumb on purpose, but that wouldn't be very interesting now, would it?

Aside from that, HP isn't well suited to SI fics - prior knowledge makes most of the plot redundant unless you purposefully have MC not give a shit, screw something up or act like a moron.

And yet, they're ridiculously fun. Not literary works of the ages, but they make fantastic mental popcorn.

******* Oh sure, but I can't think of there being a possibility of making a serious fic in that manner. Do you have any recs for si's? I've only seen like two decent ones.

******** No, I generally search on the tag or go by recs when I'm in a particularly scatty mood. My criterion is 'fun' rather than 'good', although there are more than you'd think with reasonably grammar and spelling and so on.

There's a surprising number of 'wakes up and is Gilderoy Lockhart' ones. Half a dozen or so, but still, you'd think you'd only see it once.
