Are there any fics which don't pair Arwen with Aragorn, but instead pair her with Harry?

Bonus points for throwing Éowyn into the mix. ;)

*** Please work. Anyways, this only stared but I think it's going for this. Arwen reminds Harry of someone he's lookin for.

  Eternal Wanderer, Lonely Traveler, Chained Sage, and Master of Death. He was known by these and many more names in several worlds, though he found no solace in any name or world. Hallowed in blood, forged in war and baptised in loss, Harry Potter has run far away from the world that birthed him. He traces a path through infinity, intent on reclaiming that which was lost.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.
