Anything is fine as long as the story is good and enjoyable. The story just has to be completed because i'm tired of waiting for an update. I would love some AUs.


** I have a long one, more than 230 chapters, but it isn't complete.

** The Wise One series is really long and well-written. I'll link the first book. It's an AU where Sirius steals Harry away pre-Hogwarts. The three books total to around 500k words.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is a fic I'm still writing, but the update speed is fast and that should most likely work for you.

It is an AU where basically Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't become Lord Voldemort after school, and chose a slightly different approach - with the end result that when he applied for the post of the DADA Professor, Dumbledore was happy to accept him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, Minerva is Headmistress, Tom is Deputy Headmaster and Harry is beginning his first year at Hogwarts.

Do let me know how you find it!

  Harry had heard tales of the great Dumbledore and the living legend Tom Riddle, but Dumbledore had passed away before Harry entered Hogwarts. Follow Harry's journey through Hogwarts with the mysterious and enigmatic Professor Riddle. AU based on what could have happened if Dumbledore had not declined Tom the post of the DADA professor.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I'm a big fan of Linkao3(Falling Through Time) it's over 353k but doesn't feel that way at all. It's an accidental time traveling story with a shorter “jump” than most stories and just completed at the end of February.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) is also complete and more than 356k - this one started out with a pretty cracky premise but ended up completely blowing me away with the writing and ability to make me care about characters I never gave much though to before. It's a little odd in that Gordon Ramsey is a “character” and I make it a rule to not read “real people” fic but this is so out there that it's basically an OC with a familiar name.
