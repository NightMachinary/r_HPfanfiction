I just devoured that in about 2 days and I need more! Any good fics with a similar feel to it? I prefer anything with a female main character, OC or Canon.

‚Äã

Thank you!!


** I haven't read that one, admittedly, so I'm not sure if I'm hitting the right vibe with these rec, but here are two with strong female OCs as the MCs that I really love! Both WIPs that are regularly updated.

A tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love, this is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament. Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France, the three heirs of Slytherin look to find their way in a changing world while remaining true to their hearts and keeping favor with Britain's most powerful man, Septimus Malfoy.

********** Haha! Ok I have consulted my list, and here are The Snapes! In no particular order.

First, here is a shorty one-shot, which actually fits into your female OC main request!

Alexis is a muggle who lives across the street from Severus Snape. (Chronicles their relationship throughout twenty years) Warning: Slight domestic abuse

‚Äã

Ok so this is my delightful friend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8598867/Animalium][Animalium]], who mainly focuses on Snape (her fave).

My fave of hers is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088244/1/Wormwood-and-Asphodel][Wormwood and Asphodel]]

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were. They rekindle a love they never thought possible amidst a war that threatens to tear them apart.

But her profile is just full of awesome Snilys! She is currently working on this 1st person Sev POV which is doing an amazing exploration of chronic pain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13284124/1/Chronic][Chronic]]

Severus made a grave mistake by joining Lord Voldemort and he paid for it with his body. Lily lost the man she loved to the war, James Potter. With both of them missing pieces of their lives they find themselves relying on each other. Chronic illnesses, sick!Severus

Here is another absolutely glorious one (if you don't mind James/Sirius bashing):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12437451/1/Veritas-Omnia-Vincit][Veritas Omnia Vincit]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/555858/Heatherlly][Heatherlly]]

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

She also has a Sevmione which is also really good, and another Snily I haven't read yet, but it is on my short list. She is an awesome writer!

‚Äã

Here is the Snape/Ginny I mentioned for easy access :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906606/1/A-Second-Chance-For-Happiness][A Second Chance For Happiness]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2237626/original-star-girl-78][original-star-girl-78]]

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

‚Äã

Here is another Snily --- I just started it and I'm only 8 chapters in, but so far it is INSANELY good! The writing is amazing.. like poetry. Stargirl (who wrote speaking in tongues) recommended it to me, so I was like yes please!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle][Puzzle]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/531023/we-built-the-shadows-here][we-built-the-shadows-here]]

Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world by ruled the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James. COMPLETE

Ok this one is a little different and Sev is in-character about I would say half the time, but it is bloody hilarious. Also full of lemons. :P

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13175009/1/Of-Blacks-and-Boarhounds][Of Blacks and Boarhounds]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10381342/Zorak23][Zorak23]]

An American muggle from the year 2022 ends up in a pub in England in 1992, and meets Severus Snape. Somehow she knows everything about him, and he is determined to find out why.

‚Äã

And have you read The Changeling??? Snape is Ginny's mentor in that, and she's a strong female OC! :) It's like my favorite fanfic ever, and it has 3 sequels! (The gift that keeps on giving).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]]

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

‚Äã

OK! If you actually read all these, I think they may well keep you occupied for several weeks! lol.

But what the heck, I'll give you mine too cause it has one Snape chapter and I have no self control! XD

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

‚Äã

Ok I am out of Snapes that I have personally read and remember fondly... though if you would like, Animalium can supply you with many more. She keeps going on about something called "The Long Road Home" and something called "The Snape Chronicles" or some such, and supposedly they are both amazing but they're long so I haven't gotten to them yet. I can ask her for links if you'd like though! I think they are all on FFN.

This is set during Hogwarts Mystery time if you're not opposed to that (playing the game not needed to follow), and it's halfway through being a full 7 year fanfic. It's lovely, has a strong female lead, and Snape features in it quite a bit as her mentor! I've actually been betaing in from somewhere in the beginning of year 4, I can't believe I forgot about it! xD

Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob. With everyone thinking she's cursed too and the foul Merula Snyde willing to make her life at Hogwarts a living hell, can she survive school, find the Cursed Vaults and find out what happened to her brother?

** Boy, do I have a list for you! I haven't read Coven either unfortunately, but I'm a huge Snape nerd. It's nearly all I read and write about. These are Snily and OC except for one Snarcissus. Hopefully you'll find something you like.

1st favorite: A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles

We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view. (Paired with an OC, but that storyline is minor.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]]

2nd favorite: The Long Road Home -- Snily Voldemort chooses Neville but the Potters do not escape unscathed. Five years later, Lily Potter walks back into Severus Snape's life. Things are about to get complicated. AU Severus/Lily. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]]

3rd favorite: Too Deep for the Healing -- OC

This story begins where Snape's story ends in canon: In the Shrieking Shack. Severus Snape survives the war - but which Snape? Who is he in the new circumstances? Some things will never be the same again. Other things, however, do not change so easily.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7068580/1/Too-Deep-for-the-Healing]]

Miles to Go Before I sleep -- Snape/OC This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8090116/1/Miles-to-Go-Before-I-Sleep]]

Severus Snape and the Art of War -- Snily After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222016/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-Art-of-War]]

If Someone Cared Enough -- Snily What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12481024/1/If-Someone-Cared-Enough]]

Who We Are -- OC, one shot

Alexis is a muggle who lives across the street from Severus Snape. (Chronicles their relationship throughout twenty years) Warning: Slight domestic abuse

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13265883/1/Who-We-Are]]

Cauldrons and Lilies -- Snily

"This train will take you where you have to be. Severus, listen to me, this is a rare occasion." Albus held his shoulders and he realized he was shorter than the headmaster. That couldn't be, he'd been taller than Albus ever since he was nineteen and finally stopped growing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10137876/1/Cauldrons-and-Lilies]]

Veritas Omnia Vincit

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12437451/1/Veritas-Omnia-Vincit]]

Puzzle

Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world by ruled the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]]

My own stories, available on AO3 as well:

Wormwood and Asphodel - Snily

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were. They rekindle a love they never thought possible amidst a war that threatens to tear them apart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088244/1/Wormwood-and-Asphodel]]

Chronic -- Snily

Severus made a grave mistake by joining Lord Voldemort and he paid for it with his body. Lily lost the man she loved to the war, James Potter. With both of them missing pieces of their lives they find themselves relying on each other. Chronic illnesses, sick!Severus. Rewritten version of Missing Pieces

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13284124/1/Chronic]]

Missing Pieces -- Snily

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12969696/1/Missing-Pieces]]

Eagles and Serpents -- Snily and OC (OC is told in flashbacks)

Having made mistakes when he was younger, Severus now lives in Basilnell with his young daughter. Life in the Snape home is seemingly normal despite the war raging outside until a known death eater - Lily Evans - knocks on their door and foretells of a danger that's coming to get them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13281424/1/Eagles-and-Serpents]]

For the Guilty - OC

Nagini had failed to take his life in the shack. By some miracle, Severus had survived, only to be faced with another trial, another dark wizard. The problem this time, is not everything is what it appears to be. Originally posted as "New Beginnings"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13272754/1/For-the-Guilty]]

Coming Back to You -- Snily

An unexpected reappearance topples everything Severus thought he know about the events of Lord Voldemort's defeat. Everything is put at risk, his position beneath the Dark Lord, his career within the school, and perhaps most importantly, his relationship with Harry Potter. Events in this fic are canon until Goblet of fire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13218938/1/Coming-Back-to-You]]

Potions and Perennials -- Snape/Narcissa

Severus' life is filled with obligations: serving Lord Voldemort, protecting Harry Potter, fighting for the light, and now -- most recently -- watching over Draco Malfoy. Acting as a soldier for opposing sides of war, he has to fight for those he loves most and hope there's enough time to save himself in the process.
