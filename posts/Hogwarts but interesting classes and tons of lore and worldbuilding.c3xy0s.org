I love Hogwarts but I think there could be so many more interesting electives or classes or the same regular classes but interesting new information! This could also go along the lines of a different magical school that takes the center instead of hogwarts, like Durmstrang in the fic Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. Dark Arts class, alchemy, astral projection, mind magic, any new sort of interesting branch of Magic!

** I have a full curriculum document I put together for a post-canon story, with 16 subjects that have all 7 years worth of syllabus'. I'll upload it and link it here for you when I get onto a PC. Unfortunately, no actual story to go with it, but anyone is free to use my curriculum for their own purposes.

*** Here it is. Full curriculum for 7 Years at Hogwarts, with a simplified and more detailed syllabus for each subject as well as the rules on what subjects are taken when and how many. It also has some even more detailed stuff as examples of the work for various subjects - a full list of Charms taught, a partial list of Potions brewed, an explanation of the X Classification system used in the Care of Magical Creatures OWL and NEWT, a breakdown of both Warding and Ward Breaking as taught in the new Warding NEWT, and an example of an essay that would be handed in by a 5th Year History of Magic OWL student.

****** Although actually I'll be using it for a different magic school - in Canada. So not all subjects the same, but it's still awesome. Actually inspired me to go back to writing an old one that previously only had like 2 pages that was set up to be a "Harry goes to a different school" scenario.

***** Eh, skip to chapter 3. Then read. If people say a fic is really good, and I hate the start, that's what I try. If it still isn't interesting, then I drop it.

That being said, I remember that story having a confusing and slow start, but it was excellent in the end.
