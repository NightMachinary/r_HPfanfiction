  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

  Harry, after being saved by a mysterious stranger, is flung fifty years into the past, where he resolves to save the future by killing a 10-year-old Tom Riddle. He ends up raising him, instead. But when young Tom develops an unhealthy fixation on his new guardian, things quickly spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself entangled in a deadly game. Will history repeat itself?

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

Delenda Est by Lord Silvere where Harry returns to the Marauders Era and meets a young Bellatrix before she gets married or joins the Deatheaters.

  After Dumbledore's death, Harry Potter causes a magical accident that leaves him stranded in 1944. Positives: The Potters want a child as much as he wants a family. Negatives: Between Harry's luck and Tom Riddle's tendency to make catastrophic decisions without knowing all of the possible side effects, their relationship is a disaster waiting to happen. But they make it work. Mostly. Moral of the story is, Harry should probably have told Tom no when he suggested making their wedding vows in Parseltongue.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** If you don't mind crossover with Stargate: SG1, I'd recommend linkffn(Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg) - it's not a lot of high drama, just a fun, lighthearted story. Like most of mjimeyg's fics, it's very fix-fic-y and has an OP Harry, but for me at least it doesn't make things /too/ easy on the good guys. Also, like I said, it's lighthearted with lots of silliness and other comedy.

** Face Death In The Hope is very long and is in the running for my favorite HP fic of all time (if the pairing turns you off, nothing even hinting at that pairing has happened for the entire fic linkao3(5986366)

 

And it has a 49k word outside PoV companion fic linkao3(15107627)

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúIt's a really long story,‚Äù he says finally, almost apologetically, ‚Äúand it's really hard to believe.‚Äù‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** You mentioned disliking the two main Harry pairings... What about Severus/Lily? Bearing in mind that it's a time travel fic, as you say, so Severus has had decades to reflect on his mistakes and really does try to do better (and his plotting with Dumbledore to bring the war to a faster end is quite an interesting subplot). But he's still irritable and introverted, and his devotion to Lily is genuine and heartfelt, but also obsessive in her absence, leading to codependency when she's present again and arguably overprotectiveness (he does actually have good reasons for not wanting her to put herself at risk, but he doesn't present them well or sensitively). Having her back in his life, though, he's still happier than he has ever been, and it gradually softens him. And choosing him is a harder road for Lily than James Potter would have been; James is easy-going and friendly and never needs to worry about money, while Severus is penniless and withdrawn and rather emotionally stunted. But she sees great potential in him, and she knows that she has his unshakable loyalty; that counts for a lot.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is not yet finished, but is regularly updating, long, and probably not far off completion.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  Yr 2: Harry has returned in time after one too many things went wrong, his careful plans have been messed up, so he's trying a few new things. He's searching for the diary, but while things are similar, his presence has altered enough to keep him on his toes! No pairings. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 2nd in series. Rated M because I'm paranoid. Everything belongs to Jo!

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!
