** I bring comedies!

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] is one of my favorite ensemble comedies, where the next gen crowd run a radio show. Abandoned, though.

#+begin_quote
  This is Fred Weasley, and you're listening to The Morning Waffle, where we talk about absolutely everything and absolutely nothing. Apparently it isn't enough that I have the highest ratings on the network -- now we have to do this blasted competition to make sure Stan Boringsworth doesn't steal my air time. Raj got us into this, and by Merlin, I'm going to get us out!

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=269039][Raining]] is one of the few romcoms I like; much more of a drama than the others.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter and Amelie Harris had never had the most conventional of relationships. It may sound perfect - the best friends who finally discover they have feelings for each other - but there were plenty of obstacles along the way, including serial-divorcee mothers, jealous Quidditch players, a cat called Gwenog and a lot of rain.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=300442][The Horror!]] in which James tries to conquer love and the Gryffindor girls' staircase. If you like literary references in your fic.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter is taking a journey into the heart of darkness. Which happens to be the seventh-year Gryffindor girls' dormitory. And, maybe, possibly, a certain seventh-year Gryffindor girl's heart.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=298137][The Heartache Squadron]], another ensemble in the vein of /John Tucker Must Die/.

#+begin_quote
  Daphne was the woman scorned. Gloria had been patient long enough. Gemma had wanted her final revenge. Pippa had been his unseen minion for ages. And Josie was just there for the tea. The downfall of James Potter was the undertaking of a century.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=291065][Love, Damned Love, and Statistics]], my dumb entrepreneurial James II short set before Yule Ball.

#+begin_quote
  James is writing the book on love. Naturally, it's the peak time for irony.

** Eh... I dislike most next-gen as it tends to have Ron-Hermione as an accepted pairing. The few next-gen fics that I like mix up those pairings anyway, like linkffn(the triwizard tournament by cleotheo) but those are by far in the minority and hard to find.

  Twenty years after the war and Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Tournament. As the tournament begins Harry is surprised and pleased to discover that his old friend Hermione will be present at the tournament. What's not as welcome to Harry is the identity of one of the rival champions,Scorpius Malfoy,and his blossoming friendships with his children.
