hey, I've been trying for hours now to find this ao3 Harry /Severus story where Harry drinks a potion made by Severus to travel back in time to fix things. He goes back and adopts past Harry and starts living with younger Severus and has a relationship later on. It's slow cause with the older Severus there was too much history to do anything. Oh and he has older Severus journals for the younger on to read. If anyone can helP
