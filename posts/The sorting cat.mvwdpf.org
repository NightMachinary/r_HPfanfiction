I misread something on another post and it went into my head.

Nothing's changed, it still sings, first years still have to put it on their head, it's just a cat instead of a hat.

An immortal black cat. That sings and sorts students by sitting on their head. With the wisdom of ages, and the sass of a cat, Sebastian, or Sea-bass, snarks students towards their appropriate tables.

How is the cat so long lived? It's never addressed and everyone is extremely skeptical it's actually a cat but they don't want to push it because they have a good thing going.

Sea-bass and Fawkes have a rivalry egged on by Peeves, and the bloody baron is afraid of the cat.

Prefects have to let the cat back in, no mention is ever made of how it gets out. People do ask about this one, but every hypothesis is shown to be false.

Muggleborn are warned not to call the cat Salem, and those who do seldom make a second attempt.

These are just ideas for how I imagining this going, take them or leave them, the important thing is that while a talking, mind reading hat is magical, it's boring. It's a magical world, they can do anything they want - why /not/ have a cat sort the students?

I guess this idea stems from being frustrated that the magical world isn't nearly as magical as it should be. It's all utilitarian, limited, unimaginative.

Some say a culture is best represented by it's art - the most interesting pieces of work mentioned is the painting of what's his name getting trolls to dance. Everything else is either paintings of spells, spell effects, or portraits. The art of the magical world is effectively navel gazing at it's worst.

I'd like to see a magical world where there's paintings of cats in space playing dodgeball. Where there's a mysterious immortal cat sorting students since well before hogwarts was founded, and everyone can't quite figure out how that's possible. Where the troll that breaks in challenged hermione to a breakdancing contest in the grand tradition of that one dude.

There's a lot of stories where magic is put in this box of what it can and cannot do. This post is to encourage authors to take it out of the box. Some things can't be explained - that's fine. They don't have to be plot relevant. They can just be in the background making the magical world that much more magical.

Thank you for your time, sorry for the rambling.

** u/daniboyi:
#+begin_quote
  why /not/ have a cat sort the students?
#+end_quote

Because it will just sit and meow at the great hall doors, and when someone lets it out, it will sit outside and meow to be let back inside.

Also, I just imagine McGonagall placing the cat on a student's head and it falls asleep and everyone is forced to sit there and wait because the student is not willing to move and wake up the cat.

** "Meow!" Announced the Cat, sat on the young Hermione Granger's head. "But which house is Meow? I thought the houses were Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff" Complained Hermione.

"Detention for Racism Miss Granger. The Cat clearly said Gryffindor, now sit at the table" hissed McGonagall.

*** I'm not sure which idea I like more:

McGonagall translating as the only one that speaks cat (and sometimes willfully mistranslating for a student she wants/doesn't want).

Or

The cat legitimately just meowing, and the students reaction being what determines their house.

** The cat is Bastet, who took the job because she was bored of all the typical drama seen between and in various pantheons.

"Did you hear that Aphrodite was caught sleeping with Anubis?"

Bast sighed, and she gave Astarte a flat, unimpressed look. "I don't care."

"Oh, lighten up, Basty!" She wrapped her arm around Bastet, hugging her. "We need to alleviate the boredom somehow!"

"...That's it, I'm taking that job over in Britain. The cries of a thousand children every year for ten centuries is better than listening to divine gossip and drama. What are we, New Jersey Americans?""

--

Bastet looked up at Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived's, owl with surprise. "Meow?"

Athena looked down and barked in an understanding tone. There was no doubt in Bastet's mind that it was "fucking Olympians".

She could relate.

*** Seeing as how it's DEFINITELY happened before, they have a plan for the unsorted students to be housed in the Unsorted dorm.

Even better if the sorting cat sorts a few students before getting bored and wandering off. The other students randomly get sorted throughout the first term, when cat comes up, rubs on their leg, and then meows.
