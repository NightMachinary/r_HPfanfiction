:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I've been searching for a fic I read ages ago - I remember a lot of details about it, yet can not seem to locate it. I don't recall the title. I'll list what I remember below:

- Harry defeats Voldemort, then Molly accuses him of getting her family killed and that he should just leave. Harry accepts this as he feels guilty and apparates to America somehow.

- He studies at some school or academy to become a Knight or something similar. Gets a sword, becomes a badass.

- He returns to Britain after 5 years. Arthur is Minister.

- Ginny plays quidditch professionally and Harry attends a game. There's a terrorist attack and he uses magic through his sword to hold up the collapsing portions of the stadium. Severely injures himself.

- Story branches into plots about demons coming from Hell, they attack the Burrow and decimate it. Harry gets injured (again).

- On recovering, one of Harry's colleagues/fellow knights tells a story of how Harry always needs a sword on him after a horrifying experience in Brazil involving possession and cults.

- Harry has a good relationship with Fleur, who is constantly trying to set him up with Gabrielle. This makes Ginny very envious and the two compete for his attention.

Hopefully someone knows where to find this fic, or knows what happened to it. Thanks!
