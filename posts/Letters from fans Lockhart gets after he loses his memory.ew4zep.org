*** Dear mister "I'm too good to floo or owl my fans", this'll be the last parchment I ever send your ass.

It's been six months, and still no word--I don't deserve it?

I know you got my last two letters, I gave the owl coordinates perfect.

So this is my last howler I'm sendin you, I hope you hear it.

I'm on a Nimbus now, doin Wronskis over Atlantic waves

Hey, Gil, I just trysted with a Siren, dare me to fly?

You know that book by Beetle, "Tales of the Bard"?

About the guy who coulda saved his brothers from their end

But didn't, and had to live and greet death as a friend?

That's kinda how this is; you coulda hid me from panic

Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand pepper-ups now--I'm manic

And all I wanted was a lousy floo call--say "hi, buddy!"

I hope you know I chucked all your books out my study

I loved you, Gil, we coulda been together--think about it!

You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it

I hope your conscience eats at you and you take Dreamless Sleep about me

See, Gill--shut up, witch, I'm tryin' to talk!

Hey, Gil, that's my girlfriend shrunk there in the trunk

But I didn't Avada her, just incarcerous--See? I ain't like you

Cause if they eat her soul she'll suffer more and then she'll die too

Well, gotta go, I'm almost at Azkaban now

Oh, shit, I forgot... how am I supposed to charm this shit out?

**** His fans are even attempting to be poets. This is just not fair. But thanks for this short piece full of giggles.

** That could be a really fun short - especially if it ended with him becoming the Hero everyone believed he always was. Maybe a "Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East." moment where he swoops in to help the trio out and they're utterly disbelieving at the fop actually being competent and heroic (like, Lawful Stupid Paladin levels of Heroic).
