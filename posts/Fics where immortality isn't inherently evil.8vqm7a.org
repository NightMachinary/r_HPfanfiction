** It's worth pointing out that Immortality isn't portrayed as evil in canon. Nicolas Flamel isn't thought of as evil because he created a philosopher's stone, in the same way that had Riddle accomplished that he would not have been considered evil for doing so. Riddle's evil comes from the actions he takes to achieve immortality, not the pursuit itself.

*** Initially, I would say yes. BUT the overarching theme of the last book (among others) is that what makes Harry superior to Voldemort is that he accepts death whereas Voldemort cannot. Even in PS, Dumbledore says Flamel destroyed the stone so that he could 'go on to the next great adventure.' While immortaility is not stated as bad, Dumbledore repeatedly reiterates that accepting death is better and that the fear of death is something almost disdainful.

**** You're assuming that the only reason to be immortal is fear of death. You're right that fear of death is generally discouraged in canon, but immortality for the right reasons and through the right actions isn't viewed in a negative light.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is the obvious one. As to me, though, I fully agree with anti-deathism in real life, but I don't think it's altogether very applicable to the /HP/ world, since there's no real "death" in the Potterverse save a Dementor's Kiss. Not having your lifetime limited by dumb accidents or an arbitrary 200-hundred-years limited would be /nice/, but it's not as direly needed as it would be in the real world.

***** It does sort of make me wonder what /other/ means of immortality may exist now.

On the one hand, the Philosophers Stone is the only mentioned method besides Horcruxes (and that seems to just be you make a new body for your anchored soul). On the other hand, Dumbledore seems to have not immediately realized how Voldemort may have survived. Perhaps this is an indication that Horcruxes are not the only feasible method to extend or even protect your life.

Doubtful though. I think Rowling may have realized that if you have a lot of different methods of immortality, it makes Voldemort and his Horcruxes look less /special/ in the wizarding world.

****** I think that the key difference is between longevity and resurrection. Staving off death by old age is /relatively/ trivial, though the Philosopher's Stone is much more reliable and easy to use than Human Transfiguration and other types of Healing. Surviving the complete destruction of your body through violent causes, on the other hand, now that is something else entirely, something only the Horcruxes can offer.

****** Dumbledore not realizing how Voldemort survived doesn't indicate that there are other methods of immortality. Voldemort was a genius. Dumbledore probably thought he did something that hadn't been done before to become survive. This is exactly what Voldemort did, as I doubt anyone else managed or wanted to make more than one horcrux before.

********** It's not really vague. In many ways, curtains laws in magic are partially moral in nature (notice how gross moral violations in magic allow for some of the most extreme effects, e.g. Killing Curse, Voldemort lacking all empathy due to being the product of faked love and rape, Horcruxes and the sacrificial protection). But if you wanted to make it science-y, you could say something like: The danger of a piece of magic is directly proportional to its danger index.

*********** I'm just saying, it's not concrete. What's the essence of self? what kind of consequences? how does whoever wrote that law know that, what did they observe to be able to come to that conclusion? Were they just inspired by magic to pen that down? I doubt it, so what's behind it?

It's stuff to explore.

************ The essence of self is the soul. You're right, its not exactly concrete, the consequences tend to be symbolic. E.g. creating a Horcrux, an attempt to permanently lock oneself to the plane of the living, will in death result in being permanently locked out of every other plane (no heaven, no hell, can't even send a ghost back). Or take Voldemort. His birth was caused by someone wanting to force another to love them, only to result in a child completely unable to love. Observed incidents for the law could, for example, have been issues with time travel resulting in horrifying consequences. We know time travel experiments were outlawed in 1899 in HP for this reason.

************* yeah I definitely agree that that's how it probably works in the books. I just feel like there's an opening there for fleshing those concepts out in fanfiction.

I mean even in the Books none of what you're saying is ever explicitly stated, but it does work out that way. There's a nice symbolism there but it also makes me wish that there were more "realistic", for lack of a better word, ways for things to play out. That's one of the things I particularly love seeing explored in fanfiction.

** If you think about it, the uniting factor among all humans is that we like to solve problems, and problems are really just that which is on our mind and bothers us. Death is definitely a problem to be fixed, all it takes is a little change of perspective to no longer see it as a necessary part of our being.

The only fic which really did this is HPMOR. If you're into this, read that. It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it to the fullest I think, and I happen to be that kind of person, but not everyone is. Your OP makes me think you'd be able to enjoy it though, so I recommend giving it a try.

Other than that, the only other fic which contains the struggle for immortality that I've read is linkffn(The Girl Who Loved). It's an integral part of the story but not explored philosophically at all, which is honestly almost more refreshing than the deeply emotional and longing way in which HPMOR approaches it.

*** I've previously read and deeply enjoyed HPMOR. I think most people brush off the whole Patronus thing as fanfiction nonsense, but for those that were into the philosophy, I think that was one of the most memorable and powerful parts of the book.

I loved the emotional and longing nature of HPMOR. I think it explores the plight of our species accurately. Immortality /is/ something to deeply and emotionally long for, as death is the greatest travesty in the history of humanity - the tone fits.

I've never heard of Sailor Moon or Ranma. Will that second fic still make sense?

On another note, as I become older, I'm starting to realize that we probably won't gain public support fast enough to make advances in anti-aging/synthetic representations of the brain in my lifetime. Just finished college, but the future is looking pretty grim. And I'm too lazy to get off my ass and go to a cryonics firm ;-/

**** That patronus was probably my favourite part about that fic too. I'd never thought about it before reading this fic but the way this fic played our pretty much single-handedly formed my opinion on the subject.

I'd never heard about Sailor Moon or Ranma either, didn't bother me at all. It actually added to the appeal because the new element made the world more wide and novel. It's also pretty self explanatory, though I suppose I wouldn't actually know if I missed anything of importance.

The whole death thing for me has been a bit of a topic of interest as well over the last couple of years. I notice it doesn't exactly bother me anymore. The reason I'm interested in the idea of a deathless humanity is the absolutely vast and beautiful potential it has for the growth of our species. I've also never quite been able to point out what about my existance is unique to me, and seeing as even the thoughts we express and exchange right now are not ours alone, but those of whoever reads them or has explored them in the past, and seeing as how many ideas or visions worth striving for have found their way to becoming reality throughout our history anyway, I'm not that scared about the notion of not me but somebody quite like me living in that future we're beginning to envision. Like I said, I'm more interested in seeing to it that these seeds of ideas we're planting right now have room to grow, I feel like that is something that our effort is well-spent on.
