** So, you're basically looking for the story The Aurors by FloreatCastellum. Theia Higgle, a young trainee auror, is partnered with veteran Auror Harry Potter, and realizes how dark and gritty the actual job of being an Auror is. It's an incredible story that is basically word for word what you're looking for.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

**** Have you watched /The Recruit/? Opinions differ on its quality, but I think it would be strong scaffolding material for an idea like this. /Training Day/ evokes more of a MLE Patrol/Intoxicating Substances Division vibe for me.
