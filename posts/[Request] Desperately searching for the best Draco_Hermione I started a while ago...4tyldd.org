** Have you tried asking at [[https://dramioneasks.tumblr.com][dramioneasks]]? If the mods don't know it (and they generally do), they'll put it to the general D/Hr community on tumblr. In my experience, they're pretty good at tracking these things down.

EDIT: OP, if you haven't used dramioneasks before, just go to [[https://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/ask][their ask page]] and type in the same request that you put here. You can also try searching for key words on [[http://dramioneficindex.tumblr.com][the fic index]]. There's a couple thousand d/hr fics listed out there alphabetically with themes, locations, and summaries, so if you remember any pertinent themes or anything about the summary, that might be the place to go.
