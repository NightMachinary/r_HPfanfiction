basically I remember that the Dirsley's house is attacked but the story told to others is that it burnt down. Harry is sent to stay with Snape and Draco in a town under its own private wards that keep it safe. Snape has him work for a squib doing chores for her business. Harry becomes a popular kid in the town and saves a vampire girl in an attack. I can't remember if it's finished or not but it was a cool story and I cannot find it.
