:END:
What's that fic where Harry comes into has creature inheritance and he ends up with, like, bat wings and he leaves Privet Drive and goes to an inn in Knockturn Alley? He meets a woman who gives him his kid that she had even though they had never met before. She then dies, like, as soon as Harry takes the kid. Turns out the kid is royalty of some kind and the women's parents are trying to track Harry and the kid down the entire time. Harry calls the little girl Mo and she drinks blood. All of this takes place either during the summer before his fifth year or the summer before his sixth year.

*** YES!! THIS!!! I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS NOW!!! THANK YOU!!! I have looked all over AO3, and I have tried looking on Fanfiction.net but I find that site really hard to navigate when looking for a specific story rather than just a general trope or prompt.
