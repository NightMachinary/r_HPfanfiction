:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a few that I have read and really enjoyed, such as Nightmare or Champion. The plotline is of course, accidental TT or reincarnation within a pureblood line, such as that Hermione goes back several years to her childhood (+ Marauder or Tom pairings, usually) whilst still retaining adult memories.

I keep re-reading the same few so looking for more recommendations within this trope.


** I don't have any for you but could you link your favourite one's? I'm really interested in TT Fanfics with Hermione but I haven't find any good Fanfics yet

*** I've mentioned a couple above, and I'm re-reading Have You Ever right now (Tomione).
