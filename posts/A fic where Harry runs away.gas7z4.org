*** Honestly I have no idea why I don't see this fic more often in a general crack recommendation thread.

It's brilliant, between Dumbledore being driven /firmly/ up the wall and Harry's increasingly ridiculous antics every time he manages to regain his freedom.

** Story: Dark Gold

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11412814/1/6]]

Summery:

At the tender age of four, Harry ran away when he realized the Dursley's would never love him like they loved Dudley. Hermione ran away when she began getting bullied, thinking her parents to deserve better. Ron ran away when his mother favored his sister over him. Three children on the run, thinking themselves worthless, stupid, little freaks... but the Trio are meant to be together. They shall travel the world, seeing and learning amazing things, unaware of how the Wizarding World was searching for them. In this world, they are still gold, but not entirely. Just a... darker gold. The Wizarding World is in for a shock... meet the Dark Gold Trio, my friends.

** RemindMe!

linkffn(The Hidden Hero) is the only one I can think of right now, though I know that there are quite a few roaming about. Not exactly running away, but more kicked out. I know that theres a popular one somewhere where he keeps running away and getting Vernon arrested but Dumbledore keeps altering his memories. I am at a complete loss in what the title was but it was a good crack.

I've just started reading it so no guarantee at all but Harry does escape from the Dursleys before Hogwarts (I don't know yet if he actually goes to Hogwarts at some point, though).

linkffn(9469775)

This is the all point of the fic. Harry escaping.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.
