So, Harry overheard that when he was in Borgin & Burkes near the start of Chamber of Secrets. And that Lucius Malfoy has some things that would 'embarrass' him if they were discovered, some of which are explicitly poisons. And he was going to an antiques shop that held more than a few cursed items in order to sell.

...I wonder what would happen if someone from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement took polyjuice and stood in for Mr. Borgin (willing swap or otherwise) when he went to Malfoy Manor?


** He would find the Malfoys have part of the back of the manor converted into a potions production facility that caused a pest infestation due to a combination of cheaping out on the initial setup and bad practice. It would be social suicide for the Malfoys if it were known that they turned over part of their own home to manufacturing, indicating they are too cash-strapped to keep the manor otherwise.

** Are there any fics where Harry tells Mr Weasley what he overheard and it gets acted upon?

**** I thought nothing came of it until after Christmas when they hear about the secret basement room from Draco?

(Sorry if I've forgotten something obvious, I've avoided handling my CoS copy too much for the last three or four years because it's falling apart from overreading)

***** I dunno, I might be misremembering something too. The Ministry raids Malfoy Manor the week before Christmas, then Harry and Ron use the Polyjuice on Christmas Day

****** Thanks for the clarification! In my original comment I meant the DMLE taking an interest immediately after Harry's eavesdropping at Borgin and Burkes, but I guess with the bureaucratic red tape Christmas is the earliest to be expected :')

  “Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.”

  “Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them.

  “No, he was selling --- ”

  “So he's worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. “Oh, I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something. ...”

**** Meh. That fic was just a lazy rehash of the first book, with two absolutely annoying OCs added
