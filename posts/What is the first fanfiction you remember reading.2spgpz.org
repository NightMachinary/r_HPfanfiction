That's right folks, we're taking a trip down memory lane! What fanfiction do you think as the first one you read.

Mine was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5706970/1/The-Girl-Who-Lived-Sort-of][The Girl Who Lived: Sort of]] by Leanora.

#+begin_quote
  The story of Harry Potter...the night of how he survived the killing curse is legendary. What they don't know was that he wasn't the only one who escaped that night. His younger sister lives on as well. What will happen when she is sorted into Slytherin?

Not an amazing one, but it still makes me smile when I read it.

  When an accident in Potions class turns Harry into Draco and Draco into Harry, each is trapped playing the part of the other. Romance, mistaken identities, really Cunning Plans, evil bake sales, a love triangle, and snogs galore.

****** In essence only. It's not quite as light-hearted as the summary would lead you to believe, and the two sequels drag on. I enjoyed it when I first read it but I was 14 then; I read it a second time a year ago and suffice to say I won't read it again. I can't say it's something I recommend and if it's body-swapping you're after I imagine there are numerous others that are better written (though I suspect a great deal of them focus on shipping the body-swapped parties with each other, which the Draco Trilogy doesn't).

Got me hooked on the whole thing and I do have to say that I have a weak spot for all fanfics that do similar things. "The Arithmancer" is such a fanfic.

In general I like fanfics that dissect the world even if it opens up plotholes in the original stories that I wasn't aware of yet.

I discovered ff.net about a year later when the author linked to the ff.net version of her fic. The story was called "Just Married, Kinda." It was this post-war H/G fic where they decide to elope right after the war, but when they come back they chicken out and tell the Weasleys they got engaged. It was basically, "Harry's really rich, and now Ginny is too. And they're both getting laid."

**** I wish there was a way to put together some kind of timeline of the trends. I was reading a really great oneshot from 2004 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1920286/1/The-Hero-of-Hogwarts][The Hero of Hogwarts]] if you're curious) and one of the most recent reviews mentioned that some bits were a bit cliche for HP FF. Well, it probably wasn't cliche a decade ago...

There's this thing called being "Seinfielded" were something "classic" (like a TV show) is copied and borrowed from so heavily that younger viewers watching the original for the first time see it as trite and predictable. I think this happens with fanfic too.

It's hard to judge because everyone has certain pairings and themes they tend to read, but I feel like there are trends in FF that kind of appear and then become trite/cliche. For example, it would be interesting to chart the number of fics that involve "marriage law" or "soul bonds."

I feel like there were a lot more fics where Harry somehow became dark or at least morally ambiguous (we've all read at least one "What if Harry shook Draco's hand?" fic). You still see them, but I've also read a lot of fics recently where Harry stays the same and /Voldemort/ is turned into someone more snarky/deadpan/human. Obviously there were humor fics with Voldemort in them, but the humor was generally more at Voldemort than with him (either "Harry makes Voldemort look like an asshole" or crack-y "Death Eaters have a potluck" stuff). Of course, I could be completely wrong here, but my impression is that Snarky!Voldemort has become more a trend recently.

** I think one of the first fics I read was on [[http://www.myfanfiction.de/][Myfanfiction.de]], a German fanfiction site... But I have no idea which one, the one with the earliest release date on my list is an old [[http://www.myfanfiction.de/texte/yu-gi-oh-gx/vom-schicksal-fuereinander-bestimmt.4208.html][Yu-Gi-Oh! GX fic]] from the start of 2007...

If this question is more of a "what is the first Harry Potter fanfiction you remember reading"... I honestly don't know anymore, but looking at my ffnet review history, the first HP story I ever reviewed was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2605530/1/][Acceptance?]] which is just a very humorous (slash) Oneshot I read around 2011. I've started with HP very late, since I mostly read Kingdom Hearts or Hetalia fanfictions before noticing the "gold mine" of Harry potter fanfictions.

** I remember reading some on mugglenet before discovering ffnet, but the first story I remember was called something along the lines of "Wilted Lily" or "Troubled Lily". Basically she was hated by everyone, had a bad home life, was considered "ugly" and bullied heavily by James until Sirius and the rest of the Marauders took her under their wing, became her friends and gave her a make-over. I must have been 14ish when I read it. I've tried to find it since, but it must have been taken down.

** The first I remember reading was Draco Malfoy, the Amazing Bouncing... Rat? by Maya (Draco/Hermione), the second being Underwater Light by Maya (Harry/Draco). Got the recommendations off of LiveJournal back in the day. Maya took all her work offline before publishing her first YA novel, and has since published quite a few really great YA books under her real name, Sarah Rees Brennan, but you can still find her work online in a few places. Here's a list of the titles of her fanfic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/603705/The-Complete-Works-of-Maya]]

**** You're missing out if you haven't read it. Barb was one of the first "big" writers in the early 2000s. Her trilogy had a huge following for the four or five years she wrote it, starting in 2001. She finished it off of ffnet following one of the many site reworks. She updated her profile in 2014 which tells me she's still around, even if she's not active in the places I frequent (ffnet and here, primarily) which is awesome considering she's well into her second decade as part of the community.

Markdeath is right though, the ending is a bit of a let down, but honestly it's like 10k words out of the ~1m+ so it's worth it.

Great trilogy imo, but hard to re-read nowadays.

** At the time I read it, I had no idea what it was called other than "a fabulous (and dirty) Drarry fanfic" because that was what the Word document my friend shared with me was titled. She'd copied it somewhere online. Later I went looking for it on Google and found it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6447869/1/E][E, by Tikikeke]]. The grammar is awful (I thought it was that way because something went awry when my friend copied it from the Internet. Nope, it's just that way), sometimes the word choice feels off, and it isn't the greatest of writing. Also, the author misfiled it very incorrectly on ff.net. But at the time I first read it, I loved it. It opened my eyes to the exciting world of Drarry and smut fics.

Honestly, I would love it if someone took this fic and cleaned it up. It's been awhile but as I recall it has a very interesting Quidditch story line beyond all of the smut.

** I was browsing the internet, I wasn't even certain why, and I was looking up new stuff to read, due to being bored. (I was 11 and had just gotten a tablet for Christmas, what did you expect), and came across a story that featured the characters that I was obsessing over. It was glorious. It had the Maradures, and Lily (who was supposed to be helping James learn potions in a summer school fashion) find and read the Harry potter books. I made it through the first two books with them, loving every second, and then their stories got taken down. I was devestated. I continued to read fanfiction, but it was never the same. I continued to read more, and more. I eventually told friends about it, and got teased a bit. (Still do actually, but people are accepting of it.) The one time my mom asked me what I was reading I told her fanfiction, and she asked what it was, and I told her, using science terminology, because I am a nerd like that, that it was people writing out parell universes, or alternate endings to harry potter. Eventually I found other fandoms and became obsessed with Lilo and Stitch. Then I discovered Doctor Who in general and crossovers, where Harry was The tenth's adoptive son, and Jack Harkness helps him raise Harry on the TARDIS. It was very sweet until it was discontinued. And now, around 3 years after I found that first story I'm sharing this here. Hoping someone will read it. :)
