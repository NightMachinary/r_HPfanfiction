** The very day Sirius Black is acquitted/escapes Azkaban, Snivellus is found dead with his guts half-chewed, his back bitten off and his lungs being pulled out of his back, his eyes crushed, his balls chopped off and his heart stuffed in his mouth with a werewolf bite here and there ( if it is the full moon and Moony is on board).

****** On the bright side, Ginny doesn't get the Diary horcrux and Sirius would attain some popularity amongst the masses as a martyr if he is actually sent to Azkaban.

******* To make things intresting, a young draco who grew up fatherless stumbles on the diary horcrux in his fathers study and starts writting in it.

Diary Riddle, learns about how most of his followers are dead and all that is left are children so he decides to act as a father figure and mentor till draco can get his first wand.

you can then have diary Riddle absorb draco and get reborn once draco gets his wand

or diary riddle deciding to wait till malfoy is an adult to start rebuilding his power base, with malfoy handing off diary riddle to someone worthless like crabbe because who cares if crabbe dies

** Insubordinate & churlish!

Plot twist if Snape was only there because Dumbledore couldn't make it and needed a substitute baby rescuer.

** He wasn't sure when he grabbed the crying child from the crib beside the dead body. Nor was he sure when his anger filled his veins causing him to lash out.

Yet, here he was.

Severus was trying to stop the bleeding from the cutting curses he threw at the child. He had grabbed the blankets from the crib and some loose burp towels that were sitting on top of the dresser. He was frantically putting pressure on the wounds while trying to figure out how he went from holding a dead woman to trying to undo his biggest mistake to date.

That was including giving up the prophecy.

He had tried to heal the cuts, but they just reopened. In his misery had thrown dark curse at a child. /A fucking child!/

Biting down on his bottom lip he pulled the bloody child closer to him. He pressed harder on the gash over the rib cage. Suddenly, a sickening crack filled the room as he pressed down too hard breaking the child's ribs.

He felt bile starting to rise.

He pulled his hands away from the child and tried to throw more healing spells. A few of the gashes started to stay close, others were too stubborn. The cries that had turned into a wet choking noise that made the hair on his arms stand up. He looked back up to the baby just in time to see the light fade.

Pushing himself off the ground, he darted through the destroyed home and out the backyard. He stopped only to vomit in the bushes by the back porch. He stepped off the property and out of sight right as he hard Sirius Black's motorcycle land beside the house.

He swore he could hear the man's cry even miles away.

The man knew what to do the moment he heard the train whistle. Rushing quickly to the sound, he dropped himself onto the tracks, took a deep breath, and closed his eyes.
