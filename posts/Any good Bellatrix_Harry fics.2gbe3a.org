**** It was last updated on August 10, unless the author stated they were I wouldn't assume a month since last update is abandoned.

**** I've been having trouble reading past the first few chapters. The level of angst has been a bit too high for my liking. Does it get better, or what makes you think it is amazing?

This one is pretty slow,but it's a decent fic. Delenda Est is hands down the best Harry/Bella fanfic. I've read Passageways, but don't really like it due to all the clich√©s and the way the author wrote Bellaxtrixs character. However, beggars can't be choosers.

Earl of the North was one of the first fanfics I read and I don't remember much about it.

This one was /really/ weird but may be interesting to some. It doesn't seem to be what you're looking for but I thought I'd mention it.

*** Just finished reading what there is for HP and Turning of the sun. Can't say I like it: as you said, it is pretty slow. On the other hand, I did read all that was there. I would have finished the story, if it was complete. But IMO, its not good enough to follow, especially since the story isn't complete after 4 years of working on it. One thing that I found disappointing about it is that it doesn't showcase how awesome Bellatrix could be.

Now to try The Taste of Your Magic. Edit: well that was a mistake.
