So, I've read Too Far from Home by story2tell linkffn(5757945) too many times now, and I am in a serious need of fics which at least partially focus on the father-son relationship between James and Harry.

AU, Time travel, Dimension travel, Resurrection Stone, whatever ingenious way to have James alive is welcome.

Any pairing is also welcome, just no bashing please.

Thanks


** Too far from home is so damn angsty, holy shit. Like, everything is a misunderstanding, everyone reacts terribly to everything. I like the fic, but goddamn I was really tempted to drop it after the second time one of the AUPotters attacked Harry for literally no reason.

*** Thaaaaank you, jesus. It reads like someone was set to write the angst-iest story possible and then snorted some coke to empower the angst even more. In every scene someone is either crying, having a meltdown, feeling despondent, completely hysterical or in total despair. And yet it's readable. A fine balance.

**** Holy shit, right? It's kind of ridiculous. People are constantly attacking Harry, AU!Harry chokes the shit out of him at some point, constant misunderstandings and cruel words, his AU!Sister tries to kill him, AU!James abandons him in the most painful way as possible, the author tries to force a wedge between Canon!Harry and Sirius just for angst's sake, etc.

I enjoy the hell out of the fic, and I'll instantly click the link when the next update comes out, but holy shit it can be a chore to get through at points.
