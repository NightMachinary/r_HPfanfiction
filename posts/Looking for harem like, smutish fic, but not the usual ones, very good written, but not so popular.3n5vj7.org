I'm looking for fics that are not so popular, but very good written. Harem style or not, doesn't matter. Very good smut, preferably with a good back story would be nice. More fics like cloneserpents would be nice. NO radaslab. NO slaves. NO concubines.

** The Accidental Bond, linkffn(5604382), is very entertaining.

Just a few spoilers: Harry first bonded with Hermione over the troll incident, and it had tremendously positive impact on this life. Later he ruthlessly retaliated against Lucius Malfoy over the diary incident.
