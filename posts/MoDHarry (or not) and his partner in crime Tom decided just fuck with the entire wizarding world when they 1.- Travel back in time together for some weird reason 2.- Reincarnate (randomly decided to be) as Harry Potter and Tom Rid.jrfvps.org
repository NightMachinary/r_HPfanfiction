Do you know any good fics like Boredom is Deathly, Full Circle and Eternal Hilarity?


** I think [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155][this]] is something like what your looking for, but I've never read any of the books you mentioned so, eh.

Also, would you mind dropping a link to the books you mentioned!

P.s. sorry I don't know how to use the ffn.bot!

#+begin_quote
  A disastrous trip to a waterpark (thanks, Dudley!) unleashes almost 200 lifetimes worth of memories, and now Harry is stuck as a ten-year-old while his soulmate is a wraith set on killing him.A very old and cynical Harry sets about correcting Tom's poor life-choices while avoiding Dumbledore and his Order's panicked searches for the Boy Who Disappeared.As far as Harry is concerned, the whole world can fuck off. He couldn't care less he's finally Harry Potter again, or that he can finally see his original loved ones again. The only thing that matters is getting Tom back safe and sane and with his soul intact.
