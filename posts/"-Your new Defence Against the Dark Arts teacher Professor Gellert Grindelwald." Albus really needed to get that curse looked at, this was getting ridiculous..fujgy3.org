Pretty much the title.

I see him being traded in for Lockhart, but anyone you can get away with is fine.

I haven't seen any Redeemed!Grindelwald stories, so I thought that this might be a fun little thing: him taking on DADA for a year. Bonus points if he's really good at it, and actually isn't being covertly evil.

Actually, that makes it /funnier/. The trio are like "well, we know who the evil teacher this year is" and Grindelwald is genuinely trying to repent and make it up to Albus.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

****** Ah yes... my name is something that many people are confused about. When I first got into HP I took the pottermore quiz and ended up as Hufflepuff. I was really young, not even 11. I believed that I was more Ravenclaw as I am an academic scholar at school and achieve really high. But after I had made my reddit account I decided to retake and got Gryffindor. Now was kinda confused as I wasn't sure really what house I fit best in. I'm clever but I don't put work in at school. I'm not sly or cunning at all really. I'm loyal as hell but I don't have many friends. I don't feel particularly brave either but then maybe in some way I am. I do stuff other people wouldntü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

******* Shelved Projects:

Harry Potter The Mind Arts

Summary: What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

You're probably here because of it. Which is a little disappointing, to be honest. The fact is I'm not sure if I will ever finish this story. Or when I'll even work on it again. This last update I tried my best, put plenty of time in, and it still didn't come out like I wanted.

The pacing is terrible, Daphne's character arc sucks, and the foils I wanted to set up are poorly executed when they are done at all. It's a mixed up jumble of head-canons and fanons that I just tried to throw together like I was some kind of horrific machine learning program.

It didn't work and as [[/u/thunder_dragon][u/thunder_dragon]] on Reddit first pointed out this story is dying, dying, dead.

In the end, it was a lazy self insert with harem elements that just happened to do a slightly better job then the next best things for a bit. I was tempted to remove it outright, (still am) however, in the spirit of growth, I decided to leave it up and not delete it. So, it's there, it exists, don't judge me cruelly but FWD critiques.

Anyone should feel free to adopt, continue, shred, and rewrite this if they feel like it. Any single idea or anything in general. Go nuts.

Didn't she also say it's no coincidence that he was defeated the same year the war ended? And I seem to recall at least one thing, somewhere, saying that he literally backed Hitler.

But yeah, Gellert's a neat character, and I've not seen a lot done with him besides "he's evil" or the like. Which is fine, he's the villain, but it gets a tad boring to read the same kind of fic again and again.

  Albus Dumbledore always knew how to find Gellert Grindelwald. It wasn't even an instinct, nor was it any magical connection they shared ( although young Albus sometimes hoped it was,) but no, it was merely observation. Although exceptionally skilled at transmutation and potions, Gellert could wear any face he wanted and still, Albus would recognize him. Because Gellert could change his name, features, pattern of speech, everything. But he couldn't get rid of his own charisma.Charisma, that usually affected young boys. *Dumbledore wants to die, Severus Snape doesn't want him to, and there is also an ex-Dark Lord trying to get his ex back. Maybe.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth and arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this. ON HIATUS
