"As you all know, the Statute of Secrecy was irrevocably breached three days ago, and the people around the world are wondering how magic could improve their lives. The answer is: It already is! Our names are Harry Potter and Hermione Granger-Potter, and we're here today to unveil what we've been working on for the last two and a half decades", Harry began his speech.

"Our story begins all the way back in 1991, when we met at Hogwarts, the British magic school. Our passion for science and magic quickly lead to a strong friendship, and we spent most of our time researching how to combine the two, an endeavor that lead to the event I'm most famous for: The defeat of the dark wizard Voldemort in 1996 through rather unconventional means.''

"After that, we continued with our research," Hermione continued. "We realized that most magicals, including Voldemort, don't really know too much about nonmagical technology. We realized that this was a major issue: Considering the progress in cameras and communication technology, secrecy became more and more difficult to enforce, and it was only a matter of time until it failed. Our predictions became reality just recently. But after our graduation in 1998, we decided to do something about it."

"My late Godfather had left me with quite a lot of money, and at the time I was quite the celebrity, so I was able to convince the ICW to allow me to inform trusted muggles about magic. This was what allowed us to start changing the world."

"In 1999, we founded two companies: Elemental Laboratories and Potter Research. In the nonmagical world Elemental is known as a top secret company employing some of the world's best scientists and a common topic for conspiracy theorists. Some people have even suspected that we had aliens there. In the magical world, Potter Research is known for publishing lots of articles on niche topics of magical research. Many researchers outside of it have wondered what use these niche topics could have."

"The truth is: The two companies are really just one. We have hired some of the best scientists, physicists, chemists, biologists, engineers as well as magical researchers, spellcrafters, magical theorists, potioneers and enchanters with one goal: Uniting science and magic for the benefit of all of humanity!"

"Our first major success was released back in 2005. We created another shell company, Miraculix, to market it."

Gasps went through the audience as some people recognized the name and realized what Hermione was talking about.

"Yes, the company known for the cancer cure. The drug is actually a magical potion developed by the potions and biology divisions of Elemental. It took close cooperation with the magical and nonmagical governments around the world to get it approved for deployment in the nonmagical world, but we managed it. To disguise its magical nature we had to design in a few unpleasant but harmless side effects, now that secrecy is gone we'll obviously remove those."

"And that was just the beginning," Harry began after the applause settled.

"In 2007, we acquired General Fusion, the startup behind the revolutionary reactors that power most of the world today. The scientific community was quite surprised at the time, nobody could figure out how the GX-4 reactor managed to produce ten times more power than it theoretically should. Now that secrecy is gone, we can reveal the truth: It doesn't. The reactors we built around the world barely provide any power at all. In reality, they just cover up the existence of the proudest creation of Elemental's physics and enchantment divisions: The Direct Magic To Electric Current Inducer, DMTEC. A very neat enchanted device that uses a modified lighting charm to directly produce electricity out of seemingly thin air.''

"And that was only our second project. In 2013, our biology and spellcrafting divisions eradicated Malaria using a ritual that makes Mosquitoes unable to transmit it, under the cover of the gene editing startup GeneMax."

"Yes, Malaria is gone thanks to magic. About 57% of the world's electricity is generated by magic. The cancer survival rate is at 85% globally and 98% in the developed world thanks to magic.And that's just what we were able to do while operating under the constraints of secrecy. Now that those constraints are no longer there, we will publish all our research for the entire world to see. We will be able to deploy future projects of ours much more easily, and we'll be able to dust off some ideas that we had to shelve because we couldn't find a way to explain them without magic. Those projects include mass producable cures for multiple more diseases, smaller DMTEC units to power planes, cars and possibly even phones, food enlargers for solving world hunger, and maybe our physics division can finally figure out how to correctly bend spacetime and we'll be able to warp over to Alpha Centauri.''

*** I didn't really intend to make it with that pairing until I was already in the middle of writing it and it's just really because the premise needs Harry's resources and influence and Hermione's drive to help people and scientific knowledge to work.

***** Of course not. We all know it's completely impossible for a man and a woman to work together for a common goal and NOT be romantically involved. That's like a natural law or something.

** This is my plan for the potential coming out party:

First, publish the children's fantasy series “Harry Potter”, gauge Muggles's general reaction to the concept of magic. This test is proven to be successful beyond our most optimistic expectations. Not only do the great majority of Muggles like magic, but we have also made billions off those enthusiastic Muggles.

“Harry Potter” has become so popular that many Muggles are publicly flashing their (fake) Wands in the public. True Wizards have indeed a lot easier these days, since even if we occasionally use our Wands, Muggles won't take them for real!

Next, our newly earned billions will be used in further strategic investments. For example, the end of the Cold War forced Muggle governments to downsize their militaries and selling off their old military bases at bargain prices. We want to acquire those valuable real estate cheaply and turn them into Wizard only enclaves. These are often very defendable sites with great existing infrastructure. Even better, cordoning these sites off from Muggles will not arouse a lot of suspicions.

We will partner with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to release lifesaving drugs. We will partner with visionary Muggle entrepreneurs to develop something really cool, such as a colony on Mars. We will go after our Muggle enemies in the media, and we will try to turn their children against them. Through all this, we will apply our magic as a key competitive advantage.

When we eventually come out, the Muggle world should see us as a benevolent force and be highly dependent on us. Of course, we will also hedge our bets:

- Our space program could provide us with an extraterrestrial refuge should our ‘coming out effort' fail.
- Our secret enclaves could provide us with additional safety.

** This could work, I guess, but there should be huge consequences. The likes of Mundungus will definitely be apparating/portkeying into muggle homes then obliviating and robbing them. With proof of a soul, Christianity should be at an all time high and wizards should be hunted by them.

#+end_quote

I doubt that. Precisely because it would also show that magic is nothing like depicted in Christian dogma, the proof of a soul would boost belief in /a/ religion in general, but not necessarily Christianity in particular --- indeed, depending on whether anyone's found the Resurrection Stone again yet, some hard evidence /against/ a Christian conception of the Afterlife might be gleaned. At the very least the existence of ghosts would already disturb a lot of theology.

Some nutjobs (¨cough¨ Americans ¨cough¨) perhaps, but the coming of the wizards is more likely to be seen as a miracle. In fact, I think some unscrupulous types would probably set themselves up as gods and saints, like in the old pre-Statute days.
