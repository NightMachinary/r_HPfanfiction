None of these are requirement, and I will probably read any fic, BUT I would like if there was:

Weasley!bashing Sociopathic!Harry Dark or Gray!Harry Preferably slash (no relationships also works )

If you recommend I will send you a FREE HUG!!!!


** Almost any manipulative/evil/bad Dumbledore fic would fit your criteria. Take what I'm reading right now.

** linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie)

I can't say that I like this story all that much. The author does a good job of walking a very different Harry through Hogwarts sixth year, but doesn't really do much to distinguish the plot in any memorable way.

There isn't any Weasley bashing, but Ginny and Ron are rather rude throughout the story, especially to Hermione-Sue.

*** Hermione-sue? More like Hermione-doormat. That girl had no spirit left and was abused worse than Worm's Taylor, with no one helping her, until brave soldier Harry arrived to save her.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord)

in this story, Harry is pretty much the equivalent to the John Wick of the magical world. it's such a tragedy that it isn't complete and is likely to be abandoned, still a damn good fic IMO.

** I mean, technically, darkness!Harry is being raised to be a weapon but ALL Potters have been. Not slash(no relationship stuff for years but eventual polyamory), no weasley bashing, not sociopathic but he will walk a fine line being an anti-hero fighting urges to just lay waste to everyone. linkffn(darkness ascendant)
