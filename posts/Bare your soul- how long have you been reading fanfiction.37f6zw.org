Do you remember the year you first began reading fanfiction? Bonus points if you describe your first fiction. Extra super points if you can link it.


** (I think I'm telling the truth) Summer of 2000, neighbor kids printed out a fanfiction and shared it with me. Titled /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ of course. Turns out Dumbledore was evil too. Everyone had Animagus forms. I never got to read the end.

It was really weird and I'm not sure why it didn't put me off fanfiction forever.

** Y'all are making me feel old, jeez. Probably around '98, and I think it was Gundam Wing fic. I read a lot of Gundam Wing/Sailor Moon crossovers that neatly paired off the pilots with the senshi. Thinking back on it, that's hilarious, because I've never seen two characters as ill-suited as Tsukino Usagi and Heero Yuy.

** I was about 12? My mugglenet fan fiction account says it was created a month before I turned thirteen, and I know I only created that after seeing a few stories elsewhere.

Mnff was my first archive, my once love. It seems so bleak and barren and forgotten now, it's kind of sad.

The first fan fic I remember reading was a Draco/Ginny fic worked around the song Bent by Matchbox Twenty, but wasn't actually a song fic. I remember nothing about the plot, but I remember the site has lots of dark blue and the links were yellow lmao

Edit: I'm 23, so it's been more than a decade of reading fic now. Wow.

Used to buy 15 minutes of internet on the camping computer and then open as many tabs as I could to read for much longer than those 15 minutes.

** Late May 2011. I read all the books and watched all the movies when they came out but never played the videos games.

I bought copies of all 8 games and decided to play through them all. Most of them sucked. CoS and OoTP were okay, PoA was pretty good.

When I was done I felt sad because I had just hit what I felt was the end point of original Harry Potter content. Enter Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Its been a long, slippery slope since the day I started that.

** Oh gosh, since 2002. I was in fifth grade, and my dad was just starting to let me go on the Internet unsupervised. It was on his computer, so I could only be on it when he wasn't busy with something. But fanfiction opened up a whole new world for me. I started writing as soon as that happened. Prior to that, it hadn't dawned on me that you could write your own stories, even though I had been making up "what happens next" scenarios in my head for a while.

** 2003 was when I started, the exact day after the HPOTP book release. I was randomly searching HP stuff and came across a site that was hosting a competition for fanfiction (wasn't called that, it was just called stories written in the HP universe) about HP & co going back in time and meeting the marauders. It stands out in my mind because there was a side bar listing people who had finished the book in record time. I remember thinking "it took you 24 hours to finish? Pfft, slow".

Granted, I was a recent college grad and unemployed, so I really had nothing /to do/ but read the book, so I wasn't exactly being fair in my head.

I can't remember the exact stories at all, and honestly they were all rather shit now that I think about it. I was just so new that the idea of /more/ was amazing to me.

** I think it was ages go, like just after the GOF novel came out. I was just Googling (probably with AOL search or DogPile as it was so long ago and on dialup) and I found ffnet. I looked around and I know the first thing I clicked on was a post-Hogwarts or non-magic AU where everyone was underwear models. I didn't understand anything fanon at the time so words like “Slash” meant nothing to me. Then it turned into a very hardcore (pre-purge) Drarry and I left the site for a while because I was very, very young. I came back at the time of OoTP and started consuming mass quantities.

I remember before the days of kindles and fanfic downloaders that I'd copy and paste a bunch of chapters into word docs on my laptop for car rides and things. Then I got my first ipod and there was a little teeny screen and a way to read docs on it, so that worked for me for a while. Having an ereader is so much more civilized.

I read HP off and on for a few years, I switch fandoms sometimes but generally end up back in HP eventfully. HP is like that comfort food I can always eat no matter what.

I don't think the fact that there were thousands of 'what if' stories out on the web, just waiting to be read, had ever occurred to me before. I hadn't long gotten a proper internet connexion, anyway. Still, needless to say the Twilight fic horrified me as much as the original books had, but I quickly found that FFnet was huge, and full of Harry Potter fics, which were far more to my liking.

Other than when completely necessary (you know, food, school/uni, sleep (/sometimes/)), I have barely left my computer in the last six years. The level of devotion I have to fanfiction's sad, really, but an awful lot cheaper than buying books that I'm not even sure I'm gonna enjoy (which is what I did previously--more expensive than a crack habit, that).

** I think I started reading fanfiction around 2001/2002. I was about 14, if I remember correctly.

** It was about 98/99. A friend got me into watching Pokemon. A few altavista searches later led me to some fan site that had stories posted. Heck yeah, I wanted some pokemon stories! I thought they official stories but halfway through the first one I realized the main character had the same name as the author. The fic was something about Ash going to Lavender Town to talk to the ghost of his dead pokemon.

Pokemon fandom led me to the Digimon fandom. Then I hopped around other anime fandoms a bit(cardcaptor sakura, gundam wing) before finally finding the Harry Potter fandom around early 2001.

I don't remember much about the first HP fic I read except it was a shitty Harry/Hermione fic where Hermione was the prettiest girl in Hogwarts and the American foreign exchange student was like, so jelly, of her.

** I don't remember the exact year but my entry to Fanfiction was on gamefaqs when KholdstareV wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4270777/1/Road-to-Nowhere][this Mario Kart fic]]. There was also a good Metroid one that seems to be deleted :(

My entry into Harry Potter Fanfiction was one of those terrible "reading the books" fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1847346/jlmill9][jlmill9]] which have since been deleted. I remember liking jlmill9's version because all the books eventually got completed instead of the author giving up halfway through the second book. I eventually discovered The Lie I've Lived which pretty much ruined my ability to stomach reading the terrible quality Fanfiction I had been reading up until that point.

** I started with fanfics just 3 or 4 months before HBP came out. It was one in spanish "Harry Potter y la antorcha de la llama verde", a sixth year fic and it's sequel "Harry Potter y Las dos camaras". First english one was an AU about Harry being adopted by a lady (i think her name was Daphne), and ending up in slytherin; they were up to book five in the series around 2007, but i can't find it, and it would be real good to read them again. If any one knows which one i'm talking about please hook me up with the link!

** It was late 2008, and my chosen fandom was Evangelion. The fic was [[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4140913/1/Orchestrating-the-Silence]]] Orcestrating the Silence, which still stands as one on the greatest evangelion fics of all time. A must read, and the most realistic post-Third Impact fic I have ever read.

** My first fan fic was in 2006 and was [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8077/Naitch+Star+Wars-+Episode+III+Revenge+of+the+Witch.htm][Star Wars- Episode III: Revenge of the Witch]] after a search for just what happened on Cato Neimoidia that Anakin teases Obi-Wan about in Ep III. I saw that Google's excerpt of the text included something said by Buffy (who I knew next to nothing of), and was curious enough to click and was hooked from then on.

** Since shortly after Deathly Hallows part 2 came out on DVD/TPB. So 3-4 years?

I've already mentioned that the [[http://imgur.com/aJGLBHz][last shot]] of that final film got me thinking about Harry and Hermione as the camera zooms in to the two of them leaving Ron and Ginny to the sides. I'd never thought that the two of them should end up together while reading canon, but the film made me curious. So I googled 'Harry and Hermione,' found a [[http://www.harryloveshermione.com/][fan site]] which led me to one of [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=809&chapterid=&agree=1][KateJ's fics]].

To be honest, I really didn't like the last three books. If there hadn't been a community of ardent H/Hr supporters, I wouldn't have given this fandom a second thought. I'm very glad to have found it, though. It's quite an interesting genre of derivative work IMO.
