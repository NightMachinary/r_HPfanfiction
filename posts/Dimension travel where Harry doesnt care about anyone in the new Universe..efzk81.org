Looking for fics where Harry (or someone else) is thrown in a different dimension where his parents/teachers/dead relatives/friends are still alive. But instead of integrating into his new found family and resuming old friendships, he outright refuses to interact with them and considers them completely different persons. I saw this before, but all stories that features this attitude eventually have Harry have a sort of emotional breakdown where he finally accepts his family/friends. I just want him to consider them strangers from start to finish and not bother to hide it. Bonus points if he is as contrarian as possible and doesnt actually help them do whatever they summoned him for.


** LMK if you find this

** On A Pale Horse has a similar premise to what you've described. He becomes the embodiment of Death, gets summoned to another realm. Basically has him say fuck you to everyone besides the Harry in the universe. linkffn(10685852)

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** Actually most of dimension travel stress out how much the newfound Lily is not Harrys mom. Sincerely, wtf. Even if Harry knows shes not his mum , its like getting and adoptive parent with the advantage of being generically identical to his mother.
