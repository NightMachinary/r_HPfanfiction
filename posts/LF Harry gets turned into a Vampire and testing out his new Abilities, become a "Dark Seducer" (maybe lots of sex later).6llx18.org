Mainly his seductive Abilities. As Vampires are said to be "Masters of Seduction", im curious if such exist. I was thinking about that Harry is shocked to be in his new state, but then he starts in seducing females (i had Hermione in mind, who is Canonical with Ron). He is testing how far he can seduce Hermione (or any other female) and she is slowly attracted to him, leading into intimate touches, who leads into Sex. She is after the happenings shocked at first but then wants more of it (all in a slow process). It CAN be "spiced" by Harry biting Her during their climax and figures that this Blood tastes the best. Well, Harry is either not a "Full" vampire or one that can decide who he turns into another one. Also it doesnt matter if he has just one Partner in the progress or 2 or more.

I had some slice-of-life beginning in mind. Not necessary that Harry joins some vampire clan or something like that.

The only fic with such content with Vampire Harry and Hermione that i know is this (The Game is Over) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8786575/1/The-Game-Is-Over]] its actually good, but i also want a fic with a slower process. Oh and no one of his Partners dies, of course, during the intercourse. I guess a female vampire Harry is ok, too
