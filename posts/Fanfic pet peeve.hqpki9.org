One of the best characters in the series and yet in every fan fiction I seem to read his part is always cut short or he's hardly ever mentioned - where is all the Hagrid appreciation????

He's an integral part of Harry's journey in the wizarding world and thereafter and yet it seems he gets used to pick up Harry from the Dursley's and then most fan fictions never seem to mention him again.

Is this just a me issue or has anyone else noticed this?


** 1. His accent is a pain to write correctly. It sort of interrupts artistic flow if you need to keep checking the dialog chart!
2. He‘s difficult to pair up romantically, if romance is your thing.
3. On the flip side, he has no real rivalries to explore, either.
4. He's super loyal to Dumbledore, if Dumbledore-bashing is your thing.
5. He's not an intellectual powerhouse if outthinking Voldemort or witty banter is your thing.
6. In canon, he constantly needs Harry--- starting at age eleven--- to clean up his messes rather than dealing with them like an adult. An “edgy” or “mature” or “indy” Harry isn't likely to tolerate that. But calling out his flaws feels like kicking a puppy. If you told him that he's not qualified to be a professor, he'd probably just cry.\\

He just doesn't fit with most fanfic tropes.

*** It'd be fun to break the trend and write an indy!Harry who takes no shit when Hagrid's insulted. Malfoy's sabotage? Partially-indy-third-year Harry makes Malfoy's life hell from the shadows.

Umbridge making a fool of Hagrid in front of the entire class? Indy!Harry turns her office into a constant source of misery for her, courtesy of dungbombs, firecrackers, and more sinister traps (perhaps Dark magic?).

I like to think that no matter what, Harry would always have a soft spot for Hagrid if the fic implies that the canon events still happened before Hogwarts.

*** Hagrid does too have RIVAL!!! He went to SCHOOL WITH VOLDEMORT, and got EXPELLED because of him and also POOR ARAGOG!!! :( Fanfic writers should make HAGRID have WAY MORE interactions with Voldemort than they do! And maybe Hagrid can have personal motive to fight Voldemort because maybe he thinks he could have stopped him way earlier or something! I hate how canon totally brushes this off! That is like huge, also because he meets him again in sorcerer's stone and then in deathly hallows again again.

It is way too onesided to be fair, leading back to the "kicking a puppy" thing. Why would you want to include such scenes which would undoubtedly kill Hagrid?

#+end_quote

Yes, she is not the kind the praise anyone. I guess could do it if praising Hagrid (a Healf Breed) emphasized Dumbledores failing, but considering the character, it is more likely that she would find a way to critisize Dumbledore while insulting Hagrid at the same time.

*** And I once read one where the troll was still in the dungeons when the Slytherins arrived. All the youngsters were making a big fuss about Dumbledore's decision to send them there (Malfoy especially). Then the older students just said "So what?", pointed their wands, and brought the troll down in a combined Stunner assault.

It's nice to read about a Slytherin house that doesn't entirely hate Dumbles 24/7 (can't remember the fic's name).

** Hagrid's accent is hard to get right, and if you don't nail it, people will call you out for it.

Plus, not everyone likes Hagrid. His bigotry against muggles, support of Dumbledore, and his general stupidity make him a target for bashers.

** I have a love-hate relationship with Hagrid. I agree with most of the stuff here. But my main issue with him is that he mainly seems to advance the plot or drop a hint. Don't know what's in the third floor corridor? Hagrid. Don't know what the first task is? Hagrid? Need some sort of information? Hagrid. He's the Gryffindor information network. After book1, every time Hagrid showed up, it told me something was going to happen. The chickens? I instantly dropped the book, had a Hermione moment, ran to my bookshelf and had a hell of a time finding my Canterbury Tales book. The Skrewts? Ugh...

Any sort of discord with Dumbledore? Hagrid is out. It doesn't even have to be bashing. Mad about being stuck at the Dursleys? Mad about no mail? Anything really, Hagrid would instantly side with Dumbledore.

One plot point that I have never seen (except for a Gamer!Harry fic where Harry spent a summer working with Hagrid as an assistant) is Harry asking Hagrid to help harvest the Basilisk. Maybe make a jacket or something out of it. Hagrid is always treating leather, fixing boots, his jacket, etc.

** No one can write the Hagrid speech?

one fic I've read had him talk a completely foreign language. like, "Im'd g' to Hog' hed, yall" ... what? I know that if I were to write a fic, Hagrid will not be in it. it might be because English is not my native language, so it's pretty impossible for me.

I wonder if that's a pet peeve of someone, if Hagrid is written normally without his accent. cause I would probably write him normally if I had to.

** The problem is Hagrid's accent, as many average writers often make him sound like a drunken idiot with a flu. For example:

"'Arry, I go' ya a cake fur ya bir'day. 'Appy bir'day!", "Ya a wiz'd, 'Arry.", or "Don' talk abo' Snape like tha'. Heeza a goo' teecher at this skul, ya?" (Something like that.)

That's not Hagrid. That's more like Fleur on drugs. Just a step up and you'll have Jar Jar Binks. "Yuzza izza wizard, Harry! Mezza so proud of your parentsa!"

There's a thing called Google, you know, or people can analyse the way he talks in the books. Otherwise, just avoid accented misspellings entirely, and trust the reader to mentally 'Hagridify' it.

** He is the second biggest exposition machine in canon, that's why he has so much presence. The biggest one, Hermione, actually has many notable moments outside of it. Hagrid has like two. So unless you are doing a complete canon rehash, it's hard to justify Hagrid's presence most of the time. The time that could be spent developing other side characters that can actually make a difference in the story.
