  Ever wonder what would happen if the Muggles found out about the Harry Potter world? If so, this is for you.In the movie version of Order of the Phoenix, Harry is filmed flying right next to a boat filled with Muggles when he is being escorted to 12 Grimmauld Place. Unknown to any of the wizards, an American soft drink company is filming a commercial for the 1996 Super Bowl from the boat at the time Harry is flying past. It's a pity the wizards never knew that Disillusionment Charms would not work against electronic video equipment.
