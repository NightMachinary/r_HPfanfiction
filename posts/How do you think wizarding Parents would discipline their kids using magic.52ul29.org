** Disciplining using magic sounds a lot like spanking; some parents do it, others think it's abuse. So, here's a quick brainstorm I had with myself that includes magical punishments that don't necessarily use magic directly on the kids:

- Cleaning the family owl's cage

- Shooing away harmless, magical pests (like the Weasley's gnomes)

- If their kid is caught making fun of someone else's appearance, spell their mirrors to make the kid see themselves with that "bad" trait to give them a lesson in empathy and humility.

- If the child says a cuss word, spell them so that every time they say it their mouth tastes like boogers for X amount of time.

- Take their broom away / no flying lessons with parents until they behave

- Magically "stick" a kid to a chair while in time out.

- Kid forgetting his curfew? Spell their shoes to automatically start moving them towards home.

The one who was under the imperius curse to further Voldemort's agenda?

or the one who had barely two braincells to rub together and thought Dumbledore was trying to start an army of students to take over his job?

Either way, I don't think she was so powerful she was beyond the law. It's not like anyone ever called her on it to find out

** "Crucio!" (well, at least for the Blacks. Could see that happen with a mother like Walburga Black...)

As for a serious answer, I never was disciplined with more than a "I'm disappointed" - talk as a kid by my parents -my parents and I were quite easy-going. A scourgify for a foul word, or a talk, if you have done something wrong. I don't think violence is a solution for such things.

*** We frequently see Walburga using the cruciatus on Sirius as the reason for his flight in fanfiction, but it has no support in canon as far as I know.

It may be a weakness of canon (not exploring more the society built upon magic), but fanfiction authors seems a little too fond, in my mind, of a curse /which you can be condemned to hell for life for a single use/. Using it is not on the level with beating a child with a belt (which is physical abuse), it is on the level of branding the child with hot iron. Maybe Harry's (mostly failed attempt) use of it, or his ability to rebound after being under it, distorts our views a readers.

What we see of Walburga Black is her madness at the end of her life, and the opinion of a child she was abusive with; well, she was probably not a nice woman (understatment, I know). But there is still a gap from being a physically and/or mentally abusive parent and torture on that scale.

**** To be fair, though, the way her portrait is I could see her using a hot iron on a child as a means of punishment, and I think what it boils down to is not people forgetting what the Cruciatus curse is but rather what portraits are.

Because wizarding portraits are an oft-exaggerated impression of a person, with ability to gather information but with no ability to truly learn from it. What that means is that the portrait was even less sane than Walburga was at her craziest. For example, people see her portrait hate Sirius and spew venom at him but had it been the real Walburga she no doubt would have not done so upon learning that Sirius got thrown into Azkaban for being a follower of Tom (even if it was only a misconception) and then escaped from it; even if she were to hate him again later, should this happen, were she not a portrait she probably would have spent some time feeling proud for him “finally seeing the light” or other such inanity; but, as a portrait, she'd hated him and therefore /it/ will hate him until the end of time, even were it to learn of something that should have made it feel differently.

** My headcanon is that Walburga used the torture curse on Sirius right before he ran away because he had finally realized that he could stand up to her and she couldn't intimidate him into obeying her anymore.

Other parents, I think, might have used a silencing charm in combination with something else, like standing in the corner. Maybe a stinging hex on the bum for more corporal punishment.

There's probably as great a variety of disciplinary choices among magical parents as there are among muggle parents. Some parents might be horrified of using magic as punishment while others think it is perfectly normal.

**** Maybe. I don't remember any particular fics that bring it up, but it's possible I was influenced by one or more that have it.

I think it might have been something along the lines of Sirius pushing her buttons too far and too often and her temper broke and she cast it in anger. I don't think it lasted very long nor that she cackled gleefully afterwards. Perhaps she realized what she'd done, was horrified by it, and ran to another room to calm down. Or Orion might have stepped in. There's plenty of parents that are flawed that do something horrible as discipline that they regret immediately but don't know how to fix the situation afterwards.

I think Sirius got his temper and anger issues from his mother and the examples she set in his childhood. He pushed too far and broke the camel's back for her with his rebellion. She pushed too far and broke the camel's back for him with her treatment of him.

Then again, I am a fic author, so it's possible that it's just my headcanon for my characterizations of Sirius and Walburga.

On a side note, I don't think the Ministry can detect when an Unforgivable is cast. They can trace underage magic to locations that shouldn't have magic--such as the homes of a muggle-born or muggle raised students, but it's up to parents in magical households to police their children about performing underage magic. If the Ministry can't detect what regular magic is cast or by whom even with the trace, how would they know who cast an Imperio or Cruciatus except for someone of authority seeing it, seeing the results of it, or someone else reporting it?

--------------

I have a distinct memory from my childhood of my mother with her hands around my sister's throat, pressing her against a wall. My dad was the one to step in and tell Mom to back off and calm down. Mom was horrified when she did calm down and realize what she'd done. My sister was fine--angry and probably frightened (she was probably 15 or so at the time)--but ultimately fine.

Yeah, parents can lose their tempers. I'm glad you and your sister grew up safely and relatively unscathed.

Umm, well, the thing is... I haven't actually posted any of it (yet). A long time ago I wrote Twilight and Walking Dead fanfiction and I never finished anything beyond a one-shot despite being really interested in them at the time. So I made a promise to myself to write/finish/edit before I'd ever post fic again, just because I know how frustrating it is to find abandoned fics. So I have several WIPs (one's over 350k), but nothing officially posted. It's the middle that always bogs me down, even though I have everything plotted out!

Didn't mean to write a novel at you, lol. Sorry.

***** It reads more like it's the Black family curse/blood trait more than anything else. They've all got some sort of hair-trigger or containment issue; or both if you look at Bellatrix. I'd wager even Nymphadora has a button or two that would set her off in a similar fashion.
