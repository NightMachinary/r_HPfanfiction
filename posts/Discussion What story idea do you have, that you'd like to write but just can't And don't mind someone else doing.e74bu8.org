Maybe because you don't have the time to write a full fleshed out story, rather you're not sure you can, or a variety of other reasons.

If you're okay with someone else writing the story feel free to say so, maybe the two of you can pm each other or something.


** I've always thought it'd be cool if Minerva McGonagall had gone to school with Tom Riddle and was a secret Death Eater. Like she worked hard to become friends with the whole of Hogwarts staff, kept her head down for years and kept up the status quo, then as time went on she slowly began to subtly indoctrinate some students to their ways of thinking. I have several other ideas to go along with it but every time I've say down to write it it feels wrong. I'd be happy to let someone have this idea.

** Instead of the curse on the ring withering Dumbledore's hand, it slowly makes him go mad.

Sounds good to me, but I don't have the talent for writing that with the complexity I'd like, so I'm planning on just doing it as a background for a Minerva-centric oneshot.

** I had a couple. One is Harry Potter retold backwards. Not really my idea, just a prompt I found on DLP I think. But the focus of every book is reversed, so Deathly Hallows is book 1, Half Blood Prince is Book 2, etc. Been floating in my head for years.

Another is Lily Evans being taken as an apprentice to Tom Riddle in a AU where Hogwarts either doesn't exist or is inaccessible to Muggleborns, and Muggleborns are taken into apprenticeships by purebloods, with some being better than others. Eventually Tom goes full on rebellion and Lily has to decide if his methods are something she wants to be party to.

** What about if one of the twins (or both) or Neville went back in time to right before they start Hogwarts? I see a lot of time travel stories where one of the three golden trio or Sirius goes back but it's rare to find one of a different character going back. What if Remus went back or prof. Mcgonagall? I think having a more side character go back they would face different problems as they aren't one of the ones who dealt with most of the problems Harry faced.

** sane Tom Riddle leads a radical political movement against Dumbledore, pushing for better Muggle-born integration while also trying to reinstate many of the old wizarding traditions that have fallen by the wayside. his argument is that Dumbledore's basically had control of magical Britain for thirty years (I plan for this to take place during the 1970s) and his reign has led to stagnation and outright suppression of magical progress, specifically with regards to older and darker magic that Dumbledore disapproves of. Tom also wants to rid the Ministry of its corruption.

basically if Voldemort from Sarcasm and Slytherin didn't make horcruxes and instead used his Slytherin characteristics for good.

** Dumbledore summons a hero before year one, to vanquish the Dark Lord, in case Harry fails. A MoD Self Insert shows up. "You are a character in a popular children's book, headmaster. And an ambivalent one at best. Did Harry really deserve a childhood of neglect and abuse, for the greater Good? Death has granted me a final Deathly Hallow, the Elder Quill, to rewrite the seven books. Why should I keep you past the prologue?"

** I've had a couple of these:

1. /The actual spell for making someone eat/vomit slugs is "Slugulus Eructo". So how did Ronald Weasely, a second year student, manage to cast it with an English incantation using a shoddy, broken wand?/

The final battle would involve Harry introducing Ronald Bilius Weasely to Voldemort as "my right *hand* man" thus fulfilling the letter of the prophecy if (not the spirit). Ronald would then proceed to literally eradicate Voldemort with his insane level of control over magic.

2. Have you noticed that you can be happy/excited and afraid at the same time (like asking out your crush on a date) but it's hard to be ANGRY and afraid at the same time because anger washes out the fear? So what would happen if you focused on your most angry thoughts and cast a patronus charm at a dementor?

3. Harry chooses Ancient Runes as a subject and discovers that instead of weird norse/aztec/egyptian runes, you can make perfectly good runes using the English alphabet, as long as you write in cursive. Hermione isn't amused when Harry's runework begins to outshine her.

4. A [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsf38NYzo5Q][point-defense system]] developed to counter the killing curse by flinging small physical objects at it. Now that I think about it, an actual Phalanx CIWS (miniaturized, massive featherweight charms, some way to operate in magical areas, portable power source) would be the perfect thing for that.

** There are a few things about AU worldbuilding I'd like to throw out there before suggesting the idea:

- Fuck lordships and all that shit
- Magic protects wizards and witches from dangerous situations that are not magic-related. (e.g. accidental magic letting Neville bounce when dropped
- Muggle means aren't a danger to wizards and witches, if they get shot, their magic will protego it, they'll apparate (even if they don't know how to) out of bombs etc. IT SHOULD BE REALLY HARD TO KILL A WIZARD OR WITCH WITH NON-MAGICAL MEANS EXCEPT IDK NUCLEAR WARFARE OR SOME SHIT

  - Therefore muggles not knowing about wizards and witches is essential, bc they can only really beat them if they all get together and throw all themselves at trying to kill or subdue wizards and witches.
  - This is what the ministry's main goal is, keeping the statute of secrecy, and keeping up with muggle tech + control muggle governments to ensure no danger can happen.

- Wizards and witches basic needs are easily met with magic if they are capable wizards and witches. They can build houses, grow food with a flick of a wand, get water, etc. If it's not a magical resource (e.g. dragonhide) they can easily use magic to get it.

  - Therefore, education is essential, hence Hogwarts.

    - Speaking of Hogwarts, I find it ridiculous that half the subjects are useless and that there are so many branches of magic or whatnot that should be taught but aren't. I think it would be nice if there were more branches to learn or if they also learnt something like Core Magical Theory, Magical Automation, Rituals, Runes, Wards, etc. It should be more than just Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology. Also fuck Divination or it should be something useful like how to find things using magical detections and senses.

- Wizards and Witches have gender equality. Since they have magic to do house chores and child rearing easily, they do not need patriarchal structures. They essentially had the Washing machine revolution from the get-go in magic.
- Wizards and Witches in legends are often also portrayed as sexual deviants, devil worshippers etc. While I wouldn't think they would be devil worshippers, I do think they would be much more progressive and open than muggles. Think about it, their history wasn't affected by religious puritans neither were they encumbered by religion, why do religion when you can do magic? We also know a lot of older cultures were also much more open sexually, and okay with nudity

  - I would say they're much more comfy with nudity even around the other gender and sexuality etc. They can use magic to overcome difficulties with homosexual reproduction too

- Muggleborns come from more conservative cultures and are weirded out in Hogwarts by the mixed gender dorms, shared showers, the lack of discomfort of pureblood fellow students with sex and relations

THE IDEA FOR FANFIC : A fanfic from Hermoine's perspective. She discovers she's a witch and she loves magic and reads up all about it. However, even though her parents are muggle liberals, she's shocked at a lot of things about wizard/witch culture and she wants to fit in but tries to overcome all the stuff she grew up with while learning all the beautiful stuff about magic she can.

This was written extremely hazily and roughly. There's so much more I wanna write out, but you get the idea.
