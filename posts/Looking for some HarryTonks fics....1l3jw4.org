I've read a few HONKS fics and kind of started to like them. Theres not many out there that I can find. I was wondering if anyone had some recs, and I would prefer if it was Tonks at her actual age, not deaged to be Harry's age.

I'm particularly fond of her short story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053607/1/Running][Running]], [[/spoiler][also of this pairing]]. 2k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Married people should be happy. New parents should be happy. War heroes should be happy. And if you're all three of those, you should be happy. You shouldn't be running. Post-war, AU. Oneshot. Rating for language & adult situations.

**** The R Series is rather awesome. At least it was to me when I first read it. However, I don't particularly like the post-Hogwarts stories by Regulus...

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Tonks is posing as a Hogwarts student when someone slips something into Harry's drink. With Death Eaters on the prowl and the Boy Who Lived not only missing, but stoned out of his mind and horny to boot, what's a girl to do?

** Most of my saved links have already been posted, but there's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7622731/1/A-Very-Secretive-Christmas][A Very Secretive Christmas]], which actually has a lot of pairings in it, but centers on Harry and Tonks.

There's also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6931233/1/What-Everyone-Missed][What Everyone Missed]], which mostly has to do with people learning about Harry and Tonks.
