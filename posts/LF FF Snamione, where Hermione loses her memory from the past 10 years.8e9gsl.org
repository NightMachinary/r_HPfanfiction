So, I'm looking for a specific FF (Read it months ago in FF.net) it was a Severus Snape-Hermione Granger fanfic, where she "wakes up" and thinks she's 17 years old or around that age, but she's actually married to Snape and have 3 children, they live as muggles because of a tragic accident that happend in Hogwarts (if i remember correctly it was when Voldemort died and somehow he took their powers?) so now she "wakes up" and cant remember marrying or having children with Snape, last thing she remembers is being a student at Hogwarts. Please help! can't find it anywhere

Thanks in advance!
