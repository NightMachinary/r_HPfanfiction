Such as Nick Fury's eye, or Jaime Lannister's hand, or whatever. Doesn't have to be the focus of the fic, just wanna read about characters having these things fixed for them.

Edit: Actually, any crossover where people react to HP magic.


** I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] and really enjoyed how the Jedi react to Harry's Magic. Magic is used to heal injuries, altough may be not what you're looking for. Harry saved a bartender from a blaster blast, Ventress and Master Fay from a lightsaber stab.Harry is OOC, but then again he has lived for 1700 year at that point. You could argue that his personality will be different from his teenage years. He's similiar to Harry from Black Comedy, confident and has a perverse joke.

You don't need to know much about Star Wars. The setting is between Episode II and III, right after Ashoka Tano's trial. I only watch the movies and I know the rest from reading the wiki.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

*** I'll give it a go. I've never much liked Star Wars, but that kind of Black Comedy personality might be enough.

** Sadly a lot of crossovers have Harry hide his magic.. and change his name.. and acts ooc.. And somehow authors still wants us to believe we are reading about Harry potter o.0

*** The worst are the Game of Thrones crossovers where Harry is reborn as someone else, doesn't remember his life as Harry, doesn't act like Harry, and never uses magic. They're just OCs that the author wants to paint as Harry to bring in more readers.

** When I read the title, I thought you were asking for stories where Harry (or whoever) has a Healing Factor, but I blame that on my re-watching The Wolverine while browsing Reddit.

All hail master of arcane magicks, Vincent Crabbe

also this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]] DnD magic meets HP magic. Much reacting on both sides.
