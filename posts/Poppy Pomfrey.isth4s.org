I find Poppy to be a rather interesting character. Most usually, the main characters, and even minor characters, tend to have the same type of characterizations, but there just doesn't seem to be one type of characterization set for Poppy, but instead multiple.

Sometimes she's a mother hen, sometimes she's a no nonsense type of person, sometimes she has certain favorites, sometimes she doesn't, et cetra.

She's just a really interesting character to me, and I find how different people write her, to be interesting, since while there might some similarities with Poppy in certain stories, each author takes their own spin on her character.

What are some stories where you really liked Poppy's characterization? She can be a major, minor, side or background character.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, would rather it be completed or constantly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like.

No Weasley bashing please. As I love that family and hate when authors go to that whole Weasley's were using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** I keep coming back to “The Assassin Wore White” because not only to we see Poppy in a totally different light, but it also shows healers as people who have much more power than expected.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** She's in a lot of Healer!Harry fics, but my favourite one is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6585807/1/Harry-Potter-Healing-Hands]]). At the end of 3rd year Harry decides to become a Healer after seeing what happens to Remus and Pomfrey is of course in charge of the future Healer's club.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White]]) -- This fic features Poppy very prominently.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night]]) There is one I know where Harry tutors under Madam Pompfrey in becoming a healer if memory serves me correct. I enjoyed it when I read it since it was well-written with a nice plot not to mention it was very lengthy which was a bonus. It also has a harem of you are into that.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8920787/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Path-of-Indifference]]) is a bit of a stretch, but Poppy is in the background when Harry and another character ask about potions.

  Harry Potter may be the brother of the Boy-Who-Lived and his parents may still be alive, but that doesn't mean everything is perfect. While he may not want anything to do with the upcoming war between Light and Dark, he'll end up walking between them. An AU fanfic involving Harry Potter as a Ravenclaw and based off Neither Light nor Dark: Steelclaws & Gray Coats.

** I find it interesting that she almost consistently gets a pass for not noticing the abuse or authors come up with some convoluted reasoning for her not to be blamed (up to Dumbledore forcing her into an unbreakable vow) while everyone else gets shat on in the same fic. But not Pomfrey, she wanted to help Harry from the beginning but couldn't do it due to X,Y and Z.

Come to think of it, that's probably the reason why I had her booted out of Hogwarts in my own fic (and she is much easier to get rid of via official channels for malpractice than for example Dumbledore).

*** Huh, you know something? You have a point. No matter if Dumbledore is evil or not in the story, it seems like if Harry's abuse is brought to light, he gets hated on, and Poppy doesn't. I mean, she had helped Harry for years, because of various things that kept happening to him, surely she knew of his neglect and the like?

**** That is pretty much the reasoning I used to get her thrown out. Either she knew and did nothing or she failed to notice, which makes her qualifications a bit questionable but definitely means that she should not be primarily treating children.

*** Yeah, that's pretty interesting. Do you think it's because of the fact that we can recall several instances where Pomfrey helped Harry (as in healed when he got hurt), whereas we don't see too many examples where Dumbledore explicitly helps Harry with inmediate and obvious results? In fact, the only instance where harry receives immediate help from Dumbledore that I can think of is when he took the blame for the DA.

Or maybe it's because we've been taught to trust medical personnel?
