** Can all living wizards who have chocolate frog cards spy then?

Also imagine some thirteen year old propping up Harry's card on his bedside table and rubbing one out without knowing that the person in the card can see him doing it. Imagine poor Harry's plight when he's checking out his chocolate frog card spy-cam feed and has to see the messy puberty years of underage wizards.

This was my immediate thought too, and I get the sense that photographs do not act as spies (can they even talk?) in the same way portraits can. Harry has his photograph taken, and did not gain a spy on Colin Creevey through it (and if he had, he probably would have used it, so as to avoid Colin!). Plus, we know Dumbledore had a spy or spies in Albania watching Voldemort, so does this mean Voldemort kept a chocolate frog collection in Albania? What happens when the person he's spying on puts the card in a box and never looks at it again?

Having said that, it's a fun prompt for a fic, but just not really canonical.

  "They're trying to discredit him," said Lupin. "Didn't you see the /Daily Prophet/ last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return. They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot -- that's the Wizard High Court -- and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too."

The worst casting I thought was well...Jon and Daenerys. Emilia and Kit improved but they were kind of bad for much of it. And don't look enough like the characters to justify it.

*********** I disagree with you there. The description in the books is very different and way, waaaay worse. He looks like he has been burnes superficially on a small part of his head and has been treated after. The SC in the books has half his face melted off, cannot close his mouth properly and his jaw bone peeks out. That is wildly different. The actor has been given a scar, but nothing that would make anyone go "holy shit". Oh, and he should have black hair, grey eyes and a hooked nose. None of which he has in the series.

I agree with you on Jon and Daenerys, they look completely different in my head. I am still disappointed that they did not even care enough to give her violet eyes and really white hair (eyebrows!). Well, everyone looks very, very different. Sansa as well. They really should have picked a real mother and daughter for her and Catelyn, that they look alike is so essential for the whole Littlefinger creepiness.

And I personally think Jaime and Cersei do not look alike at all. And Tyrion was not even a little ugly.

************ Yeah but George does always go to the extreme, I think it's more realistic and almost certainly more practical for the show.

I really like Catelyn's actress and she does look like someone you could believe could look like Sansa when younger. What might have helped is having a painting or something of a younger Catelyn just being the Sansa actress to emphasise the idea though.

They look less and less alike as the seasons go on that's for sure. But both are too good of actors for me to mind.

************* That might be why I tend to stick to books and hardly watch anything. I think to balance out all the things that a series lacks in comparison to a book, you know inner monologues etc., you have to get the visual part absolutely perfect.

************** The brilliant thing about reading is that everyone imagines the characters a bit differently, yes along the descriptions given but someone queasy about scars/burns etc. might imagine them less severe than GRRM indicated they were simply because our brain likes to keep our imagination within bounds we can easily live with (without to much horror). Also I imagine for the show they wanted someone suitably coarse for the monstruos part of his character, but someone who can also do the "tortured by his bigger brother" arc believably without looking outrageously damaged. Same old story, a bit damaged means possibility for redemption, too much (visible) damage is off-putting. So I'd say the casting and make-up choices were mostly to increase ambiguity of the character by making him more "neither here nor there" in terms of disfigurement.

​

Sorry for the rambling, it's just something I like to ponder. The differences between descriptions in books and the images I create in my head sometimes are really interesting to analyze, especially when those books get cinematized too and one has to cope with another set of character's looks that just confuses things even more.

*************** I like your rambling.

"Same old story, a bit damaged means possibility for redemption, too much (visible) damage is off-putting."

Though I reckon you're right, this is such a horribly sad thing and I think GRRM wanted to make it impossible for SC to ever look even close to okay. I think that looking at him is painful in the beginning is a very defining trait for him, so much that it directed his entire life. I know they tend to make things easier for mainstream media, but for me this is too much. Same goes for the age thing, I understand that you can not show the rape of a 13 year old. But a bitter angry 50 year old is completely different than an angry bitter 26 year old.

Since I read a few ASOIAF fics I also wonder if they not just made him pretty, but completely white washed Tyrion in the series, because he seems to be viewed as an all around nice dude and not someone who participated in the gang rape of his wife, just because he thought she had betrayed him.

There is just one thing that the show did, that I absolutely love though: They made Ramsay hot. In the books he is not much to look at, but I love that for once a completely horrible sadist is one of the hottest guy in the series.

I think ASOIAF is about deeply complicated characters and everything that makes it easier for the viewer always take away from the brilliance of the original material.
