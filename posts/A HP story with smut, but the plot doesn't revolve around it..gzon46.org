I'm tired of reading Dark/OP/SMART/Time Travel/whatever Harry, and not get my testosterone levels up to par. I'm searching for stories that has a steaming or straight up porn scenes with better than average detail descriptions, that doesn't take it out of the plot of the story. A good Example would be linkffn(A Sorcerer's Ambition) as it have great worldbuiding and has some great instances of...well...sex.

** Try We're in this Together by zugrian. It's a Harry/Pansy story with both characters being very cynical and doing what needs done (in terms of Voldemortand his deatheaters. Lots of teenage hormones that takes advantage of being at a boarding school with little to no adult supervision. Story starts a few days after Harry comes back from the Chamber of Secrets.

  Grayson doesn't have a bad life, not really. But given the chance to improve his not-that-bad life, he'll grab it without a second thought, even if he has to make a deal with a devil to do so, after all... the sorting hat did say his ambition was dangerous.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
