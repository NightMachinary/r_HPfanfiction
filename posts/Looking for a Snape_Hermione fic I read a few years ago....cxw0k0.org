:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that it was posted on FF and that it was a multi-chapter fic but I have not been able to find it... The war was over and Hermione was back at Hogwarts with Ginny as well as Snape who has survived and was back to teaching potions. They meet at Astronomy tower one night and talk and share a kiss but Snape retreats after that. Soon after they start a very sexual relationship but I am not sure how the fic ends since I never finished it for some reason... There is another detail that I remember quite well- one time Snape takes polyjuice and turns into a former student of his in order to sneak into Hermione's room. Rings any bells? Thanks!
