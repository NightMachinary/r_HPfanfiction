Never thought of this one. Anyone have some good Harry/Hannah fics?


** It's a secondary pairing at best, but linkffn(safe word is devil's snare) is the only one I've come across with that pairing even mentioned. (Warning, very NSFW overall).

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension. --- Rated M for language and sexual scenes (Neville/Hermione) *Art by Simona Polle*

** My notes say I rated linkffn(A Badgers Love) as 3/5 stars (i.e., "it was okay") but since I don't have any other notes for it, it must have been a long time ago when I was less discriminating, so ... maybe?

*** I read it a while ago. Form what I remember, the writing is functional, as is the plot. Enough to fill the void while it lasts but forgotten swiftly after being consumed.

Beware DeathEater!Ron (not a euphemism). Can't remember any bashing other than Ron's (which I seem to remember as not so much bashing as Ron being taken advantage of, but YMMV).

That sounds about right. There isn't a lot in Hannah's canon character to hang a plot or purpose on. Susan, at least, can bring her aunt to a story.

** I prefer Harry/Susan. linkffn(The Forgotten Contract) is very good and features some Hannah/Neville if you're set on Hannah.

  Susan discovers on her birthday she is betrothed to the Boy-Who-Lived. Can the two get over themselves and get to know each other and try to be friends? Possibly even more?
