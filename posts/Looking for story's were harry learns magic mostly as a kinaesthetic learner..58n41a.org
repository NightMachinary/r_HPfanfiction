**** Griphook is also the one being bribed by Dumbles to steal from Harry and keep him from his 9000% power boost. Harry needs to get to Ragnok, the manager of Gringotts and King of all goblins who is willing to see Harry because reasons, and giving a wizard child his inheritance power ritual.

***** Wouldn't he do it because he's also the account manager for the Potters and because Dumbledore violated some never-remembered-by-anyone and never-used-before rule by not telling Harry about his thirty vaults with eleventy bajilion Galleons and twelve expanded trunks and a stash of wands with dual and triple and whatever-ple cores of nonexistent animals and made of Martian wood and all the thirty betrothal contracts that Harry should have already responded to and gotten married, like, at 11 but didn't because Dumbles needs him to marry Snape and Draco and Lucius to Redeem™ them?

The goblins have a rarely used time chamber, which because Harry was polite and used their names, they decided to let him spend like 2-10 years in that chamber to learn all the knowledge they have horded because they are not allowed wands.

********* I do not know about the others, but I was just taking the most cringe-worthy variant I remembered from anywhere and putting that in. Assuming the others did that as well, it's in no way indicative of that but rather us poking fun at the worst we'd managed to step into at one time or another.

That said, the majority of fanfics are crap and that's that. But this is not about the fandom in any way or shape, but rather about the fact that most people writing that stuff, whatever the fandom, are neither very good at it nor inclined to write anything more than an immature wish fulfilment story ... thing.

PS. If you want the most cringe-worthy potion ever then it's probably the acorn potion, but I'm quite positive the goblins wouldn't have that piss.

*********** A horrible plot device from a story (called “Becoming Female”) that is probably close in its level of horribleness to that of “My Immortal”.

In this ... story, an “Acorn Potion” is a potion that, when prepared properly, causes random objects it is poured on to change into acorns, but when not prepared correctly it causes anyone who drinks it to permanently and irreversibly change into an idealised female version of themselves or other such rubbish. The amount of brain misuse (or disuse) that went into thinking up a potion that not only has completely different application methods for the normal stuff and the plot-required horrible nonsense, but also does nothing that they wouldn't already know how to do without potions by simply transfiguring stuff into the desired objects, makes one wonder if the one writing the story was on drugs or if it was something heavier than that (hint: it was probably a teenage girl, in love with the guy playing Draco, thinking with her genitals and writing the story in the middle of the night because she'd been forbidden the use of a computer as a punishment for failing school; her profile makes that theory quite easy to accept as true).

Brew the Acorn Potion correctly, it gives you nuts. If you don't correctly invert the polarity, it takes away your nuts instead.

**** I have read this one I find that Harry takes a more scientific approach to magic than what I am looking for.

I am looking for a harry that has a more instinctual and dynamic approach to magic.

With some sense for dramatics and showmanship. a bit like how Dumbledores duel goes at the end of fifth year.

I think that the duel at the end of fifth year between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of fifth year is my favourite in the whole series. and we never seen another duel quite like it again

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
