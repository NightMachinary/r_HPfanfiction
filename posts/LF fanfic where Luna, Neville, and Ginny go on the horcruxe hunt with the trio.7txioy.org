** That's such a rare request!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is as close as it gets, with Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville in a team [[/spoiler][Ron and Ginny were already killed by this point]].

Technically speaking, all Ministry Six participated in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8286141/1/Harry-Potter-Death-s-Ultimatum][Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum]], linkffn(8286141). But where as Neville, Ginny, and Luna entered, Ron and Hermione fell out of the hunt.
