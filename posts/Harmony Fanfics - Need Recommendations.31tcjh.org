Good evening,

I'm a lurker and I enjoy this sub very much. I really hope you all can help me because I have a serious problem. I've run out of material to read, I can't take any ship but Harry/Hermione seriously (It's a problem I've been trying to work around but I'm not seeing it for Harry/Ginny). Do you all have any recommendations?

*** I'll add on this and say Vox Corporis is one of the best, and the sweetest, fanfics I've ever read. Personal favorite.

Edit: I read all my fan fiction on my mobile so sorry about the mobile link.

** I'd highly recommend quite a few things on [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=toplist][portkey]].

I used to share your sentiments about not being able to take any ship but the HMS Harmony seriously, but then I branched out to include no-ship fics. =)

** This is a relatively new and very promising one, with interesting worldbuilding:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][/Patron/ by Starfox5]]: In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

--------------

Other fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] are also Harmony, but I've found his treatment of the canon setting to be downright hostile, so when he writes in what he sees as the canonverse, it often comes off as bashy, in a way that /Patron/, which he views as a heavy AU, does not.

*** Ugh. Only read "The Real Us" if you think it's charming to read about two sociopaths being enabled by everyone around them, and the author insisting that it's cute while graphically describing sex between 12-year-olds.
