All I remember is that its one of those cliches where Harry dies and meets a representative of death. Except this representative is female and servers an archangel and gets angry when Harry asks the archangel for another chance for not just him but the representative as well. In the end the archangel agrees but the representative is ties to Harry's life. Furthermore the oc representative is from America

  When Harry died he expected to meet his family not the Patron Saint of France. Thanks to a bit of meddling on her part the two are sent back to stop Voldemort's destruction of the world. Of course, this being Harry, something is bound to go wrong...like how his mother is suddenly alive or how friends are enemies and enemies are friends...

  Harry has died, again. This is his last shot, his last chance before he gets written off forever. This is his 48th life. But he is not alone, the game plan has changed and he's got a plan to fix everything. Hopefully while avoiding dying again. Death at his shoulder. Warnings language and possible mature situations later.
