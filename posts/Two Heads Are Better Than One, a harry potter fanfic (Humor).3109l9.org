** Hah i could tell which dirty old bastard it was just from the thumbnail. Even his obscure shit is funnier than 90% of fanfic. This is why I love nonjon.

** Nearly lost it at 'He likes to be called /'Mr. Norris'/. I really shouldn't read this sort of thing at work.

*** My favorite parts were the dick puns. Some find them hard to swallow, but I found they go down rather easy for me.

**** Some of the puns are a little odd, and I just couldn't get them. In the end I just stuck them in my head, swished them around a little bit, felt them on the end of my tongue, and after a while they popped and I got a full load of funny.
