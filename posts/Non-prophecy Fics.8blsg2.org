Looking for fics which have either Harry having a normal life with his parents. This would probably mean no war with voldermort or the lack of a prophecy causing Harrys not to have a family and a normal life. Fics which are similar to Rowlings books in that they show harrys hogwarts years would be ideal. Thanks

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

** I have written two fics. Missing Moments is a Potter family fic (Harry has a brother and sister, no war, no Voldy) starts when he meets Ginny, then goes through the stages of his life -buying an engagement ring, getting married, buying a house etc, and how his parents are a big part of his life. The second one is THE THINGS YOU DO FOR LOVE -its Hinny. Harry believes his grandparents are dying, and wish to see him and his sister in love before they die. His best friend Ginny offers to help by pretending they are in love to make their last days happy ones. Of course, along the way, they do fall in love. Grandparents, parents, a sister, Sirius, Remus and Tonks and Teddy all feature. Hope you'll check them out. All on ff.net SOrry still learning how to link xx

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

**** To be honest, I haven't read it yet because the 'good Draco' is mentioned in the summary of the sequel. However, it was very well taken at that time, so maybe I 'll read it sometime later.
