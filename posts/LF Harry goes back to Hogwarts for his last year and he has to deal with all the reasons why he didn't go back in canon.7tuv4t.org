I didn't love when Rowling said Harry and Ron chose not to go back to Hogwarts for their NEWTS, but when I really thought about it, I guess it made sense. Harry's celebrity would be off the charts and he would hate the amount of fawning and gratitude people constantly showered upon him. Plus, he definitely would've been ready to move on and taking classes would appear like a step back.

The only good thing would be Ginny and perhaps Qudditch.

With that in mind, are there any fics out there with a reluctant Harry going back to school and clearly not being too thrilled about the whole situation, mainly the extra attention and just the feeling of wanting to move on with his life? Perhaps a more realistic portrayal of what it would be like for him? I'd strongly prefer him to be with Ginny and not really mess with their relationship. Ron and Hermione can be a mess, however.


** I would love to read a totally canon year 7 after Deathly Hallows too!!! :)

** "Everything In Transit" is about a reluctant Ron and Harry returning for their 7th year. Kingsley was unable to pass a new law that would've let wizards and witches with adequate OWL marks to enter the auror program if they had fought the dark arts. So since that law didn't pass, Ron and Harry had to return to Hogwarts.

Main characters are Ron and Hermione, but Ginny and Harry are still important characters. Parings are R/Hr and H/G.

  Hermione is returning to Hogwarts as Head Girl, and Ron, due to circumstances currently out of his control, has to go with her if he ever hopes to become an Auror... but they're about to learn that going back is more difficult than they imagined. Rated M for sexual content in later chapters.

**** Lol, this fic was actually the reason I posted this topic. I did enjoy it, but since it focused more on Ron and Hermione, I wanted to see if there was a similar fic from Harry's POV.
