i wrote this fic in a few days after being inspired by a bunch of great jily fics and netflix teen movies, and i'd love for y'all to read it, review it, and subscribe to it if you like it! link in comments.

Summary: Lily Evans keeps her feelings hidden away in her treasured journals. When they mysteriously fall into the wrong hands, can she keep her feelings separate from her real life? A Lily/James fake dating fic filled with romcom tropes!

** Saw this earlier in my typical ao3 filters, but didn't read it since I generally don't read Jily. It did make me curious about who this supposed 3rd person that Lily had feelings for was though.
