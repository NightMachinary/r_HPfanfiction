:END:
hi, y'all. could you help me find this certain fanfiction i've read in the past. like, i've been looking all over for it for ages but i have yet to find it.

the fanfiction:

harry decides to pretend to be crazy or something during the summer and he goes to school. he's also obsessed with trains. the pairing of the fanfic is drarry (draco/harry). draco also likes to crossdress and in the end they get married, and they fly away with the train as harry holds draco bridal style, i think, and tells everyone he's not actually crazy but he does love trains and draco.

thanks in advance.


** What.

I have to see this trainwreck.
