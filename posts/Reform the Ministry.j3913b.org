I'm writing a fanfiction set in the Marauders Era and I need ideas to reform the Ministry.

A few ideas I have are a separation of the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The creation of a legislature perhaps called the Council of Wizards.

It's my assumption that Laws are written and enforced by the Ministry whilst the Wizengamot is a Court.

Another one is passing a charter that enshrines basic rights for sentient beings like House Elves. In the sense that House Elves cannot be mistreated.

Make Due process a thing. That you can't arrest a person without sufficient evidence.


** Simplest thing I can think of is veritaserum and compulsion checks being required every time someone walks in. Maybe have something like The Thief's Downfall at every entrance, make sure someone is who they say they are and will do what they say they are there to do. Laws against Wizarding Supremacy groups. One of those underage magic detector-type things or a Taboo set to all of the Unforgivables. The Wizarding World is so ass-backward that any modern laws against discrimination would turn it on its head.

*** Veritaserum would get expensive quickly, especially since there are actions you can take to prevent it from working. There's also the ethical concern to think of.

A thief's downfall makes sense, but we don't know how hard they are to obtain, and the cost of doing so.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hpsi4w/is_wizarding_britain_backwards/]] is a thread that discusses the wizarding world. Suffice it to say that "backwards" is not as cut and dry of an issue as you make it out to be.
