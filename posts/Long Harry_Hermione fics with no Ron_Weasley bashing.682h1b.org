Seems to me that almost every H/Hr fic I read includes a form of Ron/Weasley family bashing. Harry and Hermione get together, and suddenly Ron becomes an ass, or he dies, etc. Are there any popular, long fics that are centered around H/Hr but keep the trio strong? Any that continue the actual story of the original series, but with H/Hr together?


** Following H/Hr fics all have Ron in very sympathetic roles:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362), and its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]]

I don't know whether you are receptive to Trio in a romantic relationship, but this is actually my favorite non-canon pairing. You may want to take a look at those:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), is the only romantic Trio fic that has a great plot and is not an one-shot. Flashbacks of the War and fleet actions are excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a great story in itself, and Trio's love and friendship is a central theme. However, there is no word about romance between them, other than that they live and sleep together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][Chapter 16, The Damned]] of "The random craziness file", linkffn(8222091), could be a great romantic Trio fic if someone fully fleshed it out.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]], linkao3(No Boundaries), is suitable for pure smut.

** My favourite H/HR has no Ron bashing. He is mostly written out, but he isn't really bashed. linkffn(11916243) . It isn't entirely what you ask for, since it is AU instead of a continution, but still :).

I also second @starfox5 Patron. He linked it already.

And I also second The Sum of Their Parts. Not a romance, but a excellent continuation. No romance it it at all really. It is more of a H/Hr/R adventure fic.

**** Ehh, I wouldn't call what is there as even light Ron bashing. He gets jealous/bitter, but he gets over it pretty fast as I recall, and nothing inconsistent with his characterization in the books.

There is certainly Dumblebashing, since he is basically a villain in it. It's been a while since I read it, so I may have just not recalled any MollyBashing

Aaaaand a quick scan indicates that the reconciliation came later than I remembered. Maybe I was conflating it with the postitive!percy in that fic or amyabe another fic. I donno.

** I don't bash Ron (or the other Weasleys) in my stories, and in my H/Hr stories, he's usually their best friend, and often a hero (though he doesn't always start out that way).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
