[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3111215][Found here]], written by dirgewithoutmusic. It's a small, informally written story about a Squib who wiggles their way through Hogwarts.

While I don't think it would actually work for several reasons (it's unknown if Squibs can interact with the Sorting Hat or create functional potions and their exams have all sorts of practical components), I nevertheless enjoyed it. It's definitely "you can achieve, if you just believe!" so it's short length is good for keeping the diabetes away.

What did you think of the short story? Also, this makes me want to read fanfiction about Squibs, their struggles, and their place in the magical community. Any recs?


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086][Almost a Squib]]/ (50k words, complete): Harry has barely any magical power. As the author says: "I have tried hard not to let this become a canon-bashing story, or a crack-fic, but some bits have slipped through!"

  Angus Buchanan was born on 15 January, 1847, to the Pure-blood Buchanan family, in a village in the Scottish Borders. He grew up in a household comprised of an overworked mother, a a fierce father, and eleven children. He was the third son, the largest and kindest of them all. Angus spent much of his early childhood dodging curses on an almost daily basis. However, he enjoyed a good relationship with his brothers and sisters, who were all very fond of him --- he would, years later, attribute his aptitude for cricket to the years of helping his siblings catch Golden Snitches in their back garden.

*** So the Sorting Hat /can/ speak to Squibs! Good to know. I wonder if it can also be heard by Muggles?

**** My head canon is that squibs have some magic but not enough to use magic themselves. Just enough to not be effected by muggle repelling charms, hence Argus Filch.
