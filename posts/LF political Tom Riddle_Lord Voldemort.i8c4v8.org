I'm looking for fanfiction where either Tom Riddle has taken a political route or Voldemort has an established government. My prefered pairing is Harry Potter/Tom Riddle-Voldemort.


** I think Lomonaaren has something like that. "His darkest devotion"

I have no idea how to link it but hope this helped!

** Linkao3(Again and Again by Athy)

Harry is extremely old and has been stuck reliving his life while trying to figure out how to stop it. He's at the end his rope and basically decides fuck it, maybe Voldemort needs to win for him to die.

In this fic, Voldemort was never an angel by any means, but continually splitting his soul rocketed him over the edge into being violently insane. Harry sort of forces Voldemort to undo to the damage. When that happens Voldemort goes back from being a terrorist to being primarily a shady political activist.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

** "Children of the Revolution" from AlexisVV on FF.net might be something. It is still ongoing though.

And then there is of course "Victory Day" by WhiteWave 14 also on FF.net. This one is completed

Both are more of "Voldemort won" type of stories.
