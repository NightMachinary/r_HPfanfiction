** You posted this same request 8 hours ago. If no one had any fics for you then, why would you expect different responses now?

*** Sorry, I'm used to fast moving subreddits ðŸ˜“. And this request was more vague and open than the last one. This one is just about third year whether at the start, the middle, or the end. While the other was just about when harry got his broom taken away by Hermione.

** Instead of re-posting this nonsense four more times, why don't you google it. Since you're already used to fast-moving subs, the microsecond-long response of a search engine should be right up your alley.

*** Because it pops up with limited ones; usually ones that have 6 to 20 chapters and been around for years, then the author just stopped writing and up and left ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”. Prolly cause they got writers block; but it would be nice to see if anyone else knew any stories like that, that are finished or currently being updated.
