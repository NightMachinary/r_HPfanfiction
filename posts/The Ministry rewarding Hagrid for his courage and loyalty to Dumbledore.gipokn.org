** I feel bad. That's like, not going to happen. The ministry is terrible. They are corrupt arse kissers and if they help a 'filthy half-breed', people like Malfoy and Nott will bring down their wrath.

**** When they're in the Hut on the rock Vernon insults Dumbledore Dudley who at this point had never spoken a word was huddling in the corner terrified out his mind and Hagrid uses a spell to give him a pig's tail he was trying to turn him into a pig he abused as a child because their parents pissed him off Dudley had to get surgery to have it removed Hagrid is a piece of shit

***** I don't really think that says much about hagrids character - or rather, it wasn't intended to say much. At that point, the first book was very definitely aimed at children, and the pigs tail was humor that would appeal to that audience. Of course older people would see the larger implications, but most children's books have even more ludicrous things. Also if you think about hagrids character-- he's definitely simple minded to some extent because of his giant heritage (not being prejudice, source: Grawp) and his lack of socialising from third year onward is definitely a factor. I'm not trying to justify what he did to Dudley though because that shit is messed.

****** If I beat the shit out of a child and my excuse is that he was mean to his cousin I would go to jail for decades this is literally no different Hagrid has never spoken to the durslys before now and he doesn't know anything about how Dudley treated Harry so the only thing he could possibly assume is because his parents didn't like him that he didn't either he has no proof that he bullied him he has no reason to think he did everything he did was completely was unjustifiable

******** He didn't lose his temper if he did he would have attacked Vernon he wanted to hurt Vernon and petunia but he was too much of a fucking coward to attack them is he knew that if he did Dumbledore would find out he is a piece of shit and the fact JK rolling thought that the pigtail was funny means that she is too
