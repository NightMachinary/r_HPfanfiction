So, unfortunately, a lot of 'magical' architecture in fanfiction just seems to be 'Big Sprawling Manor with too many floors' like someone used Money Cheats in the Sims to build a big house that's Even Bigger^{TM} on the inside. With the best will in the world, that doesn't feel very Magical to me. Like the Burrow in the books /felt/ Magical. Hogwarts - in the beginning, at least - felt Magical. The Tardis Mansions just... don't.

So firstly, the *request* - I'm looking for fics with buildings that do *feel Magical*. Could be Hogwarts having interesting construction secrets, extra-dimensional wizards towers, or even the generic 'big sprawling manor', so long as it feels Magical to you. Hell, could just be Bloody Stupid Johnson levels of weirdness where third floor windows look out of the seventh floor's view, or maybe it has interesting things living or existing in it (a la Grimmauld Place).

Secondly, *how* would you make buildings *feel more Magical and Interesting*? So they're not just Tardises or Old Country Manors.

For example, the Telvanni Towers in Morrowind are giant mushrooms that you have to levitate yourself through to traverse. There was also that fic where the rooms in Grimmauld Place could be swapped about at whim, with some remaining in storage when they weren't needed. That kind of thing added an interesting twist to a generic building.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Durmstrang does not actually have a campus. That's the secret location. There are random rooms across the world, connected by random hallways elsewhere, mostly in central Europe, that are vaguely linked together. Sometimes.

There is a great hall n northern Norway and a quidditch pitch in Poland. Students live at their homes, and floo to a village some distance away and then enter the school from that village. They will typically use this village as their public surname, for example [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Krum_(village)]] and [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindelwald]]

*** That's a brilliant idea. I definitely agree that would be an effective way of dealing with the conflicts Durmstrang's catchment area would cause, but I also agree with tilman that maybe students flooing in would be a quick way to lose that secrecy. Maybe if they had a door in their homes or villages that accessed a dorm/entry corridor, which they could then use to access the random rooms? That might be a little more secrecy-maintaining?

Still though, that's a really good idea. :)

** One thing I've done in Victoria Potter is give wizarding houses have a "skydoor". The idea is that wizards will just as often arrive at each other's houses via air than land, so it's not unusual for houses to be built in a vertically symmetrical way:

Skydoor

Entrance hall

Living areas

Bedrooms

Living areas

Entrance hall

Front door

#+begin_quote
  ...just as they were clearing away their plates, a heavy thump came from the top of the house. Petunia shrieked, dropping a glass which smashed loudly on the floor, and a moment later footsteps could be heard coming from directly above them. A man's voice followed, drifting in through the open kitchen window:

  "I say!" he said, and the voice sounded familiar to Victoria, though she couldn't place it. "Where's their skydoor?"

  "Maybe Muggles don't have skydoors," responded the voice of Susan Bones, Victoria's best friend. "They don't have brooms, do they?"

  An "eep!" of happiness escaped Victoria's lips and she jumped up from table. "Excuse me!" she cried, hurrying out the kitchen door and into the back garden.

  "Now, Susan, don't be prejudiced," Mr Bones was saying, his voice coming from high above, "the Muggles know how to fly, there was a programme about it on the wireless."

  He was standing on the roof, balancing awkwardly on the sloped tiles. Mr Bones was tall and lanky, with coppery-red hair like his daughter, and was wearing beige, linen robes suited to the summer heat. Floating next to him was an extremely long broom with three saddles down its length. Susan was sitting in the middle saddle, waving down at Victoria with a grin on her face, her long hair tied up in a bun.

  "Ho there!" Mr Bones called, spotting Victoria in the garden below. "Where's your skydoor?"

  Victoria had never heard of skydoors, but she could easily figure out what they were. "We don't have one! Can't you come down?"

  "Told you!" Susan said, sticking her tongue out at her dad.

  "Yes, yes," he said in a long-suffering tone. "Be down in a tick!"

  [...]

  ...they shot down towards a tall, irregularly shaped building on the east bank of the river. A water wheel jutted out from its side, turning steadily in the rapid current, and ivy grew all over the stone walls. The house---for surely this was where Susan lived---was surrounded by vegetable plots, and beyond them were fields in which a handful of cows grazed. There wasn't a road or electricity pylon in sight.

  A flat platform occupied around half of the roof, almost like a Muggle helicopter pad. They circled it as would a carrion bird, each circuit bringing them closer, spiraling downward until they were coming in to land. When they did, Victoria jumped off the broom eagerly, her weak legs rejoicing at the feel of solid stone beneath her feet.

  "Perfect landing!" Mr Bones said with satisfaction, taking off his goggles and running a hand through his hair.

  Susan dismounted casually. She looked windswept, with rosy cheeks and hair coming loose from her bun, but she didn't wobble in the slightest as she got off the broom. "Well done, Dad. Much better than last time."

  Mr Bones coughed. "Yes, well, we won't mention that one to your mother when she visits."

  Victoria listened to their conversation with alarm. What had happened the last time?

** I did a lesser thing in one of my stories* where one of the third-floor corridors in a side-wing somehow inverted and opened up as it passed across the ceiling of the Entrance Hall, allowing anyone in the corridor to look up and see people in the entrance looking back up at them in turn.

i also had a looping square staircase with seven landings, all of which led to a different non-sequential floor, meaning that (for example) it was possible to go down one flight of stairs in order to get from the second floor to the sixth.

Other tricks included stairs that led to a different place when you went down after going up and doors that opened up on the opposite side of Hogwarts.

Things like that are quite fun to come up with and you don't have to explain them in any great depth, since "magic distorts reality when in sufficient quantities" generally suffices. Barring that, "A Wizard Did It".

***** Dankeschon. So, how much Superman/other superhero stuff would I need to know to read the fic?

I watched a few seasons of Smallville back in the day, so I have the general gist of things - Alien planet blew up, Superman got shot off into space and landed on Earth, sun gives him powers, he got adopted by a couple of kansas farmers and was angsty for several years, he gets affected by weird rocks, his enemy is Lex Luthor - but that's basically it. And my knowledge of other superhero stuff is very, very limited.

** Geometry that looks normal at the first sight, but doesn't /quite/ make sense.

A trapdoor in the middle of the third floor with a hole several stories down, even though the second floor below doesn't have anything like that.

A staircase that goes up for forever even though the tower it is in is finite. Maybe involving some fancy arithmancy to teach the readers about infinite converging series.

Rectangular rooms where the sides aren't the same length, but all the angles are normal.

Add "unrealistic" elements. Like, you have a place close to the arctic circle? Add some floating ice shards or a permanent snowstorm surrounding the premise. Likewise, permanent fog surrounding a hill, forest or bog make the whole thing seem more supernatural. Also, throw in some creepy lighting. Those ice shards I mentioned earlier glow in a faint blue, the permanent fog has random flashes of light and so on.

Parts of the place are stone walls and enchanted torches like an ancient castle, others are bare steel cause they were built when money was in short supply, and the latest additions look like the headquarters of a silicon valley tech company with lots of glass, concrete, potted plants, air conditioning and WiFi. The worldbuilding is mostly done, I don't have a decent plot outline yet though.

**** No you can go into any of them and come out of any of them. There's multiple doors to allow more than one interaction to happen at a time.

Every person could walk directly into their homes from one door and leave from one door it would just create issues where it would have to be closed in order to reset. So multiple doors.

Allowing an apartment building to not build hallways and stairs. And also save time. Fire hazard for sure but regardless

So much of magical architecture seems to be about creating something strange and neat as opposed to using the reality bending properties to make something more efficient.

***** Ah, okay. That would be cool. Kind of how I imagine Gringotts, actually. The Goblins live in a city elsewhere, they just have little hidden hatch doors like Tucker's Kobolds that they use to get from the exit gate of the city to the Bank proper. :)

That would be a good way to do this, actually. Sit down and think of the things that people need in residences and the way residences provide and do things and see how a magical approach could make that more efficient. Very psychogeographical. :)

** Would be cool to have a Howls Moving Castle type architecture. Seems like some other people have mentioned the vanishing cabinet doors which is actually pretty similar to The House of Many Ways also by Jones. In it, the doors can link to multiple places depending on things like what you opened it with and whether it was a Tuesday and so on.

**** That is a funny coincidence! I think what I liked most about the moving castle was that it existed in sort of a 3rd space. One window looks out into the capital and another to Wales. While the "castle" moves, it's arguably only the entrance that moves because most of the interior physically exists somewhere else (as shown when they move to the flower shop). So it moves and stays stationary and it's weird and I love it.

****** I guess the issue there would be that doors work both ways. So like I wouldn't want my door to connect to the Leaky Cauldron cuz then the Leaky Cauldron would connect to my house. I guess that's assuming it's a permanent connection requiring both sides to have access (like the floo or a vanishing cabinet). If it wasn't permanent I'm not sure how you would get back.

******** My personal magical policy is that nothing is unbreakable/untrickable. If someone wants in they'll eventually get in so it's better for the connection to not exist in the first place. On the other hand my personal non magical policy is that your gouse just has to be less easy to break into than the neighbors. I suppose I assume I would be cooler and therefore more of a direct target in the magical world.

********* Interesting idea. That is the basic psychology of casing the joint, though. You don't have to be unbreakable/untrickable, you just have to appear unbreakable/untrickable enough that breaking in/tricking the system isn't worth the effort. It's more deterrent than preventative. :)

So, you have that foyer drop people into a labyrinth that you can't apparate out of, with every exit leading to somewhere more dire and far away from your home. You just gotta make your home appear well-secured and not full of riches, so they won't go after it. :)

If you're the direct target, then they'll just follow you into an alley and hit you with a wrench when you aren't looking. :)

Full Metal Alchemist, there's a character named Winry who's a mechanic and throws wrenches. The crossovers with HP are hilarious because the MC (Ed) is obsessed with alchemy, which is entirely based on science. He finds the concept of magic absurd, but in the fics he'll often end up reaching alchemy at Hogwarts.

** You know what I've never seen in fics? Animated frescos (imagine if the Sistine Chapel's ceiling was animated) and optical illusion/magical illusion paintings which are actually secret passages. My second idea I've seen executed but differently and is similar to Taure's skydoor, but I think a house's entrance hall should be centred just as much around the fireplace as the door because Floo is very often when it comes to friends and families and if someone lives in a Muggle area, say London, it would be preferable to pass by using the Floo instead of apparating at the front door where all the Muggles can see.

That's... a really good point. Why have we never seen those? That definitely seems like the sort of thing a Rich-To-The-Point-Of-Pointlessness Indy!Harry would have lining the walls of his Floo-room, at least. I have seen one 'optical illusion' secret passage painting - It was basically just the Hogwarts Kitchen door with a bit of extra layering on it.

Also a very good idea. Really ties in to the 'practical elements of efficiency' thing someone else in this thread mentioned. You want a house that makes it easier for you to do the things you need to do, and getting in and out of it would definitely be one of those things - especially with floo and apparition and such.
