Hi, I'm looking for some Draco centric fics. Pairings: Draco/Tom Riddle, Draco/Voldemort. Doesn't have to be romanic. Mentor fic, psued father-son relationship, and other platonic themes welcome. Time travel, AUs. Anything really. I just really want to read Draco and Voldemort/Tom. Please and thank you!!


** You could ask this over in [[/r/hpslashfic]] and it might get a better response
