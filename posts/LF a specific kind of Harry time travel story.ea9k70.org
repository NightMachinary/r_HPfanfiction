I read a my little pony time travel story called mlp loops ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9216685/1/MLP-Loops]]) and I was wondering if anyone had done something similar with Harry Potter where he's endlessly stuck in a time loop taking him to random points in his years at Hogwarts over and over again. Sometimes happening exactly as it did and sometimes being an AU and he's bored with redoing it so much so he starts doing crazy over the top things in each timeline. Anything at all like that in the world of Harry Potter fanfiction? I'd love to read one if there is. Thanks!


** The MLP loops are [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][Innortal-style Time Loops]], which all kinda take place in the same multiverse. They were started by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/681915/Innortal][Innortal]], and other writers expanded the idea into other universes. Harry Potter is actually one of the original seven looping worlds. You can find Innortal's original Harry Potter loops in linkffn(3761766), starting chapter 7.

Personally, I think the MLP loops are much better, but there ya go.

** There was one that was never completed. Amazing but sadly even the first loop isn't done. Linkffn(time warp)
