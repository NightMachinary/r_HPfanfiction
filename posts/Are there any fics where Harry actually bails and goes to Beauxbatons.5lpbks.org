**** I like it so far. You may want to find someone to beta-read it though, I've seen a few minor mistakes. Longer chapters would also not go amiss.

But most of all, /why are the Veela glowing?/ The fuck is up with that one?

***** Chapters are progressively getting longer, I'm probably settling around 4k-6k words per chapter because that's the easiest way for me to block out work for myself.

The Veela aren't glowing, you just think they are. Chapter 8 gives some hints on why that is, but I haven't finished Chapter 8 yet.

I do have a beta, though when I first started writing, I was writing quick and haphazardly, things should get better. This is my first fic ever, and my first ever attempt at REALLY writing, so I'm experiencing a few growing pains.

Thanks for commenting.

**** I enjoyed what was there. Only issue for me is there was too much Hogwarts bashing in general. Even Dumbledore bashed Hogwarts! Don't get me wrong, I was THRILLED TO BITS that Dumbledore wasn't gonna be all "I have to get Harry back to meet my PLAN mwahahaha", but the level of Hogwarts and Britain bashing seemed unnecessary.

I look forward to seeing where it goes but I tend to side with [[/u/Taure]] on the level of governmental and educational function/dysfunction in the HPverse and you seem to be more on the "Hogwarts and Ministry are just so stupid, amiright" fanfiction train that seems very common.

So my recommendation is to tone that down and focus more on the world building in Beauxbatons. Also, maybe less on the theme that mind magic is all powerful?

Anyway, I did enjoy it, just wanted to leave a bit of constructive criticism. Good luck!

****** Sure, I figured that, and noticed the foreshadowing, but it's still very distracting IMO. What's there feels heavy handed...I don't think there's a chapter that doesn't include some comment about the stupidity of Britain. And if the curse is so bad and can't be removed or alleviated, why do people still live there?

I'm sure you'll go into more detail as time goes on, but these are the sort of questions that pop into my head.

******* I actually have answers to those questions, and the Britain bashing should drop off very quickly here soon, I just had to have a real justification for why Harry doesn't just skedaddle back to Britain, Beauxbatons really has to be better!

I also spent more time writing than thinking earlier on, my update schedule has vastly reduced as I've tried to outline more of the plot. After all this was initially just an off the cuff response to a prompt here.

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.

** Ive asked this same thing multiple times here [[/u/Ironshards]]... sadly the only one that ever seems to get linked is "The Accidental Bond" which has been linked here already.

Don't be a Dobby Downer is well worth a read too but its brand spanking new. I am looking forward to great things from it... terrible... but great ;)

I do hope more FF authors see these requests and explore the idea of Harry at other schools more in the future. There are a few out there but so very few and only the 1 or 2 Beauxbatons ones which is so disappoint. Ive tried to write myself but struggle as my creativity lies more in drawing/painting then writing.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** I'll unhelpfully say 'I've read one but I don't remember the title' - as encouragement to keep looking. It's out there. I'll update if I can hunt it down.

P.S. I can't swear that it's /good/, but don't take the fact that I can't remember the particulars either way. I have a horrible memory.

[edit] P.P.S. I think Harry (and Hermione?) transfer to Beauxbaton's when his name comes out of the Goblet and he refuses to participate... Or, he transfers in anticipation of another bad year at Hogwarts and gets sucked into the tournament anyway...
