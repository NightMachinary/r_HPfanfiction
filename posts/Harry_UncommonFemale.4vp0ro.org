Hello [[/r/HPfanfiction]] .

I'm in search of uncommon het pairings. I really enjoyed JBerns The Lie I've Lived, IBidYouAdieus Lessons (which, as an aside, seems to have vanished.) I'm looking for some other novel length (preferably) well written stories that feature Harry paired with a less common female.

That is to say - Not Hermione, Ginny or Luna.

Beyond that, genre doesn't particularly matter.

Thanks!


** Er, Luna doesn't count as uncommon? If anything, she's falls on the rare end of the spectrum, rather than common.

*** I'd say she's fairly common. I'd put uncommon as Cho, Narcissa, Petunia, Fem!Harry, Parvati and that lot. Rare is more like Lisa Turpin, Myrtle, Trelawney, Mandy Brocklehurst and so on.

**** I've never found a nice, long, and good Harry/Luna fic. I've found some, but they don't keep me reading.

Do you know of any good ones?

***** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help Of a Seer]]. If you don't like Harry/multi, or sexpot Luna, it's probably your best bet. I'm not sure I'd say it's wonderful. It's just the best of the Harry/Luna options.

******** Too true. I remember reading a fic called Lord of the Marauders, absolute crackfic but it was an amazing read. I still laugh when I think about how the Order of the Blacks got all badass and mucked up dear old Dumbles and Tommy boy.
