** I'm not writing this right now, maybe someday

"Hello /Potter/."

Harry froze. Turning around, he met the eyes of Tom Riddle, no longer snake-like but rather like his sixteen year old self. "You," he echoed in disbelief. "But...you're dead! I killed you."

"Indeed. But the fates are adamant on torturing us both, I'm stuck here."

"You're joking," Harry said after a minute of silence. "You can't be stuck here."

"Believe me, Potter, I'd rather not be but I have no choice," Tom was evidently unhappy as well. "And I wouldn't go telling anyone else, either."

That made Harry pause. "Why not?"

"Because they can't see or hear me. I'm afraid only you can."

Harry eyed him warily. "And, erm, how long are you stuck here for?"

Tom was inspecting a well cared for nail. "They didn't say."

Harry flopped down on his bed, wishing for once his life could be normal.


** Pls. Love this. Anything with miserable Tom is great. You must write it.

The end of the first day would be like:

  He slammed the door behind him and Tom floated right through it, unfazed by the passive aggression.

  "Please go away," he pleaded.

  "Why?"

  "Because I want to be alone."

  "Why?"

  "You are a ghost. You are an /invisible/ ghost. You could go anywhere else and no one would bother you. Why don't you just leave?"

  "I thought the reason would be obvious."

  Harry sighed. "Obvious?"

  "Yes. Though, I may have forgotten whom I'm talking to. You never were particularly bright."

  There was a book on his bedstand that he was itching to grab and throw right through Tom's smug, handsome arsehole face. "Shut up and go away."

  "No."

  "Go away!"

  "Why do you want to be alone all the sudden? You've been talking to me all day so far- oh." Tom's look of confusion turned into one of disgust.

  "What?"

  "You could have just said."

  "Said what?"

  Tom shrugged. "If you wanted to have a wank-"

  "THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS DOING!"

*** I definitely will at some point. I've had this idea for a couple years now but when I tried writing it I was stuck on the first chapter, which would be Tom in limbo with Death and Fate where he gets assigned his punishment. My plan is definitely for them to become friends at some point, after they drive each other mad in the process. And it would be an AU, where Fred is alive, Harry and Ginny don't get together, etc

Right now I have 2 HP WIPs and I want to finish those or at least one before I post another (just so I know I'll finish it) but when I do post it I'll definitely let you know! :)

Also I love that ^ üòÇüòÇ

** I remember reading a fic sorta like this except it was Snape purposely haunting James after committing Werewolf assisted suicide because he hated his life so much and just wanted to see the Marauders get what he believed they deserved. Ends with him telling Dumbledore Mcgonagall and James how much he hates them and then he passes on
