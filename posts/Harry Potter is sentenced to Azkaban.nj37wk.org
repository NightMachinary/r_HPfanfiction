It wasn't because he was framed for murder. It wasn't because he took the fall for the Chamber of Secrets. No, Harry was convicted of selling a class one illicit and hazardous substance, Basalisk venom. Who would have guessed there was legislation against selling the strongest poison known to man?


** Yeah but I always assumed it had to go through a shit ton of venting, like professional arms dealers and such. I thought most authors just don't show this. Think of how many potions ingredients are probably pretty deadly.

Or he just sells it on the black market which could be a good start to this story

*** He usually calls in the Goblins, who it seems are perfectly happy to cut up and sell on basilisk parts and pay him shedloads of galleons in return for them.

**** Yep and he, of course, saves some of the skin for himself to make some totally cool basilisk skin armor

** will be a hard sell in explaining why Harry would do this and how he even managed to get it safely, considering the venom can destroy horcruxes, a near invulnerable substance.

Also... minor thing: Poison is bad when you swallow it. Venom is bad when it is injected into your body. It is basilisk venom.

*** Almost. Venom needs to get into your /blood stream/, poison does not: you can eat it, inhale it, or touch it. You don't have to eat poison ivy to be effected by it after all, and it's also a bad idea to toss it into the fire pit.

Theoretically, you could drink a pint of cobra venom and be fine... though I don't think anyone's ever been willing to give it a go.

There are ways to store acids and such safely using special alloys. Monel comes to mind: it's used for piping and vessels that contain hydrofluoric acid. And HF is /really, REALLY/ nasty stuff. And frankly, basilisk venom acts like an acidic or caustic substance and could theoretically be classified as both poisonous and venomous.

**** Plus there is a good chance that the person may have minor internal wounds between their mouths and bowels, not really life-threatening or even noticeable, but enough to provide the poison a direct pathway to the bloodstream, hence why few people actually do voluntarily drink venom even though it is technically not as dangerous.

*** If you bite it and you die it was poisonous, if it bites you and you die it's venomous.

If you bite each other and no one dies...... it's a kink?

** Eh, every story I've seen where the basilisk gets cut up and sold, Harry wasn't doing it alone, it was being organized through adults. Eg Nightmares of Futures Past, where Slughorn arranges it, or The Pureblood Pretense, where Professor Snape does (though Harry gets to control the proceeds in both stories).

Presumably both of those men are well familiar with the relevant regulations and licensing for rare parts.
