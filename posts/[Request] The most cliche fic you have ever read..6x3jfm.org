I just need a laugh or something to bore me to death.


** I'm rather enjoying the WIP Harry Potter and the Daft Morons. It's more Robst than Robst.

*** Everything Sinyk writes is cliched to the depths of fucking hell.

Beyond the endless cliches and stereotypical pairings, his plots aren't bad and his writing is high quality and easy to follow.

**** I sometimes just go to his profile to have a wholesome laugh at his summaries. He just reminds me of that really adorable rebellious little niece or nephew who is constantly on the brink of being annoying, but isn't, because they're just so cute and innocent and idealistic.

Yes I'm aware that that makes me sound weird. No I don't care that it does. Yes I'm aware that the previous sentence is ironic. Fun.

***** Sinyk has written some pretty good stories.

Up until he betrothed Harry and Hermione in Daft Morons.

What the fuck dude.

** Definitely Harry Crow. It was the second fic I ever read (the first, obviously, being HPMOR), and it only took me like 70 chapters to realize it wasn't very good...

** Linkffn(harry potter and the manipulator of destiny) is pretty cliche-riffic. But still fun.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE
