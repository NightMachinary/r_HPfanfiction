I have recently taken to a fic called Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver and he had a mechanic where the use of the Patronus Charm essentially wears on the memory used, staining it with dread and essentially degrading the memory until it's useless for the spell. Anyone else come across an interesting/cool mechanic in other fics?
