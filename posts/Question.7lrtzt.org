I'm planning another story about the daughter of Silas Cracknell changed to his mum Ellen's maiden name after her divorce from Orford and estrangement from her daughter Dolores in 1965. He meets Clare Johnson in 1967 and they begin dating a year later at 16/17. They get married in 1971, move to America and have a daughter two years later named Josephine 'Jo'.

Do you think 'Jo' would hear stories about her estranged grandfather Orford Umbridge and her estranged aunt Dolores Umbridge? Or is that too much of a stretch?


** I had to read this a few times before I realized that this is actually Harry Potter related, haha. But to answer your question, I do think it would be a stretch. Jo may hear snippets of information about Dolores but I would imagine it would be accidental, like she comes across the name in her fathers writings or something like that.

*** Or she could come across a picture with her sisters during the summer. They spend every summer in the UK with their Granny Ellen
