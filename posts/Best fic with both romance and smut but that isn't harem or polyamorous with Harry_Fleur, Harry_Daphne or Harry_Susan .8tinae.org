I'm ok with fem!Harry.

EDIT:Oh, I think there may be some misunderstanding from the way I wrote the tittle, the pairings that I want ARE Harry/Fleur, Daphne or Susan, I'm not asking for fics without them. Sorry.

*** Yeah, this was one the fics that I had in mind when I wrote the post, something similar, but perhaps with a bit more plot than that.

** One of the best with Fleur I've read is A Cadmean Victory. linkffn(11446957) It does have its cringe worthy moments, but come on, this is fanfiction, not pro work. The author does try to explain those moments, but the explanation is shaky at best.

Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194) is a very good story, don't bother with what the little shits at DLP say about it. The romance is a very minimal part of the story though, and it features Fleur as a secondary character. There are a couple of Daphne moments, but that's it.

*** While at first I enjoyed Cadmean, after reading more fanfics (it was the first Harry/Fleur fic I've read, at the time) it became clear how edgy and quite tropy it is, something I don't like.

For me, the takeaways of this fic are Fleur's personality, which I liked very much, even if it is a bit cliche'd, and Harry's relationship with Salazar. The scene where Harry sacrifices the portrait was really sad and moving.

Overall, Its enjoyable, but I wouldn't re-read it. Not to mention that there's 0 smut, which i asked for.

Magicks is a fic where I couldn't handle after reading past the Yule Ball. I'm a huge fan of Harry/Daphne, and the way the author treated her just made me ragequit. THAT being said, after a friend sent me a future chapter where there's a 4-way-battle between Harry, Dumbledore, Grindewald and Voldy, it sparked my interest, because it was so fucking well written.

So now its in my reserve fics to read after I'm done with what I'm reading. AFAIK there isn't smut too, though its a bit more raunchy than Cadmean.

Thanks for the suggestion though.

**** I'm a fan of H/D as well, but as I understand it, that is very similar to how regular teenagers behave in the West. The 4 way battle doesn't involve Grindelwald, it's an undead warlock that Voldemort brings back to life. Has a name of Balthazar or something.

Well, if you really want smut badly, check out Harry Potter and the Siren's Song linkffn(6307611). There's plot too. H/D

For H/F, check this one. linkffn(11956676). Lel.

James Spookie has a few H/D fics and there is one scene each in them (I think - haven't read his stories in a while), but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night][this one]] as well. It's a harem one, H/S/D/F, and there is smut. Writing wise, its pretty meh.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
