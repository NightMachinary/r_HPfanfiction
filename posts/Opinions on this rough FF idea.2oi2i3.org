Everyone knows that Lord Voldemort is broken and shattered inside. That he is incapable of feeling love or care for another person. That he hates everyone, views himself above everyone. That his ambition relentlessly drives him in a never-ending quest for power and knowledge, pushing himself far outside the boundaries of humanity, searching for some kind of crescendo, some kind of metamorphosis. That no one will ever be worthy of him, because he is a genius, and he is alone, so far alone, so high up on a pinnacle that he can no longer even see the ground, but it doesn't matter because he is always looking up up up, always reaching for something further, and perhaps the only mercy for him, the only balm to soothe the jagged, grasping edges of his torn-up soul, would be to become one with magic itself, to effuse into the power that makes the world run, for ruling over the world is only a means to an end, a forge in which to hone his power, test it, increase it. Lord Voldemort's mind is in such a place where nothing can ever satisfy him, where there is no end to his ascent. Lord Voldemort is in such a place, where he has become power, become a force, and lost the humanity with which power is wielded.

But it was not always thus. Tom Marvolo Riddle was once a little boy who did not understand why he was abandoned. There was once a time when Tom Marvolo Riddle had not understood that he was hated because they feared him. A time when he had not been exposed to the worst humanity had to offer -- the cruelty of children who didn't understand. For no one is more selfish than a self-assured child, it simply does not know better. There was once a time when he had not yet given himself strength through the knowledge that he was better than the others. That they were just filth who were frightened of what they did not understand. There was once a time when he had not yet been rejected from the one place he had hoped to belong, from the word Riddle. There was a time before he had crushed his classmates in fear and reverence, a time before he had them hanging off his every word, jostling to be closest to him, yearning for a glance, a word, a gesture from him. These people who had initially rejected him, who had thought themselves better, and look where it got them. On their knees before him. There was a time before the sight of wanton death in the city, bodies strewn about, fires burning in the ruined filth around, had instilled a terror in him, a knowledge of the fragility and impermanence of human life. Of how easily it was snuffed out. Of how easy his own could be snuffed out. And thus the beginning of the search for immortality. The beginning of the end of his fragile humanity.

The dark arts were not addictive. It was the rush of power and control that one felt when using them that was addictive. It was the fact that the limits of the earth seemed to fall away. What was termed as the 'dark arts' was the upper strata of everything magical. The spells that had more power than the modern-day wizard knew what to do with, knew how to control. The dark arts harked back to a day when witches and wizards were in tune with magic, in tune with the earth, and were positively brimming with power unimaginable today. Magical society had taken on the aspects of the muggles, and that deep connection with nature, with the primordial, with magic, had fallen away. Rules and laws and theories were introduced, meant to be applied to magic. As if?! Magic was limitless! That's why it was magic! It was ever regenerating, ever powering itself. Using one's magic strengthened their magic, it may exhaust one temporarily, but it would come back all the stronger for the drain. The more magic was used in the world, the more witches and wizards practiced powerful spells, the more magic there was! But magical society was declining, the wizarding world was shrinking, witches and wizards thought that magic responded to rules, that it could be learned through theory, when in fact it was best learned by sensing, by feeling. They became disconnected from the feeling of their magic, crippled by the use of their wands and Latin words, that were originally meant as a focus, unable to perform magic without them, thinking it was a matter of power when really it was a matter of unity. Anything too powerful for the upper-average wizard to control was classed as dark and banned, anyone practicing it thrown into Azkaban. Those old wizarding families who had kept touch with the old ways, who were nevertheless losing them because they didn't understand where magic truly came from.... they did the rituals to honour the earth and the magic, but they still used their wands and their words... They lost touch with the other magical creatures of the earth, believed themselves somehow superior.... The dark arts were addictive to a magic user in the way that any magic, even the weakest levitation spell, would be addictive to a muggle who suddenly discovered an ability to use it. It showed them the possibilities of a world where the boundaries of impossibility lifted.

Tom Riddle once had the capability to love. To forgive. To enjoy. To find enough, to set an end to the constant grasping, to quiet his mind and his racing thoughts, to put the analysis on pause and just enjoy, just experience. He had this capacity when he was a full soul. He even had it when he was half of a soul. But he never used it, and as fragments continued to be torn off and encased, he lost more and more of this humanity. He transcended, until all that was left was unquenchable desire, he did what no wizard had done before, he went to the times of the ancients, rediscovered their knowledge, and then he pushed further, he became more a part of magic than anyone had ever been, a great if terrible part, a force like a hurricane, or a lightning bolt, something inhuman and terrifying and great and beautiful if one would just give up the assumption that he was human and should be held to human standards of beauty. He was beautiful like a waterfall onto sharp rocks, like a forest on fire. He had once been beautiful like that greatest of angels, the Morning Star. Now his appearance was called vile because it blended characteristics of the human and inhuman, and it terrified those who beheld it because its familiarity was alien, a parody of humanity, remnants of a visage which had transcended.

But if only.

If only Tom had not transcended.

If only he had gained, not the beauty of power and destruction, but that of light and warmth.

If only he was healed inside, where that betrayal and anguish and abandonment and rejection did not burn and writhe, raw and painful and always there, colouring every thought, the images of sneers and disdain and hatred and fear burned over every smile he saw.

Tom Riddle had once, before his soul was rent into pieces, pained fragments of a once great and powerful whole, had the ability to heal.

Had he healed, he would not have transcended. Not in the same way. He would not pass further into magic than any human before him, of any time period. He would not be just a slight push away from becoming one with the magic of the world.

But also, he would not lose his angelic features. He would not lose his humanity. He would not diffuse until he was only held to the physical plane with a fragile, tenuous link. He would not be driven out of his mind by need, by thirst, by a never-ending quest for ascent. He would not forge himself in the fires of war.

Most importantly, he would be able to understand that there was such a thing as enough. There was such a thing as happy. There was such a thing as enjoying one's achievements without becoming consumed by the need to constantly be progressing.

Tom Riddle would always be special, burning, drawing others like moths, he would discover the magic that the world had thrown away, bring it close to himself, be brimming with the power of the ancients, rediscover the knowledge that had been lost..... The only question was, would he be a shining star; cold, hard, distant, or would he be the sun, ever giving light and warmth and life, bringing the world back from the direction it had been heading, bringing it back to the olden glory, that firm connection, that union with magic, that harmony among magical creatures, that primordial joy of power and of belonging to one unifying, overwhelming force.

And if Tom Riddle could be healed, if he could be made fully whole, fully human.... who would be the one to do it?

Enter Harry Potter, and his quest to show the murderer of his parents the beauty of his own soul.

** You didn't really have to colour your words.

I gather you seek to reform Tom Marvolo "I killed your parents" Riddle? There's a ton of fics about this, to make yours memorable you'll have to really, /really/ go beyond the whole "I was once in dark, but now I see light"... If it's done well I'll love it. But Voldemort as a character can't be redeemed - not truly.

He's a psychopath, and thus lacks certain normal social inhibitions, the sort that allow people to kill the neighborhood cats out of curiosity. So... taking his personality beyond that is to toy with misrepresenting the character.

We can all say "But the orphanage! The bullying!"... but I'm gonna guess that Mrs Cole from the orphanage could tell early on he was a weird little shit and when Tom started "acting" normal she became warier still but "CBA trying to work with him, world war two's going on"...

--------------

Also, to have Voldemort think of the other students in such a way is to tempt the whole "I was in over my head and powerful, next thing ya know I turned into Voldemort and started killing people and overthrowing guv'ments and such, got meself off the beaten track so 't speak."

*** This is ridiculously tl;dr, but thank you for giving your opinion! I'm really grateful.

I don't really understand what you mean by 'colour my words'.... I wrote this after reading some depressing as fudge TMR/HP fanfic, as an attempt to calm myself down enough to write an essay.

The fanon premise is that Lord Voldemort was physically unable to love because he was conceived under the effects of a love potion. However, HP wikia says that JK didn't say anything definitive either way, it is only Dumbledore's theory that Merope used a love potion, because it would have been easy and because she thought it romantic. I don't think it explicitly states he was physically unable to love, either.

Well first of all, I'm sure with the existence of love potions being a thing, more than one child has been conceived under their effects. Presumably not all of them grew up to be mass-murdering Dark Lords, since love potions have yet to be classed as Dark and outlawed - even the Weasley Twins sell love potions of some sort.

Second of all, if I grew up unloved and abandoned everywhere I stepped foot, I'd want to torture and kill everyone too. It's to Tom's great credit that he turned some of them into sycophants and managed to create an army, instead of just cursing the soul out of everyone he could get his hands on before being apprehended.

Third of all, whether Tom's soul split in half or just a fragment broke off each time he made a horcrux, by the time he rose to his reign of terror, he was just a fraction of a person. No one recorded the effects of splitting your soul into more than two pieces, and if insanity was a result of splitting your soul only once, I think Tom would have kept looking for a different solution to immortality, but I think as he kept splitting himself more and more times, the ability to think logically, understand human interaction, and feel emotion, was severely crippled. Especially since he had absolutely zero experience with positive human interaction, there is no way I can see for him to not go off his rocker after tearing himself up to bits like that. I don't think it's so unrealistic for him to be 'in over his head' if he is experimenting with magic that no one has tried before, at least not in surviving recorded history.

Basically, I think if someone were to tell 16 year old Tom Marvolo Riddle what splitting his soul into little bits would do, he would drop the idea as useless to him. I also think that there's no reason one has to write him off as born a psychopath from the get-go.

A parentless child in a conservative Christian environment who is ostracised for accidental magic he can't prevent is placed into a survival situation from birth, it doesn't surprise me that he failed to develop compassion or "normal social inhibitions". I think it shows admirable restraint that none of the children, nor caretakers, ended up dead or maimed.

As for the redemption fics, I haven't really seen that many. I <i>had</i> to write this fic, because so many show him as inherently less than human, show that even with Harry's influence he is unfixable, merely restrainable. And I'm not really interested in reading fics where he renounces the darkness and the death eaters, turns to the light, and either drops to his knees before Dumbles begging for forgiveness, or finds out he has been manipulated by Dumbles all along from his purely non-violent goals.

What I was trying to write is a fic where his psychological wounds are healed, and he is able to find happiness and contentment within himself, not a fic where he is neutralised as a danger to the self-centred ignorant sheep who rejected him until he became more powerful than them.

*** Whoopsieeeees.... I debated including my other pages of notes, but didn't, because they were unfinished. This reply shows me why I should have. Sorry to make you waste so much time and thought writing this when you don't have the full story....

The "beauty of his own soul" comment referred to the disregard with which Voldy ripped apart his soul, and Harry showing him why souls are better kept in one piece. It didn't refer to Harry saying "oh, no, sweetie, you're such a beautiful person, you should <i>love</i> yourself. And the text isn't meant to be self-aware enough to register whether something sounds "corny" or not. It was written as a mental band-aid ^{^{"}} I only shared it to see if it was usable as a full-length fic.

Plot-wise, basically, the diary horcrux tells Harry what it is during their interactions in second year. That summer he somehow gets to Knockturn to try and find out more about soul magic and discover how exactly the horcrux works, and in general more information about it. He finds a book written in parseltongue by the naga of ancient India, that talks about the soul and why ripping it to pieces is a Very Bad Idea. He time travels back to Tom's school years, befriends him, supports him, ends up falling in love with him. Yes, it is slash, however it involves a 0 to 2 year age difference between Tom and Harry, I haven't quite decided yet. I don't mind slash between Voldemort and Harry, because whether Voldy has lived for 70 years or not, I don't think he has the body or the mental functions or mal-functions of a 70 year old man. I always considered him as ageless in the way a vampire or demon might be. However, this won't be one of those fics because the premise is that the Voldemort of Harry's day has mangled his soul, and therefore his consciousness, irreparably. Even if he absorbed the other horcruxes, the path to salvaging him into a functioning human being would be even more of an odyssey than the actual Odyssey.

The point of writing this would be because the other TM/HP fanfics out there depress me to no end. They HAVE to involve all this struggle, internal or external, for DRAMA, or AUTHENTICITY, or keeping them in character, or whatever, and those of us who lose our connection to reality and sense of self while reading are left suffering whatever emotional abuses the authors put the characters through. I just want something which ends in a predominantly optimistic, sunny, happy, healed, whole, properly socially adapted and all that, manner. Not just the last sentence of the fic, but like... the last half. Yes, that means fundamentally changing the character of Tom Riddle, but I don't think it stretches him beyond the limits of what his character might have been, had he been exposed to external stimuli that counterbalanced his overwhelmingly negative experiences with other people.

As for romance being unnecessary, I think that a 13-15 year old Tom having someone who loves him unconditionally and will never betray him or turn his back on him when a better offer comes up will go a long way in redeeming humanity in his view. Most of them may be disgusting self-interested sheep, but they are not all vile filth, Tom should not be ashamed by his membership in the human race, and he should not try to kill all of them, in one way or another. I think that having Harry as a simple ally, friend, servant, whatever, wouldn't have the same effect. And honestly, the idea of Tom Marvolo Riddle with a woman makes me feel kind of sick inside, so call it author-appeal. TMR/HP does have wide readership and authorship. (Then again, so does LV/HP, despite your misgivings. Although usually the focus of these is corruption, not redemption.)

Thank you very much for your opinion, I apologise for the misunderstanding, and if you have the time or inclination, feel free to go as overboard as you like in reply to this comment ;) I'm really grateful for your feedback.

Ohhh, and I wanted to add that I completely agree with you on disliking fics that make things very black and white / bad or good. The fics which show Tom as a completely innocent little angel, manipulated, set up, controlled, and/or driven insane by the crazy Dark Lord Dumbles, are even worse than canon. Not that I mind Dumbles-bashing, but I prefer my Voldy non-angelic, even if I don't think he has to be crazy to be a badass.

**** Hey, saw your comment late last night but was at the end of a fic and then sleep called.

I appreciate the reply as it did alleviate a lot of concerns. A Harry/TMR or LV story still isn't my bag (though I've never read a story purely for the pairing anyway). That being said yours sounds pretty good.

I never liked the idea of TMR/LV being incapable of love since birth and weak to love as an adult. I certainly could buy (if written well of course) that a Tom Riddle Jr. around the time of first killing and horcrux could be redeemed. Either prior to Myrtle or after Myrtle and father/grand-parents or even after he does the diary and has to repair it through regret etc. That TMR would latch onto/love someone who would never abandon them or judge/hate him etc. I could certainly see (particularly if he helps him gain immortality/put that at ease - see below).

IMO if the last half is going to be happy and mostly conflict and problem free then the brief mentions you made of Harry and Tom in the CoS, Horcrux/Soul books, Knockturn and the Naga should prove an obstacle imo. Not necessarily thriller but I imagine the sort of idea that he has bet everything on this one throw so to speak and can't go back.

(pre post edit - This really comes off as telling you what to do/ideas but my intent was just to try and say it sounds like you have a good idea/grasp on the relationship and how that develops both in the chamber and back in time but maybe not time travel or the initial problems. Basically I think to give some drive and tension Harry needs to be in a spot where there is no going back and he has some obstacles to overcome)

ex. CoS - From what you said it sounds like a huge dilemma with Harry wanting to initially want to save Ginny but then being 'turned' and seeing TMR needs saving even more so. This however could be a decision which locks/forces Harry down one path. So if he doesn't fight the Basilisk the diary isn't destroyed if the diary is destroyed then either he takes it with him or Ginny is left (either in a sort of comatose state or TMR takes life) either way Dumbledore probably knows Harry isn't saying something and somewhat concerned or even suspicious but not fully suspicious. Now that Harry is fully committed he has his adventures in Knockturn - perhaps prior to Sirus Blacks escape, or just after escaping Dursleys on the Knight Bus. This could then mean when he is caught looking into illegal or Dark books Fudge is just happy to have found Harry and dismisses it (as he did with accidental magic) then perhaps instead of staying at the Leaky Cauldron he is brought to Hogwarts (safer and Dumbledore still concerned over missing pieces of Harrys story). (Of course if the basilisk isn't killed AND Ginny isn't saved then the school might be considered to dangerous). I am usually not a fan of Parsel magics typically because it is done poorly and quickly as a quick power boost. However your mention of the Naga and ancient India gave me the idea that perhaps, in addition to its information on how important whole souls are etc., it tells of some ancient/lost arts/spells/rituals for what essentially amounts to time time travel. My thought was that perhaps the Nagas are extinct or very few and that part of the requirement for time travel is the sacrifice of a 'Great Serpent' ie. an ancient basilisk 'king of serpents' or a naga which at least according to wiki is a deity or entity 'taking the form of a very great snake'. Also it could be further limited that the spells/rituals require a great snake a millenium old (of which

there would be exceptionally few - perhaps why Nagas are extinct or at least no ancient nagas or other mythical creatures/great snakes.)

When Harry gets taken to Hogwarts (or returns 3rd year) Dumbledore is kind and caring but also concerned and knows Harry hasn't said something. Perhaps he misjudges when left alone Harry steals a book/s from Dumbledores/Headmasters office (perhaps the same one TMR looked at in the restricted section and has since been removed) or Harry take some questionable books from the library. Then Harry flees to the Chamber of Secrets perhaps when Dumbledore gets wise/asks him to report to the office over the speaker or through paintings or even tries to apprehend him. Then Harry returns to the CoS and has to use the Basilisk, a persons/maidens/innocents blood or life (if Ginny is still there or was already sacrificed which of course would be undone through time travel if successful), the piece a soul/his soul etc. (which might work in removing the horcrux from himself if that's what you want or just explaining how a 2nd/almost 3rd year can do this or live through it with a whole soul, perhaps another reason why time travel isn't common is that it comes at the cost of a/piece of a soul). So again no going back and Harry had committed himself to this course of action.\\
Then relatively little drama as it moves on to happy/redeemed when Harry prevents TMR from making the Horcrux or helps him repair it (perhaps again with the piece in Harry it allows him to explain the situation and gain TMRs trust/love which would be strengthened IMO if the piece in Harry was used to make him whole while he retains the Diary Horcrux since TMR is/was still very concerned about and focused on immortality). Then if you aren't going to far in the future you could perhaps end it with TMR getting the DADA job at 17/18 or just after graduation as Dumbledore, the only staff member who wouldn't recommend him to Armando Dippet and seemed to have some pull, sees a difference in him. Either fully redeemed/happy/whole or enough that he would rather keep an eye on him. Either way TMR gets his dream job, already has Harry, can continues his deep research into magic with full aid of the Hogwarts library etc. etc.

Anyway obviously any idea can work but there is that niggling have to rite it well thing. I think the premise is good and if it is convincingly written then Harry betting on/siding with TMR can work. As you say the results would be a Tom Riddle Jr. unlike canon but it can be pulled off. Clearly the way I view things and what I find important to me in a story seems much different that your own but if there was something I didn't touch on that you had wanted thoughts on feel free.

***** I was so happy to see this /_/ I don't think I've ever had such a long comment even on fully completed stories. You bring up some really good ideas, although I have to admit that I don't have a lot of these details sorted out yet. Does Ginny die in the chamber? When does Tom tell Harry he is a horcrux and why? I have no idea. I hadn't intended on having Dumbledore suspect or find out anything (I seem to be conflict-shy in my writing....) but you're right that it would introduce (probably necessary) drama. So thank you for giving me that idea.

In this particular world, I wanted to say that a lot of magic, and most especially ways of accessing magic, have been forgotten, regulated down and whittled away by politics and complacency. I think Tom found and accessed that old magic (I really think the above-average level of his intelligence could qualify him as a genius, and not just a powerful wizard, at least in my head-canon) and yet, there are pieces of it floating around that people have forgotten how to access. A book written in a language that looks like squiggles, which requires a stigmatised blood talent to access and talks about magic so old and complicated, it's no wonder that not a lot of people go around understanding the nature of the soul or the time travel (which really could be in there, that's another awesome idea I thank you for). Personally, my thoughts on it were that it wasn't the kind of magic Harry could figure out on his own. But when he reads the part about the soul being better in one piece, the horcrux in his head wakes up and becomes enraged.... Then the Voldy-shard guides him through the magic (not sure if Tom the Diary or the great Basilisk are still alive here) and they go back in time. I think it's best to keep the horcrux in Harry even back in time, because I don't see how he could influence Tom otherwise, considering he spent 10 years in a cupboard with 0 friends and then three years in Gryffindor with two (unsubtle, simple, brash) friends.

As for Tom being a professor on graduation or not, I haven't decided on that either. It's the internal conflict I'm looking to erase, not the external conflict. He can be a dark lord for all I care, as long as the killing-people thing stays strategic and the torturing-people thing stays non-existent, because I think you can't torture people AND be healthy in the head, it's one or the other. The wizarding world does need change, I think, even in canon. On the other hand, Tom being a teacher is just such an adorable (and especially low-stress) job.

I am a little concerned, because you mention that it has to be well-written, and I hate to disappoint anyone but I am not especially talented in that department. Other people talk about the characters running away with the story and doing what they want, but I have a lot of trouble, especially with Slytherin interactions. I'm just not up to Tom's level of intelligence, and so it's very hard to write him.

Anyways, your feedback was fantastic, and thank you so much for writing all this for me.... =D and Tom/Harry isn't even your thing :0 I'm really grateful.
