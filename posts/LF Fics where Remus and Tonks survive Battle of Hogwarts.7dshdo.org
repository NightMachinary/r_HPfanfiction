Wondering if there are any fics where Remus and Tonks survive the Battle of Hogwarts and take care of their son. On the side note, also wondering if there are any well written Sirius survived fics too.


** Linkao3(The Debt of Time)

All three characters survive the Battle of Hogwarts in this one. If you haven't read it it is definitely worth it.

The author is almost done doing final revisions to the MA rated version on AO3, but the M version is complete on ffn if you can't wait for the last 24 chapters.
