Perhaps it's because of a birth-defect; perhaps it's because of a spell-related/war injury or a side-effect of a ritual, but a character cannot feel /anything/ meaningful. Everything is dulled and diluted.

It could be set during Hogwarts; it could be set after Hogwarts.

It could be Daphne, using a trope, or an existing character such as Lavender, Katie, or Pansy that had such a cruel fate befall them.

They could be driven by desperation to regain some semblance of what they lost or to just experience what they never had.

So, discover a way to covertly, emotionally leech off a target and, for a short time, feel a (perhaps amplified) mirror of what their unaware victim feels.

To a blind person, it'd be like seeing colour again or for the first time; ditto for sound for a deaf person.

The only problem? The echoes after each attempt remain and leave permanent residue.

Leeching off Harry Potter's girlfriend, for example? She feels lust and love for him that gradually sticks.

She knows it's false. They're not her feelings. But they're /feelings/, and she's not letting them go. And they're beginning to affect her judgement and guide her actions...

For an added fringe-horror angle? Repeated on a victim, it actually begins to thieve those feelings, transferring them to her. So, as his baffled girlfriend, fiance, or wife falls out of love with him via drainage, Ice Queen grows more in-love and attached.


** Question. Do they actually end up with the ice vampire or nah

*** Honestly up to whomever thinks this good enough to use in some way. It's pretty open-ended, I think?

If she ends up kidnapping 'her' husband/boyfriend, it could go to some pretty... dark places, like kidnapping him and holding him prisoner as they live in a cave or something: likewise, it could end up with her being confined to St. Mungo's, with a pitying Harry visiting her without her knowing.
