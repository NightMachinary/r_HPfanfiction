** I personally frickin love.....the /idea/ of them. A well-written self-insert is basically my white whale of FanFiction. Not only are there very few SI fics, but about 80% of them are total crap

*** I happen to agree. And the endless possibilities they allow. For example, how could the HP universe have changed had I become Harry Potter?

A pity HPMOR is the only half decent self insert I've found so far.

** If the premise looks really good I'll give them an attempt. There are certain fandoms I have yet to find a good Self insert though. Harry Potter being one of them, though I think that is probably because it is one of the biggest fandoms I read into and I'm extremely picky. I give a lot more leeway to other fandoms.

I have read quite a few good ones in other fandoms though, for Naruto, Death Note and few misc ones.

**** They still retain aspects from the original series it isn't a 100% blank slate but not 100% the same as canon. I only have a problem reading self inserts when they are the main character that drastically change the story side character self inserts are fine as long as it's one or two. The stories where the main character from the series is replaced are what I steer clear from.

** If done correctly, they are characters like any other, and they actually are fleshed out because they are based on someone who (most likely) isn't a flat caricature of a person. However, in order to do that you need a decent (if not better) writer and one who understands themselves and is willing to admit that they have faults and what those are at that, which is something you just don't see often.

So yeah, most self-inserts suck; they can be quite interesting in the rare cases when they don't, though.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

** I've never read a good one. Never. Therefore I tend to avoid them if I don't get a explicit recommendation for them. Once again, I never got that either.

I like the idea, and will probably try out writing one at some point simply because its a fun thing to do, but I fully expect it to suffer from much of the same problems as other SIs do.

Also if they manage to make their self-insert character a Mary-Sue my respect for the author as a person plummets like crazy.

** There's a couple SI fics outside of this fandom that I like, but I've never enjoyed any HP SI fics. Though to be fair, I've only tried reading like three or four of them.

This is the first time I've thought about it, but maybe it's because it's too easy to "break the plot" of HP, so to speak. There are very clear problems with (usually) very clear solutions (e.g. Horcrux locations, Quirrel, Imposter!Moody), and only one enemy faction. So either you're going to do a canon retread with an extra character, or you're going to have to find an interesting way to introduce conflict when the SI's prior knowledge is so beneficial. Peggy Sue fics have the same problem, but most of the good ones are AUs.

** Annoying

The self inserts (OCs) I've run into have always had a tendency to be preachy. Most of the time, the character does or says something that immediately changes a "Harry Potter" characters mind or the way they live their lives and not in the believable way that I hope but in one paragraph or in that one moment they meet.

They arnt even characters, they are empty shells that the author writes to just lecture or bicker with other characters that they feel need to change.

There literal purpose is to change characters and the way the Harry Potter world works to fit how they feel.

It's frustrating just thinking about it, I cant even articulate what I'm trying to say properly
