Instead of a soft coup followed by a bunch of minor skirmishes. You know, actual battles and field strategy, more or less clear cut combatants, et cetera.

Thanks in advance.


** Most stuff by [[/u/Starfox5]] has a lot of that. /Marriage Law Revolution/ has already been linked, but there's the completed linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) and the ongoing linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) that certainly fit the bill.

That said, part of the problem with what you are asking is that pretty much any conflict involving wizards will devolve into guerrilla warfare, due to small numbers, teleportation (Apparation) and portable flight (brooms) abilities, and that whereas Muggle soldiers benefit greatly from better equipment and require complex logistics and resupply, Wizards are pretty self-sufficient, and while some equipment, like Shield Hats, exist, they don't appear to provide that big an advantage over just a wand for a competent wizard or witch.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Wizards are adapt at hiding, so unless two sides are fighting for strategically important locations, battles tend to be small. For Magical Britain, the battles are likely to involve the Ministry and Hogwarts.

If you are looking for big battle scenes in civil wars, *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is the fic you should like. It's basically non-stop actions after chapter 10, and there are many battles with huge casualties on both sides.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

** linkffn(637123)

This was written pre-OoTP, so there are some really novel ideas. The Order and Death Eaters are both militias here. There are battles for outposts and key areas. Voldemort has set up the Black Barrier, a magical barrier which prevents apparition, floos and portkeys from working unless he's made an exception for you. Excellent story.
