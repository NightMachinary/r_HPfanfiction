Anything featuring the Weasley twins that is not twincest is welcome.


** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/shosier/GAAUB.html][George and Annie: an Unofficial Biography]] is a highly recommended fic. Features a strong OC female lead, but goes in depth into the character development of George as well as having strong scenes of George and Fred antics. Novel length, rated R, complete.

*** Oh man I remembering finishing that long ass fic and it felt like a rush of air had just exhaled from by body. It's so worth the read and it continues to be one of my favorites to this day.

I read this recently. It's pretty good. A light-hearted read, nothing too serious. There also are two sequels.
