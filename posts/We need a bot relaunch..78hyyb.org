*** Working on this. This fix might take a bit longer than usual. Looks like the Reddit API has changed.

Edit: Yeah, the bot will be down for a bit.

Edit 2: It's back up!

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
