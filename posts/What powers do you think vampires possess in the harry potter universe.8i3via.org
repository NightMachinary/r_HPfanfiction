Title


** I think its made rather clear in the books that Wizards are on top. The goblins work for them, the Centaurs stay in their forests and the giants have been driven to the mountains. Remembering that and that the Weasley twins were selling hats charmed with a shield charm since lots of people were incapable of casting it, then I'd be very hesitant to give any magical creature 'powers'. If they're kept down by wizard kind who seems to be largely untalented then they can't be super anything. Likely they're just as fragile and squishy as muggles but immortality in exchange for having to drink blood and avoid daylight.

*** I agree the wizards being able to oppress all other magical beings mean's for the most part they pretty much suck. Unless jk Rowling pulls more bullshit...

*** I mostly agree with you, but its made pretty clear in the books that Wizards are on the top because they have wands, not because they are naturally more powerful. But I also think that they probably have certain specialization they have developed as because they dont have wands that cant be replicated by wizards(for lack of knowledge) like with Goblin smithing .

I am doubtful that they are immortal, if you look at the Harry potter wiki you see that of the several vampires mentioned on wizard cards none lived more then 200 years, only slightly older then wizards.

Id rather think that they simply have slightly stronger bodies, can use little wandless magic with some specialization in some form of dark magic. have to drink blood(but not exclusively, or only from humans) and avoid garlic and sunlight.

** I'm pretty sure it is mostly all negative. Like having a disease or being handicapped in our world. If there was any overriding positive side to it I am sure Voldemort would have become one.

*** Well, Voldemort did show some vampiric tendencies in PS/SS when he drank the unicorn's blood... or rather, Quirrell did that while he was serving as Voldemort's vessel.

**** Quirrell was said to have had a bad encounter with a Vampire, hence the turban full of garlic, while Voldemort was on the back of his head, draining Quirrell to keep himself alive.

***** Actually, it was just a rumor at Hogwarts that his Turban was full of garlic. I'm pretty sure he spelled it to smell like garlic because he needed a reason to wear a turban (so he could mask Voldemort.)

** A level of super strength that is probably on par with adult gorilla's, super speed and agility well beyond that of most Olympic athletes, probably at their best in a straight foot race are maybe a step behind antelope. Enhanced senses in smell, sight and hearing would be expected as would super human stamina, I doubt they get tired at all mostly due to the idea they are already dead so they probably aren't producing lactic acid. I wouldn't expect them to have any kinda of enhanced durability. They would also probably have a way of luring or confusing their prey so something like hypnotic gaze would be expected.

I think so many people think very little of wizards and so they think very little of that world in general, as you can see most people think of everything there as push overs.
