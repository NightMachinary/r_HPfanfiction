I enjoy femharry a lot, especially if Harry (or the female equivalent) is Slytherin, or dark. I tend to enjoy it if she is in the House of Black, or is a pureblood princess. Although in truth, the main character could also be another female character other than Harry, as long as she is dark.

I'm looking for something that is over 100k words long, and hopefully a multipart series, that spans several years. To get an idea of what I'm looking for and have read, here's a list:

Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool; Princess of the Blacks; Serpent Tongue; To Be a Slytherin; The Pureblood Pretense; Potter vs Paradox; Riddled; A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story; The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House; Behind the Veil, Phantasy; Fire Born)


** Okay so I have 2 recs that don't exactly meet your criteria but I think are excellent + similar enough in concept that I'm still going to rec them

You might enjoy linkffn(Moratorium). fem!Harry creates a criminal underground in the wizarding world.

The Harveste Addams series is excellent, alrhough also not exactly what you're looking for. It's dark!Harry in a fun way, and while Harry is technically male, he crossdresses and reads more feminine and/or genderfluid than male. linkao3(Harveste Addams)

*** I actually forgot to put Moratorium on my list. Thanks for the Harveste Addams suggestion, I think I'll try it. Is it a crossover though? I don't tend to like them, because the two worlds are very different, and mixing then seems awkward.

  Hope Potter was everything Albus Dumbledore feared; a girl just as clever, just as dangerous as Tom Riddle had been. Their physical similarities and likeness blinded him to the truth. That Hope wasn't afraid of befriending a Muggleborn Gryffindor or an airy Ravenclaw or even a Slytherin with pro-grey leanings. That Hope Potter was an unpredictable pawn on his chessboard. FemHarry

Unfortunately for her superiors, with the qualities of a killer come the qualities of someone who doesn't like to follow orders, and she was never one to conform with the darkness of Konoha anyways.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** The first four Hogwarts years of linkffn(black sky by umei no mai) are pretty decent, but after fourth year the crossover kicks in and fem!harry starts acting inconsistent (out of nowhere she drops out of Hogwarts, gets married & pregnant at 15 to a guy from the crossover story- I noped out after that. Also the crossover magic is not explained well to readers who don't know the crossover like me.)

But before then, Dorea has some awesome moments, including out manipulating Draco several times when they're both sorted into slytherin.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

*** Thanks for the suggestion! I finished Black Sky a day ago, and up until that random get married moment, I liked it. I admit I do like Hitman Reborn, but crossovers just aren't my thing.
