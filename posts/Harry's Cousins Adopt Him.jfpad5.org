Ok, so this is sort of based on canon. JK has said that James's parents names were Fleamont and Euphemia. We know Fleamont was born around 1909. We also know that one Charlus Potter, no birth year given, married Dorea Potter, born 1920, and had a son. Therefore, it isn't that much of a stretch to seduce that Charlus was probably Fleamont's younger brother, and since he had a son, that would mean that James Potter had cousins. Now, what would happen if the possible cousin, or the cousin's child, took up the responsibility of raising Harry?

** As far as Lily's protection it wouldn't work. From my understanding of it from canon, because it was Lily's protection it had to be a blood relative of her. So any alternative placements would require blood relations with Lily to be safe. In fanon, the protection is downplayed, but in canon it really did save Harry's life numerous times. It is also canon(albeit more heavily implied than said) that there were DE's that got off that would have went after him and likely killed or tortured him without the protection. It also adds conflict and drama that the very place keeping him alive, keeps him miserable. For a children's story, HP is quite dark. Perhaps that's why we still read and enjoy it and fanfics of it as adults.

*** Maybe I'm not remembering but when does the protection of being in the house of a direct relative of Lily save him? The protection certainly helped him against Voldy in year one, but other than that I really don't know of any instances post Voldemort's initial defeat where the protection does anything that we know of.

*** To add onto this, Dumbledore also did not want Harry to grow up knowing he was famous. That is considerably easier to pull off in a muggle family than in a wizarding one.

** As far as I know that branch of the family is dead as shown on the Black family tapestry.

Though that premise would be very interesting to read.

*** She wrote the backstory of the Potter family on Pottermore. She has never said that Charlus and Dorea were James' parents, it was just assumed by fans because the years fit.
