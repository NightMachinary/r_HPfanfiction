Looking for fics where occulmency and legimency, and also spells like the Confundus Charm and Imperio and Obliviate, play an important role. Fics were Harry not only learns mind magic, but the abuses of mind magic as also taken seriously in-story. Even the Confundus Charm, taking seriously, can be terrifying, not to mention Obliviate, and I want to see stories that reflect that.


** linkffn(Memorium by Aesop) focuses on the consequences of Obliviation. No Harry, though.

I also remember [[http://kanedax.livejournal.com/163914.html][Three Months Later]] [[http://kanedax.livejournal.com/165598.html][:Our Little Wilikins]] having some stuff on Hermione modifying the memories of her parents.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** From what I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursely and the Chronicles of the King]] is drowning in mind magic. You'll probably want to jot down notes on important plot twists if you're planning on stretching it out over a few weeks because it's easily one of the most complicated and confusing fics I've ever read.

Edit: I just realized that this might not fit your request entirely, most of the magic is being used on him. I still recommend you read it though.
