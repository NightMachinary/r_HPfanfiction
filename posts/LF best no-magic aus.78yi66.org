I recently read a short story (Ginny/Harry) that took place in a non-magical world. It was really cute and I was wondering if there were any /good/ non-magic AUs? Maybe set in an English boarding school? Jily is alive? Preferably Hinny?

Any recs would be great!


** Respectfully,

I don't see the point. Why not just read a different fandom? The whole point of HP, to me, is that there is a magical world. Can you explain the allure to those of us who don't get it?

*** Many readers love the characters foremost and don't really care whether there's magic or not.

Of course, magic is cool and adds more options to the story, so non magic AU generally disappoints. However, exceptions exist.

*** The relationships in the books are worth exploring.

I like harry potter fanfiction because I can read a story with very little presence of the canon characters because the world is so interesting, but I can also take the characters out of their world because they are interesting on their own.

*** I'd never read non-magic AU before the other day and it's so uncommon in the fandom. It's like any other fandom that has an AU magic fic. (Seriously I think every fandom has even just a HP AU). It's mostly about character exploration without the element of magic in it. I like to see the characters uncomplicated by their magic backstories and it really is a fresh take on the characters (Harry has not survived the killing curse, he's not the BWL or the Chosen One) and that's something I've never found well done in any normal HP story that stays in the magical universe.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has superpowers in place of magic. The story is Hermione centric, but has canon pairings. It's a great read.

** Mr. Chaos has a really cool fusion of Harry Potter and Pokemon that works - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master's Ball). There've been a few that have attempted a copy, but it rarely works out.

Side note - Mr. Chaos also has a nice fusion of Game of Thrones and Marvel, which is really good.
