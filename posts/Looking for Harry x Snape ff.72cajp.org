Hello. I forgot the name of it, but I do recall the main plotline. It was a wrong-boy-who lived scenario & eventually, Harry becomes Snape's apprentice, and a relationship ensues. Lily, Sirius, Remus, and James are alive- and the book bashes them multiple times, as Lily gets arrested at one point. I have no idea what the name is, and I've been looking for it for ages. Please help. ^{-^}


** The description sounds like linkffn(Invisible by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan) just based on summary. I've never read it so I don't know.

  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP!
