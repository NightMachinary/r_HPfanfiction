I am forever trying to find fic where Harry is turned into a werewolf and is then befriended by a happy go lucky pink haired woman who sees no bad. I think it would be interesting to see it play out infront of Remus because just personally I dont like the whole Remus/Tonks thing.


** linkffn(The odd trio by Numbuh10-4) is not a great match, but it's the closest I've seen. It has a werewolf Harry in a relationship with Tonks, but Fleur is also involved and Remus hasn't shown up at all.

  We're not like the others. We stand out but we don't care. When we found out that The Triwizard Tournament was back and for three champions per school we knew it had to be us. What we didn't expect was what came next. Afterall. How much trouble could a Veela, a Metamorph, and a Warewolf get into?
