In AO3 I can convert the latex to an image and insert that but I can't figure out how to do it on FFN. Just writing the source would make it difficult to read.


** To my knowledge FFN doesn't allow any fancy image embeds, hyperlinks, etc. like AO3 does. The only place you can put an image is as the "cover photo" for a work or your avatar.
