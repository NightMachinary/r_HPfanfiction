Ron occasionally complains about being poor, and it's sort of true, he does have to live with hand-me-downs, and the family has very little money to spend on luxuries.

But really, the Weasleys aren't all that poor from an objective point of view; they have their own house on their own land, they have food, Arthur Weasley has a secure job, each and every one of them has education in the form of Hogwarts, they have access to St. Mungos...

And they're able to climb out of their 'poor' situation, too; Charlie manages dragons, Bill +manages finance+ works as a cursebreaker, Percy ends up in the Ministry, Fred & George go into business, Ron becomes an Auror, Ginny became a professional Quidditch player...it makes you wonder why they were poor in the first place.

Rather than discuss about that, though, I was hoping to ask; does anyone know any stories where the Weasleys are in definite absolute objectively-unquestionable poverty?

Homeless, starving, no Hogwarts, victims of crime, loads of debt, having to sell their kids as substitute house-elves, and so forth? Harry trips over them in the street and is moved to help or some such stuff?

Bonus points if standard-Ron crosses dimensions to encounter poverty-Ron.


** I've always considered it notable that the Weasleys, despite being poor, live a lifestyle that to Muggles would appear upper-middle class. I think it's a telling insight into the magical economy. That is: almost every item we see characters purchase is one which relates to magic - brooms, magic books, potions ingredients, etc. In fact, the only item that people seem to need to buy which doesn't relate to magic is clothing. Items that are scarce in the Muggle world are not scarce in the magical one. Magical society has their own scarcities and they relate largely to magic.

Combine that with the fact that Hogwarts is free and the only magic school in the country (putting their children on an even level with the children of the elite) and the fact that healthcare is free (in analogy to the British healthcare system in general) and you have a family whose poverty relates not to the necessities of life but rather to luxury goods.

*** I think that the Weasleys are poor /for purebloods/. That's who Ron comes in contact with and is comparing himself to. So, maybe like being an upper-middle class student whose parents are making a real stretch for tuition at the poshest prep school you can imagine, where everyone else is in the 1%.

**** I don't think Weasleys are poor only for pure bloods. I don't think it has anything to do with blood status. Look at Hermione, she is pretty well-off financially even though is a Muggle-born because both of her parents have well-payed jobs and she is their only child. The main aspect that narrows wealth gap between students is that Hogwarts tuition and accommodation is free (but then in the Muggle world the children from low income families would simply go to a public school and live at home).

*** Indeed, Ron is just jealous - he's not truly poor (otherwise we'd all be poor because we don't have the mansion, the private jet, the Rolls Royce (or other luxury car), the butler (and other servants!), the indoor pool etc. etc. etc.) and neither is the rest of his family!

ps: Note: The Weasleys are still irresponsible IMHO - why have that many children if you can't afford to without hand-downs? (I myself was and often still am jealous of only children, they are IHMO better off because parents can focus on them more (money, attention, time etc. are all finite and if you get all that as an only child you will be better off than someone with siblings!)) Don't they have contraception in the magic world (or does Molly not believe in contraception?)?

***** You're right. But it doesn't change the fact it is pretty humiliating to have to wear second-hand robes and textbooks when everyone else has got brand new robes and textbooks. That's human psychology there.

Also I am really not sure how much attention the Weasley parents could provide considering how many children are there. For example, Molly always forgot Ron's preferences for his jumpers and sandwich and is constantly treating Harry better than Ron right? Not saying it's anyone's fault, but that's just the unfortunate reality of a really large but relatively poor family (and is continually growing as well!).

****** Yeah it sucks, but adolescence sucks even with new stuff. Even if Molly didn't spend all her time doting on each kid, which we see her certainly trying her best to do, they had each other at the very least. Amount of kids and good parenting don't correlate - there are parents with one kid who don't give a damn.

Trust me, before we were ruled by money, big families were a sign of happiness and health. JK did a pretty good job showing us that with the Weasleys.

True, just look at Harry's home-life as example. However I do think that some kids had it much better than others at home. For example, out of the Trio I think Hermione easily had the best home life being an only child from a well-off family.

True and for the Weasleys I think it is nobody's fault, only by a by-product of a large family. However I think Ron's unique position in the family as the youngest son but having a younger (only) sister means he is probably more neglected than any of his other siblings.

It is also made worse by the fact that Molly and his siblings seem to treat Harry better than him (more feelings of potential jealousy!). Remember how the twins gave the Marauder's Map to Harry and not Ron? It also seems that the twins only succeeded in tearing him down in Quidditch in OotP which is a fact noticed by Hermione as well. Ginny also did it to a certain extent in HBP.

I agree the twins and Ginny did help to comfort Ron at times as well so I guess the overall result is somewhat mixed but it doesn't change the fact that Ron seemed to usually receive little attention from any family member and is constantly being overshadowed as Hermione observed.

Yes but sadly in the world we live in those things doesn't matter that much. I was just saying Ron had a very normal and human reaction to being poor and having shabby stuff compared to his friends.

******** Yes, the twins were total assholes to Ron a lot... and we see how his family's preference to Harry hurts him when he opens the locket. :( Of course Ron hated being poor, who doesn't? I think he knew his situation was preferable to Harry's though, even if it didn't always feel like it. All in all, we are in agreement, I think.

********* Yeah I agree that Ron's family life is still better than Harry's but Hermione had the best family life out of the Trio as she had none of Harry's or Ron's problems. I think I already said that in my last post.

Yes, I'm glad we agree :)

**** Tinfoil hat time:

A Goyle can take the Dark Mark or become a Malfoy minion. A Malfoy can arrange legislation to favor purebloods. A Prewitt can give birth to half a dozen new purebloods.

And in some ways, poverty is when having more kids makes sense. In the popular Lords and Ladies formulation, more kids means splitting your estate. But the Weasleys work for a living, and their children all expect to work for a living. If anything, creating a network of Weasleys all supporting the family will increase their fortunes in the long term.
