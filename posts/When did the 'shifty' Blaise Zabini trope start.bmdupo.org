In canon, the only things we know about him are that his mother had seven husbands and got wealthy from them, he has negative attitudes towards Gryffindors and blood traitors, and that he has skepticism in Draco's usefulness to Voldemort. Whereas in fics he's generally portrayed as shifty character who's loyalties are in question. I've seen him in roles such as the reluctant Death Eater who's not really a true believer and trying to find a way out, a post-war Ministry official who's trying to secretly subvert everything Hermione tries to pass, and a quintuple agent in a three-sided war.

When did this become a thing? Was there a particular popular fic that started this trend? Or was this just how people interpreted Zabini after reading HBP? Or did this trope come out even before HBP?

Thanks in advance for your input!


** Just look how [[https://66.media.tumblr.com/b51a911bf9cf408682d3e74d7403a9db/tumblr_inline_p0t5f603gF1u1a3zz_540.gif][shifty]] he is!

It's probably because he's somewhat dismissive of Draco, which might imply he has some power in the Slytherin social dynamic without falling into lock step with Malfoy.

Additionally Zabini sounds foreign enough for authors to run with it, which suggests loyalty to something or someone outside of the British scene. This tries nicely into the previous point.

And because it's fun and very likely how every Slytherin acts. Loyalty isn't a house trait after all.

** I have a few guesses:

- All the other Slytherin boys in Harry's year are known sons of Death Eaters, so if you want a Slytherin in that year who isn't a locked on DE, he's your only option.
- The story about his mother lends itself to the assumption she marries men with the express intent of murdering them, it's easy to project a 'shiftiness' onto her son.
- Because he barely speaks and we know little about him, he projects the he-keeps-his-cards-close-to-his-chest persona, which makes it seems as though he's hiding something.

Interesting, I didn't actually think him saying very little would imply that, but given that logic, I can see how some people could jump to that conclusion.

** I don't really remember what fic started it, but Blaise is one of the only students (if not the only) that is shown interacting with Draco as an equal (Rowling said Theodore Nott was supposed to be like this too, but the scene she had in mind never made it to the book).

I thik it at least partially started after HBP when we learn a bit more than his name and the story about his supposedely Black Widow's mother (before HBP, some people even thought he was a girl, you can find some romance or harem with a girl Blaise inside).

His mum lures in wealthy husbands and kills them → This it the sort of moral principles that Blaise receives through during his upbringing from the only mentioned constant authority figure in his life → He grows up "shifty" and self-serving.

*** That's a very good point. I never considered the effect of living with his already shifty mother on him, which in retrospect was silly of me.
