Ok in my story linkffn(12292532) I have Harry using a charmed tent while traveling like the one in Deathly Hallows. My question what do you guys think would happen to someone still in the tent when it collapses. I'm having a character thrown into the side of it on the outside by an explosion knocking the tent down and collapsing it while another character is still inside. Do you guys think that would be dangerous? Would everything inside remain fine but maybe the entrance is closed because it's collapsed? Anyway, please let me know you're thoughts. lol. I don't want to kill the character inside but I'm trying to figure out what will happen when he's in there.


** On the behavior of closed space like that, from what I watched in Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them, there is no effect to the beasts inside even with all the abuse that happened to newt scarmander's "suitcase". So I think there is no effect.

*** Ok thanks. That makes sense, I should have thought of that.

** Well, if you ask me, my personal preference is; if the tent just collapses, then there's no harm to anyone inside. The entrance just collapses on itself and becomes a mess of folded cotton or silk or whatever the tent is made of that someone can muddle through to exit or enter as normal.

If the tent is actually destroyed, torn to bits or burnt or whatever, I'd suggest that everything in the magical space, solid, liquid, or gaseous, is re-introduced to realspace via the path of least resistance (that is, not being torn to shreds by random magical energy or whatnot and showing up nearby rather than being deep underground or on the other side of the planet or such).

** Remember during the world cup the Death Eaters walked through the camp setting tents on fire and destroying them. No one died or even was seriously harmed from what the books said, and no one even seemed worried about the possibility of a collapsing tent harming someone.

I like to imagine the tent functions more like a portal to a dimensional space. Destroy the tent and you can no longer enter said space, but you can still exit the space and you'll just be stepping out to a destroyed tent wondering what the hell happened.

*** I suppose that makes sense, but the idea in the books seems to be that space is physically extended ala Tardis, rather than the tent being a gate to a pocket dimension.

**** Except the TARDIS works by gateway, not by physically extended. The Phone Box is the projected shell for the doorway, and inside is a whole universe.

** as others have said, I think, (in cannon at least) nothing happens to the characters inside, except perhaps the exit being a mess of fabric and tent poles.

On side note, I love some of your fics return of magic and deal with a devil. both are great!

*** That's what I was thinking. Thanks! I'm glad you like my stories. Just updated Make A Deal With A Devil yesterday and wrote like 4k words of the next chapter of The Return of Magic in one sitting.

** I don't think people inside would even know that the tent collapsed, until they try to get out. Either they'd get crushed by the collapse, or not. And if not, they're not gonna get half-crushed, so nothing happens.
