I mean, obviously, someone wrote it, but why are you reading it?

I, at least, tend to get a specific fandom urge--werewolf snape, Hermoine-themed, redeemed Dudley, necromancer Harry--and download a dozen stories based around that idea... then read half of them, before getting distracted by a new shiny.

So, I've got about 100 fanfic on my kindle, and all of them have been recommended... at some point... by SOMEONE... generally from here... and while it's pretty straightforward where it comes from when Snape starts getting all furry, sometimes you end up sitting there and wondering WHY on earth this story's in your reading queue.

Maybe it's just an awful story that you're not sure why anyone would recommend.

Maybe it's so completely off base of anything you'd look for, you can't imagine why you'd think it was a good read.

Maybe it's so completely off base of what you were looking for, you can't imagine why anyone would suggest it.

Maybe it's just a great big heaping pile of "wait, what??"

Let's talk about them!

The last two stories I've read:

1) A Severitus. I think, anyway. It read more like what would happen if Darth Vader held out his hand and proclaimed "Join me and we can rule the galaxy together as father and son." And Luke said "well, gosh, that sounds pretty alright, actually." ... only replace Vader with Snape and Luke with Harry. Not one sliver of warm and soft feelings through the whole damn story. The closest you got was "I trust him to kill me if I turn into a monster." .... awwwww...

2) I'm really not sure why this one's in my files, but the last like, 3 chapters have been biographies of the last few generations of Evanses. With some Opinions about Motherhood and Abortion and Evil People, and with a rather flagrant disregard for the era the stories are written in except where convenient (One of my fanfiction pet peeves) I'm really not sure how this got on my kindle or where it's going.

What about you?


** I'm not usually a fan of deep political intrigue but I got sucked into Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law, which was posted here awhile back.

Then a friend suggested Five Days, which is Dramione and not really my ship, but I really loved the suspense and realism of their situation. It was really claustrophobic and there were some really gross descriptions of infection though.

Finally, I read Grumpy Old Wizards which involved senior citizen Hermione and Draco and Severus and was adorable.

If I comment on a fic, it's because I enjoyed it. If I don't, I just carry on and keep reading other stuff.

I do adore good Snamione though. But when it's bad, it's absolutely horrid.

** One of my guilty pleasures is Snamione, but it has to be really well-written. I also love angst.
