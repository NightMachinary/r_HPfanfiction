*** They stop dosing him and his eyes turn blue like mad eye's eye. It turns out his eye is real and the strap is to keep it from floating off and investigating clues.

Harry doesn't have eye straps, or, forgive me, Eye-Downs, and his eyes wander off looking for whatever mystery is going on.

***** I was thinking more along the lines of the rise of Manipulative Dark Lady plot twist. Since it will not out of character to the Evil!FanficGinny to use the whole ordeal, having LV at her beck and call, to be a Queen. Also she had a thing for DiaryTom for a short while. The worst part is that it will take a long time before anyone finds out how Ginny controls LV. Some how I imagine things to be much worse.

** If Harry was dosed with calming droughts, what would've happened differently? A squirrel named Steve would've still been alive, that's for sure.

--------------

"Just relax mate, everything will be fine."

"She's my sister Harry!" Ron said.

"So? I don't see what the big deal is. What's the worst that could happen?"

"The basilisk eating my sister one inch at a time while she's alive and screaming?"

Harry's face grew a bit serious. "Exactly. See, nothing to worry about."

Ron fainted.

--------------

"Just give me the goddamn stone!" Quirrell shouted.

"Okay fine. I dunno why you're shouting though?"

"My master needs that stone immediately, you blundering fool!"

"Why does he need it so urgently? Just calm down bro, it's not as if Dumbledore is going to magically appear here and stun you if I delay..."

Dumbledore magically appeared and stunned Quirrell, while Harry sat and turned the stone around. A bit of the stone cut his hand at some point, which he ignored completely.

--------------

"Don't worry Dobby just chill, relax."

Dobby covered his ears when he heard the forbidden words.

"Please, Dobby is sorry Harry Potter, Dobby won't do it again!"

"Calm down. Here, sit down along with me on my bed, and think about doing nothing for a full day. I find it has a calming effect..."

Dobby started slowly backing away. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named only killed and maimed people, but Harry Potter was much worse. He prayed for the easy death of the Diary and popped away, leaving a wizard in his bed calmly reading the letters his friends had written.

--------------

"Harry?"

"Yeah Ron?"

"Why are we not running away?"

"Why should we be running away Ron?"

"There are spiders the size of a house surrounding us in the middle of the forest. Don't you feel that's something to worry about?"

"No, of course not. Why would you think so?"

Ron smacked himself. After a long suffering sigh, he again tried to reason with his eccentric friend.

"Harry?"

"Yes Ron?"

"We're in a dense forest at night. Correct?"

"Yeah."

"And we're surrounded on all sides by giant spiders who would pass for small hills. Still with me?"

Harry nodded.

"And they are carnivores, who eat children like us for breakfast. Agreed?"

"Sure do."

"Then what would happen if they tried to eat us? Shouldn't we run away?"

"Now you're just being silly Ron. They're just misunderstood creatures, all of them. They wouldn't hurt you at all." Saying that, Harry calmly walked out of that clearing. The spiders were so flummoxed by the stupid bravery of the foolish child that the duo was able to escape unharmed.

Somewhere deep inside the dirty walls of Azkaban, Hagrid teared up. He didn't know how, but he was sure Harry had done something to make him proud.

--------------

"So you have a time-turner, Hermione?"

"You aren't mad that I didn't tell you about them?"

"Why would I be?"

"... Let's just go save Sirius."

--------------

"Hagrid is keeping a Dragon in his wooden hut. What should we do about it?"

"I mean, the worst that could happen is his house getting destroyed, which can be rebuilt easily. On the other hand, Hagrid would recieve a valuable life lesson."

"Hermione, was he always this smart?"

"I don't know." Hermione said, observing Harry critically.

These scenes wrote themselves. I feel like I might actually continue this story on my fanfic page.

** There's a fic like this (a crack fic I think), where Dobby has started switching out the calming potions that had been in Harry's food... out comes Rage!Harry as I recall.

Can't remember the name though

Edit: It's an Omake in Odd Ideas. A very short one :/

**** Haha, great minds then :)

I've seen a few stories casually mention that Hogwarts put nutrient potions in students food---usually explained as students being picky eaters or refusing to eat their vegetables (if I had gone to boarding school at age 11, vegetables would have never crossed my lips) and magic needing nutrients etc.
