Posted this as a comment on another post, but it really got me thinking. I will not deny that Harry is generally a good person with a large self-sacrificing streak and a disturbing amount of bravery. However, he also has one /hell/ of a vicious streak. In Canon 4th year, after the incident where Snape says "I see no difference.", Harry begins to imagine "horrible things happening to him" and expresses a wish that he could use the Cruciatus Curse, so that he could have Snape "flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching.". Those are direct quotes from the book; I'm sure our resident bibliophiles can find the relevant paragraph.

A year later, he tries to Crucio Bellatrix, and fails. Two years after /that/, he curses Carrow in Ravenclaw Tower, successfully using that same dark curse. In 6th year, he nearly chokes Mundungus Fletcher after he discovers the same has stolen from him, only being stopped by someone casting a Relashio spell, forcing him to let go.

I'm sure there are more incidents that I'm forgetting about, but these are the big ones that came to mind. I'd like to get people's perspectives on this. What do you folks think? Am I over thinking this?

He was a teenager. Normal teenagers aren't emotionally mature and stable on a good day. Then just add all the crap he's been through- the Dursleys, seeing Cedric die, getting tortured, abandoned by his friends, slandered in the press, shunned by his peers, tortured /again/, seeing Sirius die. I'm honestly surprised Harry turned out as good as he did. I think there really should have been more fallout after Sirius' death. At the end of Order of the Phoenix he is a wreck. But only a few weeks later at the start of Half-blood Prince Harry is back to normal and trusts Dumbledore again. (And don't even get me started on the movie where he's just casually picking up muggle waitresses like Charlie Harper's long lost son.)

And just for posterity's sake: Draco Malfoy also tried using the Cruciatus on Harry, used the Imperius on Rosmerta, committed attempted murder twice (Katie and Ron), was planning to kill Dumbledore, became a member of a terrorist organisation and actively helped said organisation to infiltrate a school full of children. It's a bit off-topic, I know. But I find the amount of fics that treat Draco like a misunderstood hot flirting machine disturbing.

******* And that is the key point - *IF* they betrayed the group. People who went there agreed to keep the secret and thus protect their peers. Those who didn't feel up to it had ample opportunity to leave. All the others somehow managed, and thus remained safe.

Marietta went to Umbridge. Not 'was caught by' - 'went to'. As in, took direct action against both word and spirit of the pact she agreed to, knowing that people would pay for it, including Cho (who was supposed to be her friend).

I find it hard to feel sympathy for Marietta, because she got injured at the result of *premeditated actions* she undertook. I am not sure if she knew about Blood Quills, but shedid know that the the Toad was bad news and lacking in mercy.

To me, it read like one of those Super!Harry GoF parodies where he puts in his name, backs out and is surprised to lose his magic. And Marietta's punishment didn't last more that 2 years - and it only took that long for the last, cosmetic traces to fade.

**** Yes and no. I think a lot of people want to see a redemption arc for a lot of villains, I'd go so far as to say for all villains (I've seen some Voldy-fics where the descriptions lead me to believe they gave him a dark-hero happy-ish story; to be fair those aren't ones I've read, so I can't be sure but...).

But with Draco, I think the Zuko parallel is easy because they both have douche bag father figures who heavily influenced their lives and choices. Does that excuse anything Draco does? Absolutely not. But it helps to explain it, and IMO gives a great build up for change and redemption. He (both Draco & Zuko) was definitely a product of his environment, his family, and social circle, and I think he wouldn't necessarily have been the douche we know & love from the books (TV show) had his circumstances been different. I think we see a flash of this in book six, when Dumbledore tells him he's surprised he invited Greyback into the place where his friends live/sleep and even though we know Draco has used Greyback as a threat, he responds with something along the lines of horror saying “I didn't know he was coming!!” (Please forgive me for not being great with direct book quotes or taking the time to look it up :D).

I think it's plausible for Draco to have a change of heart once he grows up a little and starts thinking for himself instead of continuing to be spoon fed by his environment; kind of like Zuko did with seeing the world and realizing that the world view his father painted was false. And he chose to change. Granted the books don't really show that Draco had this change of heart, but I think a lot of fanfics have done a good job with it. Also, Draco's parents clearly abandon all their beliefs/alliances at the end in search for their son whom they loved above all else, so change/redemption is clearly possible.

This also comes from a diehard Dramione & Zutara shipper, so I'm probably biased, lol. :D

Also, to the OP, I agree that he was angsty/snarky, but like the other commenter mentioned I'm surprised it wasn't more. This doesn't speak well for myself but I think I would have been way worse if I had been in Harry's same situation. Most of his douche-ish responses, while not ok, are understandable reactions to everything he was subjected to. I think it's actually why I have such a hard time re-reading The Order of the Phoenix, because I get so angry at the injustices and there's never enough of a retaliation, again IMO. Thank goodness for Fred & George's departure, lol.

****** Draco got the benefits of redemption without actually going through a lot of the steps.

****** I ship Zuko & Katara but I don't ship Draco with anyone. The biggest difference between the two I think is their childhoods and relationships with their fathers.

Zuko was a good kid who barely interacted with his horrible father. Had some really bad teen years did a few bad things mostly for the right reasons or just survival, but all in all was good.

Draco had from his point of view a great dad who spent time with him and taught him to be a man. Basically from the start Draco was taught to be a piece of shit. His entire world view is some awful nazi shit, and yeah a few people who have been raised like that better themselves it's really really rare.

******* In that view Draco is closer to Azula in some ways than Zuko, characterization-wise. Which tracks with the paternal brainwashing they both received- the main differences are how they were used by their fathers and how much power each father held. If Lucius Malfoy had been the Dark Lord as opposed to his lieutenant, it's entirely possible Draco would have been a lot more like his Aunt Bellatrix- deadly and confident with a thick streak of cunning- than we see in canon.

******** I don't think Draco and Azula are that similar. Azula enjoys what she does and revels in the hurt she's able to cause; Draco thinks he will, and tries his hardest to be his father and a good Death Eater, but as we see in the last two books, he simply ends up miserable.

I think in that way he's sort of in the middle between Zuko and Azula.

If I had to find parallels, I'd say Malfoy Manor is the equivalent of the cave in Crossroads of Destiny: Draco doesn't give the trio away, and Zuko opens up to Katara and seems to be about to switch sides. And then, due to circumstances or due to immaturity, who knows, both revert to their old selves and take refuge in what they know, despite that making them miserable.

After the day of black sun, Zuko manages to finally break free from his father's influence, and I don't find it too hard to imagine a similar arc for Draco after the Battle of Hogwarts.

********* Oh for sure- very good points. I think a lot of the difference is that he didn't have a sibling, either. Azula is the way she is because her father was able to compare Zuko to her and inflate both her confidence and sociopathic tendencies by putting Zuko down to raise her up- hence Ozai's A+ parenting quote of, "Your sister was born lucky. You were lucky to be born."

If Draco had had the same kind of influences (his father actually having ultimate authority, sibling rivalry, absent parents by either necessity (Ursa) or neglect (Ozai), and later, a healthy father figure to help him navigate emotional pitfalls), he may have turned out either more ruthless, like Azula, or more jaded and eventually redeemed for it, like Zuko.

Given the emphasis the Ton puts on heirs and bloodline, I think Draco would have broken more similarly to Azula out of necessity. He was more similar to Zuko in canon because he was the boy who made terrible choices out of love for his father- much of what we see for the first 2.5 seasons of ATLA with our favorite awkward Turtleduck. But his father didn't repay that love with betrayal and didn't make that love a weapon against Draco, so it continues to get him into worse and worse situations because letting go is hard, especially with centuries of familial obligation bearing down on you, too.

********** True. More to this point: Narcissa, and even Lucius, for all his faults, loved Draco, making it harder to break free in a way. Ozai on the other hand did everything in his power to diminish and belittle Zuko at every turn, and Ursa left too early. Plus of course Zuko had Iroh to guide him.

*********** Exactly. Love is a bond that is hard to reject even when it's unrequited, like with Zuko and his father. When it's a loving, healthy bond? Anybody would be hard-pressed to reject it, even for the clear "good" choice right in front of them.

I'm pretty sure Iroh was an essential part of Zuko coming around when he did. I firmly believe Zuko could have gotten there on his own, but it would have taken longer and been harder without an example of what a parent really should be to compare Ozai to.

Draco is indirectly the entire reason Harry made it out of the final battle alive, because of that reciprocal bond between him and his mother. It's easy to imagine Ursa would have done the same thing, but she was gone far too early. The major difference is I could see Lucius doing the exact same as Narcissa, but I couldn't see Ozai doing so even for Azula.

Indeed, this happens in canon. It's just that it happens mostly off-screen and we only see it from small pieces in the books---Draco refusing to kill Dumbledore at the end of the sixth book, Draco refusing to identify Harry when the trio is captured during the seventh book---and from Rowling's comments after the fact.

I think fanfic authors moving this change of heart up in time to before he joins the Death Eaters isn't any more implausible than what's in canon.

Narcissa goes against Voldemort as well, but that was motivated by Draco, not by denouncing pureblood supremacy.

******* I agree, I think a lot of the points in favor of Draco's redemption only count if it's an actual change of heart motivating his actions. My interpretation is that his actions are more based on fear and self preservation (though I will admit, it's been awhile since I've actually read the books).

And of course it's fine for fan fic to interpret those actions to support his redemption, it's a popular trope for a reason. I just wish there were more well written (aka not uber bashing) stories out there were Draco is still the same self-centered, big talking, kinda cowardly, blood supremacist...you know, just to balance it out a bit.

  It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . . Wouldn't he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?

Yeah, he tries to do as much harm as he can to the person who /had just killed the closest thing he has ever had to a parent right in front of him./ And then she gloats about it. If someone murdered my dad and I witnessed it, damn right I'd be trying to do as much harm to that person as I could. And I don't even have the excuse of being an angry teenage boy with a Dark Lord stuck in my head.

I think the Snape stuff is justified - Snape (book!Snape anyway) is bloody awful to Harry and to Hermione. Not to mention how he treats Neville. He's a bitter twisted person who bullies children. Because he's a teacher, Harry /cannot/ stand up to him in any way. Snape has the final say because he is the one in authority. So I think it's normal to fantasise about hurting someone who has been abusing their power over you - you want them to get a taste of what feeling helpless like that is.

The Carrows - who actually thinks what he did was wrong? McGonagall was basically his last remaining link to Dumbledore, the only authority figure left that he trusts. And to witness her humiliated like that, by a person Harry knows has also been torturing and abusing his friends? He had to cause pain, he had to incapacitate them or /they would have handed him over to Voldemort./

It was a war. People make decisions in war that they wouldn't always make in peace time. Every time Harry hurt someone, they deserved it and it was of their own making. Even when he used sectumsempura on Draco - Draco had been about to use the cruciatus curse on him. It's a case of self defence, and Harry felt absolutely awful about having caused that much damage.

If someone disfigures a close friend of mine, and an authority figure observes the effects and does nothing about it except make some stupid mocking comment, I'm going to be doing more than fantasizing about hurting said authority figure.

Legally not; it's specifically an /Unforgivable/ curse. I don't know what JKR was thinking, having Harry use two out of three without any consequences. The torture curse on Amycus Carrow, right in front of Professor McGonagall, was particularly egregious.

** He only fantasised about cursing Snape, he doesn't actually try anything until Snape kills Dumbledore - and when he tries, he fails miserably because the author made him a worthless everyman.

Bellatrix, he attempts (and fails) to curse right after the woman killed the closest thing he had to a parent. Carrow, he curses when they're about to fight Voldemort and his army.

The thing with Harry is that he never does anything like this in the middle of a fight. Crabbe fires killing curses at Hermione? Harry's response is to use a first year spell. Tottenham court road, they use obliviation which makes it obvious that the two Death Eaters encountered someone from the Order who were too squeamish to kill. The bike escape when he and Hagrid are barely holding on for life? He uses a bloody disarming charm.

Heck, a more vicious approach from Harry would have left Malfoy Manor in ruins with all the Death Eaters dead inside.

**** McGonagall was never a mother figure to Harry, he barely knows her really. The fact he tortured Carrow rather than just kills him is a huge concern. Killing him would have been kinder and better for the war effort, instead he tortured the guy. A temporary solution and one that won't last long, Carrow could have gotten up later.

But I think this is mostly Rowling's own messed up morality, thinking that only murder is truly unforgivable and that killing equals murder.

***** I agree with you on Rowling's take on murder, however I definitely think McGonagall however little Harry may have actually known her, was a mother figure to him. She was his head of house, an inherently motherly role, she helped him multiple times over the years (1st year: signs him up for quidditch like a proud mum instead of expelling him or docking points for flying without authorization; 2nd year: doesn't expel Ron or him for the car incident and tears up/says she understands when he lies & says they want to visit Hermione in the hospital wing after she's petrified; 3rd year: escorts him to the hospital wing after the dementors on the train; buoys his spirits after Professor Trelawney predicts his death )- all things a mother, which Harry never had, would do. I could go on, but truly Harry has very few mother figures in his life, so even one who is strict, but always stood up for him (let's not forget how in fifth year she grabs his shoulders and flat out tells Umbridge she'll make it her life's mission to make Harry an auror) even if they weren't close/close confidants, she meant/represented a LOT to Harry.

Though again, I agree that Rowling's take that murder is the worst is wrong. She even has Dumbledore say it at one point, I think, that there are far worse things than death. And I agree, the torture she inflicted on Harry was far worse. Killing, while heinous, isn't necessarily the worst crime in the books.

Also, I wouldn't say Harry tortured Carrow. His spell was so strong it threw Carrow against the wall and knocked him out. It was basically instant and hardly torture. If it had been reversed the death eaters would have inflicted far worse torture on Harry.

**** He cursed Carrow because he just found out the Carrows have been torturing his friends and fellow students all year and planned to tell Voldemort that it was the students' fault he couldn't find Harry (a literal death sentence).

***** I agree, but I think the reason it pushed him over the edge was because she's like a mother figure to him. I think there are few other professors that could have taken McGonagall's place that would have elicited such a strong reaction from Harry were they spit at/on. For example, had it been Trelawney instead, I don't know that it would have pushed him to react that way. Granted, I think something would have pushed him there regardless because Carrow had, like you said, tortured his friends/fellow students all year and was an all around douche (and was there when Dumbledore died also feeding his dislike for Carrow because at this point in the book Harry didn't know about Snape's duplicity). I think it plays out the way it does because it was that mother figure for Harry being spat at, and it took a slight on someone he respected so highly to push him over the edge and go ‘ya know, enough is enough' curse Carrow and to mean it so viscously/intensely because of all the crap Carrow had done.

** People tend to forget that Harry is an abused child, and often if a person hurts someone who an abused child is close too then the child will lash out in anger, and try to protect the person who was harmed. Harry is no different. Bellatrix had just killed his godfather, on of the only people who cared about Harry's well-being. And Carrow had threatened his head of house, the person who made sure he was alright, and who kept Harry Potter in check. Honestly I probably would have done the same thing. Also Dung had stolen from his late godfather, and by extension, himself. One thing abused children are protective of are their belongings. Harry has so little for so many years, and once he has something, Dung takes it away. I would have lashed out too.

The adults are horrible, abusive and should have long since have faced repercussions but haven't, and the child in question deals with all sorts of abusive behaviour with resilience or snark.

The only fic where I seriously see Harry actually suffering consequences from the shit live has heaped up on him, and Petunia getting her shit together enough to consider family therapy is An Aunt's Love.
