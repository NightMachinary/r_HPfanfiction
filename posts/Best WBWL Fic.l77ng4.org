Tried to do the Sacrifices series, but after a series breaks 1m words I get tired of it. Any amazing WBWL fics that are unde 500k words? I'd like to keep Dumbledore and Weasley bashing to a minimum if at all possible (I know that's a hard ask in this trope), and please no adult/child pairings (nooo Snarry or Tomrarry pls). Thank you!!


** Ooh, fun. If you want to cry yourself to sleep after reading it, then there's linkao3(Antithesis by OceanBreeze7), completed at 400k. Very emotionally traumatising lol, this fic was heart-wrenching, brilliant writing.

There's the linkao3(Sarcasm and Slytherin) series, which is up to book 5 and possibly abandoned.

Then there's linkao3(Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos) which is pretty much the same premise as S&S. Pros: IMO, better writing than S&S and it's regularly updated, but Cons: it's only up to book 2.

You can also go through the WBWL tag on AO3, sort by kudos and exclude the relationships you don't want :)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.

  Like most complicated things in life, this story starts with a boy, a secret and a smile. Even in retrospect, they seem like they've been scribbled on a scrap piece of paper and blindly plucked from a nice, big bowl of what-else-can-the-universe-thrust-at-me for the sake of twisted arbitrary, but not everything is as it seems, and everything seems ridiculous and inconvenient. At the same time, maybe you should have seen this coming. Maybe you should have predicted the shit storm that was going to spin your life into vertigo, like the earth has been tipped off its axis, latitude and longitude slipping and colliding while the corners of the map fade to ash. It happens, as you would later realize with an impending sense of doom, like this...

**** Okay good bot, but you got the bottom one wrong- my fault though bot, I didn't realise you don't link series! Also the second one is the /second/ book in sarcasm and Slytherin, not the first, but close enough.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the forsaken's ascension) should be book 1 of ashes of chaos. There's an audiobook of it too on YouTube.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.
