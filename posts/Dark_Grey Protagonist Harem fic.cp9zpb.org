i leave it open who the Protagonist is, but when i got the idea for this Request, i imagined (a corrupted) Malfoy sitting on a Chair and surrounded in lascivous poses by different Women, all nude. Some are from the known HP universe, some are OCs, possibly from an AU.

I wonder if a Draco Harem Fic exist that is, as i know there are plenty of Harry ones out there. It would be good that the Character wouldnt be Dark/Grey from the Beginning, but his Behavior changes during the Process of the Fic.

I dont know, maybe the other Dimension that opens is some sort of Hell and he gets corrupted by it (not only by his action, but also because of the alluring Females). Although i would keep the supernatural thing in a short leash, im not completely rejected by it.

The imagine of Malfoy sitting on a Chair with all the Females is some sort of Picture of him being the new "Ruler". But alternatively they can lie in a Big Bed.

I read some (dark) harem Fics and in those so far the Character tends to live out his ....partialy sadistic side. I would like, if he keeps his normal (tender) behavior towards the Women, unless of course there are some who want him to be rude or even Dirty Talk.

If the females from the HP World are part of the Harem, it doesnt need to be the Original ones, but lets say "copies" to satisfy the Protagonists need of said characters....he doesnt want to hurt or "taint" them, so he lets some clones put on the "Mask" of said Women.


** Lord of darkness is a great fix. If you read The AO3 version, the author includes the lemons. Features evil Harry with a massive harem.
