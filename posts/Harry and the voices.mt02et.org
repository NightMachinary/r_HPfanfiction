The story was a severitus where I think snape was the biological father. In the story voices kept encouraging Harry to do certain things and he became a potion master coz of them. The reason the voices affected Harry was that snape once promised them his first born child in exchange for something i can't remember

Edit: also harry became the the youngest every potion master right after snape I think it may have Weasely bashing


** That sounds interesting

*** It was pretty long I think over 100k words I think it was on ffn and the summary I remember nothing about this was a long time ago. Notable characters are well snape and Harry

**** The only ones I'm finding that match closely are linkffn(It's Mutual 1 by breannatala) and the sequel(s) linkffn(It's Mutual 2 and 3 by breannatala).

  Life seemed good... but Harry never considered his future, and as the Voices try to control him, he tries to keep up, and Voldemort's attacks always looming, will the end be good enough to be worth all that he must give up? STORY GROWS DARKER
