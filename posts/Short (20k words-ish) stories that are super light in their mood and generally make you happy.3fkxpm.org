** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] has a lot of great short (and fantastic longer) stories that fill the happy ending requirement, most often with romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/547939/][Crazy Mishka]] has many short fluffy pieces. All Hermione-centric and not always paired with Harry, but the ones that are, are top notch.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] : /Apathetic Occlumency teacher twisting your mind out of shape? Never fear, there's a charming young girl in the year below to twist it back in the opposite direction. Just hope it doesn't snap. Harry/Luna./

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewuser.php?uid=4064][Advice for the Lovetorn masses]] : /Ginny Weasley, matchmaker extraordinaire? The girls of Hogwarts certainly seem to think so! But how could Ginny give them any advice on their love-lives when she couldn't even manage her own? Not that she actually had one to speak of.../

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
