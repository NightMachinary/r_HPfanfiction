Love him or hate him, Severus Snape is without a doubt, HP' s most complex character. I just so happen to love him (as a character, nothing more, thanks), but what I love most about him is his sheer bravery and his towering and un-excavated intelligence. I feel his personhood is wasted when people try to shack him up with characters like Lupin, Harry or Hermione. Even with Lily, it doesn't work. Severus Snape is meant to be perpetually lonely in love. He is unattractive and foreboding and even if anyone did fall for him, he's still in love and guilt for Lily.

So are there any fanfictions that don't focus on Snape's love life, but rather on his dangerous spywork and his Potions and spell genius? I've read plutoplex's 'Darkness Visible', which was pretty good, although Dumbledore was uber evil and the ending was just depressing. I have nothing against Snape-angst- in fact, it's quite useful, just is there a Snape fanfiction more heavy on the war and spywork than on sex and romance?

Thanks. Crimson

nah, i disagree. snape's character works best when played off other people. many things about him- his bravery for example, are extremely personal and individual-oriented. his personhood shines in his relationships with other people, because that's where the drama, conflict and driving force for him is

*** Yeah, Snape's whole life is defined by others. He becomes a death eater because of his father's abuse and his "friend"'s influence. He becomes a spy because of Lily. And he is torn between two masters, Dumbledore and Voldemort.

*** Well, I agree that he plays well off other characters, but I've always seen him shine best in platonic relationship stories. I know I'm in a majorly wierd corner of the Snape fandom world by not seeing Snape as Mr. Uber Lover, but I just think that his love for Lily is just too strong, and has shaped his entire life so much, that I can't see it being easy for him to just forget her. I'd need to see a fanfiction seriously tackle that aspect of his emotions, but so far I haven't seen one.

** linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is a canon compliant, detailed and complete autobiography of Severus Snape from birth to death and it's FANTASTIC. It's the definitive Snape fic and the Snape I measure all the other Snapes by. I can't believe it doesn't get rec'd more often.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

I prefer the first part (pre-Hogwarts), it tells a part of the story that tends to be glossed over in other fics and sets up Snape's behaviour beautifully for JKR's canon.
