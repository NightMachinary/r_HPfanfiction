In canon, there is four hereditary magical powers; parseltongue, metamorpmagism, seership and veela allure. We know veela allure comes from having a veela haritage. What is the reason behind other magical powers? My ideas:

Parseltongue comes from having actual snakes amongs your ancestors. This also apply to other animals too. For example some witches and wizards in the East Asia can speak to dragons much like european parselmouths because they are descended from dragons.

Seership is the result of having a ghost on the family tree. Because of their otherworldly ancestry, seers exist in this life and the afterlife at the same time and are able to see the workings of the universe from the outside, allowing them to make prophecies. However their minds are still mortal so their subconcious cencors the the events they witness, causing prophecies to be vauge.

Metamorphmagism is a genetic mutation caused by overexposure to transfiguration spells or overdosing on something like polyjuice potion. Person who is changed because of overexposure to transfiguration relayed magic does not become a metamophmagus but their children do.

*** Purebloods wanted to keep their bloodlines pure for magical power when in fact they should have done the exact opposite.

** The thing is...Veela are considered beings. So any Veela related abilities would be diluted as time went on.

Further generations would probably just keep the beauty.

It's like with Hagrid. Giants are beings.

Hagrid is just first generation like Fleur's grandmother.

Any potential children of would his would inherit size and strength.

**** The only reason I can understand this sentence at all is because when I googled it a reddit 1v1 Hagrid vs. The Mountain came up. I've never watched game of thrones. I was so so confused

The Mountain has disowned his father and brother, Fezzik and is ashamed of his giant heritage despite the fact that he has benefited from it. The Hagrid family would gladly accept him back despite his cruelty and practice of the dark arts. Rubeus Hagrid is still proud enough to call him his son.

** My personal headcanon for Parseltongue is that Herpo the Foul is the creator of it. We all know he created the Basilisk and the Hocrux Rituall and it's not a long shot too think that me made his Basilisk his Hocrux. And then he needed some way to speak to it to control it and made some kind of extra soul magic thingy where he would get the ability to speak Parseltongue. And then it was just kept in the Bloodline so all Eureopean Parselmouths like Salazar and Tommy are descendants of him.

** Veela allure is fanon, not canon. Veela can mesmerise men with their movements, but the mindnumbing effect of fanon is just that; fanon.

They can shapeshift to something resembling harpies and throw balls of fire, though. But that's magical being powers, not wizarding powers.

*** It kind of is cannon. It is never reffered as an allure in the books but veela do put people into a trance like state in the Quidditch world cup. Fleur is not a veela but has a grandmother who is and exhibit similar powers
