Stuff where the muggle world influence him. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4771879/1/A-Squib-Worth]]

Anything that has a large part in the muggle world, or at least a large muggle influence in the wizarding part.


** Did you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]]? The first dozen chapters were a bit tedious for me to read, maybe because I don't really like muggle-influenced Harry, but I did like the later parts, where he goes to Hogwarts. Basically it's about Harry raised by a muggle who found out about the wizarding world and manages not to get obliviated. Harry is torn between his loyalty to the muggle world and loyalty to his new life. There's a muggle organization that wants to expose wizards, they manage to take pictures and videos of magic and spread them all over the news.. It's really long, like 650 000 words long and only at the Triwizard Tournament at the moment. But well, it definitely has a large part in the muggle world and is at the moment preparing a big show off between them.

*** YESSSS, I have read it And it is totally yes, very what I wanted. There's a few other stories where Harry grows up in a muggle gang that were interesting that I wouldn't mind finding again. But yes, something like this is what I am looking for.

**** Well, there are two other stories that come to mind then. Harry growing up with muggle gangsters.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.
#+end_quote

There are a few scenes with Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape that are too ridiculous and it the latest chapters hint at manipulative!Dumbledore. Really hope it won't go down there.

  Left to survive in the worst conditions possible, a boy carves his future out of the ashes, and has one grandiose plan to change the world. DM/HP. AU. Slash. Complete.
#+end_quote

Yup, DM/HP in the later part of the story. If you don't mind that then the story might appeal to you. The Dursleys leave Harry in London, he lives on the streets until he finds people to live with. Enters Hogwarts late. Modifies muggle guns to work with magic and basically wants to instigate a muggle/wizard war. Amoral Harry.

** If it counts (it's crack), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter, The Geek]]. Bit of a guilty pleasure and always makes me laugh, even if it's more crackfic than serious.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]] is about as close as you can get without going overboard on the muggle integration. It genuinely feels like Harry is a wizard who has kept stronger ties to the muggle world than the magical one, though it is a bit of a pop culture mish-mash and some of the humour falls flat if you don't understand the myriad references or appreciate fourth-wall breaks.

Also, it's in first person, so be wary if you're not into that.
