I know from many "favorite fic" posts that many of you enjoyed the A Song of Ice and Fire/Harry Potter crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]], and have been saddened that it hasn't been updated in months. Well, there isn't an update, but the author isn't dead! It looks like he's rewriting the story as he reads through the books. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] is the new one, and his profile suggests that he'll be writing new content once he finishes catching up with the original.


** I'm really glad he's finally coming back, but I'm not sure how I feel about him updating it. I asked him about it a week or two ago and it seems like he's not planning on changing much, but with a story as good as that I'm not sure he can change anything for the better.

*** Seriously, I feel a rewrite is pretty much unnecessary here. The story has only just now reached canon if I remember correctly, perhaps 1 or 2 chapters beyond the very beginning of canon at the latest. As much as I love the story, it's mostly been character development and introduction to the world, plot, etc. What's the point of rewriting that? Doesn't it already fit pretty well with the books?

** Purpose of the rewrite:

#+begin_quote
  I decided to start the new story because the larger chapters are getting split up into smaller pieces, the first being chapter 3, which changes the makeup of every chapter after. Some things will be more fleshed out, some less, but the gist of the story will be the same.

I think it's up to him how he wants to write his fic, tbh. I had no problem with it as before, but I greatly doubt it'll be made worse rather than better. Sure, he isn't incredibly far into the plot, but he is 100k words in, and that's about the length of a typical novel. If he wants to rewrite that so it's better, than more power to him, especially if he's got an eye towards OF (which semi-private stuff on his part support).

Sure, it's a pain to have to wait, but we'll live.

*** It does have some romance, but that is not its focus.
