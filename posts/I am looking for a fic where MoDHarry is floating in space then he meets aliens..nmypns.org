:END:
So basically Harry somehow ends up floating around in space not dying but not alive either as space doesnt have any air. It doesn't specifically mention Harry is the Matser of Death but it is implied since he can't die

Then an alien spaceship finds him and revives him. They were curious on how he was alive and wondered if the rest of his species were like him. After Harry wakes up or whatever, the captain(?) of the ship explains some stuff about the ship and other aliens and askes what his species specialty? Is. He answers something in the lines of 'that humans like war' or something. Also I think Harry had scars from when he was experimented(?) by muggles?

He also had a roomate in a room where they can change the temperature for each species/alien. And clothes that do the similar thing. He also writes/draws wizards on a notebook to help them learn about his species. He also has PTSD i think? But not mentioned as that but he is traumatized.

Then the ship is attacked by another alien ship that enslaves them? I don't remember much sadly....

Aaanndddd I think that's about it.

Thank you!^{^}
