It may sound a bit dubious but this is a really well-written fic that I lost track of and only recently remembered existed. Other things that happen are Harry corresponding with an American professor and expert in Parseltongue (Joseph? Joshua?), one of the more recent uploaded chapters has Harry looking at memories Peter Pettigrew gave him in a Pensieve and discovering that James and Lily were going to divorce, etc.
