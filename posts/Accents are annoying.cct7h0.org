** As with anything in fanfiction it's all about moderation. Dropping the 'h' at the beginning of Fleur's spoken words gets the point across without having to alter every word like in your example. The Hagrid accent in particular grates on my nerves.

Adding on to your point I find authors who overemphasize local, more obscure slang in stories to be maddening. Post Hogwarts stories in Australia are the worst offenders of this sort of thing. Some get so enamored with emphasizing the Australian accents as well as local phrases I legitimately struggle with understanding anything the character is saying.

It blows me away that authors don't realize that these artificial barriers hurt their stories and drive away readers. I mean...good for you that you used the Australian term for 'jerk' but I have no idea what it means so you've lost me.

*** I think adding obscure slang to stories is generally a really good thing to do as it adds some colour to the character and setting. It's something I like to do, but there are rules:

- Don't to it very much; once every 20 paragraphs at most,
- Make really, really sure the meaning is completely obvious from the context. Is the meaning of the sentence still clear if the slang term is replaced with a random, made-up word?
- The slang term must be one the character would plausobly know and use, based on their background.
- Only put the slang the charater's speech, never in the bulk of the narrative. The exception to this rule is first person. And then only for some narrator characters. For example, if a story is first person from Hermione's PoV, then the author's pretending this is something Hermione actually wrote. And she would never use slang terms in writing, even if she occasionally used them in speaking. If it was FP from Ron's PoV, then you might get away with some occasional bits of slang.

** I agree. Personally, I feel that if the reader has time to stop and be angry about the fact that Fleur is speaking perfect english, the story of the fic clearly isn't engaging them all that much. It's perfectly reasonable to write a normal speaking Fleur and expect the reader to give her an accent in their own head.

** Hmm my opinion as a writer is that it is very challenging to write accents, especially if you're not that familiar with it, or the fact that English is not your first language. I agree with that, and also with the fact that it is complicated to hit the nail with Fleur's accent. You must find a way for her speech to sound french but find the correct words and phrases as not to use the h' as much and to avoid making the sentence almost impossible and tiring to read.

On the other hand, for me as a reader, it is /very/ important the british accent. I almost can't stand when people write in american accent. I've read fics in which they use american slang and it is the worst for me (can you imagine Ron saying “ ‘Sup dude” instead of “ Oi mate!” ? Yeah, thought so). I almost immediately click away because imo being immersive is one of the most important things when writing; I want the characters to feel as real as possible, and feel like I'm in England and not in Brooklyn. For example, Seamus' accent is Irish, and I believe the accent also gives personality to the character. I want to read the difference between his accent and the others because he's Irish, and not feel like everybody talks the same. I know it can sometimes be very tiring to write accents, but I much prefer a fic in which they use the phrases “bloody hell”, “mate”, “loo”, “pissed”, “piss off” than the American phrases. For me, it makes the author much more commited to the work and the fic much more real.

It is hard to nail accents, and if you're gonna write a character like Fleur/Hagrid/Tonks/Seamus, one must be an excellent writer to be able to project the accent without making the reader go nuts deciphering what it said. So my advice to that is: If you can't write it, then don't push it. If you're not that good at accents, just try to avoid writing characters that have a prominent one. It is a hell of a work to write accents, but it makes the work much better. Just keep practising until you nail it.

** In my opinion a heavy accent should only be used if a character only appears very briefly, like giving Fleur a really heavy accent, but only ever having her speak one time in the whole fic, because she's not an important character in that particular fic. Or having Hagrid be barely understandable, but because Harry isn't friends with him he only has 2 or 3 lines of dialog throughout the entire story.

Otherwise accents should be toned down as much as possible, or eliminated entirely. You can always mention their accent in a quick description after the dialog, e.g. "You are an idiot!" Fleur exclaimed, her French accent adding an extra level of scorn to her already biting tone.

** omg yes. I tried to read this one fic recently that seemed good, but the the accenting was really out there. The character has a british accent but the author kept dropping the g like lyin' instead of lying or annoyin' instead of annoying and i'm reading that as a southern USA american accent and it just absolutely ruined it for me. I also couldn't read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in high school for the same reason. I figure if it's a central character, use it sparingly. In the books Hagrid and Fleur show up in bits and pieces so reading their accents isn't so intense, but if they were the main character it'd be awful. In the same tune when authors have foreign language lines and you have to scroll all the way to the end to figure out what was said. like, just italicize it.
