I've not read any fanfics in quite a few months now, (Had some exams to be dealing with) but I was wondering whether anyone had any flics they suggest I read.

Typically I enjoy a fic with a fair bit of romance, (Hapnhe and Harmione normally) and lots of the ones I enjoy have Sirius become Harry's dad in a way, but I'm up for anything really, along as there a long fic, (like 300k + ideally)

Some of my favourite fics are Marauders plan, Lions pride series and a saviour of magic, anything like them would be much appreciated!
