For example, I remember reading some story where Harry needed Fawkes for something and Dobby overheard or something than apparated away and literally appeared a moment later with his hands around Fawkes' neck who was stuggling against him. He kept on flaming away only for Dobby to apparate them back. That is all I can literally remember about the story. I remember another where Fawkes kept on stealing Dumbledore's lemon drops as well. Anyway, I'm looking for the best crack/humor fics involving Fawkes in a major way. Thnx!


** linkffn(8964470) the first chapter is about Fawkes.

#+begin_quote
  A series of unrelated scenes from various POVs (Harry features in every other one). Begins with "Flying," in which Harry learns that there are still a few things able to challenge him in the air, and goes from there.

** There's one out there with the Marauders feeding Fawkes Scotch Bonnet peppers, which the bird loves but which give him terrible stinky gas. I know.. not the most mature humor but I laughed anyway..

**** Er. Yeah. After properly reading your post, it is obviously not what i linked to. The story i linked to has a one shot that should be read first.
