I've never read a fic that had a 5th champion that helps Harry a lot, so I was wondering if any existed.

Thanks!


** I remember one with seven champs. I think Fred and George were champions. It was a crackfic, but I don't remember more.

** I've never come across any fics that had a 5th Champion. The closest I can think about is a fic in which Hermione was a Champion instead of Harry. But that's still 4 Champions.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Agents of Attor) features Harry and Malfoy as the fourth and fifth Hogwarts champions, but with the twist that they have to work together as a team. I don't think it was a slash fic.

  Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire but no one could have foreseen that written on that same slip of paper was Draco Malfoy. Resented by their houses and forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament together, the two once rivals form a grudging alliance in their struggle to survive the trials ahead. Rated MA.

** Why would a fifth champion help Harry a lot? Wouldn't they be trying to win?

*** Well, from a direct standpoint it makes no sense. on the other hand, it would be a substantial passive help- because it would spread the hate further. if they were from hogwarts, it wouldn't just be harry who "cheated" into the tournament. Anyone who supports, say, "ron", would also need to support harry, and the hate would be spread out too- anything they did to reduce that hate would also apply to harry's case.

Additionally, if they were also inexperienced- if, say, ginny or luna wound up in it, i could see an alliance of neccessity being a thing that happened.
