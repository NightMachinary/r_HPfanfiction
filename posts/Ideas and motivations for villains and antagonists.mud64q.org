So, I am writing a fanfic focused on Lily Luna adventures in Hogwarts. I am disconsidering Cursed Child, and making alterations in the story and characters, due to we barely know something about the next generation, most of them are basically OCs. While I am trying to make believable and realistic characters and avoid mary-sues / gary stues and clichés and tropes, I got stuck on the villains.

What could be motivations for villains and antagonists? Ideologies that not pure blood supremacism or wizards supremacy towards muggles. Villains motivated for something different than continuing the legacy of Grindelwald and Voldemort, who acts differently than having an all dressed in black army who calls themselves Dark Lord and who are trying to conquest the world.

I don't have problems with dark lords, in fact, I like they (principally in the Voldemort style, more than in Sauron / Morgoth style), so they can be in the story, but with different motivations than the same old thing we already saw in the books.

Did anyone has an idea for motivations for villains or antagonists, maybe more contained menaces than dominating the world (save the dark lords for later), but who can still personify a direct threat for Lilly Luna and her friends?


** Snape's ghost is the potions teacher, everyone hates him but they are stuck with him because Harry made him a War Hero. Lily now must correct her father's greatest mistake and exorcism /the fucking ghost/.

** I had a few ideas many years ago when I was toying with the thought of writing a next-gen series myself but I'm no longer interested in it so suit yourself. Some of the ideas have been used in other fics and were better implemented than ever could but you choose what you like:

- A Muggleborn/Squib group disenchanted with the little progress that Magical Britain has made in terms of their rights so they want to eliminate all purebloods and establish a magicfolk/muggle breeding program so that in a generation or two, everyone will have magical powers;

- An elusive gangster that is suspected to have made a huge fortune through the use of dark arts. He is involved in a lot of philanthropic activities and basically Hogwarts was rebuilt from his donations. He is well-liked in the community but has a lot of Ministry people in his pocket. Harry plays a game of cat and mouse with him but eventually he starts targeting the Potters. Harry agrees to surrender in exchange of an Unbreakable Vow that he or his gang won't harm his family. Later the guy hears a prophecy that (in my case) Albus would bring about the ruin of his empire so he tries to find a way of getting him killed by promising him he'll set Harry free in exchange for completing several dangerous tasks that are meant to get him killed;

- A dark wizard who tries to steal the magic source from underneath Hogwarts accidentally unleashes a demonic being called the Father of Dementors who wants to enslave all human kind and use them as feeding source for the Dementors. Turns out the real reason for the Chamber of Secrets was to serve as a prison for this Demonic being which is a manifestation of all the dark arts practiced in the early days of Hogwarts and the Basilisk was guarding it.

- An overly-zealous DMLE head with ambitions to become the Ministry for Magic becomes paranoid about the usage of dark arts and institutes a very intrusive program to monitor them. While at first a highly popular measure, people soon find themselves in an Orwellian dystopia where even the slightest transgression can lend you in Azkaban or even on the death row. The guy eventually becomes a Big Brother-like figure;

- Quite similar to the previous one but this time it's Harry and the DA who ran a very corrupt government, which under the guise of enforcing an equalitarian society, they ban the use of magic for everyone except themselves. Anyone in need of a spell or charm have to present themselves to the Ministry and deal with a lot of bureaucracy, the fees are absurd and anyone caught using magic without Ministry permission is sentenced to death;

- Similar to the above but after the original trio is killed, a cult forms around their ideology of an equalitarian society without dark arts. They eventually take over the magical world and only members of the cult are allowed to practice magic and only for the betterment of society. However it is very difficult to join the cult and the whole wizarding world falls into disarray because people can no longer do anything by themselves.

Hope any of these would be of use to you.

**** Of course. Happy to be of help. I would actually love to see them written sometime but I just don't have the physical time to write a compelling 7-book series.

** Wizards vs creatures, specifically the humanoid ones denied wands.

Edit: Werewolves work, too. It could be a simple fight for equality that becomes something else because of one or a few.

#+begin_quote
  adventures in Hogwarts

If you had said adventures after Hogwarts, I was going to say "petty crime" but... how bad can it possibly get in school?

*** One of my greatest problems was to define how bad the situation will be. The problem is, removing everything related to Voldemort or Grindelwald and their ideologies, leaves a few little to be a threat to a school, Unless we discover a new chamber with a new monster, or another founder's relics that wasn't turned into a horcrux to be stolen, there is no real menace for a school. Like, most of the big problems can be solved outside the school. There is a werewolf or goblin rebellion? Auror Potter, vanquisher of the dark lord to the rescue! The rebellion is destroyed even before affects Hogwarts

**** You have to go back to HP's roots: Enid Blyton. There's no need for the school to be threatened. Lily Luna can face all kinds of personal danger herself. How you deliver the story will be more important than the stakes.

***** Sincerely, I didn't even consider this. I think I'm `` stuck ´´ on the necessity of a villain to make the story progress. Like, in most of stories I write I always put some type of great evil or dark lord. Maybe stories with different types of threats are the right way. Not every story must be about saving the world, I just need to understand this.

****** I was thinking more of local, relatively petty villains. Enid Blyton was a master at writing those. Scale down, you don't have to and should not be always dealing with end-of-the-world scenarios. That's comicbook-tier nonsense.

******* yes, I'm stuck with villains who want to take over the world or who are big evil threats. I don't have many ideas on how to deal with a smaller-scale evil. but all the great evils I do are clichés and have been seen before. maybe i like the comicbook-tier nonsense, but i will try to do the lesser evil, it suits better for this story.

** Do you want your antogonist to be clearly the bad guys, or do you prefer it when the story is more nuanced?

If it's the former:

- Capitalism. The villain have a plan to get money (as an example, some thiefs trying to steal Gryffindor sword), but Lily Luna gets in the way.
- Alternatively, a magical corporation (or just a secret club of rich people) are angry because, unlike her predecessor (sorry Kingsley), Minister Granger cannot be bought. They create a plot in order to "remove" her from her position, but Lily somehows discover the whole conspiracy and tries to save her aunt.
- Revenge: Hello, my name is [Insert_Death_Eater_Name]. Your father put mine in jail, prepare to die.

If it's the latter:

- Muggleborn. After 2 blood wars in 40 years, and despite the Ministry best efforts, some Bigot still run free. Free to raise a new generation of monster to hunt them. These time, the Muggleborn will not stay still, and take their destiny in their own hand.\\
  (Basically a bunch of Muggleborn that decide to murder the surviving Death Eaters, and Harry is forced to try to stop them because it's technically murder).

*** These are great suggestions, I'm going to use the first ones because I think it's better for the more contained aspect of this story.

*** The last is not nuanced at all, It would be nuanced if they were in the wrong but since they are just defending themselves there is hardly nuance there. It would be nuanced if they went after an ex-DE that truly changed his way and shorta redeemed himself or someone that did terrible things under the imperious. They are correct by looking for Justice but is it truly Justice?

I also rolled my eyes when you called a robbery "capitalism". xD
