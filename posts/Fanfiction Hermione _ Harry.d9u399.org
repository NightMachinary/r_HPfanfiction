Hi, I know there are a lot of fanfics with this couple, but usually Harry narrates. So now I would like to read some where Hermione is the one who narrates and who focuses a little more on romance.

​

Thank you.

  The ‘true' version of Books 5, 6, and 7, as told by Hermione to her daughter years later, using her old journals and letters between her and Harry.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has perspective mostly on Hermione but switching between the two. I really liked how you can often notice the impact of Hermione's little psychology experiment on her thinking when it's her perspective. The romance doesn't get going until about halfway in though.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
