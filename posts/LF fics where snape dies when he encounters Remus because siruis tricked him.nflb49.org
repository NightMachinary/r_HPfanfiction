I don't know but I think that Lily wouldn't have forgiven any of the marauders if his best friend were to be killed so it would be a big chance.


** Could also be interesting if Dumbledore successfully covered it up still and Lily didn't find out what happened for years afterward. Imagine if James and Lily still got married and had Harry, but never went into hiding because Snape wasn't there to share the prophecy. Then somehow Lily finds out about what happened. Would be a very interesting read. :)

** Well, to be fair the only Marauder who was guilty of anything in this was Sirius: apparently James and Peter didn't know about anything, and when James learned about the situation he did his utmost to save Snape (if only to save Lupin, that's immaterial).

Otherwise, I can recommend “What If Snape Died” by witowsmp linkffn(2968636).

  What could've happened if James Potter had been unable to save Snape's life? This story follows what Harry's life could have been.

** This is technically Snarry, but Snape is a ghost so there's not really any romance.
