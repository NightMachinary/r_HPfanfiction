I'm looking for a Harry/Daphne fic where Harry saves Astoria from Death Eaters (and maybe kill them) as they try to invade and kill everyone in Greengrass Manor in which he went for Christmas (if my memory doesn't fool me). I think Daphne's grandmother was hurt or possibly killed and part of the Order (mainly Dumbledore I think) wasn't too happy with the means used by Harry.

Thanks


** I believe that would be "The Legacy Preservation Act" By James Spookie linkffn(10649604)

*** Didn't it have a really random and quick ending cuz the author gave up?

**** I have no idea if it's because the author gave up or not but it does end kind of suddenly and in a convenient fashion. I will say that the premise of the fic is that the ministry passes a law that forces people to marry and have kids, and that's handled a lot better than I expected, so convenient and rushed ending, it's not a bad fic.
