A marriage law is passed and no one is pleased by who they are forced to marry. They end up protesting against the new law; not wanting to let the ministry tell them who they should or shouldn't marry.

Showing characters band together to protest the marriage law, maybe denying the law and going with someone else that they like instead of the person that the Ministry recommended to them.

Maybe even showing characters that you wouldn't expect to see; maybe Draco is being forced to marry Pansy and he doesn't like that. Or whatever. And old Gryffindors, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws just band together.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Marriage Law Revolution (already linked) fits closest to what you want.

Escape is also pretty close, but it is more individuals than a group. linkffn(11916243)

By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

** Far less bloody than the "Marriage Law Revolution", but also quite satisfying is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450), in which Harry organized a mass exodus and left Magical Britain to rot.

  After the war, the Wizengamot passes a law requiring all young wizards and witches to marry, and the Ministry will assign the partners. How do Harry and his friends react? H/G, but not overly so

** Some Hermione/Malfoy fics (I read Lucius, but I'm sure there are some with Draco too) have this trope in a way - I don't think I read any with a global uprising from the population, school houses banding together - but there are a few with Hermione working to change the law and make things right.
