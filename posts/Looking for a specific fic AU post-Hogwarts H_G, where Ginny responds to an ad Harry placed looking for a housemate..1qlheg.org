I can't remember the name or author, and Google has let me down. It's been driving me nuts.

In the fic, Harry never met Ginny. After the war, he has a job with the ICW, and he stays in an apartment in London. He decides to advertise for a housemate, and Ginny answers. At first, neither knows that the other is magical.

Does this ring a bell with anyone?

EDIT: Thanks to Ralion, the fic has been identified as /Easier to Be/ by hgfan1111. All of her stories, sadly, have been taken down, but armed with Google and the proper names, I have located most of them. If anyone's interested in one of them, PM me your email address.


** I know the one, it's called Easier to Be by /I think/ hgfan1111.

Although when I searched for it I couldn't find it anywhere! Seems like the author took it down :(
