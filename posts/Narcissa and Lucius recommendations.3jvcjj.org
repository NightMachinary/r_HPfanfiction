** i wrote a canon one-shot recently, if you're interested! it's meant to be an snap shot of their wedding night. the summary is just an excerpt:

She wanted to leave. She wondered how far she would make it if she started to run, naked and tired as she was, if she simply jumped out of bed and began to run. She wondered if Lucius would follow her. She wondered where the fuck she would go, anyway.

"Oh god," she said aloud without meaning to.

"There's no need to sound so defeated."
