I believe Dumbledore made the right decision keeping the stone and laying out the trap for Voldemort. All the other defenses laid out be the teachers were simply window dressing for the final task which is getting past the mirror which would have been impossible for Voldemort. It was thief proof. If not for Harry bungling up shit , Voldemort could have been caught in their first year


** Except its fairly apparent that Dumbledore intended for Harry to face Voldemort.

  “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You /did/ do the thing properly, didn't you?"

  “And the Invisibility Cloak --- do you know who sent it to me?”

  “Ah --- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. “Useful things . . ."

  "We met him in the entrance hall --- he already knew --- he just said, ‘Harry's gone after him,hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.”

  “D'you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?“

  /"Well,/” Hermione exploded, “if he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.”

  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .”

The most generous explanation is that Dumbledore planned on being there to ensure that Harry was safe the entire time, but that he hoped he could fulfill the prophecy and end Voldemort once and for all when Harry was still young, remove him from the Dursleys as the blood wards would no longer be needed, and give him plenty of time to have a happy childhood.

*** And don't forget the two elements that Dumbledore planned for that weren't used:

1. Hagrid gave Harry a flute for Christmas, which would have gotten them past Fluffy.
2. Devil's Snare, to give Neville something to be best at. (Flying for Harry, chess for Ron, logic for Hermione... plus a troll, which they'd already defeated once.)

** I remember one fanfic where it's mentioned that Dumbledore let Harry think he was successful in defending the stone from Voldemort, but as it turns out, the whole thing was a trap for Voldemort that Harry accidentally foiled by getting involved.

** I would argue that if an eleven year could fuck up a plan meant to capture a dark lord then that plan was shitty to begin with. What would happen Voldemort took an easy hostage from school full of children as insurance? Or million other things he could had done without Dumbledore noticing.

** Sure use a school to trap the dark lord where a war torn nation is just starting to recover from the losses of the first war.

Honestly the entire plot of book one is huge abuse of power from the teachers, blame it on the kid that was nearly killed by the person atleast twice before that year

** So I completely understand where you're coming from with this and there's a lot of background evidence that if that was the plan than it would have worked. A layer of traps that regardless of the trio making their way through are all either deadly or at least dangerous. With the crucial point that all of the traps had quasi obvious solutions that someone as arrogant as Voldemort could have reasonably chalked up to his own superiority. Finally the mirror seemed almost perfectly designed to capture someone who was so violently afraid of death /and/ so convinced of his own intelligence. I can absolutely picture Voldemort wasting away there, enamored with the vision of his own final victory and immortality.

I'll even go as far as to say there was probably a point i'd have completely agreed with you as well, much in the same way I used to think if Shinji (Evangelion in case that's not obvious) should have manned the fuck up and fought some alien monsters. The problem with that is that there never should have been a trap (if that was the plan) or test for Harry in the first place. The fact that a benevolent and kind teacher/leader essentially drew a psychotic madman into a school full of children on purpose is horrifying.

We're all aware that JK didn't actually have most of her world building worked out until she actually wrote each book. That doesn't mean that you can't apply things she made up later to show how horrific the early books are from a (Reasonale) adults perspective. Voldemort was active in a school for basically an entire year, diminished yes but with a follower in full control of his abilities. What if he'd put a bunch of children under the imperious and sent them on a killing spree on that final night to cover his tracks? Just one or two from each house with orders to sneak a knife out of the great hall and slit some throats. He goes about his business under the assumption he's gonna get the stone and leave with the hope that all the dead kids means everyone's too busy to listen if Dumbledore reveals him.

We know from alter that people under the imperius can be made to act like everything's normal, we also know that there are no "Wards" or whatever that detect their usage in Hogwarts. I don't disagree it would have been a good trap, but Dumbledore keeping the stone in the castle at all? That should have gotten him up on charges for child endangerment at least. (Not that the wizarding world seems to have child protective laws)

** Yup, the moral lesson from the first book is that your elders should be listened to. If they just follow the order of Professor McGonagall and went to bed, Voldemort would be trapped, and remaining six books should not have to be written.

Was that meant as the moral of the story?

*** The Stone would have been safe in the mirror, sure, but I don't think Voldemort could be caught or captured at this point--he could always leave Quirrell's body and fly away in spirit form.
