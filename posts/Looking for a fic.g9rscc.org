Hi, I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago and that i want to read again. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name or its author's.

All I remember is that Harry was in his First year and he was pushed down the Moving Stairs. He was falling and the portraits could see him smile as he fell.

I think the rest of the fic was people talking about it, I don't remember anymore.

If anyone has an idea, let me know. I know it's very vague.

Thank you for your help


** linkffn(The Many Deaths Of Harry Potter) has Harry fall down the stairs, if I'm remembering correctly. Your description was incredibly vague but I hope you fine what you're looking for :p

*** Thanks for your reply. I looked at the fic and it was not this one. I know it was vague but I honestly don't remember much.

Thanks anyway, maybe the one I'm looking for was deleted.
