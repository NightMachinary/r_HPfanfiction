Haven't been able to find too many of these and hoping someone else has found one. I'm not looking for a wrong Boy-Who-Lived story.


** Well uhhh in Potters Against the World he and his sister are ummm let's say unnaturally close. The story handles it pretty well but I won't link it since I don't remember if it violates the underage rule

The Archmage of Arda on the other hand has Harry interacting with his adoptive elf family in an interesting way. He basically has two brothers who are basically siblings/nephews to him and they have great interactions linkffn(13407891)

  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

** “A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic” linkao3(22953583) is a time-travel story where Harry returns on his eleventh birthday as a twin sister of Harry and they go to Hogwarts together (except she ends up in Hufflepuff, a big brownie point for that, there is never enough non-Gryffindor/non-Slytherin stories).

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

** I'm going to go ahead and drop my own fic here. Harry does have a sibling, but he only meets her later on in the story. It also avoids the whole wrong BWL trope by a wide margin.

I hope you enjoy it!

  [Book 1 of HP & the Path of Knowledge] A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for magic. His new life eventually throws him on a journey for answers - those relating to his mysterious cursed scar, his unknown parentage, and the intricacies of magic itself. Alas, if only it was ever that easy... (AU Pre-Hogwarts)
