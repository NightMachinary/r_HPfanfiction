#+TITLE: Is there any fanfic where Riddle knows the prophecy (just the half, as in canon) but instead of attacking either the Potters or the Longbottoms, he chooses to wait and see which child is the biggest threat, thus staying alive throughout Harry's life?

Just curious, I don't necessarily mean a dystopian universe, where Voldy owns the world, but I wouldn't mind. Its obviously a big AU change, so anything goes.


** Harry suggests he should have done this in canon because it would have been smarter! :) Harry is so funny. :)

*** Wouldn't say that's funny, but yeah, i remember him saying this to Dumbledore. And that's what I meant. It would've been smarter.

***** The Smart thing to do would be to stay as far away from them as possible whilst sending various minions to take them down in both magical and no-magical ways. If you hear part of a prophecy that describes someone with the power to kill you, you don't then seek them out and go to them, even if they are currently toddlers, especially as you don't know the means by which their power of killing you could express itself, you send as many disposable minions as possible, while staying the fuck away.

** There is this awesome saga linkffn(3766574) where, well Voldie IS owning Wizarding Britain but he is high intelligent, sane, hot looking Emperor!

Sometimes I feel that all it has in common with original HP are names and Voldie-Wants-To-Conquer-World-Dumbledore-Says-No-Harry-Is-Stuck-Between-Them dynamics...

Love it for fleshed out characters and Voldie's Wizarding government which actually makes sense.
