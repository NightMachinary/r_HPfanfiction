** Writing a lot will improve your writing if you /want/ to improve. You also have to work at it. For plenty of us, writing and improving is the important part but a lot of fanfiction writers have no interest in writing well. The writing part is secondary for them and they won't improve because they don't see the need. That's fair enough; it's fanfiction after all.
