Now I love a good Harry/Daphne fic just as much as most other Harr/Daphne shippers, but that's mostly because of the dearth of Harry/Astoria fics and I love me a fic with Astoria in it. What I don't get is why the fandom chose Daphne Greengrass to be the OP OTP. Why did we select this one character out of a sea of other female Slytherins, and elevate her fanon!personality to something that appeals to almost everyone? All we really know about the canon!Daphne is that she's a Slytherin. We don't know /anything/ else about her.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, why did we choose Daphne Greengrass?


** Her name sounds cool.

That's really about it for me.

EDIT: And she's slytherin and not canonically a bitch, like Pansy.

** Well there's only 4 named slytherin girls in Harry's year.

Pansy, Bulstrode, Greengrass, and Davis.

Pansy has an established obnoxious personality, and Bulstrode isn't portrayed favorably either.

So it comes down to the pureblood Daphne or the half blood Tracey. I'm guessing most authors who want to go with a slytherin romance also want to have the pairing be with a typical slytherin pure blood

So Daphne wins by default

** This thread again, alright.

Make a list of blank slates. Commit the sin of basing plot around pairing, why because its how the FFN filtering works. Your pairing is obvious and what people search for.Now, your list, find something interesting and positive about them. Susan Bones has her aunt but you might not want the positive ministry plot.

Daphne, well she's got a nice name. If you pick and choose from Pottermore/the aftermath sizzle then we know she's a pure-blood. Tracey isn't. Millicent looks like a troll and Pansy is a bitch with a face like a pug. Pure-blood is the interesting bit. The whole sister marries Draco thing could spawn plot lines too.

What is the most popular type of fan fiction by number written? Fix-it fics. Canon but better, how would it be better, well Harry isn't a Gryffindor because they are rash and make poor decisions. But, we don't want to re-write 7 years nor do we and to remake Harry so we need to add a source of Slytherin. Real Slytherin to, cunning and such. Ladies and gentleman I give you Daphne Greengrass. Slytherin advisor extraordinaire expert in all things sneaky like occlumency or politics.

The better stories embrace that she's an unknown quantity but a house acts as easy characterisation. Its a trap but its so easy to fall into. Other than Contractual Invalidation I'm still waiting for a good Daphne story. Why do I think HP/dg could work? I don't like how clean the epilogue is. I think there'd be a shot storm that Harry would just want to hide from. Under pressure Harry becomes a moody git, he could easily go to a dark place, and I don't mean he starts cursing people. Either someone who isn't tainted by the war, fresh and full of life. A grown up Gabrielle Delacour might work or you have someone a bit cynical, a bit harsh. Someone who's outlook is similar to this Harry who has been suffering. Who fits this? Nobody really but you might think the house that likes to win at any cost is the most cynical and pragmatic. Given the stigma that might follow someone being a pure-blood ex-Slytherin they might be having an interesting time of things to.

** Alright, so as someone who was writing Harry/Daphne stories at the height of that craze, I can give some insight. And, FWIW, the height of that craze was 2007-2009. Everything since then has pretty much just been the same rehashes over and over and over, written either by people who have only just discovered it and doing their best to write more of the same. It's a vicious circle that is unlikely to be broken any time soon, or by people who literally just keep writing the same story trying to do something new. Like, you can seriously go look at the 25 newest Harry/Daphne stories and not a single one is readable.

The thing to remember is that Daphne isn't even the first of her kind. Before her, there was Blaise Zabini. The gender wasn't known until book 6, so the were a ton of fics where she was a girl, and then that still carried on for awhile after the revelation, though fem!Blaise did pretty much actually die out.

The thing with Daphne isn't that she's so much a blank slate, it's what she's used to represent, and that's to represent the exact opposite of canon, to represent missed opportunity with JKR's worldbuilding. Sure, sometimes that was to foil manipulative!dumbles, or for Harry to reclaim his wizarding heritage or whatever, but other times it's simply to simply him him a second option.

** To be fair the trope of Slytherin pureblood that Harry falls for has always been around. It just used to be Blaise Zabini before JKR revealed that Blaise was a boy in HBP.

I miss Harry/Blaise. Now it's all Harry/Daphne!IcePrincess dumbness, Blaise at least wasn't bogged down by that fanon characterization.

**** I dunno, it's a rather androgynous sounding name, and a name that's not exactly widespread or common. So while it might be a male name, some people decided that it was a cool sounding female name and went with it. So fanon characterized her as a female before HBP came out. Remember, all we knew about Blaise before HBP was that it was a student that existed. We only heard the name in Philosopher's Stone during the Sorting Ceremony, and it didn't come up again until HBP.

** Because people want to pair harry with a pureblood slytherin girl and for some reason people prefer oc stand ins instead of actual ocs. And of the four slytherin girls we know Tracey and Millicent are half-bloods, so the only pureblood slytherin girls you can ship harry with are pansy(who is supposed to be the classical mean girl) and daphne, and we only know about her that her parents are blood purist, that she is friends with pansy, that she didn't do anything that caught harrys attention and that she becomes dracos sister in law.

*** At the height of Daphne's popularity, literally nothing was known about her other than her sister married Draco. That list that JKR showed once in 2000 that listed students, their houses, and their blood status is not canon and has never been, considering it was written before the first book was even published. So saying Tracey and Millicent are half-blood means nothing at all, since one of those girls doesn't even appear in the books, and the blood purity of the other is never mentioned.

**** if you acknowledge the existence of tracey(I dont say you have to, but fandom generally treats her as a canon character), then you also have to acknowledge that she and millicent are halfbloods. Because the only source that mentions tracey also mentions their blood status.

*** But there are so many goddamn blank slates. Why isn't it spread across all the practically!OC characters? Where are all the Astorie Greengrass, Tracy Davis, Pansy Parkinson, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, Sally-Anne Perks, Fay Dunbar, Megan Jones, Lisa Turpin, Mandy Brocklehurst, etc. fics?

I really doubt it's /only/ because of the blank slate thing. Probably plays a role, but I think it's something else. Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for what "it" may be.

**** Pureblood, Slytherin, not shown to be a jerk, and in Harry's year. Also, her sister married Draco, so that gives an opportunity for interactions between +Tom Felton+ Draco and Harry.

I think the one time she's referenced in canon is that she's taking the Ancient Runes OWL, which obviously means that she's very very smart.

Incomplete blank slates like the ones that you mention often have at least a bit to go on. Susan Bones's Aunt Amelia is head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, for example. Susan is a Hufflepuff, etc. With characters like these, there's a bit to go off when writing and it seems a bit more mature (for fanfic writing) than just creating an OC that may just be a poorly written and blatantly obvious self-insert. Why create a new character and try to shoehorn them in when there's moldable clay waiting to be fashioned into a more important character? It's fanfiction, not creating an entirely new story out of thin air.

** Honestly, because she isn't the big three ships. I fucking hate Hinny, I loathe with a passion Harmony, and I don't care for Huna or Lunar (insert Pairing name here) mainly due to no one being able to get Luna's character right.

That leaves me with characters for pairings such as Pansy, who is fun, to watch the bitch evolve; Susan, who I could actually see with Harry if she is like her aunt at all; Hannah, who is blank slate; Cho, which has potential if you modify her character; and Daphne. A named Slytherin who is a blank slate.

** Her name sounds cool, and the first Harry/Daphne stories set down many plotlines and characterizations that authors use to this day. Furthermore, she's completely OC. A blank slate for authors to do whatever the fuck they want with.

The main craze was from around 2006 to 2010. Very few Harry/Daphne stories since then have introduced anything new or innovative to the table.
