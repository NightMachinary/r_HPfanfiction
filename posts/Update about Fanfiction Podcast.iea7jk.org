Hey guys!

I made a post last month about starting a podcast focused on narrating fanfics and discussing fun, fanficy topics. I just released the trailer! Yay. It's called "Basically Canon," and the trailer is currently available on Spotify, waiting on the approval on Apple Podcasts and more!

Thank you EVERYONE who submitted their suggestions for what I should be reading. I made the most extensive lists, and I can't wait to make my way through them. The first fanfic we will be reading is *"Away Childish Things"* by /lettered/! I'm so excited. She gave me permission and was super kind about it and I hope to do her work justice!

I'd love it if you'd subscribe to the podcast and follow the instagram, which has truly nothing on it today, but /will/ be the hub we can all talk about the episodes! I'll update this post when the pod is available everything, and I should have first episode out next week! Please continue to suggest anything you want, regardless of fandom.

Thank you, friends!

Grace
