By fanon aspect, I mean things that were never confirmed in canon, like Daphne Greengrass's appearance and the first name of Hermione's parents. (Or have those been confirmed since the last time I checked wiki?)

**** Cassiopeia Black, I don't think she is ever mentioned in Canon, but she appears in the "Black Family Tree".

According to the tree, she would be the sister of Polux Black (father of Walburga), Dorea Black/ Potter (fanon grandmother of Harry before Rowling introduced Fleamont and Euphemia) and Marius (removed from the tree for being a Squib).

She is not often used in fanfics (mainly in story that focus on the Blacks), but I'll admit that I like seing her as this old chill lady that is just so done with her family. I remember a story where she was a Metamorphmagus that decided she didn't want to have anything to do with the first Blood War and so faked her death and went to play the Cougar on the French Riviera.

****** Maybe it's the symbolic rejection of the power? I personally like the characterization that ALL of the Hallows are traps for the bearer (either Death or the brothers were assholes, the whole "cross a bridge" seems too easy for it not to be a metaphor), and the "Master of Death" is just the person who understood the lesson from each object.

1) The Elder Wand was created for endless conflict. Accepting the wand means accepting fights until you finally die, and the wand starts fresh with the new bearer. No matter the initial goal with the wand - personal power, revenge, justice, etc. - it lures the user into combat. After all, wands have particular specialties, and the Elder Wand's is causing death. Why wouldn't you play to your strengths?

2) The Resurrection Stone is the suicide stone. The ability to call up the beloved deceased is a major temptation, and eventually the shade hints that being called up is painful. The user eventually is pulled to deciding that joining them is the better option for all involved, since they aren't really living right now anyways. Ignoring the curse means either not using the stone, or making it difficult to use in some way.

3) The Cloak isn't as immediately lethal as the other two, because the youngest brother was feeling clever and Death decided to indulge him. The Cloak does exactly as ordered - wearing it means Death will not find you (Death still sees you, but they're eternal, waiting isn't a huge hardship). Ignotus' bane was wearing the Cloak ALL THE TIME. He organized his entire life around never taking it off. He realized his folly when he told his son how similar they look, and received a blank look. He set his affairs in order, warned his son to only use it for insignificant reasons, and took off the cloak and died.

****** I think a little part of me would die if JKR wrote about the other characters and made Daphne Greengrass a Death Eater, though to be honest she probably was a supporter. The brief description of Astoria on [[https://wizardingworld.com][wizardingworld.com]] indicates that she shared a similar mentality about blood purity as Draco, but became disillusioned with it due to the war and stopped believing in it. My guess is that Daphne was similar or worse.

However, we don't know this for a fact, so keeping JKR away keeps fanon Daphne alive and my heart intact.

*** Ikr, the Slytherins could have been given so much more character depth, here's my theories that canon hints at:

Millicent is actually a big softie, but only for people who her cat likes. Side note: I hate it when people portray Millicent as stupid just because JKR said she's ugly. Or maybe she is ‘stupid' but maybe she's kind and thoughtful. Exam marks and looks don't define a personality!

Crabbe or Goyle have dyslexia and that's why they do so badly in lessons (see the improv: “I didn't know you could read!”)

Theo Nott's dad killed his mum and he saw it happen (he can see Thestrals)

Blaise's Boggart is a beautiful woman in a wedding dress and veil (her mum killed /seven/ stepdads?! he must be so paranoid)

Pansy Parkinson's family is disgraced somehow/losing money and her only chance at a good respectable life is marrying Draco Malfoy, hence all her sucking up.

******* As seen in HBP (with his scene on the Hogwarts Express), Blaise Zabini is a man. But before this book, Blaise was only mentioned once by name, as the last person being Sorted in PS (which put him in a similar situation to Daphne Greengrass).

I guess Blaise is a mixed name, because a lot of people from that time decided that Blaise was a girl, and as the only "non confirmed awful Slytherin in Canon", she was regularly put as Harry love interest. I don't think a lot of fanfics still make her a girl, but I'm pretty sure you could find some relatively recent ones like this.

** Like...all of them?

Whenever I'm reading an established fanon tidbit and realise, I get all emotional. The fact that so much of the richness of the world was built more or less randomly by a massive fanbase is absolutely wonderful for me, more so if I remember when the particular aspect wasn't established yet. Ah, all the years! ...now you've made me cry internally.

***** True, but still, it was a semi-dark spell, it really kind of bothers me how easily it's fixed, not even leaving scars for that matter.

All through the book, dark spells are treated as something horrifying, but then when we see one used, it is... strangely disappointing how easy it is to remove the mark.

** Chill, hippie Andromeda and clever, unfortunate Narcissa. Actually, I like multiple shades of fanon Narcissa. Narcissas that are manipulative and the true power behind the throne. Narcissas that betray Voldemort actively. Narcissas that turn on their husband. Narcissas that fake defection only to lead the heroes into a trap.

She really wasn't given much room to shine in canon imo.

Also, especially since JKR revealed her backwards views I really /revel/ in stories that play with characters' genders, sexualities and origins - even more so than I would have done before I knew her views. I'm very much a 'one big sandbox' kind of reader where few things from any one universe make it into my permanent headcanon - each AU is a different offshoot that I enjoy (or not) for different reasons.

** I only saw this in a fic once and I don't think its widely accepted but I love this headcanon.

Fenrir Greyback can become a werewolf on command because he has figured out how to also be a animagus and that form like his patronus is by default also a werewolf. He has more control over his actions because of this and that's why he's able to single out who he wants to fuck over so easily. But he still chooses to only turn during the full moon so its less ovbious how much control he has .
