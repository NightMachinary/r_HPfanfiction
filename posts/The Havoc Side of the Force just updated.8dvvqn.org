** man, the quality of the later chapters is all over the place. Definitely taking a turn for the worse, and theres already been some pretty bad chapters.

*** Yeah my interest has taken a complete nosedive. Harry just doesn't stop the preachy attitude, and him getting one over everyone just because of magic each and every time gets boring real fast.

** Just finished reading this updates.\\
Didn't like scene on Mandalore. I'm tempted to say it was too unrealistic, even for this kind of story. And ending slavery speech seemed way to idealistic and childish(?).\\
Feylis freak-out about Harry ability to make contracts was nice.\\
Harrys freak-out about him not being a victim is also nice touch, lets us see into him little bit more.\\
Don't know what to feel about Harry being very open about his past and his more outlandish abilities when talking to Sinube. It didn't felt like they were at "disclosing substantial secrets" stage of their relationship.\\
Totally forgot that Bellatrix was also there.\\
Anakins visions felt like author was trying too hard in foreshadowing.\\
Weird Sith turning enzymes are strange, lets hope it will be relevant and not totally stupid in the future.

And i don't know if it is continuity error or i just missed something but Harry goal of "eliminating slavery" was spur-of-the-moment thing he came up to pacify mandalorian warriors, right? And yet Kenobi claimed that it was already a thing while in transit to Mandalore?

*** I feel the opening up part thing is because he's tired, but he knows he needs to start making allies. Making that much money means you need to start playing on another level.

For the mandalore thing, yeah, the sudden putting slavery on the chopping block was a little random, but only in the sense that it was an instant solution to the problem. We already have been told in this story that Harry hates slavery from what he did to Ardulla. That needed more build up, as the conclusion for what he needed to do happened during the trip over to mandalore when he was talking to Obi-Wan(an unmentioned glossed over info dump montage). That needed to be gone over but would have made the chapter be pushed to a 15k word count I'm sure, and I don't think the author wanted it to be that long(I would have been okay with it).

If he had played it out fully, it would have been another Godric's hollow coup, which I honestly enjoyed.

I do like the world building that's going on, and I'm interested in how the mandalore thing will look when fully fleshed out into the plot.

The Anakin thing was a little much in the forebodance section, if the author is going to go for a more 'this is what would have happened but Harry changed the timeline, I feel it belongs in the companion fic, and discussed by the older jedi, just not Anakin.

I enjoyed it overall, with the loss of his grandpa(who it sounded like helped him with this fic to some degree), I feel like it's natural for him to avoid writing if it made him think about the loss. I'm glad he's back and I hope he gets the joy he got from writing this fic back into his life. Personal projects mean a lot to people and alot of people enjoy his writing.

**** Hey, Epwydadlan1, just a quick heads-up:\\
*alot* is actually spelled *a lot*. You can remember it by *it is one lot, 'a lot'*.\\
Have a nice day!
