#+TITLE: I've read the stuff where the Knight Bus copied Sirius's motorbike's spells and enchantments, but what if the group that created the Knight Bus was owned by Sirius, and his motorbike was the prototype that allowed the group to create the bus?

*** Because fanfiction. Just because it's canon doesn't mean that you have to follow it. You can just create a new timeline for the Knight Bus, which can fit the prompt.

*** Maybe I should've replaced Sirius with just the Black family in general, haha.

But yeah, I read some pretty odd independent!Harry fics where Sirius got to sue the Knight Bus for copying certain spells... I don't remember which, this wasn't a request or a what's that fic thread.
