Yup, see title. It is a prompt.

In particular, how would our characters discover that someone is going around turning people into werewolves with this method? Would Umbridge suddenly discover herself changing at the full moon despite not having a single mark? What kind of paranoia could take seed with seemingly random people suddenly being werewolves? Might the protagonists waste time investigating ancient myths of the origin of lycanthropy? What kind of motive could someone possibly have for spreading lycanthropy and widespread chaos?


** If the wizards where technologically adept would they be able to trace who/where that blood came from? Or is that scientifically impossible?

*** Eh, don't let 'scientifically impossible' get in the way of writing a good story. Self-consistency is more important than realistic physics.

But if it were up to me, given how famous a trope sympathetic magic is, I'd say, yes, they could track the source of the blood if they thought to take a blood sample.

***** Sympathetic magic is magic based on similarities: for example, IRL some parts of Voodoo are sympathetic magic (think creating a puppet in the image of someone then harming/cursing it).\\
As far as I know this kind of magic doesn't exists in canon HP, except maybe implied in potions and herbology.

****** Well, it does show up in a way in the Polyjuice Potion; in order to transform into someone, you need a bit from them like a lock of hair or a toenail or such.

And it shows up again in the ritual to resurrect Voldemort; to immunize himself against Harry's protection (which disintegrated him twice already), he had to use some of Harry's blood, instead of, say, inventing an anti-love spell.

It shows up in Dungeons & Dragons too, casting certain long-ranged spells like Nightmare or Scrying calls for you to have an accurate depiction of your target, or a bit of blood/hair/etc from them, or both.

...In a nutshell? It's the idea that, magically, you can do stuff to a thing or a person, if you have a material component that is related to that thing/person. Once together, always together, just look at the Reparo spell.

** Make sure the blood donor is O- amiright. IDK if the werewolf disease would be stopped, probably not, but still. They might die from the reaction to the foreign blood. Also, what causes the change? Scratches don't change people iirc, and biting doesn't usually transfer blood. Maybe this wouldn't work because the disease is stored like venom in sacks behind the teeth? If its saliva or something, why doesn't greyback ever spit on his paws to help transfer?

Who says he doesn't?

Apparently, according to Pottermore, the disease spreads via saliva-to-blood contact, no venom involved. It's just a bit of imagination on my part to assume it can spread via blood-to-blood contact as well.

**** I was saying that cuz Lupin says that he tries to bite other people, but yeah I guess he could do that. Also I didn't think about looking on Pottermore for how its tranferred lol. The point about dying because of foreign blood still stands tho
