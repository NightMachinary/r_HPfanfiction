I never read something like this. I don't know why but I don't like Lily. But I love James. I want to read about James with someone else then Lily. This could be character OC but also regular. But NOT Lily... Story where Lily end up with Sirius or Remus? No, thank you!

Any help? :)


** Good luck, in my experience James/Lily seems to be the one pairing writers won't mess with unless its in a cheating/neglect fic where James is a bastard.

** Not to flame or anything but can you tell me why you don't like her?

As a Snape fan I'm pretty take her or leave her (And personally I feel like that reveal ruined his charactrlerization) but I want to hear other folks thoughts about her. She's kind of not talked about at all outside of. ...oh everyone loved her

*** She doesn't do anything in the series except die. In the books it just says she's good at potions and charms. James dies, but his life in foot notes dictates a lot of Harry's life. He was an animagus and taught Peter the skill. His compassion towards Remus ended up.giving Harry a very invested teacher. His fights with Snape gave us a villain in the first books. His denying of the pureblood ideology gave us a martyr when he died. He gave us the Peverell connection and the invisibility. His acceptance of Sirius gave Harry a devoted godfather. While Lily gets fandom love for dying and Snapes love/obsession, James set up a lot for Harry but gets very little love in comparison to Lily. Lily is the popular girl in school that nobody actually knows

**** I think, thats a suitable place for one theory on why "love defence" is so rare.

It requires "victim" to die without fighting back /at all/. Can you imagine a mother that wouldnt do *everything*, from clawing at the eyes to throwing furniture, to defend their child? Even animals would do something similar(I saw a cat attacking a BIG dog just to try to defend her kittens. She had no chance to win a straight fight, but dog was really afraid of this claws-and-fur ball)

Well, Lily is one such mother.

***** I think part of the point was that James (talented, rich, pureblood, only child of elderly parents) had every opportunity to either join Voldie or immigrate to another country. Lily wasn't rich or pureblood and there was no way Petunia was going to agree to leave the UK. Lily was also a direct victim of Voldie's ideology and so was standing up for herself. James was standing up for other people when he had a comfortable other option.

Both Lily and James died protecting their child, and James didn't put up much of a fight.

As a side note, there are stories where Lily bashing happens but not James, though they're both still married.

**** JK built up James and his friends' characters more than she did Lily. All we know about her outside of James and his friends is through Petunia and Snape. So Lily doesn't feel like a real person. We don't know who her friends were in Hogwarts. She's just a plot device (mother's love-protection-blood wards). Anyway, a lot of people and stuff in HP is there for plot device but no well thought out background story.

Agreed. I know it may not.be a popular opinion but I'll day it. There really isn't much in the way of world building done by JK. Sure a.fun story that leaves it open to creative fans but the books themselves don't do much. She also uses Lily's sacrifice as a catch all plot armor. Need to save the day but don't want to create a new solution 'mothers love'. That and the wand. Fun story and good for growing up on but looking back at it objectively; the books aren't great literature and I don't think they were ever going to be. But the foundation for fanfiction to be created is there, so cheers.

**** I have to point out that Remus isn't a very invested teacher. He has almost no presence in any book bar POA and even then for someone who was apparently best friends with his father makes no effort to actually get to know Jarry and be a part of his life. Hell, in book 5 Harry still calls him Professor Lupin!

***** I think your issue is that Remus was not a great father/uncle/mentor figure in Harry's life. His role as teacher is not a reflection of his influence or say in Harry's life. I agree with you on that, as a teacher at Hogwarts he was exceptional. He connected with students and helped even Neville improve. Different issues but I agree with your evaluation of Remus in Harry's life.
