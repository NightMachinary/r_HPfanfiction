:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was telling a friend about a scene from a fic, and now they want to read it. Problem? I can't find it.I know I've read it within the last year. A very brief summary: Dumbles puts a binding on Harry and Neville's magic, I think there's Hogwarts Heirs involved, and McGonagall ends up kicking Dumbles' arse in front of the Wizengamot, in a sort of honor duel.

I can't recall if it was on FFN or Ao3, and I can't find it in my history on either site. But I know I'm not making it up! Does anyone recognize it?

It is not:\\
Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny\\
Harry Potter and the Four Heirs\\
Harry Potter and the Old Friend\\
Angry Harry and the Seven\\
The Stubborn Old Headmaster\\
It All Started With a Visit to Gringotts (at least, I don't think it is. I'm 90% sure the fic happens during Hogwarts years, not after.)

A longer summary - TW: Miscarriage

McG was married, and pregnant when her spouse died. Dumbles gets tired of her moping, especially when she says she's going to quit teaching and withdraw from the Order to care for her child.

Dumbles pushes her down the stairs, causing her to lose the baby. He buries that knowledge.

It was originally going to be Augusta challenging Dumbles to a duel, but McG challenges her right as a more injured party. McG summons a celtic spirit, though I can't remember who (I believe she was depicted as a crone), and dedicated the fight to her. Dumbles summons the spirit of Justice on his side, or maybe it's Lady Magic. And they duel. It's a brilliant display of transfiguration in combat. McG wins and the spirit reinstates her pregnancy?


** It's from a trilogy - Second Chances linkffn(8769990), Harry Potter and the Congregation of the Asp, and Harry Potter and the Horcrux Three. It's near the end of the second one or the beginning of the third, I think the third.
