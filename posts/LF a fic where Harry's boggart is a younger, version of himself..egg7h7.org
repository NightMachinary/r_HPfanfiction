Hey

So as the title indicates I'm looking for a fic that had a scene where the students face off against their boggarts. Only when it was Harry's turn he saw himself when he was still young and vulnerable to the Dursley's abuse (meaning he fears his own weakness the most). I believe he then proceeded to harm the boggart.

Thanks in advance.


** sidenote: I think this fits under "What's that fic?"

** Oh, I've seen one of these somewhere. I can't for the life of me recall the name, but it had Harry having a vaguely antagonistic relationship with Remus for the man's apparent distaste for Slytherins and the Boggart thing was requested to be done in private for that house (for the obvious Machiavellian reasoning), to which Remus complained as every other house had been willing to do it in public.

As I said, no idea what the fic was called, but I'm tired and tipsy at the moment (It's midnight here) so I'll do my utmost to find the fic upon the morrow.

  It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and just like the last two, it promises to be anything but restful. House tensions are high, Harry's twin Jules, the darling of Gryffindor, doesn't like Harry any better than before, and on top of all that there's an escaped murderer on the loose who's apparently hell-bent on taking his revenge on both Potter twins.

** Most stories don't show it just to make it tack on with book cannon. They make the class dismiss and have harry come back alone. I can only think of a rare 2-3 times out of 1,600 fan fictions I read in the last 2 years that actully showed him looking at the bogart in class, in front of the whole class of students, and the form turning into something from his childhood like a younger self. I remember one very vaguely where its him as a little kid and the room goes quiet and hes sniffling in a dark corner of his cupboard and no one can tell what his form is and even remus is stunned. After a bit you see him looking out the grate of the wall door and then vernon comes in drunk and pulls him out and you see the horror of vernon yelling at him before taking in physical abuse. I believe it ended with harry getting a leg broken and vernon branded him with a hot iron while his aunt smashed a glass cup on his back and dudley kicked the broken leg before anyone moved or said anything or remus interfered. I'm pretty sure it broke the shit out of harry too seeing it in class. That's all I remember from it and I have no idea what fic it was.
