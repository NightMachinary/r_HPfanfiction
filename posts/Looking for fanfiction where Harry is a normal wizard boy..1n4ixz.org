** Why have it be about Harry then, it seems you want a story about a random wizard boy. Why not read a next gen story? They are normally devoid of larger picture drama. So much of what Harry is is because of his parents death and how he was raised, he would definitely be an entirely different person if Voldemort didn't "mark" him.

** That sounds a little boring, honestly. I've only seen a few 'marriage contract' and post-war disc that might fit that, but they still referenced the war
