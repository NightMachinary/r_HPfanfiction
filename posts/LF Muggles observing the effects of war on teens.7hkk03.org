I'm looking for fics about Muggles who either observe from a distance or get to know a character who was in/majorly affected by the war. I'm specifically interested in any fics that make observations about how the character's personality was affected. War and loss can have drastic effects on even adults but it would be interesting to see observations about these effects from people who don't know the context, Harry and many of the other characters were far too young to have ever seen action within muggle military and muggles would have no knowledge of the wizarding war. For example, what would a random muggle in a coffee shop wonder if they glimpsed Hermione's 'Mudblood' scar? What if a muggle became friends with George and wondered why he looked sad when he caught his reflection? Basically, I'm looking for a fic about somebody's thoughts and perspective regarding any character from somebody who doesn't know their background. I'm really open to pretty much any HP character, any relationship type, and any original characters.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
