So there are many magical creatures fic. But I rarely see one where the Weasley's are creatures. So my question is what creatures could you see the Weasley's as?


** I've had this plot bunny for a while where Ron is a merman that accidentally gets caught in a net by muggle Harry and Hermione.

I got inspired by this fanart I saw of all the Weasley siblings as merpeople I frustratingly can't find anymore

** I enjoy it much more, when the creatures are from traditional folklore.

In that vein, I would propose the Bucca (Cornish) also known as a knacker. These are fairy creatures from Cornish folklore (In this case, Cornish applies to Devon as well). The Bucca where thought to inhabit mines and depending on the story, hammer on the walls to cause the mineshafts to cave in or to warn the miners that a cave-in was imminent.

Like the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, the knackers are capable of great malice and great help but most of the time they like their practical jokes.

They are also thought to be the spirits of dead miners.

Anyway, I just think it neatly carries the Weasley Family theme, especially given their ghoul likes hammering on things.
