It was probably a Harry/Draco fic, where Harry brought him as a guest to the Burrow for Xmas. What I really remember is that he was given a Weasley sweater, and was /super-impressed/ with it, because he was aware of the amount of effort and magic that went into it.

Does anyone remember this? It's a Christmas fic, so I'm in the mood to re-read it.

**** I couldn't tell you off the bat but I'm almost positive it is near the end after Harry comes back from being in the alternate universe when they're together for real I think? Or maybe it's during the alternate timeline ? Sorry!!
