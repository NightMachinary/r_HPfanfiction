** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is best served Raw: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]

Despite being REALLY tropey, it is written in a really well and imaginative way that makes it much better than most other fanfiction. I might go as far as to say this is my favorite fanfiction. ever.

Tropes:

Peggy Sue

Most Ancient and Noble Houses( With all the added tropes.)

Wrong boy who lived

Obligatory Harem trope

Magical Cores

Manipulative "Greater Good" Dumbledore

Seer Luna

Uber rich Harry

(these are the tropes i remember there is probably more.)

*** My one problem with this fic is that it combines the mental time travel trope with the harem trope.

** /For science huh/? As a scientist, I must ask what your methodology is.

Are you looking for the number of different tropes overall (i.e. quantity)? Or are you looking for the magnitude of singular tropes in a fic (i.e. OP character, angst, etc.)?

How do you distinguish between tropes appearing? Where do you draw the line between, say, a time-travel story and a reincarnation story? Are you counting HP specific tropes, fanfiction specific tropes, or fiction/literature specific tropes here?

What about different iterations of tropes? Do you count subverted, inverted, averted tropes (and so on?)? When is a trope not a trope?

Frankly, the lack of clarity is disingenuous here. For shame.

YES, this is tongue-in-cheek. Don't take it seriously. Try something like Prince of Slytherin, Den of Snakes, or Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. Tropes and Slytherin stories seem to go hand-in-hand in the fandom.

** Prince of Slytherin. It nailed every single terrible WBWL and indy!Harry trope on the head in the first few chapters. I can only imagine it eused each a dozen times in its incomprehensibly unncessary wordcount.
