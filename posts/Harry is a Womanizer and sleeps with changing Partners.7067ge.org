Are there Fics that have Harry being charming to Females and sleeping with them, but also changing them? No steady Partners, more just for fun so no real heartbreaks. Doesnt matter if he is in a Relationship with Ginny or she tolerates his escapades (or even supporting or getting aroused by it), but i imagine him being Single with a possible one-sided attraction of Hermione (no real H/Hr). Can happen during Hogwarts and/or after the War. Mature content would be good and as closely described as possible, maybe with a bit slice-of-life.


** now I want a fic about Harry being Radcliffe's character from Extras

** if the partners are changing how does he actually know they're different people?

Cheating on Tonks with... Tonks. Also Tonks again.

*** LOL this is an amusing idea for a fic. I've seen it done once where Tonks portrays I think 2?... of his female friends and sleeps with him without Harry being aware, but it would be more amusing if Tonks just runs the gambit of possible partners just to sleep over and over and over with Harry.

  The contest is over, and Harry has won. Now it's time for Tonks to pay up, whether he wants her to or not.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

*** yeah, ok. He doesnt have to be a Womanizer but sleep around with several Partners, but it would be nice IF he is one. The icing of the Cake would be a one-sided Attraction of Hermione for Harry (the idea for this came in mind from "The Best Man" by luckintheair04, in which Ron and Hermione are marrying, but Harry leaves the celebration. At some Point, she divorces and visits Harry to ask for a place to stay. Unknowingly of her Harry has started a Session with his secretary, but she confess she is ok with it, so she waits until he is finished. I have to admit, that since its a H/Hr Fic, it has double-edged Thoughts/feelings about the situation awoken in me)
