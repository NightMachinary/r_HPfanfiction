** This isn't exactly what you asked, since the summoned Harry isn't weak or decrepit. But he is incredibly old and powerful: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse]]

*** Stopped reading when I saw that the author hasn't read all the books or even watched all the movies. I don't even want to know what kind of view they have on the wizarding world if most of their knowledge comes solely from /fanfics/.

** I was just reading linkffn(the master of death by rgm0005) and thinking how cool it was that Harry was old in it! :D (he's not weak and decrepit, though, sorry)

I've also seen some where he's like thousands of years old, but his appearance in those is always somewhere between 17-30 years old.

Edit: I sent the FFN link, but I think some other site has more chapters of that story than FFN, although I don't know where.

#+begin_quote
  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** This Harry does not get summoned, but he is fairly ancient, and there's some time-travel going on. Not weak or decrepit, though.

** He is used to being a father/grand father and emotional blackmail. So he uses 'I dont know if i ll ever be able to do so and so again, to get his way in every conversation'.

He is also well versed with the spell that makes you feel like your have been spanked like a naughty child. He uses it on the children often enough, but it really gets funny when Molly is talking too loudly while he is trying to get some sleep and then everyone sees Molly suddenly shut up, clutch her bottom and look at old harry.
