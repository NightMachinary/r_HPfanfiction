So, this started off as an ask for books or novels. But I realized I liked the idea for fanfictions too. So I'm posting it here as well.

Do you guys know any books that the main character is changed by something alien or magic. Like in some zombie/vampire/werewolves stuff the character is bite but doesn't turn, but they still have some changes. Or in fantasy someone touch's some strange artifact and it alters them maybe gives them powers. I'm love male main character with a lgbt relationship but the pairing doesn't really matter as long as the story is good.

Since this is being posted in Harry Potter fanfic groups, I guess you can ignore the Alien part, unless you know an awesome crossovers hahaha
