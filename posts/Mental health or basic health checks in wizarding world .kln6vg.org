I don't recall even a sentence suggesting these things in original canon. I know they're in fics and all these but were there actually anything like that in actual canon ?


** It's the 90s in Britain. Margaret Thatcher had just resigned, and before pushed years of austerity and "individual responsibility," and strongly suggested that people who needed help were losers.

If the wizarding world was anything like that (which it probably was, given how closly other parts mirror, e.g. the tabloids), then mental health problems would be seen as an embarrassment. Something to be kept secret, instead of something that is normal to treat.

*** Still Hogwarts was an established school with a (I'm guessing ) 20 beds hospital wing and a live in medi-witch. Still there were no basic standard line regarding vaccinations even ? Like magicals had some different disease then no mags.

**** I mean, just because canon doesn't mention it, doesn't mean nothing is happening.

During the course of the series, Harry doesn't go to pee a single time - the only time a toilet is visited is to cry or to brew potions. That doesn't mean that wizards and witches don't pee, just that canon skips standard stuff.

So I expect a "normal" amount of healthcare, i.e. you maybe get checked up once or twice, and you maybe get a couple of vaccinations, but unless you're sick, you don't visit the hospital wing much.

** I think I remember a throwaway line where everyone had colds and someone had steam pouring out of their ears after visiting the hospital wing for Pepperup Potion. (Though we don't see Harry visit.)

Google says it was in CoS; Percy made Ginny get some following 'a spate of colds'.

Teens have an average of 2-4 colds a year, so presumably some sort of questions take place before medication is handed out. Plus sickness bugs.

Basic health checks aren't really a thing until you're 40+ here, so it seems unlikely that checks would take place. If it's anything like muggle Britain, then you're only given tests and treatment if a condition can't be determined from symptoms alone. (Over testing can be as bad as undertesting.)

Most vaccinations are done when you're young. The only vaccination I had at school as a teen was HPV, although that was because they cancelled TB for my year group. You can opt out, or choose to have it in a GP surgery instead. Although ATM kids up to Hogwart's First Year are elligible to have a test up the nose at school (jabs are done at the GP surgery, anyone with certain health conditions gets one every year).

Between Hogwarts having a somewhat distanced approach to pastoral duties and JKR having based much of it off Britain, I'd say no basic health tests and def no mental health checks. It's implied that they're literally unsupervised in the dormitories, save for also-still-children prefects.
