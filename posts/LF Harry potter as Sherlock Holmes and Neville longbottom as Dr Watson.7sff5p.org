I read a fanfiction once where Harry potter reads the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and becomes a deductive genius himself. Neville starts to write about his cases. I remember it being complete and there being a sequel but I've completely forgotten the name.

** Here's the sequel, but I can't find the original. I think he took it down. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7534803/1/Harry-Holmes-and-the-Web-of-Conspiracy]]

** Part 1 isn't on this person's profile page anymore, and I wouldn't know where to find it unfortunately. However, part 2 and 3 are here:

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12310140/1/re-upload-from-zeno-no-kyuubi-the-chronicles-of-harry-holmes][This]] seems to be a re-upload of part 1, but it's mashed into 1 chapter. I don't know if they have permission, either. I can re-edit this out of my comment if asked.

*** Neville makes a good Watson for a few reasons. He's the solid dependable type more able to pay the strait man against the Potter/Holmes brand of insanity. He also slots very well into a healer role, an interest he could easily developed after spending so much time in St. Mungo's. He would be content to chronicle another's adventures while helping his friend however he can.

** I can offer you half of that: Harry Potter as Sherlock, with Daphne Greengrass as Watson. linkffn(12373224) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373224/1/The-Casebook-of-Harry-Potter][*The Casebook of Harry Potter.*]] Harry is much more like BBC's Sherlock than the Conan Doyle version, yet the story is very well done. It's not a complete canon rehash, or even a Sherlock rehash. There is just elements taken from each to form the story.

  Daphne Greengrass wouldn't realise that a chance encounter at the age of eleven could have led her to have a life of adventure. Fourteen years later she meets Harry Potter again, this time over a dead body, but will she walk away or stay? He's a consulting detective and she's a healer, worlds apart from some, but for others, it could be just the beginning. AU.
