** I'm not trying to stop you from looking, but the amount of writers who have skill, energy yet lack ideas is rather tiny.

And most of them will have heard stories of this kind of arrangements always going wrong.

So, again: I don't want to stop you from looking, but you'd be incredibly lucky to find someone.

** I'm not a big fan of bashing --- my favorite character is Ron --- however I'm a decent storyteller so I can help you organize your ideas into workable stories.
