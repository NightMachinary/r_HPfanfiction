Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone would be able to suggest me some long stories, completed and/or ongoing, preferably 100k+.

I have been reading for a long time and was hoping to find stories I might not have given a chance in the past or just simply missed. I usually prefer Harry centric stories, but am not opposed to other suggestions right now. I'm not into Yaoi/Yuri/Slash stories - it's just not my cup of tea unfortunately. But yeah, almost anything else goes!

Thank you for taking the time to read this!


** I haven't read a lot of non-slash harry potter centric stories but I have read a lot of draco/hermione! Here are some of my top ones.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8156101/chapters/18691246][Apple Pie and Other Amends (76k)]]

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** Wow! That's phenomenal! I have come across your works when searching for stories but have been reluctant as they wasn't/didn't seem Harry centric. However, feeling I've exhausted Harry over the years, I feel this might just be the fresh start I'm looking for! I must thank you for taking the time to reply to this and also thank you for the contributions you've made to the community! Really appreciative of people like you who spend their time and produce such epics! Thank you!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate][Fate]] is almost 3 mil words and ongoing.

I've recently found it myself and have been on the binge since, caught up just yesterday. High quality story telling, which is surprising given the length of the story and the fact that its been published less than 2 years ago. AU is very extensive with quite a few well fleshed out OCs, however it still feels true to HP. And my favorite - powerful wizards actually being powerful - which ironically goes a bit against Rowling lol.

Main characters feel quite similar to how they are in canon which is rare especially considering how different the plot is. Ron is the mc, though the story is told through multiple POVs.

Pairing is Daphne, and it starts bit early to my taste, however the author does a good job of making it feel believable with all the teenager-y awkwardness and everything else that comes with being in your first relationship.

There are a few things that I would normally call out, however the plot justifies them believably.

Honestly my biggest con is probably 13 year old with a six pack, but given the sheer volume of the story and all the cool things in it I'm more than willing to let it slide.

Rated M for dark wizards doing dark wizard things. Nothing super explicit sexually.

*** Hey! First of all thank you so much for replying! I really appreciate the time you've taken to explain the story along with the aspects you enjoyed and potentially disliked about it as well! Appreciate that! I had a read of the summary and it has me nervous. A MC Ron! Ouch! I think I've read too many fanfics and slightly lost touch with the real Ron from the books and maybe this might help me really get back to appreciating his character! Once again thank you!
