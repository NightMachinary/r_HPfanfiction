I'm talking about a cynical, slightly unhinged, stoned off his gourd, roasting Harry!

Voldemort murdering unicorns to use their blood as medication? /Leave the sick pervert to die from his terminal condition!/

A big-fuck off prejudiced snake is jumping people in the corridors and the school is blaming Harry? /Leave the little backstsbbers to die!/

Now pitch!


** Harry, Ron, and Hermione move to a tropical island. Fidelius it. Voldemort takes over the world but the island is self-sustaining and they still sneak out once in a while to see what's up with the world.

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.

*** "Hey Sirius, we're moving to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands"

"But why?" whined the old dawg

"You really want to stay here?" Harry asked

"Well no..."

"Do you have any responsibilities here?"

"No, except you that is-"

"We leave Wednesday. Pack your bags"

"Isn't the Andaman and Nicobar Islands very secluded?"

"Exactly" Harry nodded.

Sirius was still reluctant.

"I've heard that they make vodka out of coconuts there"

That did the trick.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

  What if Dumbledore was out-maneuvered and was late for Harry's hearing for underage magic? Harry ends up expelled but he will not take the unfair and condescending treatment by the Magical World any longer. Watch as Harry successfully escapes and leaves the problem of Voldemort to those who should be handling it. Lots of bashing. Completed - sequel to follow eventually.

*** If he chooses to just shrug then it's better that he lets them die/suffer harsh punishment instead of saving them. Seriously, I think we have an equal divide in the Devil-May-Care between stories in which he is actively working to be the one to kill the people he was supposed to ignore and stories in which he is trying to become St. Potter by saving anyone he sees in danger while telling anyone unfortunate enough to stay still long enough that he doesn't care about the ones he saved in particular and has given up on humanity as a whole -which, super annoying, I mean come on, make your damn mind already.

The idea of having a Devil-May-Care character is that they honestly don't care about anything or anyone outside their circle of interest and associated, and even inside there usually are exceptions. A Devil-May-Care!Harry would neither feel the need to save people he is not personally close to nor of fighting enemies that hadn't attacked him first in anyway (and even then just to the extent of stopping the attack). A Devil-May-Care kind of character should be the age old adage “nothing personal” taken to the extreme.
