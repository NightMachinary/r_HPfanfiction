I think it would be lovely, we all know Harry adores her, views her as his mom, and wouldn't it be cute if they opened a bakery on diagon alley. Just a cute sweet story about everyone finding love and happiness after the war. Any pairings would do, although for the love of God not Harry and Mrs Weasley for reasons I shouldn't have to state.

I can honestly say that's not a pairing I've seen before. And I've seen of a Dobby/The Sorting Hat pairing.

** I'm imagining this as a Sweeney Todd crossover.

Voldemort gets defeated, but the magical government once again lets most of his faction off without consequences, Ginny ends up getting killed, and the delightful little bakery that Harry and Molly had started as a way to process everything goes from a delightful little bakery to a complicated revenge scheme about making the bastards disappear while selling delicious meat pies to the people who let them go free in the first place.

I'd assume canon pairings and ending (sans epilogue) as a starting point, because that way you've got Harry and Molly snapping over the same event, and Ron & Hermione paring (as much as I usually detest that one) works better for interactions as they find out what's going on.

As to in-fic pairings:

If you wanted to further embrace the self-destructive horror narrative, per Sweeny Todd, then starting up a codependent Harry/Molly after they've done a few jobs and finally manage a more significant kill would work well. Doing the least healthy thing possible out of sheer self-nihilism. Yes, for the love of God, Montresor.

But you could also go for Harry/Luna if you didn't want things to be quite as dark, or take the middle road and not add another pairing after the Harry/Ginny. Maybe he gets hunted down by an angry mob and gets a last scene with the Resurrection Stone as he's dying.

Actually, do the Harry/Molly, /then/ do the Resurrection Stone ending with talking to Ginny. He struggles with telling her the whole thing about the meat pies and the whole laundry list of people they killed and the escalation as they got carried away, then she's like "so that's it?" and he's like "uh...actually, there's one more thing" and then has to tell her he's been fucking her mum as he's dying.

** So no explicit relation of Harry/Mrs. Weasley... what about just good old baking flirting? The occasional spank and teasing?

This post just made me think Mrs. Weasley can totally canalize Stifler's mom.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year
