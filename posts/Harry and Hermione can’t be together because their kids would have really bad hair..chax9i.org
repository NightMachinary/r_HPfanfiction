Many people ship these two characters, who have the most unmanageable hair in the entire series, yet I've never read a fic that goes into detail about exactly how bad their kids' hair is. I mean wild, untamable hair, hair that defeats Hagrid's beard in battle, hair that pulls asunder the stones of Hogwarts, hair that strangles their dormmates in their sleep, hair that makes the Whomping Willow pull up its roots and run away, hair that frightens the denizens of the Forbidden Forest, hair that disturbs the centaurs' astrological prophecies by pulling the stars down from the sky, hair that brings about the apocalypse. That's the only logical outcome of two people with such bad hair getting together and having kids.


** The Potter family wealth is almost all from sales of [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/sleekeazys-hair-potion-company/][Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]], which was surely developed using the cursed Potter family hair. The Potter-Granger union gives rise to the most cursed hair of all time, enabling even greater innovations in products to tame unmanageable hair. Together, they develop Perfecteazy, the ultimate of hair potions, marking the dawn of the Potter hair-care empire.

****** And that is not my definition of nice.

Detangle in the shower with water and oodles of conditioner if it's a wash day. If it isn't, put diluted conditioner in a spray bottle with water, wet down your hair, and comb out or finger detangle. Then scrunch and style. Standard day 2+ refresh routine. You can also plop and wrap your hair before bed, sleep on silk pillowcases, etc to minimize tangling.

Look at the wiki on the curly hair subreddit, or Google the curly girl method.

** I have this headcanon that the Potter hair is literallty the result of a curse, that's why Harry's hair grew back so quickly when Petunia cut it. I like to think that a Potter from a few hundred years ago was a very vain man, always taking care of his appearance above all else. This man had a rather spiteful wife, one who would exact cruel and unusual vengance on people who wronged her. Well this man also had a mistress, kept secret from his wife, whom he would often visit for wild and passionate um...relations.

Well lo and behold his wife found out about his side-wench, catching them in the act, the Potter's hair wild and ruffled from his exertions. Knowing his vanity his wife cursed him to never again be neat or tidy. To always be scruffy and disheveled. This curse was so strong it even passed to his future children, though it weakened over time until only the hair was untameable.

Thus we end up with Harry and his eternally uncontrollable hair.

No. That's not how it works. If you believe in genes and evolution, you believe in science, and things that have been proven to be right, or at least close enough. If you believe in genetics affecting intelligence, then (most of the time - see below) you are wrong.

False.

If the parent has some sort of mental illness that affects their intelligence, and they pass it on to their child, then genetics do affect intelligence. If they don't, the child is just an idiot. Not racist, just factual.

If you are a caveman and know lots of hunting techniques, that's great. If you can't actually do them, that's not so good, and you're probably going to die.
