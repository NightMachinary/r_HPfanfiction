I would love any fic where they are actually smart people!!!! Whether they pretend to be stupid outside of the common room and manipulate people by playing idiotic is up to you. Ive seen it done well, and i love them in the first part of 'A Lion and Two snakes walk into a bar and save the bloody World' even if they arent the smartest (though i read the series for Percy who is my fav HP character) I just want to see them done well!!!

** This really bothers me, I can remember a fic where the houses swapped one person around, so I think Goyle went to Gryffindor and was accepted, and was decently smart, before sacrificing himself on the Express. I can't remember the name!
