I'm not completely doing a Harry Potter fanfiction- it's an AU set in the future in another fandom. My favorite character is secretly a wizard. What are some things that he might say, have in his room, etc? Keep in mind nobody knows he's a wizard.

Also, his family supported Grindelwald like Bellatrix is with Moldy Shorts back in the day and he still has that idea, hundreds of years later.


** You could watch Howl's moving castle to peer around his house for at least a mental image of what you could do for his household with differences between public rooms and the bedroom.

** Check out this link. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter]]

A Foe-Glass is a type of Dark Detector. It looks like a mirror, but instead of a reflection it shows the enemies of its possessor. The figures appear as "shadows" but become clearer and more visible as the enemies get closer to the possessor. He could pretend that that "foggy mirror" is an heirloom and that's why he keeps it

Perhaps a trunk locked through runes/magical expansion charm etc.

Talking mirror that comments on the looks of the ppl who look at their reflection and he regularly has situations in which he has to pretend to have said it himself. "Did that mirror just say my bangs looked like I let a 3 year old cut them?!"

"No, that was me" /sweats nervously, contemplating if he can get away with obliviating them/

"How dare you!"

"I can't help it if you look like shit, Carol!"

In general simply every day objects that have developed a bit of sentience. Like that one teacup that sometimes spits out tea. A key that ramdomly vanishes from it's place and always ends up under the sofa.

Overall, if his family were supporters of Grindelwald, he might have a few dark/cursed objects. (And proudly holds on to them if that's still his ideal.)

For example take a look at the stuff they threw out of Grimmauld Place. It held many Black family heirlooms and possessions, such as a music box that played a sickly tune and tried to put the listener to sleep, crested goblets, a biting silver box containing Wartcap powder, and an unopenable locket which turned out to be Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.

He probably owns a few magical books, maybe potions ingedients in jars and stuff or keeps potions in stock. ""I collect ...um insects."

"It looks like a fairy"

"Just an odd mutation"

Maybe he has a jewelery item with "Grindelwalds sign" the Deathly Hallows.

Galleons, sickles and knuts. "Oh yes, my uncle twice removed was a treasure hunter. I got them for my 11 birthday"

Invisiblity cloak. "Yeah it's experimental nano tech"

A wand. "That is my lucky stick"

The *Secrecy Sensor* is a dark detector described as "an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial." It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies

A remembrall

A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.

/on the phone/ "Ah my alarm clock went off again, say how was that about you not able to come over because your dog got sick?"

Exploding snap, gobstones. "Yes it's a popular game in... Michigan"

Wizards chess. "Did that knight just move?" "You're just still high Joe."

Mokeskin pouches are a type of draw-string pouch that can be operated only by the owner
