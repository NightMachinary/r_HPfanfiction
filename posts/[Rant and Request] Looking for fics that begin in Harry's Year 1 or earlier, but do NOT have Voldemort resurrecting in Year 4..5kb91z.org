I'm honestly getting sick and tired of the mandatory TWT, Moody impersonation, and graveyard resurrection plot. I especially hate fics that depict a powerful!smart!Harry still letting Wormtail escape and falling to a stunner in the graveyard. I'm looking for COMPLETED fics that begin in Year 1 or earlier, but have Voldemort getting his body back at a different time (earlier would also work) and in different ways.

I would highly appreciate if the story lets Voldemort returning AFTER Harry's Hogwarts time. Please do not recommend "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), because I already read it.


** linkffn(for love of magic)

linkffn(Harry Tano)

That's what I can think of.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8034380][Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue]] which have Voldemort resurrected before fourth year. Rather funny at the beginning, sadly, it try to be serious and goes of the rails in the third and fourth book. Despite the note, it's not a single point of divergence fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11767424][Butterfly Wings]] also has Voldemort resurrected before third year as part of rushing through canon plot elements. Again first part is cool, with crazy stuff constantly happening, but most of the second is boring and is wasted at "Hi, this is random character X. Character X is homosexual/bisexual/asexual/heterosexual but prefers open relationships. That's everything you need to know about character X, because they will be barely if even mentioned again. Now let me introduce to you Character Y..."

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  Lily Potter made a mistake nine months before Harry was born: Severus Snape, not her husband, was Harry's father. The ripple effect of this reaches far: Snape dies young, Harry calls vampires family, and Lucius Malfoy seeks to destroy Voldemort. But one thing remains the same -- the inevitability of death.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
