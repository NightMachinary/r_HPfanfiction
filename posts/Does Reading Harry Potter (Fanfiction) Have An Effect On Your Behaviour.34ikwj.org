I was inspired to post this after [[https://www.npr.org/2015/05/01/403474870/does-reading-harry-potter-have-an-effect-on-your-behavior][a story]] reached my email inbox.

My answer is a resounding no. Given that we are not governed by a Wizengamot or an overly officious magical bureaucracy in the real world, the HP universe has no impact on my own political or social views. I found the tone of the linked piece to be stilted in one particular direction: that Muggleborns are a disadvantaged group. I'd certainly agree that a vocal segment (the Malfoys foremost among their number) have a low opinion of first generation witches and wizards. Ron believes Arthur hasn't been promoted within the Ministry due to his accommodating views on Muggles, so the possibility exists.

It's also possible to think of it in far different terms. Families from the nebulously identified Most Ancient and Noble Houses (from Sirius' strange rant in OOtP) share something in common with even the newest members of the wizarding community: they were born with the ability to do magic. This reasoning could easily be shaped by conservatives to bolster their own views on immigration, etc.

In terms of /fanfiction,/ overt political author tract is fairly rare. One of the most prominent examples is LordsFire's work with positive Christian themes and Islamophobia. To be honest, I'd be happier if idealogues of any flavour would quit attempting to interject their own political designs into what began as a children's book series.

What's your take?

tl;dr Fictional pureblood politics have nothing to do with real world social problems.


** I'm too lazy to look up links at work, but there is sufficient data to support that the Harry Potter books themselves practically shaped a generation. The kids who grew up with HP are more likely to be tolerant of other religions/nationalities/ethnicities/sexual orientations, and there was some research that found a correlation between voting for Obama and being an HP fan. It's pretty interesting stuff. And then of course there's the Harry Potter Alliance, which is a non-profit organization that fights for Human Rights all over the world. I'm pretty active in that community, and it's one of my favorite parts of being an HP fan.

As for fanfiction, I would say that readers in general are more accepting of Slash pairings even if they don't read it...you know, exposure theory and all.

*** Correlation does not equal causation. Parents who let their kids read fantasy books are more likely to be progressive, for example, which would make them more likely to vote for Obama.

I agree there's some minor influence, but I've met plenty of racist HP fans.

**** Hence the reason I said correlation as well. I'm just relaying information that I've read. I can try to track it down if you're interested.

***** "practically shaped a generation." implied otherwise, sorry.

** I'm extremely interested in politics, and if I made a political HP fic, I would make that clear from the beginning in order to avoid people being turned off later. In general, though, I like fics that get a bit political, as long as it doesn't involve irrelevant irl things.

As for behavioral changes, my catchphrase is "I hate everything," which I got from "So You've Decided to be Evil," my favorite crackfic ever. I've also caught myself unironically saying "Merlin's beard," but that was only once.

** I don't think you mean behavior, but beliefs? Because fanfictions change my moods, and that changes my day to day behavior.
