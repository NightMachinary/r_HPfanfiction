when all the characters are older (roughly around the 19 Years later epilogue) Hermione slowly starts to have feelings for Ginny, but she refuse to convince herself that she is attracted to the Redhead. At a Point, she do eventually realize, that she has a Crush on Ginny and maybe overthink her sexual orientation. When Ginny and Hermione make something like a Girls Night, Hermione makes her outing to Ginny. Ginny wouldnt be rejected to her, but (as a good Friend) comfort her...i will leave it to the Author if Ginny will be Bisexual or make/accept the offer to Hermione to Kiss the Redhead, for Experimental purpose.
