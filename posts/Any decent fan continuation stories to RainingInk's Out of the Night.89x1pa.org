As the title says, looking for fanmade stories that continue on Out of the Night.


** No :(

The author did say they were going to post the summary of what was to come but they never did.

That beautiful world building... Lost forever. :(

**** Thanks for that. I wish it had what was planned.

I never understood why authors who are leaving the fandom with unfinished work won't post the plot. So many fics I wish I knew the ending to.

** Decent? no. I'm not even sure if I've seen one that goes more than one extra chapter.
