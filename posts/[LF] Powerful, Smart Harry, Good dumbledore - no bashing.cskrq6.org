  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  It is wonderful to be James Black. Believe me. How many fourteen years old boys can say they spent their birthday in one of Marseilles' best nightclubs with their friends? Or spent the same night in the arms of a naked goddess? Anyway, we'll get to that later.

  Now, you may wonder, what kind of parent would let their underage child spend a night in a nightclub drinking? The answer is simple: Sirius Black. Though, to be honest, Sirius isn't my real father. My name isn't even James Black. My real name is one big secret.

  I was born Harry James Potter. I was to grow up as a Potter. But life rarely goes according to the plan. 'Man makes plans, and God laughs,' and all that nonsense.

  According to my father/godfather/creepy uncle/dog, when I was a little over one-year-old, an insane murderer named Voldemort - I know, what a funny name! - hunted me down, killed my parents, tried to kill me and blew himself up.

  For the record; yes, I'm that awesome.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Powerful but not completely overpowered Harry and Ron, eventual aurors.

Good but not all-powerful Dumbledore.

Good and skilled Mundungus Fletcher.

Evil and manipulative Lucius Malfoy.

And a Hermione with one goal: Revenge against those who wronged her, no matter what it takes.

Harry and Hermione centric with eventual slow burn romance. Plot and action heavy. Infuriating politics. And a really good broom chase scene.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
