I'm looking for any good harry potter fics where harry has wings for any reason.


** Hell Eyes by Jezaray certainly fits but is very AU and shows it age. Written before HBP and is complete.

*** I second this rec. It's got some of the best worldbuilding in the entire fandom, to the point where I'd rather it be it's own book, because the HP elements feel shoe-horned in.

** I'm pretty sure [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] qualifies. It's a really interesting story, although it hasn't been updated in years and is sadly incomplete. linkffn(9036071)

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

**** Kinda hoping starcat gets back to it soon as they initially put it on hiatus to write Blindness when inspired by their own temporary experiences with vision loss.

Hopefully they can get back into this now that blindness has been finished for a few months.

****** I checked her page after posting that and they have a note saying finishing it is their next project.

However she has to reread the story and go over all her notes to get back into the swing of it. Was expecting to start actual writing in the next few months.

  When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

** Linkffn(No More by The Seven of Us)

One shot where Harry is basically a more powerful version of a metamorph, and is living disguised as an adult when Hogwarts tried to reach him. Thanks to him escaping the Dursleys and living on his own he has control over his magic and is also able to shapeshift animal traits, such as wings, in addition to his human traits.
