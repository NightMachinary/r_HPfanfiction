** In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][R-- trilogy]] /(Words^{T} : ~1,700,000; abandoned for ~2.5 years)/ by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/562135/GreenGecko][GreenGecko]] Snape eventually comes to realise that his and Lily's personalities didn't match as well as he wanted them to, after all. This realisation happens gradually almost throughout the whole story, so I'd suggest reading it if you have enough time for a ~2,000 page long story.

The story starts somewhat slower than usual, and there are too many parties and go-outs described to my likening, but the writer at least uses these simple interactions between characters to better develop them.
