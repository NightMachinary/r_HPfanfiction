I'm looking for fanfics that have the most powerful magic overall, so long as they're written decently.

Something like Core Threads doesn't count, because that's something unique that Harry stumbled onto.

It needs to be the general magic that every Wizard/Witch uses, so another way of asking this is "Which fics have the most powerful average Wizards/Witches?"

Got any recommendations?

Thanks.


** In the prince of slytherin there was this spell "Imago Dei" or something like that allowed the user to change reality.

** The Armageddon Spell cast in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For), Which is basically a more sentient version of fiendfyre that is called down from the sky, and reduces a planetary invasion force to smoldering husks, and was felt across the galaxy.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** I'm tempted to say HPMOR, considering that anyone who knows that antimatter is a thing can just TRANSFIGURE SOME ANTIMATTER.

Everything below is a spoiler:

Aside from the unknown 'oops seemed like a good idea at the time' disasters, like when Atlantis ERASED ITSELF FROM TIME.

Aside from that, reading between the lines, there's a backstory where successive species almost destroyed the universe, then created and cast some magic that changed the fundamental nature of reality to prevent that thing from happening again (which is why HP-verse magic is so arbitrary - it's a kludge of a myriad of patches).

And then there's the fic of HPMOR where there's a ritual that lets you singularity your total magic power you can apply (doing it once multiplies it by a fixed constant, but you can do it as many times as you want) - but then you die very fast.

As Voldie has the Pioneer probe as a Horcrux, and Voldie is tech-savvy enough that Harry knows he'll do an immortal Dark Lord on the entire Galaxy... Harry does the above ritual, and casts a supremely overpowered Aguamenti into the sun, adding enough mass that it supernovas, thus sacrificing everything the Earth could have been to save everyone else (he first casts Homenum Revelio, and around so many stars... there is the glow of sentient life).

Ah, yeah, this is pretty goofy.

I'm... pretty sure this didn't happen in HPMOR.
