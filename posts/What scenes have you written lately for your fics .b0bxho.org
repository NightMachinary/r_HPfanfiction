** Currently trying to complete a story about the grown up trio as Hermione navigates her father being diagnosed with dementia. Due to her altering her parents memories, Hermione slips from his memory very early on after his symptoms emerge. Super family oriented and a reflection of the hard conversations I've been having about the care of my own relatives.

** My last chapter had some highly intense, very emotional scenes involving declarations of love, fierce arguments, realisation that they've made a terrible mistake and confessions. I loved writing it, so satisfying. Feedback has been great too, pretty proud of myself.

** I just had to rewrite a scene from a different character's POV. It was coming out too stiff and bogged down, so I switched it and now I feel like it's in a better place. More natural, more interesting.

** I'm kinda stuck on the first big action scene of "Dawn of Darkness". A recurring theme of that story is that shit starts happening without the protagonists really knowing why until much later and being forced to act based on their own guesses. However, that also makes the actions of the bad guys seem very random and I am struggling to sell that convincingly.

** SFW

I recently wrote a chapter following Harry finding out about Horcruxes and the ensuing (FRUSTRATING) hunt for information on them. The â€˜golden trio' isn't the main focus of my story, but one of them is the protagonist, so the trio are like a side/sub-plot, and they're still important. I decided this was a time to step away from the main story a bit and focus on an important part of their story.

NSFW

I also recently did a belt scene for a BDSM story. My protagonist had been tied, silenced and beaten with a steel-tipped belt very early on in their experience with BDSM, and is not fond of them, to say the least. They do, however, want to work through it. Their Dom encouraged them to experience /his/ belt, which has no metal on it except for the buckle. They couldn't bring themself to be hit with it, but they wore it on their bare skin while being spanked, so they're taking steps towards getting past their fear.

The other is an American wizard taking the DADA position at Hogwarts and dealing with Umbridge. His brother-in-law has the appearance of a child, and he gets sorted into Slytherin.
