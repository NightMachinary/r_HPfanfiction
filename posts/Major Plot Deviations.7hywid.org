Looking for any fics with major plot deviations, as the title states. Whether the plot point is how the Dursley's treated Harry, who he first met, whether it was Hagrid or someone else who came to pick him up, if he didn't meet the Weasley's, etc.

I also don't like fics where a major plot point has changed but little else did, such as Harry being sorted into Slytherin but somehow still becoming best friends with Ron and Hermione instead of anyone in his House.

EDIT: To be more specific I mean major plot points that happen in the beginning that could change the entire series so things such as Harry being sorted into a different house, not meeting the Weasley's or Ron on the platform or on the train, the Dursley's treating him different(for better or worse), being rescued from the Dursley's or kicked out of the Dursley's before age 11.

As for quality, I would prefer longer fics that are well-written and either complete or being updated.


** Being more specific could get you more responses. There are a huge number of stories that fit your criteria and it's difficult to pick just a few because of the diversity of correct recommendations.

I /will/ point you to linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue), and my own linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor); the first one is "what if Harry was born with red hair", the second "what if Harry had had a lightbulb in his cupboard and thus spent his lonely time /reading/", and the third "what if Hermione was a Parselmouth too".

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, and spells are learned or created... (Canon-compliant except for the aforementioned tweak in lineage.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

And like it or not, /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ is well on its way to becoming one of the classics of HP humor fics alongside /Seventh Horcrux/, /Oh God Not Again!/ and /A Black Comedy/.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  "The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine." ~ Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park Harry Potter was, in the end, blessed to have relatives other than the Dursleys on his mother's side. Growing up with the Johnsons allowed him to know familial love he would not have known otherwise. But this has changed more than his home life before Hogwarts. In the end, a single person can, in fact, drastically change how events play out. A small change here, a small change there, and eventually, you get a drastically different story. This is the story of Harry Potter, Maggie Johnson, their friends, and how they in the end, changed their very world.

** Your post implies that you eant straight up divergences, so I recommend those. If you want more AUish stuff in terms of setting I can post more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on the magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slow paced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

*** I've read a couple crossovers, there's a particularly good one with the Avengers and the Master of Death plot. There's not many I enjoy because I'm not immersed in the fandoms so a lot can get lost in translation when I don't know the characters or back stories very well.

Other fandoms I do know fairly well are Avengers, Doctor Who, Sherlock Holmes, and Dragonball Z. Go ahead and link some crossovers, because even if /I/ don't read it someone perusing this thread might!
