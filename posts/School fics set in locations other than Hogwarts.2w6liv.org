Summary: With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Harry P., Sirius B. - Chapters: 4 - Words: 62,622 - Reviews: 633 - Favs: 3,176 - Follows: 907 - Updated: Sep 20, 2007 - Published: Sep 6, 2007 - Status: Complete - id: 3771102

Rare, in that it's not about shipping, has some good fight scenes and for it being complete.

***** I'm in the middle of book three atm...just got to the part where she decides to steal the Time Turner. She hasn't even voiced her plan yet, but I JUST KNOW BECAUSE SHE'S SUCH AN IDIOT!! But really, the fact that I'm this invested is amazing. I have to put it down for the rest of the night or else I'll murder someone.

****** I know!! She can be so bullheaded it's astounding how she gets out of some situations. But that she does is testament to her resourcefulness - Inverarity writes her very well.

** How has [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] not been rec'd yet?

/obvious

One I'm enjoying is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] which uses a similar concept. I haven't actually got to the Durmstrang bits yet, though.
