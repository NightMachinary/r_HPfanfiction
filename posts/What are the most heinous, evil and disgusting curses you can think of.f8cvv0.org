I'm especially asking for ones you invented yourself, it's always interesting to see what others have come up with.

Here's three I've used in stories over the years, as a general guideline:

- The bone-to-sand curse. I originally intended it to be a "normal" dark curse, but then switched it to have an incantation that only works when spoken in parseltongue. The incantation is a word humans can't really understand the deeper meanings of, at least not if they aren't a parselmouth or had one explain it to them. In essence, it turns your bones into dry sand and salt, as found in various salt flats around the world. The counter needs two people, one to hold the sand in shape and the other to speak it. I had Voldemort use it in a reimagining where he didn't rely exclusively on the killing curse.

- The Memetic hour-eraser charm, /Prohibio Tempus Cognitio/. Originally a medical charm to treat recent trauma, and keep it from resurfacing. Essentially, it was supposed to stay in the mind and continually scan it for the targeted memory, and keep it erased, sort of like a permanent memory charm. However, its adaptable nature meant it would become somewhat independent once inside the mind, and would mutate into a spell that continually erased any new knowledge entering the mind, essentially robbing the victim of their short-term memory abilities. It also transfers through any sort of mental contact, like Legilimency, memory-sharing, and being in the same pensieve.

- Anubis' Scale was one of my finest creations, though. It's an ancient curse, from a time before wands existed, and as such, it doesn't need one. To cast it, you need to cut out someone's heart, and then squeeze it apart using your hand while chanting "I judge you guilty" in ancient egyptian until they expire. If cast correctly, the spell prevents passage into the afterlife, forcing the victim to return as a ghost. The destroyed heart can also be used to channel the trapped soul into an object, where it can be shaped freely into that "ethereal spark" needed to give enchantments true life.

Two, it is not the whole wizard or witch that is summoned, just their eyeballs. Makes an important difference.

Three, you can wreck utter mayhem with using "accio eyeballs" on muggles, animals and magical creatures. Imagine using that on the dragon in GOF, creates a very likely scenario where the flames of the dragon hit the stands with the spectators instead of the champion.

***** If you had ever read about Accio charm on Harry Potter wiki, you would have known. Go search it. Accio charm is used to summon objects. If you could just summon someone's eyeballs or their entrails, wizards would be living in a constant fear for their lives. Nobody would need dark arts to kill. Magic itself provide protection to magical beings and prevent summoning and internal transfigurations of your body parts.

You already don't need dark arts to kill. The average second-year student knows spells that can kill. A knockback jinx at the top of a staircase. Tickling charm until they can't breathe. Dancing feet spell near a cliff. Body bind in the snow or while swimming.

For more advanced students: Levitate to a height and then cancel the spell. Levicorpus (turn them upside-down) and then just leave them to suffocate. Summon their broom.

** luto sanguinis - turns victims blood into mud. Created by a rather insane pureblood in 1680 tales of his persecution on Muggleborns gave rise to the term mudblood or dirty blood when referring to them

Cellulam engorgia - weaponised cancer

Dolor animo- when used the victim will have a small headache, as time goes on the pain will increase to near cruciatus levels, the only way to lesson the pain is to torture/ kill someone multiple times until the victim no longer feels any hesitation towards torture/killing. Useful brainwashing tool

Perdita somnumus - sleep deprivation spell, forces victims to stay awake, no know counter curse. Victims die after 9 - 10 days due to organ failure from being awake so long.

** Modified swapping charm that scrambles sections of the jugular veins, carotid arteries, and windpipe. If the victim inhales, their lungs pull all of the blood out of their head and into their lungs, they instantly lose conciousness and drown in their own blood. If they exhale they force all of the air in their lungs into their brain, killing them instantly with a massive embolism. If they try to hold their breath they die seconds later as their heart pumps blood directly up their throat and out their mouth. Completely fatal, no hope to dodge if the caster can see you as it is a charm that doesn't cast a beam of light (like the hovering charm) and relies on eyesight and visualization.

** Some ideas I've had:

1) The Groundhog Curse: traps victim into a temporal time loop and forces them to relive the past 24 hours eternally.

2) The Annus Horribilis: everyone the victim has ever loved dies. The curse lasts for a full year, and causes bad luck to result in deaths.

3) Avada Et Crucio: the killing curse, combined with the pain of the Cruciatus--death by pain, in other words.

4) The Invidius: curses the victim with intense envy. They will focus that envy on one person at a time and do increasingly bad things to that person, up to and including murder.

5) Sic Semper Tyrannus: this causes other people to never trust the victim, and makes betrayal a guarantee.

6) Ante Portas: this makes the person an agoraphobe; they will become a reclusive shut in.

7) The Renaissance Curse: transforms the victim into a marble statue of themselves, still fully alive and cognizant; they must scream but they have no lungs and no mouth.

** I think the most disgusting ones, if I'm being honest, would be to look up old torture methods and base it off those - or, at the least, purported torture methods.

For instance, when reading your Anubis Scale one, it reminded me of the Norse [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_eagle][Blood Eagle]] a bit - which would be quite a gruesome way to go. Same with a million other sorts of execution/torture methods. A few in particular that I remember hearing of would be getting coated in honey and left for creatures to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphism][feast on]], or anything involving intestines/disembowelment.

Another methodology is to take something that we rely on everyday (or that someone in HP might use everyday) - and to cruelly use it as a way to torture someone everyday. For instance, cursing someone's magic or making it so that /using/ said magic would result in torture/suffering is probably one of the worst curses/fates you could use on someone.

Mental torture in general is obviously horrible, as are mental compulsions - particularly those that leave the target /cognizant/, but unable to resist (or forced into pain /until/ they give in). I think in general that might be the most horrifying one - because they're the ones that we can't /really/ reach without magic. Everything else is physical, which is obviously terrible - but magic can make one /feel/ like that's the case. Toying with someone's mind or memory is just horrifying, really....

Entrail expelling curse - Self explanatory

Organ Liquifying curse - also self explanatory.

dog bones curse - turns the bones of the victim into soft rubber like substance that is entirely eddible but on a live victim would cause chaos

Blood boiling curse - cooks the victim from the inside by heating their blood.

Now the important thing is that if you do all of these on a dead cow or lamb or pig you end up with a skinned, gutted, perfectly cooked beast that will be mouth watering and the bones are a great source of calcium to nibble on later. All takes about ten minutes.

** Not my ideas, and one of them may be canon, but Belial666 had the Heart-Ripping Curse (Accio Cordis) and the Plague Curse. The latter I don't remember the incantation (if there was even one) and basically what it seems to do is that any person touched by the curse goes through the symptoms of the Bubonic Plague in the time frame of a minute or two. But since it was fake Moody that cast the spell on a simple rat, I imagine it wouldn't be as fast on a healthy adult. Other than that I think a curse that lights your lungs on fire would be pretty dope since they're filled with air.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
