I don't remember much from it just that Dumbledore is still Headmaster of Hogwarts, Voldemort is either the supreme ruler or is the Minister and Hermione is a bigoted pureblood.

I think they had a dueling tournament where Harry produces a massive shield that has a phoenix or something on it. I really dont remember much from it just that I really enjoyed it.

If anyone knows what it is I would really appreciate it!
