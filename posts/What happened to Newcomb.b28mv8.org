So, I just decided to reread What You Leave Behind and noticed it seems to be abandoned, but I checked the Author profile and it looks like Newcomb just decided to stop posting any stories very suddenly and as far as I can tell there hasn't been any explanation. Does anyone here know what happened? Are they just taking a break. or have they abandoned fanfiction, or what? If anyone knows I would really appreciate it.


** Legend has it that he's still shitposting to this day.

** Then they gathered around Newcomb and asked him, “Newcomb, are you at this time going to restore the fics to active status?” He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Newcomb has set by his own authority. But you will receive inspiration when the Fanfic Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses on Fanfiction.Net, and in all AO3 and HPFF, and to the ends of the earth.” After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. “Men of HPFF,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Newcomb, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”

** He's one of my favorite authors and I hope he comes back. But if he doesn't I wish him the best and I hope he's doing okay.
