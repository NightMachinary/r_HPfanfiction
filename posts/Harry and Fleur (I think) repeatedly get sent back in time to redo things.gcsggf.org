:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a while back so I can only remember a few details.

I believe it was Harry/Fleur (though I could be wrong) and they would try to win the war against Voldemort but something would always get screwed up so they were repeatedly sent back in time to fix everything. They'd done it so many times that they'd worked out who does what and in what order. Like Harry would wake up at the Dursley's (I think) and realize they were restarting again and would immediately think about what order and methods to use for things this time and speculate how long until Fleur would get things done on her end so they can meet up again.

I can't remember anything else about it but would really like to read it again. I've spent a couple hours searching for it but haven't had any luck. Maybe I'm wrong about the pairing or something and have been looking in the wrong places. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!


** I'm quite sure it is Gabrielle and Harry, but I can't remember the name or much else sadly...

  Harriet Potter woke up in the cupboard under the stairs again. She isn't surprised. Hasn't been surprised by that in a very long time, actually. Fem!Harry, Time-travel, Femslash.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
