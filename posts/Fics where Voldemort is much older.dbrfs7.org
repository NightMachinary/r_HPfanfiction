It bothers me that for all his horcruxifications, Tom Riddle only lived to be 70+ years old. For a vilain lusting after immortality, it's underwhelming to me. So are there fics where:

- Riddle was born at a much earlier point in time and took much longer to become the Dark Lord?

- By the time Riddle rises, Harry's generation have already reproduced?


** It is sad, but his immortality wasn't introduced to be of any importance besides being a checklist for the later books and the sacrifice theme.

Voldemort is one of the worst villains in fiction that I've read and immortality is otherwise known for producing wise and strong characters. Voldemort might be those but it was never really shown outside of his fight with Dumbledore. His characterization is limited solely to his arrogance and madness instead.

An older immortal villain wouldn't recognize a child as his nemesis. Even if he did, he's just finish it quickly and efficiently and not monologue.

Basically any kind of competence would the book plot

*** Many great â€˜villains' in life have had a flare for drama and have made decisions that are not optimal for their ultimate goal but satisfy their sense of drama or destiny otherwise.

Why wouldn't an immortal villain recognise a child as his nemesis? Voldemort has great respect for the older magics no matter how much he denies it - as can be seen by his ritual in the fourth year. Him listening to a prophecy is not obviously stupid - this is a world dominated by magic after all.

Voldemort was never immortal whilst Harry was hanging over him in any case - there was always that threat to him.

Was he acting stupidly? Maybe at times. But saying he's the one of the worst villains in fiction is ignoring the aspects of him that are interesting - like the characterisation he gets by way of the visceral fear other characters feel when talking of him.

** I think it's fitting, in a hubristic way, for Riddle's dream of immortality to end at such a (relatively) young age.
