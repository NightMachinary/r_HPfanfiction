What happens to Muggleborns who refuse to attend Hogwarts? Perhaps their parents say no, and also the child declines to attend? And what's stopping the Muggleborn's family from going to a government official or a person in a high level postion? People make the assumption that Wizards work to prevent exposure in government places, based on the fact that Kingsley Shacklebolt was the Prime Minister's bodyguard.

Secondly, what's stopping Muggleborn students who have trained to control their magic, but end up going back to the Muggle world? Perhaps they have been disillusioned by their Wizarding World and don't want to be apart of it anymore? What's stopping some Muggleborn who got his family murdered by Voldemort to go to Muggle secret services and spill everything?


** My headcanon is that if Muggle parents decline to send their child to Hogwarts, they get confounded to do that anyway. Wizards mess with Muggles' minds all the time to keep the Statute of Secrecy, so they would see it as a necessary evil. Simply obliviating Muggleborns wouldn't stop their accidental magic, and we see how disastrous it can get with 13-year-old Harry. And binding magic is definitely not a thing, because otherwise the Ministry would do it to dangerous prisoners like Bellatrix or Sirius, and Death Eaters would do it to Muggleborns. So the Ministry would probably prefer that all Muggleborns have at least basic training so they are all accounted and won't expose magic to Muggles.

** Well, we can definitely conclude from the fact that giants were rampaging through Britain and muggles thought it was a hurricane that the ministry of magic is very good at controlling the knowledge Muggles have. We know from the fact that the Prime Minister did not believe in the existence of magic that very few people in the Muggle government are allowed to know about the existence of magic. And given how wizards have portraits in the prime minister's office, know his schedule and are capable of changing it, and can insert employees as they desire that wizards have full intelligence over the muggle executive branch at the very least.

So presumably, there's nothing that actually stops a family from going to secret services on the magical end, short the unlikely possibility of a taboo of some sort (or the one of the family having been obliviated upon refusal). But let's say you're an employee of the government and a family comes to you claiming the existence of a shadow government with magic. You'd laugh them out.

What proof does the family have? A piece of parchment and ink? What an oddball family. They refused to go to Hogwarts so they certainly don't know how to get to Diagon to buy school supplies. They get laughed out, and that's assuming they even got past the receptionist.

Let's say that they made it into an interview with an employee. Although accidental magic can't be done on purpose (what naturally talented wizard who can control underage magic to an extent turns down Hogwarts?), the child gets angered enough and accidental magic goes off. Okay, maybe the employee believes them now.

They go to the employee's supervisor. Same issue with evidence, only it's even more unlikely for accidental magic to go off. Maybe the supervisor sees the video and believes it and is willing to risk his career to send it up the chain. Hopefully, he's not too worried about losing his career to being known as the guy who sent a hoax up the chain.

In this chain of unlikely scenarios, it eventually reaches the highest points in the muggle government. Ministry of Magic finds out. Oblivation happens, records are wiped, confundment is done as needed. And the family probably gets charged with a violation of the Statute of Secrecy. They're muggles and it doesn't bode well for them.

Nothing stops a muggleborn from re-entering the muggle world besides the issue of degrees, certifications, and records in the muggle world.

I'd assume that muggleborns can refuse to go to Hogwarts. Assuming they aren't obliviated, I'd assume the muggleborn would be free to go live their life, though they'd be banned from using magic because they presumably wouldn't get a magical education and pass their OWLs.

** It depends.

If we think of obscurials as canon (i don't) then i think obliviation might be in order.

On the other hand, i think that if some muggleborn were to refuse to attend Hogwarts, they could still be required to learn some magic (i.e. with a tutor) in order to minimise the potential for accidental magic happening, or for it to be reversable/containable for them, or so that they'd at least get someone more competent to fix it.

​

Now, as to muggleborns that leave Hogwarts and want to go and live in the muggle world - i'd wager there might be some issues with education since they didn't attend any real school, but if they really wanted to there might be some way for them to catch up to that (either bullshitting some story about immigrating from some godforsaken shithole of a country, or with ministry helping them get some flase track record, or both), but with some work on their part i don't think it would be too hard to get back into muggle society.

Add some careful magic here and there and they might even manage a legitimate muggle business in which they aid themselves via the use of magic - some sort of restauratn (with other muggleborn/squib workers to not violate SoS), a repair shop (Reparo!), or maybe a houseflipping business with them buying shitty apartments and remodelling them with magic for miniscule costs. Or a ton of other things that i didn't think about.

** My guess, muggleborn who refuse to attend Hogwarts attend muggle school and don't learn magic. They won't be able to find many jobs in the wizarding world later on, so will likely have to live in the muggle one, forfeiting many of the magical conveniences. They could afford a wand on a muggle salary, and if they manage to learn some magic themselves, they can use it after they become 17.

Fanon tends to imagine things like obliviations, bound magic, even taking the child away, but honestly those don't make much sense to me. Pro-muggle wizards will say, "Sure, if that's what you want..." Anti-muggle purists will say "One less Mudblood, good riddance." Attending Hogwarts or not isn't that important for the Statute of secrecy.

Also, nothing stops them from going back to the muggle world except the lack of muggle education. They could, perhaps, use magic to ease the transition a bit, but the Statute limits how far that can go.

The main things that stops them from going to the secret services is accessibility (especially since their reason is not very believable) and legality. If they manage to get an appointment and demonstrate some magic, the most likely result will be some obliviations + trial for breach of secrecy.

** I find it very unlikely that a magical education is optional, I'm sure anyone who turns down a place at Hogwarts is free to pursue alternative education abroad, but it'd hardly be unusual for education to be mandatory and muggles can't really do homeschooling.

As for muggleborns trying to reveal magic, I'd assume the same things that ensure that giants and death eaters can rampage about without anyone being any the wiser, a few obliviators to wipe the memories of anyone who saw too much and a few reasonable sounding explanations from the muggle-worthy excuse comittee to cover it up. Oh and naturally said wizard would be in deliberate breach of the statute of secrecy and likely face criminal charges.

** This is pure conjecture as I don't believe that canon ever clearly states it but the impression I have is if the muggleborn doesn't attend Hogwarts (assuming that Hogwarts is the only magic school in the uk) that their magic is bound and everyone obliviated (Also assuming they don't ask about "other" magical schools and state they will go there instead).

On the second one only the muggleborn's respect or lack of respect for the Statute of Secrecy would determine if they would inform the mundane government (which according to canon already know). So I would expect whatever special department that the mundane government sets up to watch over the magical world would be un the lookout for disaffected magicals.

Because there is no way a government would not put together a department to watch over an entire secret society who could be a threat to them.

  “Not to worry,” he had said, “it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's something really serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles --- the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it's live and let live. And I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.” At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. “You're --- you're not a hoax, then?” It had been his last, desperate hope. “No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look.” And he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil. “But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why --- why has nobody told me ---?” “The Minister of Magic only reveals him --- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”

Also magic doesn't seem to be something that can be "bound."

**** Nothing stops the prime Minister from telling other trusted members of his staff. Or to have his people look for folks with "certain" backgrounds that would most likely be muggleborns who have returned to the mundane world.

The binding part may be due to too many fanfictions bleeding into "canon".

This wouldn't work. It's on the same level as the Goblet of Fire. IF they really existed, they would be abused to no end. The goblet especially, as I find it highly irregular that in seven hundred years nobody has used it as an assassination tool yet. And the purebloods would be going around binding magic of muggleborns for shits and giggles.

All it takes is one idiot on the board of governors to look at the student book to discover their name and location. BOOM! they have a way to target muggleborn and halfbloods.

** I've always assumed that, if a Muggleborn doesn't want to join the magical world, nobody's gonna force them to, and that someone raised in the magical world could choose to leave it. Presumably, they'd still be beholden to the Ministry's laws, and considered a citizen, but given that it's a secret society largely independent of the muggle government, that doesn't really mean anything unless you're on the Ministry's shitlist.

  And what's stopping the Muggleborn's family from going to a government official or a person in a high level postion?
#+end_quote

Lots of things, access being the most immediate: how easily can you a) contact a government official who will b) genuinely give you their attention, c) is able to act on your information, and d) willing to do so? Even after getting over that /immense/ hurdle, then what? There's likely no official records in the muggle world of Hogwarts' actions, so there's not much to investigate, and if they came right out and said they they'd been contacted by wizards, who would ever believe them?

And besides, it's explicitly stated in Deathly Hallows that a Hogwarts education wasn't compulsory until when Voldemort made it so (and I think we can reasonably assume that that law was overturned when the Death Eaters lost control of the Ministry), and since we /never/ hear about any other schools in or around Britain/Ireland, I think it's a reasonable extrapolation that a /magical/ education isn't compulsory in Wizarding Britain. (Apart from that one year when a genocidal autocrat was in charge of the country, but I assume that muggleborns weren't exactly welcomed into the wizarding world that year, anyway, so that's kinda a moot point.)
