It takes place in a time before Voldemort's first attack on Godric's hollow. Someone (I think regulus black) is a really neat wizard. They find new ways to use magic and impress Voldemort. I think there was something about him living with Ted tonks and his wife. And also being able to disappear into a swarm of bats? I think regulus was being tutored by a guardian angel, maybe? Might be confusing two fanfictions.


** Harry Potter and the Deux Machina. One of my favorites. It's fantastic.
