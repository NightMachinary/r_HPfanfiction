I really want Harry to have his grandmother back no matter if she's been in stasis frim a disease for ten years or brought back to life. Anything where Dorea Potter nee Black helps Harry.


** I think that's in this one:

ShayaLonnie stories start out interesting, but tend to get bogged down in romance after a while.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  In the canon Harry Potter universe, Sirius and Walburga Black's mutual hatred is the stuff of legends. But, what if that hatred wasn't real? What if, instead, it was secretly one massive prank?Behind closed doors, House Black is strong and united.Harry Potter would know; after all, he's secretly been raised as the Blacks' pride and joy. But, shhh, you can't tell anyone that.Much of this story was originally written for April 2018's Rough Trade Challenge: 'Call it Magic', though it has seen some editing since then.
