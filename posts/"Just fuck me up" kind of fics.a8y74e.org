You ever been asked what you want at say, a party and said "just fuck me up" and gotten either the worst or best trip of your life?

(First time I drank, we mixed a bit of every beverage in the room alcoholic or not into one fruit bowl. It tasted like Bubblegum and trash)

So fics that Just Fuck You Up. Whether that be emotionally or mentally.

My recc for something like this would be The Art of Self Fashioning. That fucked me up mentally and emotionally from reading from a mindest that made me very uncomfortable and the events that occurred.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])


** The art of selffashioning was a great fic. Although I must say that halfway through the madness largely goes away, still fucked up bits in there after that, but the first half of the story is better in that regard.

From more of an emotional/wholesome perspective I recommend linkffn(Blindness). The first half of this story is really something else in my opinion. The latter half still tugs at the emotions, but the author strayed a little too far from the start of the story for my liking. Excellent read all around though.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(2452681) also by Duskbyte, a different fic was linked by the same author in this thread already. This one was an absolute trip for me. The descriptions, and more importantly the proper decision to describe only when needed creates an amazing aura of horror and revulsion. I loved the ending involving fudge and umbridge the most.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** You know how it's a miracle that, with all that Remus has suffered, he's still a sane, kind person in canon? This story corrects that error. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4653672][Sacrosanct]]

In my own story, he's not quite that bad, but is still pretty messed-up. This is my darkest story, that some readers have told me has scared them away from reading even my lighter stuff. And it's a Christmas story, so now is the time to read it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255][Employee of the Month book 1, Hiraeth]]
