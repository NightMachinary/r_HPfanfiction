** linkffn(11634921) 'Itachi, is that a baby?'

Not only Harry and his bonkers adopted 'uncles' (in reality a band of somewhat insane superpowered mercenaries with world-ending predilections) are utterly hilarious in this fic, but Dumbledore as well. Dumbledore's characterisation in this fic easily brings it up from 'funny' to 'hilarious'. Basically, this fic's Dumbledore is one who's got no fucks to give at all, and is basically seeing how far he can go before someone calls him out on it. So far, he's very disappointed. Every scene with Dumbles in it will have you in tears laughing. Features bloodthirsty bunny slippers from hell, odd train schedules and aviary artillery, and that's just some of the stuff Dumbles has had a hand in.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.

** It's honestly a classic, imo. And it is rated M, and I don't think it's here, but it is on skyehawke. 'Batman' and it's sequel, 'Catwoman' by jennavere. My first legal adult beverage was a Mai Tai, just because of these two stories.

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will not be controlled. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"
