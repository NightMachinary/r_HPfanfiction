What rare pairs do you think are underwritten as a whole, and are lacking in enough numbers?

What rarer pairings do you wish you could see more regularly in the background of fanfics, in one era or other?


** I think pretty much anything that is between two minor characters tends to be overlooked. (With perhaps the exception of Dean/Seamus).

And I'm not just talking about romantic pairings but even the background noise of other people living life around our main characters is often lost. I'd love to read about Filch and Madame Pince playing dominoes and eating stale cake if it meant you understood a bit more of the world as a whole.

** Harry/Luna: Actually there is quite a lot of it, but most of them have Luna as a side character to some other female, or even worse, have her as some all knowing seer. It's not like Harry/Luna would be the complex pairing to write, so I don't know how it can get fucked up in so many ways.

Hermione/Lavender purely for entertainment value. I know it's stupid, but I need some stupid fics in my life. The funny kind of stupid.

Ron/Luna I have a fairly strong belief that Luna had a crush on Ron in OoTP. I have zero concrete proof of this, but there are so many things about the way they interact that just makes me believe it.

SomeoneotherthanHarry/Multi, come on, can't someone other than Harry have a bunch of girlfriends for once? Am I seriously the only one who hungers for fics where Draco, Ron or Neville have a bunch of women at their fingertips? Cos I'm starting to believe that I am

*** tbh there shouldn't be Anyone/Multi, because it's a bit spastic to think that eight or nine girls would want to share one bloke like he's a communal dildo. That being said, I think Ron/Multi could be achieved very easily: make him the superstar English quidditch keeper and a "harem" isn't out of the question, so long as you make it clear that it's not a harem so much as Ron shagging around, attachment-free.

***** Harry/Hermione/Ron is my favorite non-canon pairing. But there are very few good fics about it. [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works]] has 95, but none of them good imho.

*Just The Three of Them*, linkffn(6807742), is nice, but only an one-shot.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is a great story, but their relationship is implicit.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is very good, but still a little too short and has Theo Nott instead of Ron.

*** Harry/Luna is exactly what I was going to write. It shouldn't be a rare pairing, since it is one of the most logical (despite how illogical Luna is) possibilities. Yet somehow, there are almost no good stories with the pairing. I know personally, I haven't written it at all, since Luna is quite possibly the hardest character to get right, which has led us to the position where there are tons of awful stories with her.

** Snape/Dumbledore. Their dynamic fascinates me, and I love stories that explore it. I'm a fan of cross-gen pairings and power imbalances, plus there are vague parallels in their backgrounds where each made a tragic mistake as a young man that cost the life of someone dear to them. And Dumbledore has a huge impact on Snape's life (and death), while not really seeming to give much of a shit for the man himself. That kind of tension and leader/follower relationship interests me, because they're both complex characters and Dumbledore always has the upper hand.
