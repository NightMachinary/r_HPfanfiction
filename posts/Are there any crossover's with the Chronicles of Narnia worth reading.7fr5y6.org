Narnia is one of my favorite series of books in addition to Harry Potter. I'm not quite sure how well a crossover would work exactly though, but it would easily work from a technical standpoint for dimension traveling and Death considering Narnia has The Wood Between The Worlds and Aslan's Country. It just feels like a perfect fit there, not really sure about the characters though, since there are rather a lot of protagonists from Narnia. I'd prefer it to feature the Pevensie children opposed to others, Lucy or Susan would make the most sense IMO.

So I thought I'd ask around, there are a few on fanfiction.net, but I prefer suggestions to reading the author's descriptions to get a feel for em.

I only ever found a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/40d17u/narnia_crossovers/?st=jahg7q5s&sh=e16deb48][single post asking for a Narnia crossover from over a year ago]], and that only had one suggestion.


** I also really want more stories. Susan would be the best protagonist, given how she was vilified. I feel like the Wood Between the Worlds is the perfect way to connect crossovers - for any fandoms, really. Middle Earth, Westboros, Alternate Earths - it's an excellent plot mechanism.

An alternative story idea is the Neitherlands, from The Magicians series. I'd love one where the Ministry Six create their own world, like Quentin did, and have a world building fic. Ministry Six plus Rolf and Hannah.

*** I agree, Susan is the obvious choice of a protagonist. Maybe something after The Last Battle would be good. And yeah, The Magician's heavily borrows from Narnia in regards to how the universe was made and whatnot, with Fillory and the Chatwin's being so close to Narnia and the Pevensie's. I think that was why the author decided to not mention Narnia in the Magicians books like he mentioned Harry Potter. The Harry Potter parallels are mostly cosmetic, but the Narnia ones are more substantial.

** I seem to remember that A Year In Their Courts was at least decent.

*** Thanks, I'll give it a read since it's so short. I don't know how I feel about a romance though, Narnia never seemed to lend itself to that IMO, still could be interesting.

  ...Is better than a thousand spent at home. How much of who we are is tied to memory, and what happens when we start to forget? Hermione Granger stumbles through a wardrobe, into Susan's bed, and finally into Peter's arms. A Narnia/HP crossover.

** Not fanfiction, but you just came perilously close to describing, and therefore may enjoy, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(Grossman_novel)][The Magicians]] by Lev Grossman.

(There is also a very good chance you won't enjoy it. Reactions are heavily polarized, so if you check it out and aren't immediately taken, /don't/ wait for it to get better.)

*** Yeah, it is a bit close. I've always really liked that series, I'd say that it has one of the very best coming of age stories of all time, mostly because there was such an enormous change in the protagonist. You really hate all the protagonists in the first book, I think that's by design, and by the end things are much different.

** I'll get back to you as soon as I locate the stories I have in mind. Many of them were about Susan but there's this other one where Harry was brought up by King Edmund in Narnia.

*** The Made-Up Things: The Muggle Princess of Narnia ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2423300]]) Once upon a time, there were four children. Their names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. And then only Susan was left, and she had two daughters. One was name Petunia, and the other was named Lily.

A Chance Meeting ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8351385/1/A-Chance-Meeting]])

The first day Susan Pevensie met Tom Riddle, she thanked Aslan for giving her the strength to ignore his advances... The second day she met him, she hoped that she would survive. The last day she met him, she hoped that he might have repented over his life.
