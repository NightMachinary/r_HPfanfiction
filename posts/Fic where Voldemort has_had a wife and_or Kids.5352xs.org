I've read two fics where Voldemort has/had a wife or kids. In both of them, they were killed. I don't care if Harry is a DE or not.

** There are a few Voldemort is Harry's dad/grandad stories out there, but it sounds like you want more of LV acting like a family man? If LV as Harry's dad/grandad is ok:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]] is not exactly a masterpiece, but fits and is complete. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3974539/1/A-Different-Life][A Different Life]] is a bit better quality wise, but has slash which will put people off. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3367625/1/Harry-Riddle][Harry Riddle]] maybe? There are a lot of issues with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1606443/1/Family-Issues][Family Issues]] (the least of which is that terrible summary), but it also has LV as Harry's dad. Something not decades old is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of old laws]] in which Harry is adopted by LV, and is active and updated today! I enjoyed what little of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9901082/1/Family-Matters][Family Matters]] these is. Mostly for LV reaction in finding out. For some reason I think it is funny.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  They all thought Lily was Light. She wasn't. She was in love with the Dark Lord, and gave birth to his son. Now Erus Riddle is growing up, showing just how evil the son of Lord Voldemort can be. Of course, the Light doesn't know that fact. SLASH-FIC.

  In which I attempt to write the screenplay into a full short story. I have no rights over the characters, plot, or dialogue of this story, which was published as a screenplay based off of an original short story by JK Rowling. I sincerely hope JK Rowling releases Cursed Child as a full story, in which case I shall retire this fan-made version.
