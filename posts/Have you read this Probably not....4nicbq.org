** I don't know the name either, but this sounds super familiar. Was the OC named something starting with an 'M'? I wanna say it was Melody or something with that same cadence.

** Marnie, I believe the character's name is Marnie. I have read a similar dice but involved Harry being raised by Sirius in Grimmuald Place and Lucius hiring Lupin to "search" for Harry.
