Okay, the title is pretty self-explanatory: Why not try writing a time-travel story with not only one path, but different ones.

[[http://dendritestories.co.nz/read?p=4932a]]

I wrote the first few pages and choices to set the general tone, but you can obviously deviate from the path. Now the only thing you have to do is add new decisions, or add stories to branches that were created but not filled with content yet.

This is obviously an experiment, and the result will most likely be weird (because of the many different writing styles), but I imagine this could be fun.

Let's see where this takes us.


** That sounds awesome. I'll write something tomorrow when it's less late and I can think again.

** How did I not know we could write choose-your-owns so easily?

I'm in, I think. Once my work-brain has rebooted into play-brain.

** Well, I decided to join in on the fun. But only 5000 characters to play with? That sucks a bit. Still fun to write up, though. And if I accidentally trod on someone else's toes in regards to backstory, I apologise.

*** Hi there! My husband created the website (Dendrite) you are all using. I saw all the referral traffic coming from this reddit thread, and I'm glad you are all enjoying it. I'm sorry the 5000 character limit is not enough for the writing you want to do. Do you have any suggestions for what the character limit on each page/section of the story should be?

**** Closer to 10,000 characters would be good, with the option of more should the content be a collaboration between two or more people/moderated by a trusted admin or site use.

*** Backstory is mostly canon so far, and if someone dislikes your version, they always have the option to add an alternative chapter.

** I have a horrible feeling that someone's got the wrong end of the stick with the abuse Harry went through at the Dursley's. Especially since I can see a "Vernon: Beat Harry" option which they've left as a choice... :/
