I'm working on a fic that draws heavily from Arthurian myths and has a huge AU backstory for who raised Harry. I'm looking for someone to read over the first chapter and other than regular feedback, I want to know if I'm explaining enough about the content I'm introducing.

The fic itself takes place in Harry's first year and is probably rated a pretty soft T.


** I have no experience as a beta but I would love to help.
