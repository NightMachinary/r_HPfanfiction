******** That's an... uncharitable way to look at it. There's a middle ground, methinks, between "Draco in Leather Pants" territory and "Kill them all, none of them have any chance of ever redeeming themselves!", especially with the examples of Snape and Regulus to specifically prove that turncoat Death Eaters who realized Voldemort was going too far were /totally a a thing/.

/However/, all this is entirely besides the point because I honestly don't think Pettigrew was your average Death Eater. It's sufficienly vague that you /could/ characterize him as pure evil, but I find it more interesting to think that he was a genuinely nice person and a good friend to the other Marauders... jus weak and cowardly in the face of danger. Voldemort had barely threatened him and immediately he turned, hating himself all the while but never finding the strength to resist. He betrayed the location of James and Lily because of his pathetic cowardice, and after that was forced by this same, almost clinical /terror/ to keep obeying Voldemort.

Bottom line is: I don't /think/ it's quite fair to say that Death Eaters like Malfoy or Rosier are beyond redemption, but even if /they/ are the same doesn't have to apply to Pettigrew.

But as someone that doesn't mind Snape-ships, I'll say it's not about looks. He's an intelligent and intriguing character who's interesting to read about, whether alone or interacting with other people. Even grouchy gits like him have relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and when you're writing that it's an appealing challenge to keep him IC while handling those relationships. When you write about him wanting a relationship, you can dedicate an entire story arc to his understanding the give-and-take of any relationship and having to adjust himself to that, that he may have to learn to temper his words, be a bit nicer even if he has to work at it---or have him decide that he just doesn't want to work that hard at relationships (or a specific relationship) and having to accept that he'll never have a close relationship for the rest of his life and whether that's okay with him.

** I have to wonder why Peter would owe Harry a life debt in the first place; Harry pretty explicitly says he intends to hand Peter over to the Dementors, which probably means life imprisonment or a Kiss for Peter, both fates worse than death, and that he's only sparing Peter at all because he doesn't want Remus and Sirius to become murderers.

I mean, by that logic, if that earned Harry a life debt from Peter, then the Death Eaters should have tons of life debts from their victims, every time they decided to keep one to torture later instead of killing then and there.

--------------

Maybe it'd make sense if it's less a thing of 'saving someone's life' and more 'granting someone's wish'. A wish debt. Peter dearly wished to not-be-murdered at Remus and Sirius's hands, and Harry (technically) granted that wish, so that created a reciprocal debt (a get-out-of-being-murdered-free card) that Harry called upon way later in Deathly Hallows.

Or maybe it's a magically-enforced slavery thing; by having complete control over Peter's life in that moment, Harry's magic created a master-slave bond between him and Peter. But the problem is that by /that/ logic, Voldemort should have a so-called life debt over Harry because of the graveyard scene in Goblet of Fire (though see above, he'd probably have one anyway).

**** Yeah, I don't get this either. Harry saves Ginny and Gabrielle and Draco just because he is a good dude. No life debt. He asks Remus and Sirius not to kill Peter: life debt.

Snape saves Harry's life at the quidditch march, no life debt. James stops Sirius from murdering Snape. Life debt!

Looking at this, the way to life debts is to stop Sirius from murdering someone.

**** Well, technically everyone in Britain owes Harry a life debt then.

(I would argue that the magical governments elsewhere are far more competent since there is no way in hell that magical Prussia or the French would take shit from some upstart British guy with 50 followers.)

**** Since Peter apparently was forced to pay it back, it is likely a magical thing. But in my opinion, it's just another plot hole since as you point out, in numerous cases, lives were saved and no debts created.

I usually assume in my stories, if I use the trope, that a life debt is only created when someone risks their own life to save someone who would have died otherwise. (Throwing yourself in front of someone to catch a shot while you or the other are bullet-proof, for example, wouldn't create a debt.)

Just saying though, Harry probably didn't save Gabrielle from anything. She would have been fine.

Also, I'm not really sure Peter did owe Harry a life debt. JK said the hand killed him for hesitating, not because of some magic to do with life debts.

I personally believe life debts are just a wizarding tradition as opposed to a magical phenomemon, but either way, the idea in this scene is that the life debt /caused Pettigrew to hestitate in the first place/.

**** Yeah, because they were talking about it and he thought about it. I was just meaning, nothing magical made him hesitate. And it wasn't a magical life debt that made the hand choke him. (I know some people who only watched the movie thought that's what happened.) I still don't think he really owed Harry anything. Just because Harry or Ron said he did and made him think about it, doesn't mean that he did.

** Correct that's something I've noticed as well. Another character that owes Harry a life debt is Ron Weasley (book 6). Of course Harry owes Ron a life debt as well after being rescued from the frozen lake in book 7.

Not sure how life debts work in that regard. Do Harry and Ron now have a soulbond^{^{2}} ?

*** Cause it's always something like a life debt that's the driving force for an arranged marriage between harry and whoever since there's probably no good reason for them to actually even be together in the first place. A life debt is just an easy way out/writing tool and OP is just making fun of it.
