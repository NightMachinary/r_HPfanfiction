I am talking about the obligatory Diagon Alley shopping spree scene, the Sorting Hat singing scene, the Quidditch match scenes.

Like, I understand, I truly do, why writers reuse those scenes again and again. When reading them in the books, it was indeed magical. Trying to awaken that magic in your fic is all fair, I understand.

BUT it just gets tiresome reading whole chapters about yet another shopping spree or another Quidditch match. If there's not something inherently different going to happen, something truly defining for that fic, then I don't see the point in reading a whole chapter about Harry or Harriet or Hadrien shopping for a new wardrobe because I've read that one in like 50 other fics already. A short scene of about a hundred or so word summarising everything is more than enough IMO.

What do you guys think?


** It comes from newbie authors copying JKR without understanding /why/ JKR used those scenes in the first place. They think they have to, because they assume that these scenes are what makes Harry Potter... Harry Potter-ish. The same goes for writing out extensive classroom scenes, because Hogwarts can't be Hogwarts without classes, right?

No.

In canon, JKR wrote scenes because they were directly relevant to the plot of the story, to establish important information or introduce characters. She skipped past weeks of school between major events because it wasn't the classes that was important, it was the important plot points and hints dropped in them that justified their inclusion - Snape's "bottle flame, brew glory" speech showed his instant bias against Harry, Slughorn's love potion demonstration foreshadowed the Merope backstory, Lupin's boggart lesson hinted at his wolfiness, Moody's Unforgivable Curses lesson hinted at him being secretly evil all along.

Most of it boils to noob authors not recognizing that JKR structures her story as a mystery novel, and the magical stuff is just window dressing. Everything she writes is meant to lead up to the big reveal.

JKR's kind of mystery structure is dependent on having a solid plan for the story, and this is something that fanfic authors don't do, since they write and publish chapter by chapter, altering their plans on the fly, depending on how they feel, and how many people flame reviewed them on the last chapter.

*** That's the point! Literally every scene in the books and movie foreshadows to an future event. The ulterior motive for showing us the levitation spell class was to show that by learning it, they can use in the troll fight. Even Hermione emphasized on the pronunciation part to Ron so that in the end, he could cast the spell correctly to levitate the troll's club and drop it on its head. JKR does everything on purpose (except Ron/Hermione pairing. Seriously, She herself admitted that it happened only because she was clinging on the idea too long and they would need relationship counselling if they pursued a relationship. Even if it is true for magnets that opposite do attract, Ron/Hermione pairing atleast need a common ground to work on, and I *don't* that they have any (except, being Harry's friend). Hermione is portrayed as being sophisticated and studious and Ron being plain Lazy as F. /I don't think it's gonna work guv'nor./

What I want to say is that *almost* everything has an ulterior motive portrayed by JKR and new writers wont benefit from writing plain class sequences. You can add some confrontation scenes between Malfoy and The Golden Trio in a classroom , it's all up to you. I literally have the complete Hogwarts curriculum to use and I use it only to bare minimum. Imagine how hard it is to not use it completely showing a complete school year in 30-40 chapter book. It's tough, believe me, /It is tough/.

So, just dont make any more unnecessary and boring classroom scenes than the bare minimum. You can make classroom scenes to build the plot like chatting in Binns's Classes or working together in Potions or Outclassing everyone and everything in DADA classes, just dont start explaining how to cast /Alarte Ascendare/ like the '/Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile/' Goldylocks did in 2nd year duelling practice.

For stories, /The More You Know/ meme really and i mean /really/ wont benefit you always.

Well, good luck and Adios amigo!!!

** I think certain scenes like the sorting hat scene and the shopping sprees are pretty obligatory since most kids need to go through them, and usually, the sorting hat scene is a pretty important scene in terms of characters, since, you know, you are put into houses based on traits of your character.

â€‹

While I do agree they get repetitive I find the best fics usually choose to focus on aspects of these usually obligatory scenes that aren't showcased in the books or have the scenes and their events play out differently, affect the characters differently or focus more on parts of the scene that works with the theme of the fic.

That I agree with. I don't see the point in spending 1k words retelling the shopping spree, but I definitely don't have a problem with mostly skipping the less important aspect of the Diagon scenes while focusing on important scenes, like meeting an important character for the fic itself, or if something defining for the fic is happening at Ollivander's. But having the Malfoy scene repeated almost word for word from the book, or the wand scene being almost identical to the book...THAT grinds my gears and is, unfortunately, the case for too many fics.

** What do I think? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/djybfp/any_wellwritten_femharry_paired_with_a_weasley/f49kahj/][This]]. These scenes are allowed if they different from the books, and if they bring something of their own to the story. I scream in anguish, whenever I read Professors McGonagall's speech on four houses verbatim copied from the book.

** I think you sort of need to keep in mind that

a) fic writers are amateurs and mostly are not bastions of wit and imagination, and

b) they're writing more for themselves than for you. Basically, fic writers who write this kind of thing tend to SI themselves into their protagonist at least a little, and it's fun to imagine yourselves in similar situations.

** It depends on the purpose of the scene in the fic, as does any scene really. Namely, what is it communicating to me, the reader, about the characters/story/world that I should know? In canon, these scenes serve as much to show the magical world and all its quirkieness. In most fics though, they are generally just scenes about how X would be done different if I were writing Harry Potter...which is /boring/.

Not to toot my own horn, but the way I have always proceeded with planning is to write scenes that serve one or more purposes in the story. This means every section does double, triple or more duty with worldbuilding, characterization, humor, etc. Just writing a scene to advance the plot or, worse, to rehash the canon steps is endemic of a lack of forethought from my perspective.

** Well, they only get tiresome in two scenarios for me - one, the writing is bad, or two, it's not particularly different from canon.

For instance, Diagon Alley (in the novels) is Harry's first real exposure to a new world - and has a ton of options. If writing a different sort of Harry, it makes sense that that exposure would go differently - and it's important to see it.

Even minor changes can be fun to see in that setting - for instance, it can be a great way to introduce new world-building elements in the form of different shops, people, etc. If doing a generally canon personality Harry + a more fleshed out WW, it might make sense to introduce some of the changes here.

In the end, I would imagine that you're more annoyed with one of the two I mentioned - quality of writing and importance/relevance, than with the actual scene itself. It just stands out more because you've read similar scenes a lot!

Though I do agree on the Quidditch - those are very hard to write in a way that keeps me engaged, and tend to not actually have much relevance to anything else in fanfics.

This exactly. Quality of writing would put me off even earlier, but if the scene is simply a rehash of the canon ones then yeah, it is really bothersome to me. But I do agree if things are different and make sense to introduce in those scenes then please do. But don't spend 1k words telling me how Harry met Malfoy at Malkin's and how Ollivander expected him, etc. Those things can just be summarized if there's no actual change in comparison to canon.

** I actually enjoy the shopping scenes, but only when they're not limited to Diagon and Knockturn Alley. I love the fics where there are other alleys, (like a restaurant District, business district, etc.) and they're discovering them.

** It really depends on what you do with those scenes. If they play out like in canon, well, what's the purpose of that fic? And if you intend to diverge at a later point, start the fic at your divergence. Or even start after the divergence at the moment where it becomes impactful. For example, in one of my fics I have Harry and Tonks bond over the DoM, but because that would change very little during the first half of the sixth year, the fic starts December 1996 rather than July.

But if you take the canon setup and have it play out differently, that's fine. For example, say Harry gets the Welsh Green and not the horntail, or if he has a different battle plan, the first task should obviously be part of your fic, even if there are thousands of fics where the first task makes an appearance.

** Nevermind JK Rowling copying! That is to be expected since it is the source material!

But what about yes FANFIC AUTHORS and OTHER FANFIC AUTHORS?!

People need to stop being lazy and copying each other. :( Especially with all those exact same Gringotts inheritance vault scenes. It is seriously weird that people just wholesale rip off entire scenes from each other! And characters too, with everybody writing the exact same personality for Daphne! Seriously lazy fanfic authors!!! Stop stealing exact same materials from each other. COME UP WITH YOUR OWN STUFF!!!
