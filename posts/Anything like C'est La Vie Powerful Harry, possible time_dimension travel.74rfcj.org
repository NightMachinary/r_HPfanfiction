Okay before I start, I have already read the following (way too much /cry/)

linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is)

linkffn(Stages of Hope)

linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)

linkffn(A Black Comedy)

linkffn(Emperor)

linkffn(Timely Errors)

probs more but those the main stories recommended when I ask this.

Recommend me anything good, I'm begging you. I'd prefer them to be finished/updated 'regularly.'

I like gen but romance is good. Bashing at a minimum or at least done tastefully. No slash unless it quality slash and not the main drive of the story. Fem!Harry is cool too

No harems! Noooooooo please no harems

Thank you HPfanfic gods


** linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth)

linkffn(World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren)

linkffn(To Call A Place Home by missmusicluver) It's been more than a year since it updated though.

linkffn(Never Say Remember by Malora)

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
