** Well this does open up the interesting topic of how exactly parseltongue works.

For one thing, snakes generally have pretty shit hearing, and they aren't generally very social animals. Typically, we only see language develop in social species, like dogs, chimps, dolphins, etc.

So the question is, do snakes /actually/ speak, or is it just the magic translating their reptile brain intent into words we understand, and vice versa? So can snakes actually speak parseltongue themselves at all?

  All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on castors and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, ‘Leave him!' And miraculously---inexplicably---the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. *He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't have explained.*

Now I like the idea of Ron replicating Harry's hisses to open the Chamber in DH less and less. Parseltongue isn't just a language, but a magical ability like Seers have futurevision trances.

**** But we know it's also a spoken language, because people who can't speak parseltongue, even muggles, hear it as a strange hissing and spitting. I think for the human, it is a spoken language, and the snake's response is received telepathically.

I think the Chamber specifically had to be spoken parseltongue, though, otherwise why would the basilisk have stayed there for 50 years?

*** I honestly don't think so.

We sort of know that the basilisk had to obey the heir's commands, so it is likely it was simply commanded to stay there. Otherwise I would ask the question on why would it obey Tom and not, say, tell him to go away and let it sleep?

A second option is that since the basilisk's resting place was behind Salazar's statue, *that* place was locked up, preventing it from coming and going as it liked, but not the rest of the passageways who'd open with 'open'.

I like the idea of the imperiused snake. It's something I thought of before. It fits with Ron being able to emulate it. And if would fit canon, unless there is evidence to suggest that a human speaking it actually hisses and whatnot, while only the parselmouth 'hears' snakes telepathically or something, with no actual serpent hissing involved.

I guess in the end it all comes down to how those kind of locks work. Does it need to be a human(oid) saying it?\\
On a related topic, I always thought that Hogwart's password locks were teribly unsafe. I think we all know that passwords consisting of actual words are unsafe (hence everywhere asking for symbols and stuff), so all one would need to do is to enchant an object to recite a dictionary. Time consuming but feasible. It would be harder if the password is two words or a sentence, but still feasible.

**** As far as I can tell, there's only one instance of a snake speaking to a wizard that is told from the POV of someone who doesn't understand parseltongue. In Goblet of Fire, Nagini reports to Voldemort that Frank Bryce is standing outside the door.

#+begin_quote
  And the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. ^{GOF 1}
#+end_quote

then,

#+begin_quote
  There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. ... This man could talk to snakes.

  Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.

  “Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said. ^{GOF 1}
#+end_quote

In this moment, Frank hears Voldemort speaking parseltongue, and we know that Nagini has told him about Frank being outside, but Frank does not hear Nagini responding. It's /possible/ he just doesn't remark on it, but given his suspicion that Voldemort is talking to Nagini, you'd expect it to be noteworthy if he heard two /different/ 'voices.'

** I personally dislike these sorts of clever loopholes in the magical world, as to me it cheapens the restrictions and specialness of abilities like Parseltongue. So I imagine only an actual Parselmouth can speak and understand snakes though some sort of telepathic connection. Snakes don't speak Parseltongue in day-to-day life, that's just what the Parselmouth hears as the snake's thoughts. A concept I'm a fan of is that the Parselmouth themselves 'gives' the snake sentience by speaking to it. To me, this explains the Python in Book 1, Harry, empathizing with the snake, imagines it would very much rather be back home than trapped in a cage (though that's probably the case regularly). It also explains how Parselmouths control snakes by default; if you 'are' the snake, telling it what to do is easy.

So if I had total control of the HP universe, Imperiusing a snake wouldn't give you the ability to speak Parseltongue, the snake might not even have a way to express the concept of 'open' through hissing. But that's the beauty of fanfic, JK wrote a universe that can be interpreted in many ways, and anyone can write what their view of it is!

Do you think that the Diagon Alley brick wall would open if a muggle tapped the right pattern of bricks (three up, two across), or does it need a wizard to do it? The books show wizards tapping the wall with their wands (and Hagrid his umbrella), but they aren't actively casting spells.

** My understanding was always that parseltongue is a human language which (by magic) permits communication with snakes. Although it has a sibilant phonology, parseltongue is not the actual noises snakes make naturally.

So:

A parselmouth can speak parseltongue and understand snake-noises.

A snake can make snake-noises and understand parseltongue.

A regular human can learn parseltongue but cannot understand snake-noises.
