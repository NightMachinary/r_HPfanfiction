[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): This fic is near completion. Head Auror Harry had to catch a serial killer, while still maintaining a good work/life balance. Story often narrated from Harry's Muggle neighbor.

The second half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), features Harry and Ron as a pretty good Auror team. Unfortunately, too many forces are stacked against them, and I expect them to fail.

My top time travel fics are those that ignore rehashing the 'time line':

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry got thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. She is a fun character here and by no means a paragon of virtue. Harry also had to teach potion for several months.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione jammed her 20 years old memories and powers into her 2 years old body. Hilarity ensued, but also heartbreaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James' POV. She didn't get paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): A very damaged Harry got thrown back into his 11 years old body. Voldemort and Death Eaters were barely an issue, but regaining Hermione's love was a lot more difficult.

Unfortunately, a good one does not exist in my opinion. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3717885/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Autumn-Swan][Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan]], linkffn(3717885), is ok.

*** I loved Returning To The Start, it was actually believable. Why any time travel stories has Harry training twelve year old's to fight terriosts i'll never understand.

Thanks,\\

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
