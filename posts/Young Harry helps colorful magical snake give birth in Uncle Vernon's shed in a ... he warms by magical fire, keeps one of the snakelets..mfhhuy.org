While weeding the garden Harry hear a snake and starts talking to them. Many snakes comes to talk. Later a large, colorful, magical snake comes. She's escaped her owner and need help to give birth - she needs a magical fire (part ashwinder?). Harry use his magic to warm/set fire inside a metall {can't remember what it's called} in Vernon's shed. The snake give birth (eggs at first?), and Harry cares for and bonds with the baby-snakes - especially one he's later allowed to keep.

Harry's snake is partly boomslang, and Harry gets a good relationship with Snape when Harry gives Snape skin from the snake, and they try to figure out the magical properties. I also think Harry initially asked Snape about the snake's health or spiecies or something.

Possibly Harry sorted into Slytherin. Possibly Harry good with potions. Probably AO3.
