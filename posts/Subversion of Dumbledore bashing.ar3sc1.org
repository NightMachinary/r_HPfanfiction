We've all read a fic or ten where Dumbledore is this inexplicably evil manipulator who somehow gets outsmarted by a kid. Are there any stories that play around with this trope in interesting ways? Like, delusional Indy!Harry thinks Dumbledore is out to get him. Or Harry is raised by Voldemort sympathizers who brainwashed him. Or Dumbledore deliberately acts in ways that make him appear evil for some good reason. Anything like that?


** There's "What Was Your Plan?", which I kind of appreciate because while this IS an example of Evil Manipulator Dumbledore, it's an Evil Manipulator Dumbledore who's actually competent and who doesn't immediately crumble when a self-important teenage boy starts ranting.

In this story, Angry Badass Harry confronts Dumbledore with how Evil and Manipulative he is... and then the scene plays it out the way it would realistically go, because OF COURSE an Evil Manipulative Genius would have accounted for this possibility and be prepared for it. linkffn(11613187)

  Harry has just begun his showdown with Evil!Dumbledore. Having shouted the various crimes perpetrated against him, he is unprepared for how the rest of the confrontation goes. ONESHOT

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]]? I don't think it's subverting enough. Dumbledore is still seen as a misguided old man for me.

I think there's a one-shot where Indy!Harry (or TimeTravel!Harry) confronts Dumbledore about his 'manipulations' and then he totally refute them, kinda cracky. Unfortunately I forgot the title.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** Heh i read one where Harry was up in arms over the first year encounter at the stone. He blames dumbledore later, and dumbledore then complains back that Harry actually ruined his plans, it was a trap for voldemort, Harry was never supposted to go there, the stone was a fake (obviously) but he couldnt tell Harry that he risked his life for nothing xD

** So I just watching a beautiful mind a couple months ago and thought that Harry could have been practising with runes or something and that effected his mind into thinking that everyone is out to get him like how Nash had schizophrenia in the movie.

** In the sorta-crack-fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12875945/1/One-Floo-Over][One Floo Over]], the main character (who is taking on the role of Mentor to a pre-Hogwarts Harry) mistakes Albus Dumbledore for a Death Eater the first few times that they encounter each other, mainly because Albus thinks that the MC had kidnapped Harry and is attempting to retrieve him in order to get him somewhere safe.

  It's the classic Dark Harry fic... or not. When the hero refuses the call, it's up the Spares, the Unchosen ones, to be the heroes. Insane!Harry, Nuanced Dumbledore and Snape, Nuanced Dursleys. World's first Bashfail!fic (to my knowledge), Harry tries to bash and faces slightly more realistic results for it than having everything fall into his lap. Originally written while angry

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
