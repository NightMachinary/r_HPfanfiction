** Just started it. This is pretty good. The writing is pitch-perfect for this kind of story.

** u/MeijiHao:

  It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

This is probably the best Dark!Hermione fic I have ever read. It is fast paced, no nonsense, and very intense. Definitely earns its M rating. I stumbled upon it in another author's favorites list recently and felt compelled to share it.

*** Oh my goodness yes! I just read all of this in one sitting and it was honestly one of the most believable Tom/Hermione fanfcs I've ever encountered. It honestly makes Tom and Hermione seem like equals. In most stories Tom is always portrayed vastly further along magically than Hermione, yet if you compare what J.K. said about her OWL/NEWTS she BEAT Tom in many aspects because of the whole "scores that rival that of Albus Dumbledore" bit.

** Very, very good. It swept past my initial reservations and took me thoroughly along the ride. Overly canon-compliant, for a larger piece, but given the tight focus on the diary/Hermione setup, it worked.

I did think the tension surrounding diary!Riddle's motives could've been resolved better, however. I feel they got an overly-perfect ending out of it, despite the way the author sold it.

** I'm not a fan of the ending and I hated Hermione throughout. [[/spoiler][She acted so uppity and superior I was just waiting for her to be killed by Riddle. As I got towards the end I was flush with excitement of her being consumed to give Riddle life or being exterminated as soon as he came into being that the end left me feeling despondent.]]
