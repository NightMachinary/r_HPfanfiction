I remember reading this fic where the year Harry enters Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decides that the houses are too divided or something so it sorts the kids into almost the opposite house than the one they were originally in. Like I'm pretty sure Harry and Draco went to Hufflepuff and got in a lot of trouble together and Hermione and Neville might've gone to Slytherin? If someone can find this I'd really appreciate it.


** Sounds like the switchverse series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082]]

Fred and George confuse the hat so it ends up sorting all the first years into completely random houses.

  Draco licked his lips and then pointed at Harry. "His Muggles kept him in a closet."

Is there any good fic where Draco and Harry become friends because Draco is outraged about how those *animals* are treating a *wizard*? Probably just edgy Dark!Harry bullshit, right?

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.

Not exactly random or what I would call "missorting" though. I think it's definitely in the spirit of your request.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  I've loved many Harry Potter stories, but the one that I enjoyed the most was "Hogwarts Houses Divided" by Inverarity. This story is the fanfiction sequel to that (meta I know) but with new characters, conflicts, and narrative threads, I believe this stands on its own. Teddy and his friends attend their second year, which proves as busy, interesting and dangerous as the first.
