It was a Harry/Draco fic, and I didn't read it on FF.net. It was also around 2005 that I read it, so it might just be gone now.

All I remember for sure is that Pansy has a fairly big role in the story, and she uses a curse (whose incantation is never stated) to break all of the bones in Harry's body. She first learned the curse from someone else who used it on a garden gnome, I think?

*** Oh man, that's it! The Cicatrix Cycle! Thanks so much. :)

Edit: After digging around, I remember that I originally read it on the PSA over at glassesreflect.net. Boy, does that take me back!
