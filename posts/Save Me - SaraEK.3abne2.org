Hi. I am looking for a fanfic I read a few years ago, it's called Save Me by SaraEK. Does anyone still have it? Checkmated and Quidditch Pitch don't exist anymore.


** I have a version. [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35450803/saraek/saraek%20-%20Save%20Me.epub][Click to download epub.]]

**** Different format, or just a different way of getting it? I can convert it (html, mobi, rtf), or if you just want a different way of getting it you can PM me your email address and I'll send it that way. (Or I can convert and then email if wanted.)
