** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire]] is so far removed from canon it's crazy. Basically during the 4th task, a bunch of students end up on an island in the middle of the ocean due to a portkey mishap. The story is about how they go about building a civilization.

EDIT: ignore ffn bot, instead check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][this Island of Fire]]

** linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation) The premise is that Quirrelmort kidnapped Harry at the end of first year. This is on my top 5 for a grand number of reasons. The dynamic of this fic is breath taking, all the relations and characters really do feel that they are alive. The relation between Voldemort and Harry follows a natural progression that i've not seen in other mentor Voldemort fanfics. Best Quirinus Quirrel of all fandom, a must read.

** This story is truly unique among the Voldemort!Harry's son stories. While the grammar leaves some to be desired at times, the plot is nothing short of astounding in its originality and content.

edit - I love this story so much I've actually re-read it /nine/ times.

** linkao3(7900501) always makes me cry when I read Sirius is talking about Lily and James.

I think I have a bit of a more personal connection as a trans person, but deep down we all want to be accepted by our parents and the way Sirius talks about them makes me want to be a better child to them but also for them to accept me the same way.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

** linkffn(With Malice Aforethought)

I read this one recently after seeing it rec'd here. It's old and I believe was written before the last two books came out, but the writing style is quite canon-y.

linkffn(Summer Loving: Sleepless in St Cricket)

And this one is pretty adorable (Daphne especially so). Whenever I see a request for a Daphne that isn't an Ice Queen™, I think of this story, although usually (always) those requests are looking for Harry/Daphne and this is Theo/Daphne, but I think it serves the same purpose.
