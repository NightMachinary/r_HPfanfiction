Are there any good (preferably longer) fics where harry from the future comes back and instead of killing his younger self he becomes a voice in his head and gives him advice?


** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10127452/1/Schism][Schism]] by My blue rose. There are only four chapters, however.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764665/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Children-of-Change][Harry Potter and the Children of Change]] isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's similar. Hasn't been updated in a while though.

** I don't know if you've seen this one yet (it's a month after you posted, so it's a decent possibility) but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Edunuelos][dunuelos]]'s The Lone Traveller and it's spin offs are kinda what you're looking for. ditto [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etheprofessional][The Professional]]'s The Lone Traveller which dunuelos used and abused as inspiration.
