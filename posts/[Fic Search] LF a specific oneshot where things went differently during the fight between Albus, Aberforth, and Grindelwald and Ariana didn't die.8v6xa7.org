IIRC in the fic Albus went away to the continent with Gellert and sort of helped his rise. And then he became disillusioned with what Gellert was doing. The climax of the fic involved a fight between Albus, Gellert, and a few of Gellert's most loyal followers. Afterwards Albus took Gellert home and they remained friends (possible more?). At the very end of the fic it was revealed that the whole fic was what Albus saw in the Mirror of Erised in first year
