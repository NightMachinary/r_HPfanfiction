You'll see every fic recommended or mentioned on this sub in the past several years and can even sort by controversial or popular.


** Or, of you just read something on ffn and really liked it, check what fics the author favourited and followed. There's a high chance you'll find something you like there.

*** Eh, sometimes that works for me, other times I hit a total dead end and have to start from scratch in my emails or the communities. Both kinda suck for looking for completed great fics.

** That's how I found fics when I first started reading fanfics. Over time as my interests stabilized, I started using FFN and Ao3 filters instead.

I still do it occasionally when I feel like reading outside my "comfort zone" for something novel.
