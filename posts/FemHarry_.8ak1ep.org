** Are you planning on keeping her otherwise the same, so (barely) raised by Dursleys, Girl-Who-Lived, sorted in Gryffindor?\\
If her character would be close to the canon Harry, you're pretty much limited to Gryffindor only as Harry is not shown to associate with the other Houses at all.

Or wait for fourth year and make her the girl Krum takes to the ball.

If you're going to change things about her character other than the plumbing, you have more possibilities but make sure you're not going to just make her an OC in Harry's place.

***** Well, lets be honest, Harry, I think, didn't go out of his way ever to talk to Malfoy... Granted, he's the one with most dialogues with Harry from any other house, but still, I'm pretty sure Harry would've preffered never talking to the ponce.

** Hmm. Is she straight? Usually she's paired with Fred or George, sometimes I've seen her paired with Neville or Ron. In a very infamous fic she was paired with Cedric, but it made no difference to the story. Most fanfic writers decide to make her gay and pair her with Ginny, and occasionally Hermione.

Are you planning a time-travel fic? I've also seen her with Remus (not my thing but it's an option), Grindelwald, and basically anyone you'd like
