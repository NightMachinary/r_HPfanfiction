** It's a cool idea but not all that reasonable, especially after year five (the more the years progress the less reasonable it gets).

Voldemort is hunting Harry. In his eyes Harry is the one prophesied to defeat him and as the years progress that fact is cemented more and more in Voldermorts mind. And his fear grows; do not forget that Voldemort fears death enough to hack his own soul into pieces, scattering them.

And then there is his Image. Harry Potter defeated him as a toddler and has escaped relatively unscathed after every later confrontation. That really doesn't sound good for the supposed darkest Dark Lord.

Finally, there is his Ego (with a capital E), for basically the same reasons as with him Image Voldemort will not tolerate the fact that The Boy Who Lived has managed to escape into another country. Maybe he will wait, without Harry the resistance's moral will crumble and Voldermort will easily gain control of the whole country. Then he will strike, with immense and unstoppable force he will hunt Harry down and kill everyone he managed to familiarize himself him, he will torture him and only then will he publicly execute him.

Harry will never be able to truly "run away" from cannon Voldemort.
