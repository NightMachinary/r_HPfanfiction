#+begin_quote
  The Harry Potter saga told in a form where every word in the story is composed from the letters “Harry James Potter.” It's slightly harder than it looks .

** Not as unique as it could be but it's a good version, /Realignment/ [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838/]] is a good story in which a Harry Potter travels back in time to kill a young Tom Riddle, who ends up under the protection of Albus Dumbledore.

Not knowing anything of horcruxes and his future self, Tom Riddle prepares to fight this wizard who calls himself "James Bond" whilst also dealing with Dumbledore snooping, Grindelwald's ambitions, and his own search for his remaining family.

Is one of the few Voldie-focused fics I've read that make him relateable yet still potentially able to become as moustache twirling as his canon counterpart

*** That was a great recommendation, thanks!

One of the best portrayed Dumbledores I've seen so far, a believable character for TMR, a fresh take on the nonsensical slytherin powerplays, and even good fight scenes.

The only negative side so far is it being incomplete (I'll ignore the whole James Bond thing).

*** I'm really enjowing the magic in this. Very fun, very interesting, and the twisting of how old magic is generally portrayed is a nice touch.

Plus the Silver Skrewt spell is amazing. Probably based off of Wormtail's silver hand.

** Well, I'm assuming it's limited to Harry Potter fanfics, and I've read quite a lot, so I'm not actually sure...

...oh who am I kidding. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-series-of-crazy-random-happenstances-hp-dc.14620/][A Series of Crazy Random Happenstances]]. Clark Joseph Kal Harry El-Potter Kent beats everyone else in sheer uniquity.

Honorable mention to linkffn(Culture Shock by Ruskbyte), which takes a completely off-the-wall crossover and makes it work. On hiatus since 2008, unfortunately.\\
Side honorable mention to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harrys-island-home-harry-potter-that-flies-off-the-rails-quickly.325447/][Harry's Island Home]], which is a rare humor fic that isn't quite crack, and incidentally gives a lot of characterization to rarely-seen Diagon Alley vendors.\\
Classic honorable mention to linkffn(Make a Wish) - very unique for its time, probably too much of a classic to still count as unique today.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.
