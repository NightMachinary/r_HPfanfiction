** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) features a powerful and skilled Harry who has basically no self confidence whatsoever.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** There is "Children of the Sun" by Lomonaaeren, it has a variation on "His Dark Materials" daemons. Harry has a prominent position by virtue of his daemon but he remains humble and even rejects the idea that he should be privileged because of the manifestation of his soul.

** This is a frequently asked question on this subreddit, and it may behoove you to check some other requests (just within the last month) rather than ask here. However, I will give you some examples I personally enjoy, though snobby and cocky are like many things in the eye of the beholder.

- linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is one of my absolute favorite time-travel fics, where Harry speed-runs Voldemort and his forces in a twelve hour race against the clock. Warning: VotN is a fairly brutal writer in terms of violence and gore.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) may be one of the fandoms Top Ten, and you have probably already read this as well.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) is an old trilogy of fics where Harry increasingly becomes more and more OP as it progresses. The writing can get a bit slow, but the action can be top notch when it ratchets up.
- linkffn(The One He Feared) is incomplete at only 40k, but whats there is some of the most captivating displays of magic and OP Harry currently written.
- linkffn(Skitterleap) has Harry in a Massive AU where Grindelwald won, and Harry is a soldier fighting for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Enembee's other fics linkffn(By the Divining Light) also feature a powerful but tempered Harry.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge) has Harry getting some new help following OOTP, and massively scaling up his abilities. He is initially somewhat cocky, but this is tempered fairly quickly when Harry gets in a fight with the Carrows and they sever his arm (which Dumbledore then uses as Portkey to save him).

** I recommend checking out linkffn(core threads) and linkffn(gods amongst men).

In core threads he basically becomes a god and has some really cool magic done by Harry. This is hands down my favorite HP Fan Fiction ever. It's also insanely long. Like 340k+ words I think?

Gods Amongst men is harry losing his horocrux and quickly advances in magic and power. Honestly this is one of the most interesting fan fiction I've ever read, because of some stuff at the end. Not sure how to do the spoilers thing but SPOILER warning: Harry is the heir of gryffindor, gets a spirit copy / spirit animal version of Codric Gryffindor that helps train him. He gets some training from Dumbledore and Grindelwald, along with becoming the owner of Excalibur and technical king of Britain. Pretty much OP Harry.
