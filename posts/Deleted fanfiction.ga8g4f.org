:END:
There was a Hermione/Snape fanfiction that as far as I can remember was really good and I've been wanting to read it but it seems to have been removed from Fanfiction.net and I can't find it anywhere. It was called either The Tapestry or Tapestry and Hermione was in her 7th year, her and Snape start practicing legilimency, she gets him a book that I think Salazar Slytherin owned or wrote, she gets kidnapped at one point, and eventually she makes her way to this part of Hogwarts that shows you multiple strings(?)(three of them?) and the colors all represent something. Pretty sure some of the Gryffindors save a Slytherin girl from being attacked? It was really long and rated M. Anyone know where I can find it? Did anyone happen to save it?


** Could this be it? It is on Ashwinder though. [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1231][Link here.]]

***** Do you happen to have an Ashwinder account to possibly copy and paste the story to me? I tried making one to get access to the story but it isn't sending me a password like it says it will and no one is responding to my email so I can't get to it.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

****** I don't, but I can tell you that the owner of Ashwinder is a healthcare worker and is swamped right now with the pandemic. Unfortunately I can't help you. :(

** I would try checking out the [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/][LJ Community]]. They're loads more helpful.

You can ask in this [[https://www.perusingtheshelves.com/fanfiction/harry-potter-fanfiction/][community]] is someone has a copy.
