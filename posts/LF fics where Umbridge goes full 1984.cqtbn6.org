** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420434/1/][Moments in Love]] This fic is best described as Harry and Hermione vs an Umbridge led Ministry. Umbridge successfully has herself elected minister before 4th year and by the 5th year she has a magical TV invented for propaganda broadcasts.

**** You might be able to tell if your going to like it in the opening note.

He definitely had his good moments (Resisting talking bad about Harry and Hermione for the propaganda broadcasts, enough so that Umbridge just Imperiused him.) but I don't remember enough to tell you how bad the bad is. (bashing also doesn't bother me so that might be a bad sign.)

#+begin_quote
  The premise for this is "consistent-character!Harry Potter" based on his "Pre-Ron" characterisation. And by that, I mean the way Harry is described at the beginnings of the books (particularly in the beginnings of 1-3... see my profile for chapter citations... and in any other scenes in the books which are most reflective of Harry's fundamentals) before Rowling started writing Harry with lines of thought and dialogue which sound more like they were originally written for Ron.

  As such, we see a Harry who is VERY interested in reading his schoolbooks, keen on learning everything there is to know about magic, and keen on doing his homework in a timely fashion - in other words, someone who has loads more in common with Hermione than Ron. And as such, we will also see a Harry who is more consistent in his behaviour regarding being very anti-bully, anti-bigot, anti-slavery, and very pro-fairness, not to mention being a fair bit smarter than he sometimes behaves when he's hanging around with Ron.

  So there will be no Rowling style Out-of-Character moments where Harry goes from being someone who treats Dobby likes an equal, feels bad about house-elf enslavement, actually frees Dobby from house-elf enslavement, and then suddenly turns into Brainwashed-by-Ron!Harry who thinks Hermione is crazy for wanting to free house-elves two books later. And also no moments where Harry isn't smart enough to be suspicious of a super-expensive broom appearing out of nowhere when an alleged mass-murderer is hunting him. Nor will Harry be stupid enough to test out unknown spells discovered written in the margins of an otherwise very useful book on unsuspecting people.

  In other words, again, a Harry who tends to have far more in common with Hermione in terms of goals, intellect, and basic outlook on life. Which isn't to say that Harry will be "Brainiac!Harry" who is a clone of Hermione - he will still have a more intuitive/visual style of intellect rather than a verbal/linear one, his memory will be normal - not eidetic, and he will still have a measure of impulsiveness, and some anger issues, all of which are strong features of Harry's core persona.

  Likewise, in this series of moments, we'll see a more consistent-character!Hermione. A Hermione who once she learns to trust Harry's friendship and instincts, doesn't suddenly do inconsistent things like talking to McGonagall about suspicious broomsticks before discussing it with Harry, or stupid uncharacteristic things, like not believing Harry's all-too-credible deduction that a Son-of-a-Death-Eater, with serious Daddy-Issues, is very likely following in his father's DE footsteps.

  Nor will Hermione be doing stupid OoC things like falling for an idiot with a motor-mouth, or going to a party with a gropey-rapey jock (McLaggen) just to make that same idiot jealous... i.e. Hermione won't be portrayed as one of "those girls," a smart assertive girl who inexplicably falls for idiots who treat her like crap all time, and who never really show any appreciation for her unless she's doing their homework for them.

  No doubt some folk will think my characterisation of Ron is "bashing," (someone always does :P ) but frankly, it is based on Rowling's OWN portrayal of him. And Rowling does not treat Ron's character kindly (when it comes right down to it, she's the original Ron Basher, which is one of the things that really makes the Ron/Hermione pairing truly bizarre). Oddly enough, Ron is one of the most consistently written characters in the original series.

  Anyway, Ron will be depicted in this fic with all of his canon faults, but also with all of his more positive canon traits (he's a decent bloke at heart, after all). Likewise, the relationship between Harry and Ron in this fic will have its ups and its downs, much as it did in canon.

So If that put you off you probably won't enjoy it.

***** I never think it's a great sign when people front-end their fic by calling the original author's writing OOC. It seems like the writer here doesn't really get that people have nuanced personalities, sometimes do dumb things when they should know better for this or that other reason, and that personalities and views change with time, growth, and exposure to new information. Of course Harry will have changed in the time between him being an eleven-year-old boy locked in a cupboard and then being a grown teenager who's solved his problems with only his friends for years.

****** Yes. I found it funny that people belived Harry was interested in learning based on an offhand remark of Harry reading his textbook during summer instead of his action during the whole series. He's a good student, but he's not as interested in learning as Hermione.

******* I think he's interested in learning, but not book learning. He clearly thrives in practical classes like Defense Against the Dark Arts, but lags in text-heavy classes like History of Magic. Of course he'd read his textbooks over the summer because that's his connection to the only place where he feels at home, plus he has very little to entertain him at the Dursleys', but he obviously foists a lot of the book heavy lifting to Hermione at school while being actively interested in practical lessons on magic.

It probably isn't, but it's surprisingly common among H/Hr shippers to call HBP badly characterised, they think Rowling changed Hermione's personality slightly to try to disprove H/Hr could work. Whether you agree with that is another question.

Edit: And some people have thought this from the beginning, I found a fic from 2007, one year after the book, that said the actions of Hermione were caused by a scheme of Voldemort to weaken Harry by getting rid of his greatest supporter.

******* It's totally common in any large fandom for people to call so-and-so badly characterized if it gets in the way of their favorite ship. I take it as a pretty reliable sign that they'll be writing what they wanted the character to be rather than what the character actually is.

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.
