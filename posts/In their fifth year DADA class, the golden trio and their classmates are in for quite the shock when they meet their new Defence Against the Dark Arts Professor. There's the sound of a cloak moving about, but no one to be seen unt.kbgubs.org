Suddenly, a man with black messy hair and round glasses emerged in the middle of the room, an all to familiar scar atop his head. Several jaws dropped as he smirked in obvious amusement.

​

"Hello class, didn't get a chance to introduce myself at the welcoming feast. I am your new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor; Harry James Potter."

Notable fics below:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063892/chapters/25491018][Wind Shear]]: time-traveling Harry teaches Defense, complete. It's a classic. All author's works are 'good' at the least.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8898816/1/Remuneration-for-Instructional-Services][Remuneration for Instructional Services]] , fifth year, for want of a nail: if anti-cheating parchment included a field for name of one's teacher. Pretty decent. Author /might/ be worth looking up too.

In case other variation of Harry has a job are welcome too, here's a few courtesy of [[/u/TheBlueMenace]]:

  Have you had a look at the Harry runs a cafe stories? There are a few, but the focus is never really the business (more relationships). I mean like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10867705/1/Starborn-Caf%C3%A9][Starborn Café]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]]. There are also stories where he has other stores, like a mechanics shop in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]].

*** None of the links that you posted, with the exception of the last two even remotely fit OP's request. They're looking for a travelling Harry that teaches during canon era, not whatever you've linked.

800-Rent-A-Hero almost would, with the exception that Harry is the Divination professor, rather than the DADA.
