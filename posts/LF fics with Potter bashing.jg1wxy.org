Yes I know its a washed out, overused and utterly unrealistic trope but it's also a guilty pleasure of mine to read about James and Lily “abandoning” Harry. Abandoning can mean: ignoring him in favor of his twin brother or straight up dropping him at the Dursleys. Wrong BWL, brother of the BWL etc. anything is welcome.

Please no Slash


** Well, this might not be exactly what you're looking for.

Linkffn(Strange Reflections by Lequin) has a Potter family from an alternate dimension end up in another slightly non-canon (and thus more realistic) dimension post-war. These Potters have taken "fame" lessons from Lockhart (except for the youngest sister).

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

**** Prince of Slytherin doesn't currently have pairings. Saving Connor is Drarry? Huh, never got that far. The only relationship Harry has been in in Den of Snakes is a brief relationship with Daphne. Btw it says book 5 of the Den of Snakes series has been orphaned, but the author continued it under a different pen name. I don't recall of the top of my head what it is but let me know and I'll got though my subscription to find it for you.
