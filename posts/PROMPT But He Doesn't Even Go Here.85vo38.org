So we all know those stories where Harry is put into the Triwizard cup under the name of another school, yeah?

Write a scene in which either the Head is informed, or the Head informs their student body, that Harry Potter is competing for their school in the Triwizard Tournament.

*Requirements:*

- 200+ words long.
- *PICK ONE*: *A)* Somebody telling the Head of an unrelated school that Harry is competing in the Triwizard Tournament for them *B)* the Head of an unrelated school announcing to their school that Harry will be competing in their name for the Triwizard Tournament.

*Bonus Points for:*

- having Harry show up to said school, already wearing their uniform, and really confused.
- somebody shouting "Field Trip!"
- a non-OOC Luna Lovegood somehow showing up there
- somebody freaking out about contradictory paperwork
- Harry accidentally assimilating into the foreign student body


** "Wait wait wait wait, this makes literally no fucking sense."

"I am truly sorry about this Madame Jones, but this is simply the way it must be. This is a great honor for your school!" Ludo Bagman told Mrs. Daisy Jones of Roosevelt High School. Mrs. Jones raised her finger and shushed the room and then rubbed her temples trying to massage out the horrendous amount of stress these British idiots had just caused her.

"So let's get this straight. For one, magic is real and you all have your own little special society?" She asked the entourage of Ludo Bagman, Barty Crouch, Albus Dumbledore, and other ministry officials.

Albus decided to talk first"Well that's one way of putting it, but its really-"

"No no, answer the question. Then i ask another. Very simple, kapish?" Mrs. Jones said with her principal tone.

Albus relented, "Yes."

"Second, some British boy at your school has been enrolled in a tournament under this specific suburban American non-magical high school as the school he represents."

"Yes."

"Well that about makes sense to me."

"Really? You're remarkably flexible about this!" Ludo exclaimed.

Mrs. Jones shot him a dirty look that would probably be felt by his posterity for generations. Mrs. Jones then leaned over and pressed on her intercom, "Mr. Tither, can you please send him in now?" And a few seconds later, Harry Potter walked in the door.

"Good lord! What are you wearing, Potter?" Ludo exclaimed. Harry looked at his "new" apparel and just gave a shrug, "I think it's called streetwear. When I randomly got transported here, some kids were nice enough to lend me some clothes. I think they call this "knock off Supremes and Yeezys". I don't know what it means but its quite lavacious if you ask me."

"Harry, my boy, have you been alright?" Dumbledore worryingly asked.

"Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm alright, it was weird here at first. But then Luna showed up and kind of showed me the ropes."

"Luna? As in Luna Lovegood?" Dumbledore asked incredulously.

"Yeah one in the same, funny thing happened really. She kind of just walked out of a random maintenance closet while I was stumbling around the school's hallways. Something about a magical portal door on the 5th floor at Hogwarts. But regardless, once she showed up she told me we'd be late to class if I didn't hurry and then I was in 7th period Geometry. Apparently she's been thinking that was the Arithmancy classroom for the past year. Really fascinating stuff to be honest, triangles are cool shit."

"That'll be a demerit for your language, Harry." Mrs. Jones admonished him. "And I do believe that you have 6th Period AP English in 5 minutes do you not?"

Harry sighed and headed out the door leaving a visibly stunned entourage of wizards. Dumbledore recovered first, "Actually we do need to take Mr. Potter back, he needs to be getting his magical education. Not that there's anything wrong with your curriculum of course."

"Not so fast Mister," Mrs Jones replied. "Since Mr. Potter is now 'magically' enrolled in my school we are now responsible for him. Do you really think we're just going to let a bunch of weird old dudes take away one of our students? Jesus Christ we'd be on CNN for the next few weeks about how we let some old pedophiles whisk away one of our students. So first you'll need to fill out the proper request forms in triplicate, cause god knows we've been needing to do that for forever. Then we'll get to how exactly you'll be paying for Mr. Potter's expenses if he goes to this 'tournament' and which chaperones he'll need to take. Cause lets be clear, the American taxpayers will not just be funding this out of goodwill. So let's get the State Department of Education on the phone and the teachers unions to work all this out. You all have a free week right?" A rather sinister grin filled Mrs. Jones face and in that moment Albus Dumbledore realized there may be more nefarious villains than Voldemort out there.

** This is really cool. I'd probably add considerations for language barriers for non-English speaking countries or dialect differences.
