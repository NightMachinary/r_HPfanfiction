Both Voldemort's and Quirrell's souls are merged in a way in Quirrell's body, So what happens when Voldemort takes the position of DADA professor and unknowingly the curse breaks. Next years are different as Quirrell has to die.


** So remus becomes the new permanent teacher? Lockhart being the attention "lover" he is would get in the same situation in second year, leading to third year and onwards being remus?

*** Well, Snape is still petty and angry at Remus for doing nothing while his best friends were bullying him, so his secret would still be released. I think it's more realistic for Moody to fight off Crouch and become the permanent DADA teacher.

**** True, but at that point it would end up with snape or umbrige as the DADA teacher. Moody is a paranoid S.O.B. he wouldn't stay very long in paranoia of the curse just to be sure he was safe.

****** Its fine don't worry. I forgot about the whole snape thing myself. Though maybe Dumbledore could force snape not to tell anyone about remus, i doubt Dumbledore could stop moody from leaving after having been fooled by barty jr. For the full year.

** Turns out there actually wasn't a curse, Albus is just really shit at hiring teachers.

** That means that he either breaks the curse by becoming the DADA teacher or falls victim to the curse because he doesn't “count” as Voldemort/Tom Riddle anymore.
