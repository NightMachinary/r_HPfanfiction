Are there any fics where this happens and changes the course of the story? Fenrir Greyback leads a pack of his followers through the Vanishing Cabinet (ala end-of-book-6), perhaps? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362319/14/Bolts-from-the-Blue][Bolts From The Blue has a semi-successful werewolf attack on Hogwarts]], while [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/77/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus has an attack on Hogwarts that isn't that successful]], but are there any where such an invasion is wildly-successful and infects a large portion of the student population? Possibly teachers too?
