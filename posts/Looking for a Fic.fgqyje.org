:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic many years ago, on FF.net, and my memories of it are very blurry but I remember there was a Polyjuice drip, where Polyjuice Potion goes into you through something like an IV so it doesn't wear off after an hour. Somebody used it to impersonate Dumbledore (I think) and get Harry at the Dursleys. I also remember Harry was kidnapped and put onto a cruise ship or something like that and he had to battle monsters? I can only remember him having to fight some furry monster (without magic) and he willed the nails to come out of wooden boards or something.

Sorry for the all over the place description. I really can't remember anything more about it. Some help would be very much appreciated!
