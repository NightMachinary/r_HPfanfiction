can anybody explain me how you can fancy this ship??!? There're 54 years difference between them! IT'S JUST SICK


** First of all, among all HPxLV/TMR stories, fics with huge age gap aren't even majority.

As for specificly those with an age gap, this relationiship usually is SUPPOSED to be unhealthy and sick. Often some obscure magic is involved (like soul magic).

Anyway, 'ship' doesn't always mean good relationships and fluffy feelings.

Fun fact: among numerous tags on ao3 for this ship there's also HP/LV/TR, which means that Voldemort and Tom two separete people and both are in relationship wih Harry.

** The first time we meet Voldemort in canon, he's a ghost, and it's not really clear how old he is. The second time, he's sixteen, and has essentially time-travelled from the nineteen forties. For fans who started reading before GoF, our clearest picture of Voldemort for a long time was a teenager that Harry-as-narrator finds handsome, who points out all the ways that he and Harry are similar.

The age gap of 54 years isn't necessary to the pairing. In addition to the canon age gap, the common senarios I've seen have been: Harry time-travels to Tom's school years; Tom time-travels to Harry's school years; Tom comes out of the diary, either in CoS as in canon, or later*; both are reincarnated to be the same age; both are born the same age for no reason; MoD Harry turns around at the train station in DH and decides to help the Voldemort-thing, either at 17 or after living a full and happy life with Ginny.

*I would love if someone wrote a fic where the events of CoS happen during Umbridge's reign of terror. I would love to see her blamed for it in the same way that Dumbledore was.

** I like Tom & Harry in time travel stories. I think everyone is capable of redemption and remorse.

Their power games and banter are really amusing. I like mature Harry.

I think Snape/Tom story would be really really interesting. Very rare. Does anyone know any good ones?

***** To answer both if your questions, obsession is debatable when it comes to Snape. Where in the books does it imply he is obsessed with Lily?

As far as l know, it doesn't even imply if he loved her romantically or like a sister. His doe patrons could have formed due to his feeling of guilt.

My opinion is, if she and her husband lived, he could have moved on with his life. If there was any kind of obsession, it would have been probably because of his regret and her early death.

This is what fans have divided opinions on. That is what theories and discussions here are for. Where some see obsession, others see loyalty and passion. It's a matter of view.

Time travel stories are different, any character could be of any age. Also, it could be a father/mentor/brother/friend relationship as well.

It would be so interesting if Snape or Harry adopt young Tom Riddle, or meet him as a Hogwarts student, or as a young adult after Albania... or if 38 year old Snape meets adult Tom.

** Voldemort being old isn't something that comes to mind when I think about his character, seeing as he's an immortal dark sorcerer and all. Similar to vampire love stories.

I love Tom Riddle as a character, and he completes Harry well with their similar backgrounds of being halfbloods raised by abusive muggles.

But what I love most when I read Tomarry fanfics are the mind games. Harry having to outwit the the ultimate Slytherin to survive.

What will Tom do in retaliation for Harry's defiance? Will he torture him? Or take it out on someone close to Harry? Or will he kiss him?

Does he actually care for Harry (in fanfiction), or will Harry go dark to be with him? How will Harry's loved ones react to their bond? There's so much to explore, plus Riddle is hot ❤️.

*** Exactly this!

For me a pairing intrigues me when there's so many ways it shouldn't happen. Authors have to get creative, there's lots of drama and the sprinkle of romance especially from a character no one expects it from is exciting!

I also love the mind games and banter and the power dynamic is very interesting becsuse in the ones I've read Harry begins to hold power over Voldemort too whether Voldemort intends for it or not. I like when they become equals of sorts.

Also yes Riddle is hot ❤️ The ones present time Voldemort ones that I read have him looking like an older version of Tom Riddle instead of the snake face monster so he's hot and powerful how can I resist that ❤️

*** yeah, he was hot when he was 17. But when Harry's a teenager Tom is about 70 years old and this is fucking creepy. It's like fucking a grandad while being a child.

** A large percentage of healthier Tomarry stories are same-age AU's either via time-travel or by having them in the same generation. More wholesome stories with the ship are Muggle AU's with essentially zero violence. The dynamics there are truly amusing to read. They play off and complement each other nicely. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these stories.

Stories with huge age gaps usually justify themselves with some kind of soul magic induced feelings which is close enough to the effects of a love potion: Voldemort finds himself to be magically and irrationally obsessed with Harry. The age gap feels irrelevant to the average reader because Voldemort almost never acts anything like his age, he barely feels human and Harry usually goes along due to a lack of options. Its like 1000 year old Arwen/Aragon in LOTR except a lot more toxic. Like the other post said, age or maturity is not a character that feels relevant to an immortal insane dark lord.

Then there are the third type of stories which try to make explicit relationships between a 60 yr old and a teenager look romantic. These are just plain disgusting and should be recognized for what they are. Nope out of them soon as you see them unless they treat the subject with the appropriate amount of horror or with a proper perspective and warnings.

*** In some ways i can see where you're coming from, but stil 54 years, that is way to large a gap in age in beings that aren't say, elves that live for literal millennia. Really I at least feel like Voldie just ends up as a pedo.

** I'm... fine with it. IF its well written. Wait, before you start hating, hear me out. Tom Riddle is an interesting character. An aloof sociopath, sure, but that makes him all the more interesting. Now, of course, the age difference. Well, yes, that would rather ruin the possibilities, since that is rather f*cked up. Obviously. On a related note, these fics are most often terribly written. HOWEVER: there are some fics, with time travel, either Harry re-doing his life, Harry travelling to Tom Riddle era, or whatever else, where it just sort of works. A great example of this would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282]]. This fic is named Xerosis, and is written by Batsutousai. It's about a Harry who went through all the canon stuff, but eventually the world was destroyed by muggles, and this f*cks Harry up. So he travels back, meets Voldie, and it is written rather well. Harry is actually older than Voldemort in this one. Sadly, there aren't many good fics like this. The only good one I ever found for teen!Harry and Voldemort was /Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness/, on wattpad ([[https://www.wattpad.com/story/179650625-harry-potter-and-the-descent-into-darkness]]). This, and the sequel, /Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness/ actually represent an interesting, realistic relationship between sane!Voldemort and Harry. The relationship stuff doesn't really even start until ch.24, and the chapters are LONG. There is smut, lemon, whatever you're going to call it included, but it is well written. I have never been able to stand the teen/kid Harry with Voldemort/Tom Riddle in any other fic though. Good Tomarry fics are really hard to find.
