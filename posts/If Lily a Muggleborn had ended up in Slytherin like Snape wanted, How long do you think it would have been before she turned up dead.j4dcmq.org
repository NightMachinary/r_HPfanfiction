If Lily has ended up In Slytherin I genuinely think she would have ended up dead. Or some the Dead eaters would have have killed her and her whole family over the Holidays.

How long do you think she would have lasted if she has Brought attention to herself as a Muggelborn in Slytherin During the first war?


** Lilly might survive school

but she might be a broken person due to how ruthless her fellow slytherins would bully her

** Hagrid in canon is puzzled why Voldemort never tried to recruit Lily (and I think JKR in an interview said in fact he did try). So maybe the Death Eaters weren't uniformly prejudiced against Muggleborns in the First War. They did recruit Snape - a half-blood who mixed with Muggles during his childhood.

*** If she accepted how long do you think it would have taken death eaters like Bellatrix to Kill her? or for her to have a accident.

I honestly don't think any such offer would have been in good faith.

and even if later offers were genuine they would have been from Lily reputation as a Talented witch, which she would not have had during her first few years at Hogwarts.

**** The whole "Blood Purist" ideology lie on a base of hypocrisy. Looking back far enough, absolutely every witch or wizard has some Muggle blood (according to Pottermore, one Malfoy even tried to court the queen Victoria), they just choose to ignore it. I mean, Voldemort talked about his own Muggle father in fron of the Death Eaters in GoF, and nobody even reacted to the news, not to mention the Half Blood Death Eaters (Snape, Pettigrew and maybe others).

The point is, if Lily had accepted Voldemort offert, and played her role well (kept knowing her place and never showing any Pro-Muggle sentiment), the other Blood Purist would probably have cooked up some "Squibb line" to justify her talent and make her "acceptable" in polite society.

Slytherin Lily would either had been crushed by others, or managed to strive in the "Snake Den" until she became powerful enough for others to ignore her inferior origins.

***** It was actually Queen Elizabeth I that the malfoy tries to court and the reason that was significant was because of the fact she swore not to marry they likely tried to marry into royalty a few times and were likely successful. The Malfoys and most rich pure bloods were objected to the statute of secrecy because they liked mixing with juggles because they could use there magic to get clout that's where most the Malfoys money came from their estate that they were gifted by William the Conqueror and then annexed off neighbours estates

** If she has enough self-preservation instinct as a sorting into Slytherin would suggest, she would probably have a close brush and then understand that for next year she should learn French over the summer and try to get into another school

** Knowing how outgoing she was, she would have attracted attention very early and would have died within her first year. Remember that when she was in school the war was raging and Voldemort was in power so death eaters had much more power.

** Looking at it that way I can kind of understand James hatred of Snape the first thing he see Snape going is, Trying to Trick a muggleborn into being sorted into Slytherin.Which would be a truly terrible thing to do to them even if Snape was doing it out of naivety rather than maliciousness James didn't know that.

** I personally think that she would've been just fine in Slytherin, especially once it's "discovered" that she's not just some random Muggleborn, but the long-lost heiress of some Squibbed out family from centuries past. Because how else would one explain her clear talent at the magical arts? /s

** I'm actually writing a self-insert where Ted Tonk's little sister is sorted into Slytherin. It was fun to think about what it would have been like and how it affected her character.

I had Lucius (via Voldy) attempting to kill her by October so she moved out of the dorms and into an abandoned room instead. She became a lot more cold hearted and brutal than she would have been otherwise because she had to be feared in order to survive. I think Lily might have some the same thing.

  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.
