I know it's probably come up before but wondering if we can collect some of this stuff all in one place. In my opinion the darker the better so don't worry about something being too dark for me!

Him owning Snape or hurting/controlling him in some way is a MASSIVE bonus - and come to think of it ANYTHING with Harry hurting, controlling or owning Snape would be fantastic. Underage is totally fine with me.

Thank you you beautiful people!


** ...Hello friend. May I suggest the Harry/Snape section of Adultfanfiction.net?

** walkingtheplank.org is a Harry/Snape fanfic site. Great archive, though it's not updated much anymore. AO3 also has a healthy assortment of Harry/Snape (around 2800 stories). That having been said, you should read "Ashes of Armageddon" by Emily Waters if you haven't already.

Oh! And LJ has a very active Snarryficfind community with about a hundred tags. Here's the URL for the slave!Snape tag: [[http://snarryficfind.livejournal.com/tag/slave!severus]] I'm positive you'll find something to your liking.
