I'm looking for a fic where Dudley talks to Harry about one or more of his kids being magical. He's uneasy about the whole thing, but he's particularly worried because of what he knows about the war & blood-purity discrimination.

Harry assures him that he'll look after them, that things are different & a lot more peaceful now, and maybe someone there says something like nobody would mess with the Head Auror's family. Not sure about that last part.


** linkffn(Uncle Harry) fits all of your description I think. Sequel to linkffn(Contractual Invalidation),

** Linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much by Casscade) is very good and may be what you are looking for. It is short and only 20k words, but the final scene with Petunia is incredibly well done.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552564/1/Dudley-s-Daughter][Dudley's Daughter]] by theinkwell33 is considered to be one of my favorite fics involving that premise. It is also a completed multi chapter fic so I think you might enjoy it.
