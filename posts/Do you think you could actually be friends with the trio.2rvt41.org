After reading a lot of self-insert stories (in prep to do my own) and seeing that everyone instantly befriends Harry, Hermione and Ron it has become pretty evident that people have to change the trio's personalities to squeeze themselves in.

This got me thinking "would I even like the trio if I met them in person?" my answer is largely no (more so when considering teenage me). I reckon while I could have a couple of intellectual conversions with Hermione about muggleborn things I don't think our personalities would match up and we would just endup arguing all the time. For Harry maybe 1st and 2nd year we might get on but I would probably get real tired of his hero hating bullshit 3rd year onwards (out of jealousy most likely).

Surprising myself I think the only person I would probably get on with throughout is Ron. He's not my favourite character but his humour and mine are pretty close and overall he's a less intimidating person to talk and relate to. If I was to befriend the trio it would probably be through a friendship with Ron.

What about you guys?


** Well, my perception would be colored by what I know about their future. If I just met them without knowing anything about their backgrounds and future fates from the books, I think I'd stay the hell away from Harry. Dangerous, unstable, angsty, constantly clutching his scar and muttering about Dark Lords, occasionally collapsing and having screaming fits, not a person I'd want to get close to.

** Probably not. I'd find Harry and Ron's athleticism and academic underachieving boring and uninteresting, and Hermione's straight-laced teacher's pet attitude obnoxious. At 11, I would have been friends with awkward loners and bully-magnets like Neville or Luna, because that's who I was too. By the time I graduated, I would have been with the most academic over-achievers in the most extracurriculars possible. Which is probably the only time I would have found myself in the same circles as Harry or Hermione, but not so much Ron. I'd still prefer to hang out with the nicest people possible, which means I'd probably be friends with people like Ginny or Neville, and stay away from the trio and their drama.

*** That hit home a bit. Looking back on my highschool years I hung out with a lot of the awkward outcasts (like I wasnt one of them lol). However is was mostly because I could look at them knowing I wasn't as bad as they were (which is terrible really) but I got some awesome, kind and slightly crazy friends out of it. So yeah 11-15 year old me would probably gravitate towards Neville. Luna would probably be too much though. I would probably feast on the trio drama though and would be why I would end up befriend Ron (get that insider story).

At best, I'd be some quiet person that got good grades nobody knew about. At worst, I'd probably be a swot like Zacharias Smith who was obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious, just because everyone else was enthralled by their every move.

If canon Malfoy is an accurate representation of what going to school with him would be like I doubt I could be even sorta friends with him unless I was either a pureblood or in Slytherin.

** I probably wouldn't at first, but I'd definitely try /hard/. Being friends with the people that have made saving their classmates from unspeakable evil a routine just sounds like common sense to me. That and, well, let's be honest here, they kinda need more contact with people outside of their little clique.

Which I would be happy to provide. Especially if it means punching assholes in the nuts and getting the low-down on Death Eaters vs Artillery-who wins?

The only downside is that I wouldn't last long at all in the magical world. It's one of the things that plagues me when considering whether to write an SI or not.

I currently evaluate my lifespan in canon HP at roughly twelve to eighteen months with it devolving to roughly fifteen seconds should I find myself face to face with the threat of the week. The large gap in estimates is largely due to several factors; starting point (muggleborn? Pureblood? Half-blood? They all have different benefits & drawbacks that make them attractive), funding and date of entry into Hogwarts would all contribute towards the length of time that I have at my disposal and/or the degree of effort I'd need to exert to endear myself with the trio.

For example, given that I was born in the mid-eighties, my entry point into the HP world, changing neither canon nor my age, would put me as a first year when the triwiz swings around. If I am a muggleborn, that effectively means that I have two and a half years to live before Umbridge sends me to the prison-turned-concentration-camp at Azkaban.

If I am in Slytherin to boot, my survival largely depends on what benefactors I can con into keeping me safe during the school year, otherwise I'll either have to pull a Riddle very /very/ quickly or I won't live to see Halloween.

This is the current me. My teenage self wouldn't survive the week in Slytherin.

But the biggest problem, and the reason for which I'd do my best to try and endear myself with the Trio and their support staff ASAP, is the vast amount of stuff Rowling had to gloss over in canon.

For example, what actually happens to muggleborn during their initiation tour? How extensive is the Ministry's surveillance net? What intelligence organizations in the muggle world have a foothold in the magical one-and don't tell me they don't exist, given just how extensive the SigInt agencies' powers were even during the eighties. What types of magical crime are there and to what degree do they prey on students and/or the muggleraised?

If you're an SI in a world as volatile as the HP one, your primary and overarching concern is survival. Righting wrongs and derailing plot points are secondary to your ability to come through such adventures with a beating heart and an optimal number of attached limbs. The Trio's friendship goes a long way towards taking care of that problem. Gaining intelligence and support from others does the same too. But, above all else, you /have/ to leverage what you learned prior to becoming an SI. For me, it's how modern businesses and computer systems work, a literally invaluable tool for making money when combined with magic. For others, it may be soldiering, martial arts, chemistry, maths, physics-hell, an electrician or a plumber could, with some creative application, turn the magical world upside down.

All these are good ways for an SI to survive.

And well, let's be honest. The Golden Trio is a bunch of teenagers who end up out of their depth so often they need scuba diving equipment. The farther along the timeline the SI appears, the harder it will be for them to make friends. And their personalities aside, it's their history and mutual reliance on each other that makes them so damn hard to befriend. However, should your SI prove itself capable enough and stubborn enough, then he or she has a decent chance of not-dying, though surviving the experience as a fully functional human being until the end of it is still not a given.

Because the Trio /never/ gave up on their friends.

Hermione... I think I'd appreciate her intellect. But her bossiness, pushiness, and authority worship I couldn't stand.I could deal with the last one, but the first too... not so much.

Ron... No. I don't think so. He's just too jealous, not smart, lazy, obsessed with a sport I strongly dislike, etc.

Harry... I'd like to say yes, but I'm pretty certain his self-sacrificing hero complex would get to me sooner or later. Probably by the end of first year.

** I'd probably have been sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, which would have given me little opportunity to befriend the trio.

Hermione and I would have butted heads terribly. I was very much a "quietly shatter the curve" student in the day, never feeling the need to rub other people's faces in my competence--right up until they pissed me off (as her antics would have, inevitably). I never had any patience for flashy, know-it-all personalities and probably would have made it my mission to crush her academically (which I would have, and which she wouldn't have been able to accept).

Ron and I would have been cool. We could have bonded over chess (a passion of mine in the day) and dislike for Hermione's overbearing nattering. He was generally pretty laid back, aside from a few teenage moments, which we could have overlooked. I think we would have gotten on fine. His twin brothers would have pissed me off though (I hate bullying).

Harry probably wouldn't have been more than an acquaintance. He seemed a classic introvert who didn't seek to connect with those outside a fairly narrow circle and I didn't have it in me then to befriend those who didn't care.

Incidentally, I dated someone as vain and vapid as Lavender for about three years (she even matched Lav's physical descriptions), showing that for teens there's no accounting for taste once the relationship progresses to a point where it's sufficiently physical.

** I think a lot of +who I am+ how I look at the world would lose a lot of meaning if I found myself in a world where magic was +real+ demonstrably and obviously real, so who's to say, but given my experiences in high school I'd probably be that Ravenclaw who is on friendly terms with /almost/ everyone but mostly keeps to a small group of people who all play... well whatever wizards do for fun when DnD becomes real life.

If I fall in knowing what I know now, I'd be super paranoid about ruining everything and may decide to avoid them. Not to mention being friends with 11 year-old kids at my age is mostly an exercise in exasperated patience. If it was me as an eleven year old, or knowing nothing of whats to come, I'd probably only vaguely be aware of the trio's existence in the "oh those guys that flew the car into the tree! I played chess with the red head a few times over hols" sort of way.

Hermione and I would either get along or not depending on how well she took to being wound up so I could watch the fireworks. I poke fun at everything.

**** Well, there's the obvious point that at present I view 'magic' as applied misdirection and subterfuge. There is no real magic, and anything that appears to be such is simply something I haven't figured out yet or that I'm not seeing the whole of. This mentality breaks down rather rapidly when magic IS real and is in fact the simplest explanation for a lot of things. It's like being an atheist in DnD, taking the viewpoint that there is no God(s) makes far less sense when you can actually go talk to one and get tangible responses. Removing that foundation from my world at 11 would produce a very different me.

Also, HOLY &^{/%&/^{%!!!}} I CAN DO MAGIC!? I'm not sure that /people/ would register as relevant to me after that discovery. <edit> ...Though it occurs to me that I might bond with any of the muggleborn (which would include possibly Hermione) over trying to SCIENCE ALL THE MAGICS!

** To be honest, I probably would get along with them...even if we weren't good friends. I'm a really easy going and cheerful person, and I rarely ever get into arguments. Probably the best part of my personality. I'm a Gryffindor with strong Hufflepuff characteristics.

Whether I would particularly ENJOY that friendship is another question. I make it a point to be nice and friendly to everyone, and because I'm a good listener (I work in the field of psychology), the relationships always tend to be a little one-sided against me. I can imagine that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would only hang out with me when they were mad at each other and needed to rant. And stupid me would just sit there and listen and smile until they were ready to go back to their real friends. If I had to pick someone from the trio to hang out with, it'd probably be Ron for his humor (closely followed by Harry's self-deprecating humor). I don't think I would like Hermione very much, but I would never say it to her face of course.

Unless I were to write a dramatic romance story (my husband is an obvious Slytherin), I don't think I would make a very interesting character to insert into the world of Harry Potter. Maybe a strong minor character.

** I'm going to assume I'd go to Gryffindor since, honestly, that's probably where I would actually go. Gives me a much better start off, no matter what I'll at least be a casual acquaintance to them all.

Seeing a lot of Ron hate on here and I don't know why. Ron would probably be the easiest to become friends with for me. He's a very normal kid, likes Quidditch which I would probably play since I'm an athletic guy and there aren't exactly other choices, (but no getting on the House team until fourth or fifth year because the whole team is stacked to all hell unless I'm some Chaser prodigy), and is pretty laid back if you are a casual friend (basically unless you're Harry and Hermoine you don't really see him blow up or do the really stupid shit much).

Friend rating: Bro

Hermoine I'd probably just kind of coexist with. I'm pretty book smart but not nearly dedicated enough to really jive well with her or suffer through being her study buddy. Probably get along alright with being the only Gryffindor to understand some of what she's talking about, but nothing more than a class/housemate. I'd beat the shit out of her in History of Magic though which might tick her off.

Friend rating: Friendly Acquaintance - Friendly Rivalry

Harry: Unless some freak accident pushed us into becoming friends by circumstance early on I'd probably barely know him (which is exactly what happened with my actual best friend so it could happen). Probably would think he's just an alright quiet kid until he starts winning House Cups and speaking Parseltongue and shit. Might try to get to know him better once I realized that he was one of those people that shit revolved around.

Friend rating: Acquaintance - Sorta Friend

Now overall within I'd probably get along really well with Lee Jordan and the Weasely twins, probably not good friends until the later years though. I'd probably beg Wood relentlessly for a spot on the team and annoy the shit out of him. I'd get along best with the more fun Ravenclaws. I'd probably be on okay terms with most of the Puffs, Slytherins depend on if we're going canon or realistic, canon = ignoring some of them and fucking enemies to the death with a few, realistic = probably good friends with one or two, ignore the rest

More likely to be best friends with Neville, if I'm placed with the trio, or a complete loner, if I'm put in Slytherin like I want to be. I think it would be awesome to have Hermione spewing off random facts about magic all day, as long as I didn't have to be there when she told me I couldn't try to break Gamp's Law just because it's called a law and the book says. She'd be great for motivation to study, though. I really hated canon Harry, and I was never fond of Ron, either. Would totally idolise Draco for being pretty, though.

The trio has a very "fire-forged" friendship that would be hard to get into without extreme events. I think I'd feel isolated if they were always hiding secrets from me and I hate feeling left out.

At 11 I was really smart (but didnt realize it, so I didnt have the cocky attitude I later developed), very nice and generally wanted to be friends with everyone. I always had plenty of friends, but no one "best friend". I was probably like a female Neville, only I didn't have the problems in class.

** no as I would be in slytherin, hermione's personality is something I really hate. ron sees the world as black and white and harry is an heir of an ancient house but somehow dresses like a tramp. as image is important for me i would definitly be friends with malfoy and zabini.
