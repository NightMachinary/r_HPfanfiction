It doesn't have to be forever, but it'd be nice if it was. Doesn't have to be the main thing, can be a minor thing.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New.

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry's fame and fortune for money and fame, cliche. No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc

Something like the little ficlet here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kxursa/after_yet_another_request_for_new_school_brooms/]]

Really made me crave some more of that type of thing. Doesn't have to be an auction or fundraiser (can be), can be anything though.


** Yeah i also saw that one and i am craving more student unity stories :) hope you het some recs. One you might like is 'the changeling' by Annerb on ffnet but it will be a while before it happens. It is a slytherin!Ginny story so when it gets bad in the school she gets some slytherins to help the DA (Just het Friends tho, not everyone) against the carrows and stuff. It is one of my fave fics. But it is not just a happy read or something

** The closest thing I can think of is the fic where Draco becomes a Marxist martyr and the school bands together against Umbridge.
