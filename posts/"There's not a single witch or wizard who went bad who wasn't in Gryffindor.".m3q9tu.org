** In a recursive fanfic off of HPMOR (which yes, I know that inspires no confidence), Slytherin dark lords are more common but less dangerous than other dark lords, because all you have to do to stop a Slytherin dark lord is change their incentives so it's in their best interest to be nice, whereas:

- Gryffindor dark lords are convinced they're doing the right thing and will fight through any amount of adversity to achieve their goals
- Hufflepuff dark lords believe in persevering through adversity as inherently valuable, so you trying to oppose them will just make them try harder
- Ravenclaw dark lords want to know something that can only be learned by doing evil, and you can't be in a position to offer them that knowledge without being just as bad as they are.

**** Canonically yes. The Blitz was between 7 September 1940 -- 11 May 1941.

Children were being removed from London from September 1939 which would have been between Riddle's first and second year. The blitz started as Riddle began his 3rd year.

Please note I am not a historian.

In timeline.

Year 1 - September 1938: Riddle starts Hogwarts. He escapes his Orphanage for his first year and find a wondrous place. He then presumably returns to London in June. Riddle despises the orphanage and in living in a city ramping up in fear as war is declared and preparations are made to start children shipping out.

Year 2 - September 1939: Riddle returns to Hogwarts and a placement in the countryside is not needed for him. Riddle becomes an odd case. He has a school in the countryside but the school returns him in June after the end of the Blitz. (But London residents wont know if the bombing will start again). This is a problem. Why has a child been returned when the entire country is getting children out of London - Do note that children did start to return. Perhaps the orphanage assumes bad behavior and treat him accordingly.

Year 3 - September 1940: Riddle and the orphanage staff are probably relived to have Riddle out of London. The Battle of Britain has started. Depending on what historian you listen to this phase of the war finished May/June 1941. About the same time Riddle would be returning. The Orphanage would again be frustrated that a child has been brought back to an area of greater danger and another mouth to feed. Would they suspect poor behavior on Riddle's part?

Year 4 - September 1941: Riddle returns. Japan have just bombed Pearl Harbor, the US has entered the war. I can imagine that London is safer. But being 14 years old. Riddle is probably more aware of the stress and rationing going on around him.

Year 5 - September 1942: The war is going better. This is the year that Riddle releases the basilisk. In June 1943 as the year finishes he asks to stay behind. In terms of the war, it was an odd time to ask to stay. Probably the safest Riddle could be in London. Rationing would of been occurring.

Year 6 - September 1943: Would have been as per the previous year. But V rockets would have started bombing from May/June 1944 in the SE of England.

Year 7 - September 1944: Riddles final year starts per above and then is concluded just before the end of ww2.

â€‹

I would have been asking to stay every year.
