I feel that Rolf Scamander is a rich source of fan fiction material. We know he ends up marrying Luna, that he is the grandson of famous author Newt Scamander and an American witch Porpentina Goldstein and that he is a magizoolgist. He isn't really popular in fan fiction but maybe that will change once the movies about his grandfather come out. We really don't know that much else about him and I feel that he is rife for exploration. He doesn't even need to be british, as though Newt Scamander currently lives in Britain during his retirement, Newt might have decided to raise his children in the land of his wife and as a result, his grandchildren grew up American. It would explain why we never saw him at Hogwarts. On the other hand, maybe he's a lot older than Luna or a lot younger. Personally, I'm writing a fan fiction where Rolf and Luna travel back in time and Rolf is far apart in age that it makes it incredibly awkward to date a ten year old girl but close enough that Luna as a twenty-one year old can acceptably date him. What head cannons do you have on Rolf? What good fan fictions show Rolf in some prominence?

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin is sixteen and his hopeless crush on Victoire has sent him into an epic sulk. As a distraction from his romantic angst, Luna invites him to tag along on an international expedition to catalog the mysterious and magical jackalope. Together they cross the sea, travel through the Arizona desert, and encounter new people and legendary creatures, and along the way, Teddy deals with his past - the parents he lost, and the things he would have liked to know about them - with help from an unexpected direction. He also discovers that perhaps there are girls out there who are much scarier than Victoire, but that even they are not so very difficult to talk to...A Teddy-centric fic, with a romantic b-plot about the courtship of Luna and Rolf, and lots of Remus/Tonks allusions.
