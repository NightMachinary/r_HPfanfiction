I can't find any fics where Ron goes back in time for a do-over. Please help my craving.


** The cost of time travel, linkffn(6905950) Probably the only Ron Peggy Sue fic on FFN.

Mein Teil, linkffn(3224489), which is a HP x Buffy crossover where Ron and Faith are the Peggy Sues.

Three's the Charm, linkffn(8326928), Trio Peggy Sue. There's not a lot of drama, and it's rather nice and clean. Where everything is going exactly as planned, so it's not exciting. But it's still a decent read simply because Trio Peggy Sues don't really exist.

linkffn(backwards with purpose) Harry, Ron, Ginny Peggy Sue fic, you've probably read this one.

  It was supposed to be easy. Just a simple trip back to the past for Ron and Faith to stop Voldemort before he became too much of a problem. Too bad nothing is as simple as it seems. BTVSHP

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.

*** Just a warning with the cost of time travel it's more than likely abandoned and didn't really get anywhere interesting in the chapters that were released

** I really want to read a fic based on that old 'Ron is a Time Travelling Dumbledore' Theory. The only one I know of is linkffn(Game of Chess replayed by Quills and Muses), which just started up and has only the prologue written.

There is a bit of awkward phrasing in this, but the story has potential. Swamp the author with hits and reviews so that he may be persuaded to continue this.

  Being the Knight to kill the white Queen was not enough to checkmate the King. The game replayed, Ronald Weasley plays, not only the role of the Knight, but also that of a King. Based on Ronbledore Theory Rated T
