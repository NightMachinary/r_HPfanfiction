I've rarely seen this approach, there's plenty of Black family fics but not much about the Potters. I'd like to see a fic where some great aunt or uncle takes Harry in. Or perhaps an indy Harry who actually reads some of the books in his family vault, and learns about his family. I've only seen three fics involving a Potter family grimoire, that would be my ideal story, but anything similar is welcome.


** Try linkffn(The Power of the Potters by Rockill)

Think that's the author's spelling.

#+begin_quote
  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings.

** linkffn(Strong Blood by CooLibrarian) ... I am big ambivalent about this story, but it has certainly very strong part in having Evans' family story going back to the 1920s (if I am not mistaken).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
