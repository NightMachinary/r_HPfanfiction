Besides, it was about time that bloody ghoul in attic was useful for something. A few well placed confundus charms and those nasty muggles won't know the difference.


** I adore this. I absolutely adore this.

After all, she'd been dealing with Fred and George for a while now - she had to have developed her internal Sneakoscope most only refer to in reverent whispers: The Mum Sense.

"Please, repeat what you've just told me Fred, George." They did.\\
/They did not lie./

Molly Weasley moved as if in a trance. Bustling about the kitchen, talking about the mundane topics as they came up during dinner, taking care of the housework. If Arthur noticed she seemed a bit absent, he knew not to disturb her.

/Fred and George didn't lie./

Molly knew to trust her well-honed instincts. They told her the truth. About the cat flap. About the bars in the window. About the lack of food... But like most of the complex problems, this one too had a simple solution.

The house did feel a bit empty since Bill had moved out...

*** Likewise.

I may write a chapter or two of this to drop into my 'ideas' folder. See how it flows. Probably start with Molly puzzling over things in a chapter, talking to Arthur and the kids and asking questions, and maybe pick up with Harry's POV after Chamber of Secrets when Molly drags him home.

Make it a little cracky. It's canon that they made the ghoul look a bit like Ron at one point. Improve it a bit and have Ghoul!Harry act sick at Privet Drive. The Dursleys would lock him in and that'd be fine. :)

**** link!ffn(Like a Read Headed Stepchild) Harry is born ginger and gets confused for a Weasley when entering the Wizarding World, and ends up absorbed into the family during PS; after the year ends he ends up informally adopted by the parents after they meet the Dursley's.
