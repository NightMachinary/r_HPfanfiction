I'm not completely sure this is the right place to post this, but why not? I have pretty awesome lucid dreams and have for a very long time now. What I'm placing here is an idea I had in one a rather long time ago that I never developed any farther; just to let people that may use it have it. Reply to develop on it; if you'd like, or let me know if you're going to use it. These all come from one dream; though I've kept the mentioned jetpack since (at least one of my dream characters that I revisit in multiple dreams has).

- It's common practice in the US for buildings to be 'missing' floors, because of superstition, most commonly the 13th. These floors actually exist, just stairs and elevator don't exist there; you have to fly to an external door to access them.
- In the city of Boston, many of these hidden floors make up a higher education center for wizards; where many wizard and muggle researchers work together in the creation and combination of muggle technology and magical artifacts to create more powerful and useful devices than magic or technology could alone.
- In the dream the location was called 'Massachusetts Institute of Magic' or MIM; but being an obvious pun on MIT might not be a good choice.
- In the dream it was further explained to me that in Europe, no technologies newer than early film cameras were accepted into the magical community and their culture had largely frozen in a pre-1900 period, because of a combination of wars and complete separation from muggles. (Sparked by the prejudice of Grindelwald, et. all). But in the Americas, though keeping magic a secret, except from the trusted; it'd never gotten to any kind of self-segregation. This lead into a culture of technology and magic being developed together.
- Similarly traditions, such as conical hats, brooms and even wands were mostly cast aside; with importance shifting to other magic materials and artifacts. Very new age vs. Old age.
- In this I was shown several technologies. My dream avatar kept from these only a jetpack, which burned oxygen for a controlled flight. The amount of oxygen in it could hold was enhanced via an Undetectable Extension Charm and magically reinforced (so the tanks wouldn't explode if hit with powerful magic or muggle weapons). The original muggle version of the device could fly just as well as the enhanced version, but would explode from any major impact on the oxygen tanks and only held enough oxygen fuel to fly for about 5 minutes; compared to the near-infinite offered by the enhanced version.
- From then on, my dream avatar used the jetpack to fly instead of his ability to summon geysers and using the water. (An ability I'd had in dreams since 1999). Along with his other geomancy abilities, which were not related to HP at all. [Not that that's relevant, just a funny part of that dream.]
- This is offered as world-building for anyone that wants to use it. As the mentions of the original series are minimal, it may even be legal to sell without copyright permission, unsure.

I may use this someday; but I'm no longer keeping it a big secret until I get around to it. If someone wants it...sure, why not?


** I love the idea is of missing floors of buildings being used. I may try to blend that in to something I'm working on! Awesome!
