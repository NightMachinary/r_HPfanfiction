Are there any /non-dystopic/ AU fictions in which the statute of secrecy is dead in which there is wizarding-muggle collaboration?

Possibly since earlyer than the 20th century. Either the Statute never existed or it has failed somehow , i would like more the former compared to the latter.

*No HPMOR spinoffs/meta-fics please* , I arleadly have read those.

If you had such a setting, it'd probably be radically different; what lots of people tend to forget is that there are tons of races in the Harry Potter series with intelligence on par with that of humans, just that many of them are few in number and hidden under the Statute of Secrecy.

In Harry Potter canon and fanfiction, wizards are typically at the top of the food chain, giving only themselves the right to govern and use wands, and marginalizing or exterminating the rest.

A story with no Statute of Secrecy would naturally have to change that; having a story with wizarding humans on top as usual would likely conflict with your 'no-dystopia' qualifier, so the alternative is having all these dozens of magical and non-magical races integrated with humans, high fantasy style. Unless, say, you had one world with normal humans (ours), and all these magical races and magical humans coming from an alternate-dimension.

In any case, though, it'd change the setting of the series dramatically, unless there was a Statute of Secrecy that was only broken very recently.

The thing is about Harry Potter, the setting is 'our world, but magic has been doing this and this and that in the background'. If you remove the Statute of Secrecy and let all magic mingle with normal humans, that basic setting assumption is broken in half and absolutely anything could happen.

Except, to argue against myself, would human history as it is in real life, really be so different if some groups of humans were instead some other race? And up until the development of education and widespread communication in the last few centuries, would the occasional charm or curse really change things that much?

Really, you could probably have the Vikings be giants, the Incas be elves, Greek centaurs and minotaurs, goblins in Europe...and certain events like the storm that wrecked the Spanish fleet and certain plagues could be passed off as major acts of magic.

Okay, I'll stop rambling now.

** You could have the Statute of Secrecy broken in 20th Century very easily. Just have JFK be a wizard who became President to reveal wizards to the world. The Macusa had him assassinated to keep magic secret. The Macusa doesn't care about trial by jury for a crime carrying the death penalty. Carlotta Pinkstone was sent to Azkaban to be tortured by dementors. Why would the Wizarding World hesitate to assassinate a President. Of course, there must be some center of opposition to the Statute somewhere separate from the Pureblood opposition to secrecy.
