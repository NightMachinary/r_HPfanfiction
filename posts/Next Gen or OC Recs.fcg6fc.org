So I Just finished reading the Albus Potter Series by NoahPhantom (thanks for the recommendation!!!), but now i'm looking for something new. I really like next gen fics, and was considering maybe even trying out an OC fic if anyone has any good ones in mind! I prefer longer fics or even another series, but I really really would prefer it to be finished! Thanks!

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Happy to recommend the Its TeaTime series by frombluetored. While it follows canon pairings, it follows on from CC, and Scorbus is the main pairing in the first two fics. But the second story is set at Hogwarts and features some great OC's as their school mates, and follow on to the third story in the series, currently a WIP. I also like the Quietly series by starlightpeddler, also Scorbus main pairing with some great OC's. And floreatcastellum is currently writing Wood for the Trees, with James SP and an OC as the main pairing, and you know she is a great writer so worth checking out. Hope these are what you may be looking for
