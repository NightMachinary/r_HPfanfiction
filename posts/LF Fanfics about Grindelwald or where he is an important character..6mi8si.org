** "The Things We Lost" linkffn(11463306) is a favorite of mine by this writer. They have a number of other Gellert and Albus stories as well. "Skyfall" linkffn(11942828) and its companion "Kingdom Come" linkffn(12011914) are also pretty good.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.
