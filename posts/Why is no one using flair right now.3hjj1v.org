I feel like for a while everyone was using the link flair but now it seems no one is. Thoughts?


** It probably doesn't help that there's no information in the side bar as to how to apply flairs to posts. I was under the impression that only mods can add the flairs. I've experimented in the past and I know that using square brackets (e.g. [Discussion]) doesn't do anything.

*** When you've posted your post you click [[http://imgur.com/3t0TRuT][where I've circled]] and pick from a list which flair you want. Easy as that.

**** The css in [[/r/smashbros]] makes that button appear bold, about 300px wide and gives it a yellow colored background. It's right in your face when it shows your post after submitting, maybe the mods here could add something similar?

***** That's a good idea, I'll look into making the flair button stand out.

** A lot of people don't bother to flair their own post so it falls to the mods to do it for them, clearly there are no mods around tonight.

*** Yeah. I end up doing most of it and I was busy last night. I'm going to tweak the CSS to make the flair button stand out as apparently some people don't even know they can do it themselves.

**** Could you activate AutoModerator to just flair posts that contain tags like [this]? You could also look for "LF" to tag requests, and maybe some others.

***** Possibly. I haven't looked into AutoModerator much because it seemed like overkill for sub this size.

** Is there a way to apply flair before posting? To my understanding you have to write up the post, submit it and then add the flair. I usually just forget to go back and add flair once I've posted.

** If there was a way to do it from the Reddit Sync app, I would. As it is I just don't create topics often.
