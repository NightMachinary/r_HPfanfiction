#+begin_quote
  Scorpius isn't on the Hogwarts Express at the start of seventh year, and Albus discovers that he's become very ill over the summer. Determined to find out what's wrong with him and how to make him better, Albus starts doing some research, and discovers Moramortia, a fatal illness with just one cure. Together, Albus and Scorpius (with some help from Rose) set out on an adventure to find the ingredients to make the potion that will hopefully save Scorpius's life...

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. RW/SM. "drama, angst, love, happiness, action and brilliant story telling" - reviewer (Complete!)

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Lmao I also read Velkin's series. The Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom is the natural next rec. it follows the squad all 7 years (I'm pretty sure). [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/NoahPhantom]]

After you finish that, the Stygian Trilogy by Slide is hella good. Romance is more present in this. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/438892]])

Also, from what I recall, some older guy wrote a fanfic “the James Potter” series. It's passably interesting and not housed on ao3 or ffn. Only warning is that it has A LOT of ocs.

  Five years since the Thorn Wars. Five years of peace, five years of rebuilding. But the people they left behind are never truly gone, and past deeds echo louder than mere nightmares. The hardest part of fighting for a new world is finding your place in it.
