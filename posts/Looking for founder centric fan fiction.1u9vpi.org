I've been looking for awhile for a story that is just about the founders and someone going more in-depth about a potential founding of hogwarts and the 4 guys/gals history. Would prefer if there was no time travel business and all that. So have you guys seen anything like that that is good?


** Legendary by Katie4493 was an awesome founder fic, it was really different and challenged my perceptions of how i thought the founders should be, I loved it. I read it on HPFF, i'm not sure if its posted on another site.
