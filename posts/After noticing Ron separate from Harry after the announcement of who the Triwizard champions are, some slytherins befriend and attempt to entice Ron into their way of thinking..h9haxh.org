** Oooh, a twist! Ron never hated Slytherins in canon. He didn't like them and hated Malfoy in particular, but /hate/? No.

Plus, his paternal grandmother is from Slytherin.

** As much as I would love to see a realistic portrayal of Ron as a bad guy, this one is too tough for me to consider. Unless it is a oneshot where Ron essentially tells the Slytherins to fuck off, any author writing it would have a ton of work to do explaining why the most anti-Slytherin member of an anti-Slytherin family would be willing to join up with a "bunch'a snakes", no matter how PO'd he was at Harry.

*** Ron Weasley completely hating all these "Slimy Snakes from Slytherin" comes from Fanon. In Canon, Ron is pretty neutral toward the house (as in "could not care less about them"), and is probably the member of the Trio who would get along the best with them (while Harry is the one showing the most anti Slytherin sentiment, even if it's because "they dislike him cause he keeps beating them at Quidditch").

In the books, Ron only shows a big dislike toward Malfoy (which is justified) as well as his cronies, and does not believe in blood purity (which is supposed to come from Salazar Slytherin himself), but never talked about the other members of the House. Even the "all the wizards who turned bad came from Slytherin) originaly comes from Hagrid and has been given to Ron in the movies (because reasons?).

Also, according to the "Black Familly Tree", Ron's grandmother is Cedrella Black (blasted from the familly tree for marrying Septimus Weasley). Since all the Blacks (with the exception of Sirius) seem to have gone to Slytherin, it would be really stupid for Ron to hate the House where his own grandmother came from.

*** On the flip side, I'm struggling to come up with a reason why the Slytherin(s) would go for Ron, particularly one that has nothing to do with Harry. You have to stick with canon at the beginning here and his claim to fame is Harry Potter's best friend. Ron's not going to take kindly to being asked a bunch of Harry Potter related questions by anyone at that point.

Also, while I agree Ron doesn't hate all Slytherins, the Weasleys are anti-Slytherin enough for Ron to think his parents, Cedrella's son included, would be disappointed if he landed there.

And as far as I can remember, Ron interacts with 3 Slytherins for most of his 6 yrs. Of course he's going to /appear/ less anti-Slytherin than Hermione, who is bullied by a gang of girls + Malfoy, and Harry, who has to deal with Malfoy, Snape, and an entire Quidditch team, but I don't think those two are anymore anti-Slytherin than Ron is.

**** While I mostly agree here, there's one thing that confuses me: besides disliking Slytherin because of Malfoy and Snape (understandable), why would Harry dislike Slytherin by virtue of having to face them in Quidditch? That's like saying he dislike Hufflepuff because of the same reason (and he actually got along with Cedric, despite being very much a Quidditch rival whenever applicable).

***** There's a line in one of the books saying one of them, maybe Bletchley, cursed Angelina, or maybe Alicia, and I doubt that's an isolated incident. There's also the stunt Flint, Draco, etc. pull in 3rd year. Slytherins are also far more aggressive on the field than everyone else.

***** Real reason is because he needed villains.
