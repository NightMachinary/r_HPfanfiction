Looking for fics similar to Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues]] . I like the style and the content and would be interested in anything with a similar style or plot type. I really enjoy the whole spy thing and it doesn't need to be Harry as the spy.


** Hey, finally a reason for me to stop lurking and create an account!

I dunno about other fics, since most of what ended up creating MB was pop culture references to movies and novels and music, even. The entire point was to create a seamlessly believable fic where Harry and Hermione still remained tethered to the muggle world (which is one of the reasons why Harry prefers football to Quidditch, a sentiment I'm sure the canon Harry wouldn't). But the fic also had to simultaneously allow Harry and Ron to get up in all the shit that they do alongside that. Which I'm sure I cop certain amount of (probably deserved) flak for, since I do realize it comes off as a bit /too/ muggle for some people's tastes.

The closest I can think of is maybe Gryffindors Never Die for Ron and Harry's bromance, but other than that, I'm drawing a pretty big blank on other fics.

If you want original media, and not fics, I've got a lot for you: Guy Ritchie movies (Lock Stock and Snatch in particular), The Big Lebowski, John Le Carré novels, *lots* of Metal Gear (seriously, half of the fic is an extended reference to Metal Gear), and Bond films, particularly the more campy Connery/Moore ones than the realistic Craig ones.

*** Haha wow. I actually love the muggle influence on Harry. Also the references are fantastic. I'm really into the whole spy thing recently. Possibly because Archer and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are on loop in my dorm room. Excellent writing honestly. Although as an Arsenal fan I find Harry's allegiance most disturbing ;) . I'll check out the Gryffindors Never Die thank you!

**** At least he's not a Spud!

But seriously, I couldn't deal with a Harry that's a United or Chelsea supporter, either of which everyone who bothers talking about football makes him. But especially United. Fuck United.

***** You do know that “who” and “whom” are not synonyms, right? I mean they're not not synonyms. You can use “who” whenever you should use “whom” and it's going to be fine. Very much not vice versa, however. You have to do a find and replace, because otherwise your story is unreadable.

Really well written apart from that, but your subjects and objects need figuring out.

****** Yeah, as I've learned over the past year, there's a very good reason I wasn't an English major. I've totally scrapped the who vs. whom stuff as the fic's gone on but any typos in earlier chapters are a product of both my idiocy and my laziness to go back and change it. I really should get around to cleaning it up, there are definitely some messy parts in earlier chapters both grammar and plot-wise that could use some tinkering.

******* You've got the whole first person narrative, which gives you some leeway, but yeah, going over your story would't hurt. It really doesn't have to be perfect, but there are a bunch of mistakes that make your narrator sound a bit daft.

Seriously, start with that find and replace. I did that from chapter six or so onward and that made it instantly readable. You have a way with words -- not so much if they're pronouns. Also, Harry/Hermione all the way. Obviously they're both bonkers but how would waiting for years help at all?

******** Sorry I'm so late with a reply, but I've been fixing up the who vs. whom stuff with find and replace and am now going more thoroughly each chapter for revisions.

As for Harry and Hermione, I don't think there's much question that Harry is totally deluding himself into thinking he's not at the very least attracted Hermione. That being said, I don't think Harry would jump into a relationship beyond casual sex and feel comfortable (he tried and failed with Ginny) after the whole Hannah fiasco and Hermione is already seeing someone, unimportant as the dude is, though that's mostly due to the fact that the story is told from Harry's perspective.

**** Yes I definitely liked it. Emperor by Marquis Black (I think) is supposed to be similar, but I never read it. Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution is somewhat similar with the war elements and gritty imagery. But honestly, I don't think any fic is really comparable. I've never seen a fic that seamlessly combines a perfectly canon Hermione with Harry and Ron from Gryffindors Never Die. It's such a perfect combination of different kinds of drama: crime, family, politics, and humor. Even the fact that plays straight several tropes especially those related to the Big Bad adds to the story because you know there's more to come. There are some places where you can definitely see where the author stopped writing for an abnormally extended time and due to the time jumps it does get a bit confusing, but overall it doesn't take much away from the story. I hope the author makes it to the end.
