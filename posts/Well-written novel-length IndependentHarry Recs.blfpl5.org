This has probably been posted about many times before but I have to head in to work and yet have a sudden burning desire to read an independent!Harry fic.

I'm looking for something well-written but I'm still open to some of those classic cheesy tropes (help from Goblins, powerful inheritance, etc.). In terms of length, at minimum +60k words but ideally longer though maybe not like 800k because I don't have time for that atm.

Honestly though I'm open to anything as long as it's well written. That said, I've read a LOT so if you can think of any fics you think are underrated or not widespread definitely rec those!


** You read, Under the Cupboard series by Stargon1 (I believe)?
