As the title says, almost all the Wrong Boy who Lived Stories out there are about Harry's brother being the real boy who lived. I need a story where Harry actually is the Boy who Lived, hopefully with some delicious karma for his brother when the truth is revealed.


** Wait... has it changed? I remembered that it is the other way around, that harry is almost always the BWL.

*** You're right.

I've never seen a WBWL that wasn't [/someone else/] thought to be BWL and it turns out that it's really Harry (hence the "wrong").

Otherwise, it's not "Wrong Boy Who Lived," it's just "Boy Who Lived But Isn't Harry Potter."

**** I swear lately I've only seen ones where Harry wasn't the boy who lived, and I've seen none that have the payoff of Harry being revealed to be tje true boy who lived and everyone realising what idiots they were for treating him badly

*** Most of the ones I've seen have had him not being the BWL, or at the very least giving no hints that he actually is and leading nowhere, I just need that sweet karma
