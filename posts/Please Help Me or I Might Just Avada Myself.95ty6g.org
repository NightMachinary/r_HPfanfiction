Ok so I remember reading this fanfic (unfinished and probably/definitely abandoned but whatever) that i enjoyed and i wouldn't mind re-reading it. Except I can't remember what it's called. Mind you, I can remember VERY SPECIFIC details but no matter what i search, it just doesn't come up. Maybe I'm just dumb and have passed it a million times but if you know what I'm talking about please let me know. Anyways, here's what I got: -Hermione is Bellatrix and James' (*accidental) child after Bellatrix's revenge plot of some sort goes awry. So basically she drugs James, has sex with him, and ends up pregnant. James goes back to his family, (and everyone lives through the events of October 31st, I don't remember how.) and Hermione Potter-Except-Noone-Knows-It gets dumped somewhere. A couple years later, Hermione is somehow in the Leaky Cauldron (?i think) and lo and behold James and Sirius are there duelling Bellatrix and I think Lucius (bc they're both Aurors) and Hermione sees that Bellatrix is about to Curse Sirius so she throws some spaghetti at her feet, causing her to slip, and saving the day. Anyways, James takes Hermione to his house where she meets Harry and Lily, and the house elf. Now, Lily wants to adopt Hermione, unaware that she is technically her step-mother, but noone except the elf knows this. The story drops off with some elder elf telling the younger elf about keeping secrets or whatever. I know, it's alot, but i would really appreciate it if anyone knows which fic I'm taking about, because I'm about ready to tear my hair out. --Thanks.


** It sounded like a half decent fic until you mentioned spaghetti beating Bellatrix.

** Holy fuck I found it. And all it took was "hermione throws spaghetti at bellatrix" even though id searched that a million times before. Its "the forsaken child" and James gets imperio-ed, not drugged.
