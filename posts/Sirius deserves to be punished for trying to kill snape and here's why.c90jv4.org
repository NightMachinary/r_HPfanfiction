** We still do not know the context in which Sirius chose to do that. Frankly, given how he behaves in the rest of the books when he isn't half-mad from Dementor exposure, actively trying to murder a fellow schoolkid in a way that would likely get one of his best friends executed, for nothing but shits and giggles, seems wildly out of character.

He wasn't a psychotic â€˜80s-movie-style bully (i.e. not Snape). There were almost certainly extenuating circumstances.
