Has anyone written one? After re-reading Septimus Heap, I saw how fun it could be!


** Wow is this Magyk etc?

I have /not/ seen that book in a while. I didn't think it was well known at all so I wouldn't be too hopeful

** I plan on reading this series.

About your request I did a quick search but couldn't really find anything. :(

Why don't you give it a go and try writing?

***** I'm trying to figure out how to introduce Magyk to HP... do you think I should bend them together, and have the /entire/ HP universe use both Magyk and Magic or should I make it just for Harry?

****** Which universe do you want to use as the setting? Although, actually, I think a blending would be cool. Have you read the Pureblood Pretense? One of the things the author did was sort of cast HP characters in the Song of the Lioness roles, which I thought read really well. So it really felt like the Song of the Lioness quartet, while being primarily an HP fan fiction.

Oh, I just realized you were talking about the magic system in particular, whoops. You could make it common in the HP universe, just not in the UK, or maybe uncommon but can be found. So Harry's using old-fashioned magic or something.

I'm probably going to reread the books soon, since the first time I read them I think there were only three or four.

******* I was thinking maybe have it a common thing, but have many of the spells "lost".

Like, we can replace conjuring with materializing, replace legilimency with reading... we can even replace Voldemort's flight spell with him uncovering the flight charm.

But, like, have more than half of the spells lost. Harry could uncover them, and that would be how him and Voldy fight it out- testing either others knowledge of the Septimus Heap spells.

The only question now would be how he uncovers the knowledge.

******** Ah, that would be awesome. Easy sources of knowledge include hidden areas in Hogwarts, or the Black library. One thing that might be cool is maybe Harry helps someone/befriends someone (like an old witch or something along those lines) and in return they teach him a little, and maybe he goes from there. Or maybe she teaches him a trick to creating spells/combining spells into new spells. So that Harry wouldn't be responsible for finding all the old spells, but rediscovering them.

**************** Ah, I see. You could just not write it. Start on the second chapter or so and then go back and write it later.

One thing you could do, which I've seen a lot and I think works well enough, is to pick up directly where one of the books left off. So instead of starting a new story, you're just writing a continuation of the books, but obviously everything is AU from there. Then you could slip in changes to the timeline/magic system as recollections of a sort. linkffn(The Never-ending Road), controversial for it's pairing even though in the entire first book there isn't really any romance at all, does this especially well. It starts off second year, but with an alternate timeline, and sort of goes through the changes fairly organically as characters' thoughts and musings. It reads very cleanly.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.
