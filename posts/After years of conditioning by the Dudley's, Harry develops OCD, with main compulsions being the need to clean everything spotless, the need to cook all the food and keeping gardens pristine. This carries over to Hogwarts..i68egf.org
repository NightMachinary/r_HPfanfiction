** Cool request, but it's also important to note that OCD is a neurobiological disorder that cannot be learned. If anything, Harry could have developed OCPD, which is Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder and can be developed from childhood trauma. Just something to keep in mind!

*** I mean maybe he has OCD and his compulsions have been fueled by the Dursley's treatment of him? From my understanding if a compulsion is encouraged it becomes harder to deal with and I assume they can be created from the world around them so him being made to clean, cook, etc could cause those activities to become compulsions. So his OCD would be more prevalent due to childhood trauma. I know a family friend and his anxiety got really bad (he doesn't leave his house or if anyone other than his parents and brother are at his home he won't even leave his room), his OCD became harder to manage in part due to this (to my understanding that is, he won't even talk to people online) so his environment has affected his OCD.

** Harry looked at the mower in despair. It wasn't even close to full and the petro can was empty.

Aunt Petunia had decided the grass was a few centimeters to high and ordered him to mow it. Sitting down in the garage he let out a cry of despair again wishing the grass would be cut.

He felt that tingly feeling he got when something freakish was about to happen and felt even more despair.

Oh no, something bad was going to happen again and he just wanted the grass to be cut!

Suddenly he felt the tingly feeling leave him and looked on in amazement as the lawn was suddenly pristine!

Had he used his freakish powers to cut the lawn! From his fog of despair he rose like a phoenix in joy as the perfectly cut lawn!

His magic sung as his joyful emotions filled him for the first time with happiness over his use of magic.

Over the next few years he had learned to control his genie powers as he called them. Afterall what other stories did he know where wishes came true?

He wished for a clean house and got a clean house everyday. He wished for his aunt and uncle to feed him more, viola! More food was his at every meal!

He wished for Dudley to ignore him and Dudley couldn't even seem to remember he had a cousin it seemed.

Still he always wished for everything to be clean. He had been forced to make a desperate wish once again though.

His Aunt had taken him antique shopping and he had out of habit wished the dingy place to be clean.

That had almost got him a copping on the ear until he desperately wished that no one would take notice of him making wishes anymore.

Now he made it a point to walk the city, wishing away the dirty. Wishing everything to look newer, to be repaired perfectly, to be clean.

Afterall cleanliness is next to godliness and genies had godlike powers. Best to stay on the right track after all.

When he received his Hogwarts letter he had simply wished that his family would ignore it. He didn't have an owl but wishing for one had worked well enough.

Sending back a letter saying he would like to attend had been another wish.

He had got back another letter with a ticket to something called the Hogwarts Express.

He didn't know where to find the things he needed for his list but another wish solved that.

Finding himself in a dingy alley filled with fantastic things he had set to cleaning it up first thing.

Diagonalley was sparkling and fresh as a daisy within the hour. He saw an especially filthy little alley off to the side.

It seemed like the kind of place people disappeared into and he was leary of heading down it. Still needs must afterall.

Wishing himself to be unnoticed he began the arduous task of cleaning that filthy place to the cobblestone.

That took him the rest of the day as the shops were filthy as well!

Still it was done now, all shiny and clean. He had made a powerful wish that everyone would want to keep it clean as well.

It was late enough he needed to get to cooking soon so he wished himself home.

/Break/

The witches and wizards of Britian were in a stir! Something magical had happened today in both Diagon and Knockturn alley!

They hadn't noticed until the end of the day but the special edition of the Prophet the next morning made sure everyone knew, oh yes!

Both Alleys, and all their shops, had somehow been magically cleaned to perfection last evening.

As the witches and wizards looked at the newly cleaned alleys they wondered why it hadn't ever happened before?

Now that it was so perfect they fully planned to make sure it stayed that way from now on as well. It would be a right shame if they dirtied it back up!

/Break/

Harry finished his chores and wished himself back to the alley.

He realized he didn't have any money though so he performed on of his most feared wishes.

He wished for a fat stack of pounds to spend. He was always careful of making money wishes. In the stories that seldom turned out well. He figured since he was the genie though it would be fine.

He soon realized his pounds were useless until he changed them over to Galleons it seemed. The little gremlins had been helpful at their bank in changing his thousands of pounds into a fat stack of gold.

Thankfully he had brought his satchel and had long ago wished to it hold anything it needed to, while staying light on the weight. The gold, silver, and bronze coins had fit in nice enough.

He purchased everything on his list soon enough, minus his books and wand. Always making sure to wish them as the best and cleanest they could be after he did.

While he wasn't a wizard, they had to use a wand instead of wishing like he did as an unbound genie, he still got a wand none the less.

He had learned from the local library that genies were usually trapped in magic items so people could use their powers.

He did not want to get trapped, no thank you.

So he would pretend to be a wizard for now.

Firstly though he made his way to the bookstore and this time looked at the books. Yesterday he had just popped in and wished it clean real quick.

He froze in his tracks at what he saw.

Pictures of him in glasses, he had wished his eyes better years ago, with his old scar, also wished away. Though that one had brought him to his knees in pain as he cried black tears for some reason.

Worst of all was the messy hair! As if he would let his hair ever be messy!

Still seeing the books about him he knew these witches and wizards must know he was a genie! They wanted to find him!

Wishing harder than ever he wished that no one would ever realize he was actually The Harry Potter, instead they would all think of him as a perfectly normal wizard who happened to be named Harry Potter (no relation).

*** /Continued/

Satisfied with his wish he then proceeded to get his required books easily enough.

Next was his wand and that place had been a mess yesterday. It was by far the dingiest place in the main alley yesterday. With its beat up store front and dusty cramped interior.

He had fixed it all up right away. He wasn't sure why but usually his wishes also made things space out a bit more when cleaning cramped places.

Why his room under the stairs was nearly the size of the rest of the house! He had filled it with many nice and interesting things over the years.

Now the wand shop was much more open and he was looking forward to getting his cover wand.

The old man had tried to draw it out but Harry had simply wished for the whole thing to hurry up and left in short order with the wand he though looked coolest.

It was a white oak with unicorn hair wand. It seemed pretty enough he guessed. Still he just wished for it to do whatever it needed to do and figured it would work out well enough.

He had flipped through the books though wasn't really impressed.

It seemed witches and wizards needed to go through some intensive training to even use simple magic.

Being a free genie was definitely the best choice.

He had only found three books that seemed worth reading. A history of magic book, a supplemental astronomy book a nice wizard had suggested, and the potions text book.

He realized he could wish for the potions, just like he could have wished for his school supplies. However, there was a joy in doing things be hand. To an extent that was, he didn't clean by hand anymore, his wishes did that far better and faster than he ever could.

He spent the next month visiting the Alley, reading his three interesting books and making sure his town was nice and clean.

Which led his to his current problem, he was leaving in a week.

He didn't want to have to wish himself back and forth all the time to keep the city clean.

They had won several awards for being the best maintained town in Britian it seemed.

The tourism was doing wonders for the economy, along with the grants, at least according to his Aunt and Uncle.

He needed someway to keep the town ticking along while he was off to boarding school.

It took him another two days to figure out a solution.

He had made his best wish ever! He had wished for any bound or trapped genies to appear before him!

That wish had nearly caused him to pass out, something no wish had done before.

Still he had an odd collection of several hundred items in his room now. He was sure from the sheer number that he was one of the last free genies.

He had then wished them free and happy as the first one had been angry.

He couldn't blame her, she had been trapped for thousands of years!

Wishing them all to be happy and healthy had been an obvious wish to make.

They had all be excited afterwards and he had explained his story to them. They had all promised to keep an eye out here and there on his city. Ensuring it was kept up while he was gone.

Several of them stayed a few days before he left, teaching him clever word tricks and how to twist the wishes of others.

It was good knowledge to have for sure. His favorite was an Irish genie who had a knack for making wishes into horrible curses after enjoying the wish for some time.

He said his goodbyes to all but Bres, the Irish genie. He took the form of a beautiful white cat, to act as his animal.

Bres had decided the extremely unusual wizard had the raw power to match those of the Kin. That said power had drawn from a pathological desire for order and cleanliness was beyond hilarious to him.

He had volunteered among the kin to watch over and evaluate the wizard child.

Freeing them had well and all, it was him using his magic to soothe their hatreds that had truly drawn the interest of all the Kin.

He would watch over and occasionally test the wizard child. If he succeeded they would likely elevate him to a true Kin. Most likely one of order, cleanliness and wishes, a most unusual combination he found great humor in.

Harry wished them both to the the train and soon found himself disgusted with it all. He had arrived a half hour early and the place was filthy!

He got to work right away cleaning the 9 and 3/4 platform. He had time to spare and set about getting the train up to his standards as well.

He was only on the second train car when it went underway but no matter. Needs must afterall and this train needed a good cleaning!

He spent most of two hours getting the train up to his standard. It was in the last car he found something that shook him to the core.

A fat rat as a pet! Rats were the least clean of animals. That wasn't even allowed as a pet!

Making a firm decision he decided to clean up all the pets as well.

The fat rat turned into a nice sleek brown tabby cat in the red headed child's hands. Nodding at a job well down he bang his journey through the train again.

Spiders, snakes, and slimy toads all quickly became good solid cats in short order.

Cats were a great pet, they kept themselves clean and buried their leavings.
