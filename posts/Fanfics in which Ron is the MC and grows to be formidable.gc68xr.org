Like Harry Crow, but not as cringey. I have read the Red Knight and I want something more along those lines.


** linkffn(Speed by Clell65619)

As a bit of shameless self-promotion.

*** I love it.

I generally prefer Ron's foreshadowed "powers" and "skills" to be brought to the surface +i.e his insane emotional range that can be mistaken for a empath, his chess playing skills, his people skills which come from empath thing, his "I will make a joke about this thing that will definitely happen" thing that implies he has seer prowess, his creativity, his willingness to get into physical fights in spite of being a wizard, his oddly impressive fighting record which is off screened, his connections via family that can be capitalized on, and so on,+ but I love these stuff too. Thanks for suggestion!

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

This fic is directly inspired by Red Knight, and imo is the spiritual successor that has passed it.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** linkffn(Voleur D'âme by Twubs)

This is an SI fic with the person being in Ron's body, with him and Harry moving up the power ranks pretty fast. Note, this is my first try using the Fanfiction bot, so tell me if I messed it up.

  A soul from our world is thrown into the body of Ron Weasley in the exact moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Teenage hormones, dark lords, and missing memories is a hell of a combination. SI
