** linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy)

I can't remember too much about the plot, but I'm pretty sure it has the best Harry/OC romance by a whole lot. Also there was a ton of angsty drama between the order and Harry (a lot of it because they disapproved of his relationship). But yeah, the drama sort of worked, because the characters had actual depth and there were real reasons for conflict, instead of artificial bullshit.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

*** I just got around to reading this a few hours ago, and to be honest I kind of enjoyed it.

It has got massive weeaboo vibes, but its pretty chill OP!OC/Harry romance if you can get past it.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
