** Draco Malfoy comes to terms with the fact that his Hawthorn wand doesn't approve of him and his path anymore and refuses to support him in it. He couldn't kill Dumbledore if he had tried and the wand gladly accepted Harry as more compatible than Draco when it was taken. Harry tries to return the wand after the war and helps Draco become the kind of man that can use a Hawthorne and Unicorn wand again, eventually becoming a healer.

Based off of Pottermore wandlore and wiccan tree mythos
