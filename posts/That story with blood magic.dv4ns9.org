I believe it took place during the triwizard tournament. Placing blood on your wand would increase the power of spells. I think Harry used runes drawn with blood to get his name into the goblet of fire. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: It may have involved Harry cutting himself to get the blood and having blood replenishers negate the power of the blood. It's a very unsure may though.

** Not sure if it is this but this starts out during the triwizard tournament and features a lot of blood magic

*** Thanks but it's not this one. To be honest the blood magic in this is more aptly called sacrificial magic but you use drops of blood to bind the sacrifice to you. The fic I'm thinking of had Harry cutting himself to place blood on his wand to increase power or draw runes. I'm not 100 percent sure but I think blood replenishers prevented one from using the blood magic.

It's a great fic, but Harry uses rituals with sacrifices in this one if I remember correctly, not blood magic.

**** Ah, yes, I think that's right. But they are using blood as wand cores, which was what I could remember. But yes, it was sacrifice rather than blood although I think they used blood to make wards maybe
