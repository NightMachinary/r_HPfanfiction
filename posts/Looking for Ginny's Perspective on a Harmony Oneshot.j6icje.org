:END:
The story is a oneshot told in third person but from Ginny's point of view(Her thoughts and emotions are displayed but she is referred to in third person), in which she views Harry/Hermione's interactions after the end of the war. There's no bashing at all, and the oneshot is canon until Voldemort's defeat, but Harry never got back together with Ginny afterwards. From what I remember, Harry and Hermione aren't actually dating but it's pretty obvious that they will be soon. Also I remember the last line of the fic being "For how could she be anything, anything compared to Hermione Granger?" Thanks in advance!
