*** What is so hard about "Rape = Sex without consent"?

I mean that is what basically everyone agrees to, people only argue what consent is ("Can you consent as 14 year old", "Can you consent when using any drugs", "Is having done it before and not revoking consent also future consent", ...)

But apparently not even the very basic rules are clear. WTF?

**** Very true. Normaly it's No,Debatable, wtf is the third one?

But really, as long as you don't go to cops, then everything is ok and permited.

***** Not a lawyer in Germany or the US (or anywherr):

The third one is a bit hard to describe: I am married to you, and last night we made out. Is it okay to wake you up by fondling you? You didn't give me consent for that, but it seems pretty normal. Is it still okay when you are a one-night-stand I met last night?

Or: You are my girlfriend, and I see you somewhere. Is it okay for me to grab your behind, assuming I have done that before and you were okay with it?

And the answer for me (as a german) is: "Yeah, unless I'm older than 21, then it's up to the judge's discretion*", (I'm unsure, but the answer is "it depends"), (Unsure again, I think this changed recently)

* obviously other rules like positions of authority, no coercion, ... factor in.

In the US you always need (and needed) an explicit "OK", in Germany it was that prior consent kinda implied future consent (but I think it changed)

So it's definiy debateable, even the laws of two civilized western countries differ in the three examples I made. That's what I meant with "What is consent?" Isn't as clear-cut. For practical situations it's not as hard, and a lot of times rape is rather obvious. But there is definitly a grey area.

****** Thanks, that cleared it up. To me(If I had a girlfriend :( ) I figure its like:

Hey are you okay with me grabing your behind?

If she answers yes, I'd think it would be reasonable for me to do so again(if she liked it, and was not in a bad mood)

I figure there has to be some sort of unspoken agreement. Don't know. I'm single.

But like you said its more or less debatable.
