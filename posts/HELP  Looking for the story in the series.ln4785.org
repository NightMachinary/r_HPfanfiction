This is a Snarry Fic. Full story on fanfiction.net. Sequel is Tango at the End of Winter. Enemies to friends to lovers fic. AU from OoTP forward. Bonding fic. Super long. Very good.

But!!!! The author ends the second book on a cliff hanger and never wrote the third. Her page was abandoned years ago. Does anyone know if anyone has ever wrote a 3rd books to it!? Anyone willing too???

I first found this fic probably 3 years ago and have re-read it several times. I just want an ending!!!

If anyone knows of a third book, please link!
