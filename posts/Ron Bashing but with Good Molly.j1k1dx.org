Normally, I'm not one for bashing. However, under certain circumstances I'll read a Ron bashing. I want to know if there's a fic where Molly is not bashed along with Ron. Mrs. Weasley to me would try and smack some sense into him.

So Molly isn't bashed and if possible, calls out Ron for his behavior.

*** I was going to recommend this fic. It has (in my opinion) a lot of problem and I can't say that I'm a fan, but it totally fits the request.

***** I guess it's only a question of taste, I'm more interested by the plot than the form, and can be pretty lenient when it comes to spelling and grammar. It's just that /this/ Harry is one of the most infuriating character I have ever seen ("/I don't cook, I chef/").

Still, you are right when you say that this fic is still above most of the other fanfics, and it's understandable that some people love it. I think I would put it in the same category than HPMoR, a very good form of writing, but not a story liked by everyone.
