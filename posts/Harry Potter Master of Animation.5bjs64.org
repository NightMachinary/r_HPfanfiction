Are there any fics where Harry's main weapon is to animate everything?


** Hmm...the knights and statues of Hogwarts coming to life, grass seeds growing and shooting out of the ground to entangle foes, trees growing arms and swinging their branches (Whomping Willow all over again), the pebbles on the ground rolling together and forming up into a little stone homunculus, someone being tied up by the hairs of their own beard, even animating the air itself to create a living whirlwind...

I don't have any recommendations, I'm afraid, but I'd like to see a fic like this just as much as you do.

Kinda. Its opening scene uses animation in a big way. Can't remember if he uses it much afterwards.

#+begin_quote
  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/8496][mad_martha's Two Households series]] might be of interest, Harry's skill as an animator plays a large part in the later fics. Slash: Harry/Ron, Remus/Sirius.
