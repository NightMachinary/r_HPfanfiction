I was thinking of something along the lines of how Moses split the Red Sea or how the Ancient Greek priests of Apollo were granted Seer powers.


** Hmmm, not sure this is what you're looking for. It's kind of crackish, but involves the various gods granting Harry boons/gifts without consulting each other, so sometimes they've accidentally doubled up. It's also unfinished. Storybook Hero by DogbertCarroll linkffn(7597067)

For something a little more serious (but not too much), Harry Potter Squatter by Enterprise1701-d (also incomplete but with a recent update) is a cross-over with Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and has more traditional godly gift-giving. linkffn(13274956)

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?
