:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry is on the streets and did some sex work for cash. He ends up working at a bdsm club as a â€˜lock boy' I'm pretty sure he does karate or something at some point along there. Anyone know it?

Cheers in advance


** I think it's /Runaway Wizard/ by Yanagi-wa.

Not sure because I gave up reading as soon as I saw that he was going to engage in sex work. I don't think I can link it here, because I think it violates this subreddit's rules.

** Is it the one with an eventual Draco/Harry pairing? I dropped it pretty early because it's not my thing, but it's among the first pages if you search for [Harry; Draco] in FFN with a mature rating.
