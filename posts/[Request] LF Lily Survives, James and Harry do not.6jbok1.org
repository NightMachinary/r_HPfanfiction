  Things go very differently on that fateful Halloween night. When Voldemort defies natural law and rises from the dead, he wages war on the wizarding world. in desperation, Dumbledore finds a way to bring a hero into the world, but is it the hero the world needs, and will he be capable of saving them, or will he need saving from himself?

Thanks for the honesty, heh. The premise has promise, but the fic ... From what I've read so far (first chapter, part of the second), it doesn't seem like Lily's all that broken up by her impossible choice. She really, really should be.
