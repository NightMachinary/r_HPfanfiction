Hi All,

I just discovered fan fiction. I was an avid fan of Harry Potter universe.

Is there a story where Harry travels to india or has an indian connection?


** Only one I can think of off the top of my head is Alternative Medicine by canoncansodoff.

It's Harry/Hermione/Parvati/Padma smut so your mileage may vary depending on tastes.

** In the collection of shorts called Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot a story called My India has vernon dursley taking over a branch of the company in India. The Dursleys hate it but Harry thrives there. He is eventually forced to go to Hogwarts.

In the story Harry's Un-Birthday Gift by Aealket Harry spends some time in India.

linkffn(9237873)

In the story Escape by JackPotr After the last battle Harry takes off in a sail boat and travels the world passing through India where he meets the Patils.

Alternative Medicine by canoncansodoff is the only story that I have read that is mostly based in India.

** Out of curiosity, are Indian/of Indian descent? When I was planning my main story, I considered adding in a section of the story where he goes to India and incorporating some Hindu religious mythology, but because Hinduism is still one of the major religions of the world i was afraid i would end up being super offensive. Instead, i used ancient Mesopotamian mythology.

I agree i think India is a narrative setting ripe for exploitation!

*** Yes to your question

I also agree to the other point you mentioned. It is vast and due to its long history and geographical spread has become hugely complex for any two people to agree on anything.

It is very easy to offend one or other sections of followers inadvertently. On top of that add colonial appropriation and it is a volatile mix.
