** Not quite what you're asking for, I remember a rather interesting Harry/Fem!Draco piece from a while ago. Pretty sure it was a crossover and Draco was renamed Calypso, or something. Literally the only time I've enjoyed that pairing, but not sure where I read it as it's been years. I cannot vouch for how well it's held up in the intervening time.

After a bit of Googling it's [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16165/EllandrahSylver+Fool+s+Consequences.htm][Fool's Consequences]] by EllandrahSylver.

**** Not really. As I said, that's the only one in that pairing that I've enjoyed.
