Pet-peeve or bad trope threads are +rather+ very common here, but those tend to focus more on fandom specific tropes like multiple Lordships, Draco in leather pants or overly friendly goblins.

But what are some general writing tropes which you utterly despise (eg love triangles, "The chosen one", dominant MC)?


** - Character bashing
- Focus on shipping
- Manufactured drama
- Dumb down characters to jam through the plot
- Power wank
- Mindless canon rehash
- “Good guys don't kill”

Those are all part of the last two books, which really is a shame since they would have been so much better without Hermione mentally reverting back to her sorting (or even further considering that she forgot about Tesco), the defenders of Hogwarts actually using their fortified high ground to some effect and the absolutely atrocious depiction of the Harry/Ginny romance (Chest monster anyone?).

Heavens forbid you write a situation where the love interest has to save the protagonist.

******* He was talking with some shady guy who was non-threatening, Hit Wizards show up, the guy makes a run for it, gets a killing curse in the back. Hit Wizard, from a Death Eater family, then immediately sees an opportunity and arrests Harry. He doesn't have his wand out and was still rather shocked by the random act of violence, so there's no way he could get the jump on the Hit Wizard with a wand trained on him. Harry gets disarmed and shackled, with a wand to his back.

Tonks shows up, takes the Hit Wizard out, stuns another one and she apparates them away.

Given that this was mid-HBP, Tonks is vastly more competent than Harry, who didn't even had a single apparating class yet (nevermind the wards).

** Two that get my goat:

"Only the true heir/chosen one/my blood can use this special toy" - I blame Mjolnir and Excalibur. It's one thing to set up restrictions that make an earnest thief work for their pay, but I absolutely hate when magic makes something absolute. Even JKR knew not to make an un-resistable truth serum. For every one of those poncy Lord Black rings and can't-be-removed-except-by-the-owner slave chokers, I want there to be a villain smart enough to cut off that hand or that head in order to break into the secret vault of auto-win goodies. The same goes for Oaths- there has to be a way for a character to choose a consequence rather than force behavior.

The other has to do with Fate, Death, and other agents of re-do; if a super-ultra-powerful being decides to rewind /all of reality/, you'd think they'd do so only to make it more interesting to watch. Why would they make it easier? Why would they explain anything, for that matter? Watching the mortals fumble about without a clue is where the fun happens.

See, for me, it did. I didn't really notice a lot of the logical inconsistencies (or JKR's terrible maths) until fanfiction made me spot it.

I also didn't really appreciate the fifth book until fanfiction made me realise that Harry actually handles trauma remarkably well on the whole - before, I'd found his angst really irritating and it was my least favourite book.

This is true. However, after years of reading and re-reading, I now haven't re-read in about 5 years as I find reading new interpretations of the same world more interesting, so I think my fan status has evolved a bit since I first met fanfiction.

***** It's interesting that I've been thinking about this recently, and I have to say that after reading a what if scenario (if Sirius had lived) I actually realized I would always prefer the canon version. There are things I dislike in canon, but some people seem to passionately hate it. I actually prefer canon compliant fics, and I have to say that some fics ruin the characterization of some characters, leaving only their names. Some authors even write on their profiles that they want only positive reviews, because, well, if you think their interpretation of a character doesn't fit with the one presented in canon, that's your problem. People come up with interesting plots, but I'd rather read a fic which shows a missing moment between,say, Sirius and McGonagall, than a fic where it's even impossible to believe that a canon character could act the way he does. But then again, I'm the kind of person who wasn't bothered by JK's maths issues and was surprised others saw this as a problem. It's possible to find flaws in any book. I've ranted a bit here, sorry.

Unfortunately, tropes are not used in a vacuum. Using a trope will remind people of how it has been used in the past. If it's been used in a cruddy manner a thousand times, it will be extremely difficult to use it well.

For instance, the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][Stuffed into the Fridge]] trope is overdone and done sexist /almost/ every time. The work you need to do to make it better is called avoiding the trope. Like, giving the deceased party agency or a crowning moment of awesome or something for their death.

** Not really a trope, but a general writing flaw that I see *a lot* in HP fanfiction: inconsistent POV and head-hopping. Minor instances of something like "Minerva was worried about the future" (when the story isn't told from Minerva's POV how does Harry know this?) I can usually forgive if they happen once or twice, but if it becomes a consistent issue that the narrator tells us things that the POV characters have no way of knowing it *really* pulls me out of the story (so much so that I lose a lot of respect and even if I continue just look at the fic as an example of a very amateurish attempt at writing).

Constant head-hopping is just as bad even if it is intentional. It's a really lazy way to get around having to explain the feelings and motivations of characters, because ""Yeah, let's just jump into their head and have them monologue all their thoughts and plans". Having multiple POV characters is totally fine, but often authors don't limit themselves to a POV per chapter (or similar) format or don't even limit themselves to a certain set of characters that can be POV characters. It's more often a total mess than anything else and I wish they'd just stick to a single POV character and learn how to write that properly before trying to emulate George R. R. Martin.

** Making less obviously masculine characters hyper-sensitive and babyish. This more applies to Fantastic Beasts than Harry Potter. There's a good amount of fics where Newt just crys way too easily and is written like a child. Meanwhile actual Newt Scamander is a fucking badass who is socially awkward but in a confident way, if you get me. He kinda overwhelms people I feel and is definitely quite head strong with Jakub - he's just in his own world.

It's something I see with any "soft" or slightly effeminate characters. Take Midoriya Izuku from BNHA for example, some fics take that route too. Heck I've even seen it in spider man, as bizarre as that sounds.

She also had a difficult life and of course someone had to say they were surprised she was still walking and talking. And of course she just knew a canon character so well that she understood everything about his reluctance to be with another canon character. She understood everyone so well...I don't think it's a trope, but when authors do that to their original characters I do want to scream, "I get she is wonderful". In other words, she is a Mary Sue who steals the show. I can understand it when a character understands a canon character due to their shared experiences, but but letting your original character be another Dumbledore is a bit too much.
