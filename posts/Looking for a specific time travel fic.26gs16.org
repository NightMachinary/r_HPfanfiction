Hey all, looking for a specific time travel fanfiction in which Harry consults the portrait of Dumbledore to create a runic system to bring his soul back in time. He has to kill himself to do it. It is completed.


** Are you thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] by S'TarKan Harry Potter The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

Harry won the war with the help of Dumbledore's portrait, then commits suicide to send his soul back in time.
