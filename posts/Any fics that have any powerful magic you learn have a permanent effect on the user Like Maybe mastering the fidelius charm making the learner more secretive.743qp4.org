we see a glimpse in canon that using Powerful magics can have a permanent effects on the user are there anyfics that go more in detail on this?

Maybe have the first truly powerful Spell that a wizard learns a have a large effect on the wizard threw out the rest of there lives, other powerful spells that a wizards learns still have permanent effect but they never influence a wizard as much as there first truly powerful spell?

It would be interesting to see the permanent effects on harry from his first truly powerful piece of magic that he masters being the Patronus charm at such a young age compared to Tom riddles being the killing cure(or maybe making the diary Hocrux was his first truly powerful piece of magic?) or the Marauders being the Animagus transformation ?

what do you think the first truly powerful piece of magic the average wizard learns is ? I think its Apparition


** Unfortunately, I don't know of any such a story, but the concept is really intriguing. Following your thought process, if Apparition is the first powerful spell learnt by most magicals, that would explain their wackiness. Maybe Dumbledore's was a massive contemporaneous animation of transfigured animals? That would give the many aspects of his personality that we see in the books a new spin.

A protective charm for Lily, who wanted to make sure to be shielded from the pranks and shield Snape from the marauders...

** In my current story, "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", becoming an animagus affects the caster mentally, and also precludes learning Occlumency or Legilimency.

*** I like the Idea of including Potions i this though I would have it be both the creator and the one who ingests the potion who is affected but in two different ways.

It would also be interesting if it was all the more powerful spells that had an effect on you, though only a slight effect, but it would increase in effect each time it was cast. This could be used to explain the aversion to the dark arts, they slowly changes the caster, making them steeped in the negative emotions and the bloodlust required to cast the spells.

Perhaps this could also be why Wands have become the dominant way of casting spells, because the Wand acts as a buffer between the caster and the magic preventing most spells from affecting the caster. Rituals and wandless casting having a much larger impact on the caster.

** One does come to mind but.... Welp it is a huge spoiler to link it at all! Is not exactly a single spell having a full effect but does goes into powerful magic affecting someone's behavior I think? Welp, is also quite cracky... Your call if it sounds interesting at all. linkffn(4081016)

** Hmm...well, no specific fics come to mind, but I often see Animagi adopting traits of their animal form while they're human. Does that count?

** It's not a HP fic, but mutants in the urban fantasy series The Disilusionists have a generic X gene and gain one specific power from whatever they first did with their ability. Most mutants are telekinetic, as they frequently yank things towards themselves as small children. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6890220-mind-games]]
