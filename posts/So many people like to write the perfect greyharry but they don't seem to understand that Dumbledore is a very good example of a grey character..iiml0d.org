** I have a theory that people don't write grey well sometimes because they don't confront it in the canon material.

For example, I really love Lupin. Something that I think makes his character richer and more interesting is that he sought to abandon his wife and unborn child - yes, for understandable reasons to his anxiety, but this is pretty uncomfortable. He shows several instances of cowardice. He never intervened with the marauders bullying. He was too afraid to tell dumbledore that a mass murderer had an animagus form because he didn't want the shame of his teenage actions coming out, and this recklessly endangered Harry's life. He chose to avoid shame rather than protect Harry in that instance. Lupin a good character with a good, kind spirit that messes up because of shame and anxiety, and I think that kind of makes him grey and interesting.

Look at how comfortable Lupin was running around the Hogwarts grounds as a teenager- it's like drink driving tbh, ‘fun and reckless' at the time, but he could have ruined someone's life. Harry would never ever have done that I don't think, he was too good.

So Lupin was grey, to me, because he was a lovely, endearing person that's done some pretty reckless or cowardly stuff. And I notice that people who really like Lupin get angry if you point this stuff out about him. But I enjoy him - all parts of him, even the parts he was ashamed and tried to hide! This nuance makes him fascinating! But lots of fans and fanfic writers lack the “fleshed out” feel of characters because they don't embed these believable flaws that makes loveable people do very unloveable things.

Fanfic writers I follow who get angry for example at pointing out the greyness of Lupin (he's amazing, leave him alone!) or snape (total tool, never did anything good!) seem to miss those really compelling, morally uncomfortable aspects in characters that JKR nailed. She didn't write Lupin and snape the way she did so that people could pick only from the good or bad and put their nose in the air and be done with it. She wrote them so that you'd love them anyway, or hate them anyway, and feel that tension. She even put in whispers of Voldemort being terrified of death to make him more understandable.

So you need to understand the greyness in the source material, and I think some grey!harry writers struggle with that.

*** The issue with Lupin if you write Harry centric (which a lot of fanfics do) is that the greyness translates into not being there for Harry or acting in his interest. Which means that he's on a fast track to being distrusted and out of Harry's group in a way which for example Sirius is not (who came back to Harry despite facing summary execution during GoF while Lupin disappeared again).

And alternatively writing Lupin with more backbone takes away the greyness which comes from what you've described as cowardice.

**** Huh - I've never written with either Lupin or Sirius so that's interesting to hear! Thanks for that.

I think, more broadly than just Lupin, almost all characters in the series kinda have flaws and problems and grey aspects that many readers don't grapple with (especially with their faves). So when they end up writing their fave in a fic it's like missing salt in your food - everything seeeeeems alright, but where's that spark that makes them real?

Another example I see of this is Snape, golly, everyone either writes him as Satan incarnate or a closeted darling. He was a total asshole who did good things, like a feral cat you have to steer clear of, and a lot of writers find it hard to nail him in character I think.

***** Another thing to keep in mind is that it's hard to write about characters you are not invested in. I mean, I'm pretty sure I could write a decent Malfoy fic which diverges after the first year and has him grow in a believable way towards a romance with Hermione, but that would mean I'd have to spend hundreds of hours writing about someone I'd rather see hang in canon than kiss Hermione. Or it'd end in a weird train wreck like the time someone here challenged me to write Harry/Malfoy and I ended up with Harry/Tonks who morphed to look like Malfoy (I deleted that without ever publishing it).

Which means that even if I end up with a plot line which would suit Lupin, I'll not include him because it would only make me want to ditch the fic.

*** While I don't dispute anything about the characterization you offer, I'd argue over the definition of "grey" you're using.

As you pointed out, Remus Lupin is, essentially, a good man with some serious flaws. That, to me, still puts him firmly in the "light" character spectrum. Instances where he hurts or endangers others aren't a product of him making a moral choice. He's simply being reckless, or cowardly, or just not thinking things through (again - this doesn't make him a bad man, just a flawed man).

As OP mentioned, Dumbledore would be a better example of a "grey" character. He is also, essentially, a man trying to do good. But he's willing to compromise his morals and put others in danger to achieve that. The talk about "ten long years" with Harry makes clear Dumbledore was fully aware he'd be condemning an innocent. Despite that, he still goes through with it, while being aware of the implications and consequences of his actions, in favor of some long-term goal (whether that's defeating Voldemort, making sure Harry survives at all, or something else entirely). Canon Dumbledore makes choices\\
he's not happy with, because he believes those are the choices he needs to make.

Harry, on the other hand, is a fully "light" character. Self sacrifice is woven into his very being and shown multiple times in every book. When presented with the need, he immediately puts his life in danger to help someone and would never consider deliberately endangering someone else to achieve a goal.

A perfectly "dark" character would be Voldemort. In contrast to the other two he only acts selfishly. He's perfectly happy to sacrifice any number of people for his own benefit, but would never consider giving something of himself while he can have someone else pay the price. He also actively seeks ways to enrich himself without any regard for others.

All three of them - Harry, Albus, and Voldemort - are aware of the morality of their choices and act either because, or despite them. Harry does the right thing, because it's the right thing to do; Albus makes compromises, with the hope it will be worth it in the end; and Voldemort completely disregards consequences to anyone other than himself.

I feel like I'm starting to ramble, so I'll wrap this up: a character being "light", "dark", or "grey" isn't solely about where their actions put them on the moral spectrum, but also how they view that spectrum themselves.

** This is such a good, nuanced way to think about this! (The comments are on point in this post too, you done good, OP)

I definitely fall into the category of people that are mad at Dumbledore for all the shit he put Harry through, but he's a person of power/a leader. He makes decisions that influence other people, I can respect that. And for all the questionable or downright immoral things he's done that affect Harry, he also *undeniably* loved Harry, and taught him a lot. Let's not forget, that Harry also loved and respected this man, and that's not for no reason. I really don't enjoy fics that paint Dumbledore as an abuser.

Also, as other commenters have said, lots of characters in HP are grey! Admittedly, all the ones we see regularly (Harry, Hermione, Ron, the teachers, the other kids) lean towards light grey, but that's the interesting thing! Hermione /is/ cold and calculating, and she /has/ been (excessively) cruel to two characters, Rita Skeeter (but fuck that bitch lol) and Marietta Edgecombe. Their dimensions make them interesting and fun and lovable, and that's what makes the canon good, too!

Again, glad you brought this up, OP. I've been wanting to say all that for so long!

** Probably the main reason people act that way is because of others believing Dumbledore to be perfect. I think the whole Lord of the light thing is fanon but I'm not sure, regardless Dumbledore never says or even implies he's perfect. He never brings up Grindelwald to anyone, but it's something he's ashamed of which a lot of fanfic writers seem to miss. Would you go around telling everyone how your same sex lover was magical Hitler and was partially involved in the accident that killed your sister, an accident that you and all your living family blame you for? Dumbledore is a deeply flawed old man with a lifetimes worth of mistakes and regrets. He does his best to learn from his mistakes, do better and prevent others from making the same mistakes. His intentions are good and he knows what can go wrong because he's been there, done that and now lives with the regrets. His means for preventing others from making the same mistakes aren't always good, but his motives are pure. He's certainly not a saint, but he's not a demon either. He fits grey pretty much perfectly. A lot of people see him as a hypocrite, not realising that others put him on a pedestal, he never asked for it and seems to have never really wanted it but makes use of it to achieve his goals which is a perfectly grey thing to do

Some people use it as an equivalent for chaotic, others use it as some kind of (ridiculous) mix of good and bad and others use it in the same way as the alignment of "neutral" is used in D&D. Sometimes it's even none of those and "grey" just means "3rd faction".

*** I actually got the sense that OP was referring to it as gray morality, as in willing to do wrong things for the right reasons. He believes in "necessary evil" like putting a trap for Voldemort in a school.

Other commentators seem to be referring to gray as "has character flaws or makes mistakes." In fanfiction I typically see gray used as a political spectrum somewhere between the Dark (staunch traditionalists) and the Light (rabid progressives). In those cases Dumbledore is Light as he cares a lot about house elf rights and pushes forward canon ideas like The Muggle Protection Act and is against things like restricting creature rights. Other times I see gray as an actual class of magic.

My biggest issue with Dumbledore has a lot less to with his morality and a lot more to do with his inability to trust others with important information. Keeping information close to your chest is important, but so is giving people enough information to act. I also kind of get the feeling that Dumbledore was scared of how much power he had and so he chose not to use it. He didn't seem to trust himself with power after Grindelwald, but he didn't seem to trust anyone else with it either.
