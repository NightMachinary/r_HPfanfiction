Hey all,

With the permission of your mods who have generously allowed me to post an ad here, I've created [[/r/RoomOfRequirementRP][r/RoomOfRequirementRP]], a roleplaying community geared towards story focused individuals that enjoy writing longer, more intricate, plots and posts. We don't have any mechanics systems or the likes because we are, first and foremost, a writing subreddit.

If you are interested come join us in our [[http://irc.lc/snoonet/RoRrp][irc chat]] if you have any questions. I am semi afk but will try to answer any and all questions to prospective writers. Feel free to pm me personally with questions, but most will be answered in the welcome page at the top of the sub.

Cheers!


** I hope this works out, it sounds really awesome! Shame I can't write to save my life though :)

*** Well, if you're interesed the best way to learn is to try. I'm not asking a ton out of the writers beyond genuine effort in their posts and a willingness to improve. If you've got that, you're plenty qualified.

Regardless, thanks!
