During or shortly after the War Harry and Ginny split and both go for each Work. Whether she is joining Quidditch or some other Group. Through this she will surely meet attractive Partner that she shares the Bed with. If this happens "on-screen" or its hinted/skipped doesnt matter. Maybe she and Harry will even have a couple of Sessions.

I dont care if she is Hetero, Lesbian or Bi.


** Not sure this helps but Annerb, the writer of the Changeling, one of my favorite fics, wrote about post-war Ginny and Harry reunion that's noncanon. Sorry it's not as smutty as you'd prefer but it's a fun little story. linkffn(lips long parching by Annerb)

  Going solo to her ex's wedding is not exactly Ginny's idea of a good time, but thanks to a smuggled flask and a rather sullen Harry Potter, it's about to get a lot more interesting. (Harry/Ginny)
