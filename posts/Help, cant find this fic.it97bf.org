:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically its "a black comedy" but with Ron, and Harry. I also remember that ginny was a bitch, and im pretty sure that they were like 100 before they got transported to the past.


** could it be 'Gryffindors Never Die'?

** It seems like you already found it, but there was another humorous Ron and Harry back in time fic I found here about a week ago. I haven't read it yet, called Through the Veil by darienqmk
