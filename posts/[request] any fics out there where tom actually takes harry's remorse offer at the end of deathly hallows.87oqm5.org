yeah, thought this'd be a pretty awesome idea to ask for. what if he actually seriously considered it, and he did feel something, and then he ended up maybe surrendering or maybe he just leaves and tries to be a better person in secret?


** Um...hmm. I wanted to do a snippet here but I'm not sure how to write it.

I mean, the end of Deathly Hallows isn't really the best time for Voldemort to feel guilty about his actions; Harry-plus-friends have destroyed all of his Horcruxes, destroying parts of Voldemort's soul in the process (potentially a worse crime than murder), and if Voldemort surrendered then he'd practically be guaranteed to be imprisoned or executed (if not given the Dementor's Kiss).

Between that, the pureblood mania, the existence of Azkaban and dementors, the lengths Crouch went to to fight his Death Eaters...he's probably got good reason to believe 'there is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it', really.

The snippet I was going to write basically had Harry & Voldemort acknowledging that the latter's crimes are ultimately based in fear (making himself the strongest and immortal, to make hurting him much harder and avoiding a potentially unjust afterlife), with Harry trying to convince him that aside from a few bad eggs, most people are genuinely good and can be trusted (and thus his bloodshed was never necessary), but the problem with that is with all the times Harry was shunned and all of the 'bad eggs' rising high in the Ministry and other positions of power, Voldemort can refute that (or at least call the population gutless sheep).

Hmm...

**** Mm, I was wondering about that, but I double-checked; in chapter 6 of Deathly Hallows, Hermione explicitly points out that while with normal people with normal souls, injuring or killing them won't harm their soul at all, but with a horcrux, destroying it will also eradicate the soul piece within.

#+begin_quote
  Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. "Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all."

  "Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure," said Ron. Harry laughed.

  "It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched," said Hermione. "But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it."

  "That diary sort of died when I stabbed it," said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort's soul as it vanished.

  "And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new."

********** You're arguing for the same thing (that Rowling made a mistake). You're just shifting the blame to a character even though its blatantly obvious that Hermione isn't supposed to be wrong there: If it had been intended as misinformation it would have been a plot point, pointed out later and held some kind of significance.

It's even possible that Rowling made the mistake when writing the Hermione scene. Maybe the Limbo scene was written first. Who knows.

************ Or maybe the two cases aren't actually as related as we think. Putting a soul piece in a soulless object might tie that fragment to the physical world in such a way that, when the object is destroyed, so is the soul piece.

But putting a soul piece into a baby who already has a soul? That's gotta a be a whole different bag of worms. Remember guys, the soul piece was literally part of Harry. When he spoke to snakes, he didn't feel like there was something foreign inside him translating what was going on; he felt like he personally was talking to the snake. And Voldemort cursed him in the forest, it wasn't that the soul piece 'blocked' the hit or something; they both went to Kings Cross.

So I think the soul piece in Harry was a lot different from normal horcruxes. It never tried to posses him, or anyone else. It didn't whisper bad things in his ear or drive him insane or evil. Instead it was just kind of a part of him, that only started acting up when Voldemort (where it came from) was alive. So I think it became less like a horcrux, and more like a rather confusing addition to Harry's soul.

So Hermione is right, but her words only apply to normal horcruxes; and Harry was no normal horcrux.

************* Hm. You may be right. On the subject of Scardemort not possessing Harry, though, I always thought that was a result of the Love Protection, and that had he /not/ had that, Scardemort would have taken over his mind.

Also, I tend to believe that when speaking Parseltongue, Harry wasn't really speaking "through" Scardemort, but more that he had absorbed that bit of knowledge/ability from him. Note that per /Cursed Child/ he still kept it after Scardemort got dumped in Limbo.

************** oh really? I like that, cuz I vaguely remember being mad a couple of years ago when someone tol me about a Word of God where Rowling had said Harry had lost his Parseltongue after getting rid of Scardemort.

Knowing he kept it after all is reassuring, as I find the blatant portrayal of everything Slytherin/slightly related to snakes as 'evil' in canon kind of annoying (looking for some good Slytherin stuff is actually the reason I started reading fics in the first place).

I feel quite the same. To clarify, that person wasn't wrong, the Word of God /was/ genuine, but it seems that for the sake of /Cursed Child/'s plot Rowling changed her mind about that. So regardless of how you feel about /CC/ that's /still/ something good it did, anyway!

Aha, suddenly it's important what Rowling meant to be genuine?

I agree though. But if Rowling almost certainly meant both of the situations we discussed to be genuine, there's no clever in-universe way out of this dilemma. Just imagine that it's poorly explained and the broken Voldemort-thing is supposed to represent the fragmented soul during its destruction (or something asinine like that).

***** Hmm yeah, interesting. Sounds like you're right, though the whole sequence doesn't really make sense to me, but this is critiquing Rowling now:

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”
#+end_quote

This is such a weird question to ask. When a human being dies the soul doesn't randomly decide to live somewhere else (except maybe for ghosts, but that's not what Ron means). I'd expect the soul fragment from a Horcrux to just perish, as in, move on to the "next adventure". Seems natural since it isn't forcefully attached to the Horcrux anymore.

It seems to me the main purpose of that sequence is to retcon the Diary into having been a Horcrux... but kudos to you for looking it up. It's hard to remember stuff from DH correctly since a lot of it makes so little sense.

Coming back to your original point: You're still just destroying a fragment of a soul. Not really sure what that means to be honest. Also how does that whole deal work with the Baby Voldemort in Limbo? That strongly implies that the fragment is on the same track (moving on) as Harry... probably why I misremembered. Maybe Rowling forgot too when she wrote it.

I think she may have forgotten, that or Hermione was just wrong earlier because so much of what is known about Horcruxes is just guesswork and theory. But wee bloody Scardemort wasn't moving on like Harry; the point of his scene is precisely that he was too weak and mangled to "board a train" and move on, and would just stay there, laying in agony in limbo, forever.

** I honestly can't see that going anywhere. I mean, kinda like this:

Tom Riddle, once known to the Wizarding World as Voldemort, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Name, or You-Know-Who, was kneeling on the ground, weeping. He'd taken the chance offered by the green-eyed youth, and felt the crushing guilt of every murder, torture, curse, and crime committed by himself and his followers. Every single one, even back to his first dark days at the orphanage. The Great Hall was silent, watching the oddly cadaverous man weep. He rocked back and forth, consumed by his grief, until Potter embraced him, and shushed his muffled sobs.

"Tom, I'm glad you've felt remorse for your actions. Now, you can go on to the next great adventure in peace. /Diffindo/."

The rest of the Hall gasped in horror and shock as the erstwhile Dark Lord's head parted company with his body and hit the flagstone floor with a hollow-sounding /thunk/. Potter looked around in astonishment.

"What? Did you lot think I was gonna let him go or something?"
