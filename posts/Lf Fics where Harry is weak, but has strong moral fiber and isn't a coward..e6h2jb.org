*** Seriously though. Do people think Harry was weak in canon? I thought he was pretty much perfect, able to hold his own against most Death Eaters but no match for Riddle.

Fanfics, where Harry is much stronger, are nearly always low quality (have yet to come across a good one) and feel like wish fulfillment.

**** He wasn't weak. I do feel like JKR was setting him up to be crazy powerful, but changed her mind between books five and six.

Though to be fair, few people like HBP!Harry.

***** She wanted to have him be both the everyman and the chosen one. Instead of balancing him well she made him sometimes overpowered and sometimes weak and moronic.

**** Not able to hold his own against Riddle, which meant he had to win by literal plot armor.

Harry somehow managed to hold off a horde of Dementors alone, but then never does anything else outside of that, that shows he's even slightly "Voldemort's equal". JK was obviously setting him up for something, and then changed her mind, because it went against him being the perfect, can do no wrong, wizard Jesus, she wanted in the end.

*** Canon Harry was not weak. He was good that he taught DADA club in 5th year. He produced patronus when he was 13. He even got EE in potions OWL. All his friends were able to hold Death eaters in DoM against 2 to 1 odds. He just doesn't care about many things outside what was important.( like visiting his parents graves or finding about who was Sirius Black before his escape). It doesn't make him weak, it may be product of his living with Dursleys. I don't think they encouraged him when he asks questions or got curious about things.

He learns spider repelling spell just by witnessing in Tom Riddle memory in CoS(film) and later uses it on Aragog and Co.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
