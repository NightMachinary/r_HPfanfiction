Hey all,

I'm looking for some (hopefully) well-written Hermione-centric fics with the pureblood/heir of trope. You know, Hermione turns out to be Voldemorts daughter or the long lost daughter of the Black family, or a princess of wizardingly Britain, etc.

Bonus points if the fic does a lot of world building (culture or magic wise).

I've read some in the past, as I remember none of them were very good but perhaps Reddit has some good suggestions? :)

​

Harry-centric would also be okay (with the same tropes). I used to only read certain pairings but these days I'm broadening my horizons so any pairing is fine by me.

​

Thanks!


** Linkffn(Patron) is a bit like that, although Hermione isn't royalty it does take the pureblood elitism and turns it up to 11.

I definitely recommend it.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Nihil est ab omni parte beatum by Seselt) is like that and it is also very nicely written as a bonus.

Content-wise, it is probably not what you would expect, though.

  She took a deep breath. "Arbitrarily, if you had to pick the people I'd least like to have as my biological parents, who would you guess?"

  Harry stared at her then at her left arm. She nodded.
