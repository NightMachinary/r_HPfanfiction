So I don't even know if this fic exists but I'm searching for a god where Dumbledore summons a Harry potter from another world/dimension and then right after that Harry gets angry and kills Dumbledore front of everyone. Yes. I believe that's quiet aptly put.

** Well, he draws it out, but linkffn(On A Pale Horse) Has MoD!Harry get summoned, kill Voldemort before the day is out, and engineer Dumbledore's fall through a combination of airing dirty laundry and removing Dumbledore's ability to lie.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
