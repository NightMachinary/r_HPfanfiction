In the story, Hogwarts is placed under lockdown and quarantined due to the magical disease spreading. How is it, then, that Narcissa and Lucius can visit to check up on Draco? Furthermore, why can Snape leave to pursue ingredients when he is supposed to be quarantined?


** I believe Snape left the school before the quarantine was established. It wasn't until Draco got sick that the news of the sickness was leaked, and only the Hospital Wing was under quarantine before that news article was published (Chapter 20).

As for the Malfoys, quote from Chapter 21: "The Malfoy's were probably only let into the school because their son was in serious mortal danger, unlike the other children."
