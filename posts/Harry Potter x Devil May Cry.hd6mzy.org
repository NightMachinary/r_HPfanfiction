I know this sounds weird and all, but with the Visions of V manga suggesting that magic is used by Devil Hunters as well, What about a Voldemort summoning demons as his Army and Harry hiring, teaming up and fighting alongside Dante and co. to take down the demons and fighting Demon Voldemort at the end, with Harry's Scarcrux giving him a DT or sth. Bonus points for Puzzles, if that can even work in a written narrative.

So what do you think?


** I'm not familiar with Devil May Cry, but here's a Harry Potter cross with it: linkffn(Dark Defense by kyugan).

  Before Fudge can appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new DADA Professor, Dumbledore seeks out a candidate of his own. And after all, the best tutors against the Dark Arts are those who are Dark themselves... 5th Year
