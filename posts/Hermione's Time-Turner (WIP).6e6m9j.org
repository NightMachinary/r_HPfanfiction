Started this fanfic and was wondering if I should continue it. The story is written to fit chronologically after a specific chapter of a Harry Potter book. I'm thinking of doing a few. Thoughts?

Hermione, crying and panicking, ran onto her bed. As she sat there sobbing Parvati and Lavender slowly pushed the door open.

‘Hermione?' said Parvati cautiously.

Hermione darted her eyes at Parvati.

‘What?'

Parvati pushed Lavender in front of her.

‘Why don't you come and join the party?' Lavender said brazenly.

'I have to finish this by tonight.'

‘Hermione' said Parvati apologetically.

‘can we just go?'

‘please.'

Parvati allowed herself to be pulled away by Lavender. Hermione, seeing the door left open, closed the curtains on her four-poster. She looked down on Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles and saw it was 8pm.

‘OK, four-hundred and fifty pages.' she said, mumbling to herself. ‘...I have to get this done.' she cried.

Hermione, feeling the weight of her head increase, collapsed. She broke into tears as she curled up around the book. She pulled out the time turner and held it tight, almost as if it gave her strength. At that very moment, she heard a creak and a thud. She sat up on her knees and a cold breeze shook the four-poster curtains. Someone was there. In a sudden realisation, she fumbled the time turner back under her collar. She grabbed the curtains slowly and stood there too scared to draw.

‘Who's there?' she said breathlessly.

No one answered. She drew a single breath then ripped her curtains open. She stared petrified. She saw another Hermione stare right back. Only she looked exhausted and overwrought. Is that really how I look? Her hands were raised slightly in a silent surrender, one of them clutching a time turner. She put away the time turner and stood up de-stressed, lowering her hands.

‘It's OK.' She said softly. ‘Nobody comes in till 1. You can use the time turner to go back in time before then.'

Still in shock, Hermione didn't say anything. She thought of arguing with her but she then realised how stupid that would be. Almost in acceptance, she moved back from the end of the four-poster and pulled out her book still eyeing the other Hermione. She started to read on, looking up every once in awhile to check new companion. The other Hermione was also glancing up at her, almost imitating Dumbledore. Twenty pages passed, then forty. The page count turned to eighty when she finally settled into the new position she found herself.
