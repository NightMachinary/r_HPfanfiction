** For some variety, I've got mostly one-shots to rec:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788265/1/Tis-the-Season][Tis the Season]] by Littleforest. 4476 words. Summary: What if, during the Christmas holidays of Harry's sixth year, Dumbledore did take Harry to visit the Graveyard at Godric's Hollow? [I think it's actually part of the author's longer fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7869770/1/The-Mark-of-a-Hero][The Mark of a Hero]], but I haven't read that one.]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641464/1/Forgive-an-Old-Man][Forgive an Old Man]] by AngelMoon Girl. 2486 words. Summary: After receiving an alarming amount of owls regarding Harry, Dumbledore decides to pay the teen a personal visit. On the Weasleys' cellar steps, they discuss Sirius, the prophecy, and how best to avoid tickling a sleeping dragon the summer after Year 5.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] by branwyn. 5301 words. Summary: When Albus Dumbledore is eighteen, he meets a mysterious young woman with a Time Turner, a secret mission, and a disarmingly comfortable relationship with death.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/711432][Four Versions of June, 7th, 1957.]] by Graou. 12972 words. Summary: "Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of Dougal McGregor to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship," says JKR. This is a development---actually, four possibilities, one per chapter, of how it could have looked, sounded, felt like to a younger Minerva McGonagall and a less ancient Albus Dumbledore.

Also, forgive the self-promotion, but I'm gonna throw in two of my own fics, which are kinda-sorta companions to each other:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] by SiderumInCaelo. 1028 words. Summary: Set mid-HBP. Dumbledore tells Harry the curse on his hand is terminal.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14678448][at once more wonderful and more terrible]] by SiderumInCaelo. 529 words. Summary: The decision not to tell Harry the curse on his hand was terminal was easy, until it wasn't.

** It's rather long (over a million words), but Abraxan's /Refiner's Fire/ series has such a Dumbledore character. He's literally "Grandfather Albus" to Harry's kids in one of the epilogue side fics she wrote.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
