Basically, while James and Lily still die, there isn't the bungle up of justice and Pettigrew and is sent to Azkaban, and Sirius raises Harry.

Any good ones on this or a similar plot-line?

** Eh, most Sirius raising harry are sadly from Sirius escaping or fleeing, don't know any where Sirius and Peter get true justice back at the first halloween fiasco and Sirius gets custody that are all that good to be honest.

My favorites where Sirius raises Harry- both times after escaping prison, are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The wise one]] - a three part completed series where Sirius escapes and rescues Harry at age 8 and go onto traveling the world learning magic- pretty good fic and not as crack-filled as most traveling fics seem to be.

And my personal favorite, a short one sadly, but a good one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254667/1/Black-Vengeance][Black Vengeance]]- You know all those fanfics where Harry gets sent to Azkaban and when he escapes/gets released he goes on a vengeance kick? Now it's Sirius's turn, and he rescues Harry along the way. How he deals with Voldemort and the deatheaters in this one is truly inspired- though beware of the slight bashing- but it's one of those fics that doesn't truly make the bashed characters out worse than cannon but rather misinterpretation of intentions and uncaring of their- mainly Dumbledore's excuses on Sirius's part.

** I've seen a couple. One I thought pretty good is where he's in America, everyone think he's dead but is forced to compete in the TWT due to the connection and Riddle knowing he's alive. His name is put in by Riddle's minion. I'll try to find/remember it and link it.

My Darkness!Harry story has Sirius still in prison until one character tells Dumbledore that he saw Pettigrew betray the Potters. From about ten and a half, Sirius raises Harry with a Ghost!Potter, Remus, Andromeda, and a few others help.

If I were a gambling man, I'd put my money on that fic being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7222456/1/The-Fourth-Champion][The Fourth Champion by James Spookie]].

** I can't remember what happens to Pettigrew, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry]] by Copperbadge definitely has some of what you're looking for. It is Sirius/Remus, and the author never finished out the years, but the author does give notes on where he thought the story would go.

** *Tyrant*, linkffn(5324704), is a very interesting fic. The author tried to recreate the story of Caesar/Octavian with HP characters, and I must say it was very well done. The author of *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), even credited this fic as his inspiration.

Its story began with Voldemort's attack on the Potters in Godric's Hollow. The Potters still died, but Sirius (Caesar) was also there and landed a lucky hit on Voldemort. He took in Harry (Octavian), Draco (Brutus), and Nymphodora (Octavia) as his own, formed a triumvirate with Frank Longbottom (Pompey) and Alastor Moody (Crassus) to push through their political agenda. Soon a major Goblin (Gauls, Barbarians) rebellion broke out, and the British wizarding world countered by raising permanent standing armies. As Sirius success and power grew, Frank and Wizengamot (the Senate) grew more and more suspicious.....
