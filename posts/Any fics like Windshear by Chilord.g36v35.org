Harry is effortlessly powerful, practical and very laidback, without any emotional anguish.

linkffn(Stepping Back)

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood)

The Former one is pretty much as similar to Wind Shear as it gets.

While the latter is by the same author and has a very similar vibe to it.

While I wouldn't call it 'effortlessly' he is rather powerful. The only emotinal anguish that would stick to these fic's is the usual Harry Potter /I-lost-my-parents/ shtick, but there is no everpresent sadness or depression involved.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

This fic has good Dursleys who don't abuse Harry and who raised him like their own son. He's blind due to Voldemort's killing curse on Halloween 1981 but somehow gained the ability to see magic and souls. This ability grants him an insight into magic that nobody else has. He also never attended Hogwarts so there's little to no emotional anguish either.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
