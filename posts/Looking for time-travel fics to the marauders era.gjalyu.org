** I'm assuming you mean something more than the usual Hermione or Harry time-travel back to the Marauders era fics? I can recommend a bunch of those if you like. But if you mean more of an ensemble piece try Iacta Alea Est, which has Hermione, Luna, Ginny, and Lavender going back as a group. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209/chapters/25775856]]

** I once read a fanfic where Harry and Draco travelled back to stop the death eaters who returned to past to support Voldemort. Ginny follows them to the past. That was an interesting story but I can't find it. If you find it, please share.

Other than that there is 'Putting M in the Mystery'. I'll recommend others as I remember them.

** I really liked /Crossing Lines/, which has Fred and George go back to the Marauder era. linkffn(11993367)

You could also try /Timely Errors/, which is just Harry time traveling. linkffn(4198643)

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
