idk just need to remind myself the possibility is there haha

Main character just is not (completely) mentally healthy.

Love can be of any kind: romantic, platonic, familial, etc.

Thanks guys

(If you can think of really good non-hp ffn, fitting the above conditions, that can be understood without reading the original story, pls link that too)

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  The Marauders -- it's hard calling themselves that after Peter -- managed to defeat Voldemort, and are stumbling through adulthood without a war. Harry should get a normal life with his parents and his uncles. But Remus is worried. Because Harry doesn't seem okay. He doesn't seem okay at all.

  Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends. A Sixth Year story. Major spoilers for OOTP, GOF. This story is now COMPLETE. Enjoy.

** Hi! I'm working on one! Snape Centric, writing him basically as a person with PTSD. I'm aiming for a happy ending that is also canon compliant.
