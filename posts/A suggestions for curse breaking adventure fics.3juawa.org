I really loved reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer by Mountain907)

It was all about Harry going on curse breaking adventures will Bill Weasley over a summer. He meets new people, makes some friends, and learns all sorts of new magic, all while going on adventures that would leave Indiana Jones twisting in jealousy.

Most fanfics I've read are usually fun alternatives to cannon, but a relaxing adventure is really refreshing. If you have any suggestions, please do share. :)

*** Just FYI for anyone who wants to read this, it says 'complete' but what it really means is 'I wrote 3 chapters of a sequel then abandoned it'. And it's not one of those sequels that's unnecessary like the Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness' sequels, the story just stops for the sequel.

I might be a little bitter.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

**** You get used to it rapidly, it's really not a pain after a couple of chapters. Far worse is the first chapter, I hate prologues where there's a fight going on but you don't know why or what's at stake so you don't really give a shit. But if you skip it and come back to it in the proper place, it's great.

** Woops, sorry about the title... "Any* suggestions" was what I meant. I'd fix it if I knew a way, but I'm new to the whole Reddit scene.

 

I'm no author and it's nearly 5am, (up late reading fan fiction, I'm sure you understand (; ) so I hope you can forgive my mistake. /bows apologetically/

 

Lesson learned, though. 'Double check before posting. '

** Might not be exactly what you're looking for (it's about side characters and not Harry-centric), but this one is pretty damn good:

[[http://hp-holidaygen.livejournal.com/57249.html][The Sacrifice of the Right]]: When Minerva McGonagall discovers a cryptic note among Dumbledore's old papers, she finds herself investigating a mystery involving goblins, ancient runes, and Beedle the Bard, with the invaluable assistance of Percy Weasley.

Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter./

Very good exploration of curse breaking and the ancient Mayan civilization. Ginny's the main character, Harry comes in later.
