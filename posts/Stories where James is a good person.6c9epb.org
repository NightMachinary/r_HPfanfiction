I have read a lot of stories recently where James is cheating on Lily or he is a distant father or a bad father or he kicks one of his children out of the house. Generally just portrayals of him as an asshole. So I am looking for the opposite. Stories where he is a good and loving husband/father. They can be au or dimensional travel or whatever.


** linkffn(5757945) is a good one. It contains a Harry that travels into a different dimension. It also has one of the better protayal of James Potter.

Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

***** What's your method of editing? I download the fic, throw it into Word (because Docs crashes when you throw 100k words into it), and find and replace.

However, the formatting gets a bit fucked up. Anything that was in italics or bold or centered (so to read like a letter) is ruined.

****** I download it with FanFictionDownloader and edit the HTML file in notepad. Then I use Calibre to convert to other formats though I mostly just use HTML to read at work.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
