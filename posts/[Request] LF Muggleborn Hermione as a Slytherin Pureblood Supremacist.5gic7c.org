I'm curious if this story exists:

- Hermione is a muggleborn, has muggle parents and everything and not a drop of magical ancestry in her

- She gets sorted into Slytherin

- She becomes a pureblood supremacist, up to and including repeating Draco's slurs and eventually becoming a Death Eater. The rest of the DE's just sorta go along with it.

Sort of like a Clayton Bigsby-esque character (who was a Dave Chappelle character).


** Not that she's a pureblood supremacist, but Colubrina's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][The Green Girl]] checks some of those boxes...

*** I actually despise this fic. I'll embrace the downvotes with open arms, but I hate this fic with a burning passion. Just thinking about this fic has made me so furious.

I have no issues with the author, the fic is just... oh my God, it makes me so angry thinking about it.

**** LOL. Sorry for linking it? I didn't mind it, but I know there are definitely some out there that drive me absolutely batty and I cannot fathom how or why they are that popular.

I definitely preferred this piece in the earlier chapters than the later, but it gets to a certain point where you've read so far into it that you simply do not want to not finish it. I'm a bit of a completionist...

***** I'm going to go more in-depth so I don't come off as ignorant.

The fic is, in all sense, a Hermione Granger wank-fest. She's perfect in this story and the world does actually revolve around her. I was excited, despite my loathing for the actual character, to see a Hermione in Slytherin story.

I get a few paragraphs in and I see so much things contradicted. I was like, "Okay, great! I'll get to see Hermione slowly be accepted, something like canon, but different to adapt to the house."

She sits down and the first word out of their mouths are: I don't care, you're one of us now.

Skip ahead and she's getting her Death Eater mark. She gets some jewelry with it on it. Holy God that has infuriated me because Voldemort wouldn't care. He marked Draco in his sixth-year, so the excuse "You need to be discreet" is invalid as Voldemort treats his followers like garbage. He wants them branded.

It's a canon rehash, and I love canon rehashes, in the worst form. Most things are copied word for word and things don't change. The author didn't set up any future plot-points from it.

Example: I wrote one where Harry stole the Stone. Nothing unique, but Dumbledore knows that Harry has the Stone is remaining quiet. (I doubt anyone reads it, but this is a massive deal in later books). The events leading up to canon events need to be changed. I don't want to read a 'Hermione Granger and the Philosopher's Stone'.

It sucks because these fics, no matter how awful, are immensely popular for some reason. I can't fault you, your suggestion was on point, but that fic just annoys me beyond words. It could be so much better if the author displayed some medium of originality regarding it.

****** Thank you for your response! You totally have valid points, and I can see where you are coming from. The gripes I have with it are actually a bit different than yours, but that's neither here nor there. It's interesting to compare notes and thoughts on these things!

I only recently read it (i.e. Maybe two weeks ago?), and I wasn't even familiar with the author until that point. (I hate FF.net and avoid it at all costs.) That's why I was actually able to pull a recommendation without much thought or looking at my various bookmarks...

I found that for myself, I really enjoy Dramione. I think I have read most of the pieces the general audience labels /really/ /really/ good. I've read most of the well-known ones, a lot of obscure and sadly overlooked pieces, and despite painstakingly going through different archives with a fine-tooth comb, I'm finding it more and more challenging to find anything decent.

Sorry to go on a tangent there. Just to summarize and follow-up on your last bit there about popularity... I honestly, honestly do not understand it. I ask for fic recommendations occasionally, and while not just on reddit here, there have been plenty of times where a number of people have linked me the same piece labelling it "phenomenal" and "AMAZING" only to read the first paragraph and go, "really? Really?!".

*** I don't seem to like this author's portrail of Voldemort, the author always makes him have some sort of glamour.

**** It's definitely a unique take on him. I feel like a lot of authors (myself included!) tend to glamorize the Slytherins and certain death eaters...

While I enjoyed The Green Girl (and other pieces of hers) and I can see why Colubrina has such a large following, there are times when I find myself questioning some of the characterization.

** Linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) checks pretty much all of the points, except she does not really become a pureblood supremacist, she just sort of behaves like one.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

** Why Hermione? Wouldn't any other muggle-born OC work better for this? I don't see the point of borrowing her name if you leave her entire character unrecognizable.
