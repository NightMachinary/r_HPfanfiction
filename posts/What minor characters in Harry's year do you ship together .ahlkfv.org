I mentioned the other day about how I adore the idea of Michael Corner and Lavender Brown. I also really like Justin Finch Flecthly and Parvati Patil as well as Susan Bones and Seamus Finnegan


** I've established in my story that when Pansy Parkinson dumped Draco, she dumped him for the Hufflepuff Prefect, Helen Monroe (about whom I've got this entire fanon story). In true Draco fashion, he's not so much upset at the breakup itself, but at being replaced with a Hufflepuff.

They pretend to be best friends, so people just assume they do some BFF stuff together instead of seeing their dates as what they actually are.

*** Hannah can still be married to Neville though.

My head canon suggests that Ginny and Luna are having a decades long secret relationship without their husbands's knowledge. Or perhaps Harry knew, but gave his consent in exchange for “some private times” with Hermione and Ron.

As for my favorite minor character pairing, my pick is Seamus/Lavender. She went through rather large changes after being severely wounded by Greyback, Seamus took great care of her and finally brought her out of the deep depression.

That's nice, but you cannot dismiss someone else's headcanon with your own.

So you see Ginny/Luna and the golden trio. I don't see Ron/Hermione lasting longer than a weekend. Rowling admitted that writing them as a couple was a mistake. Now what?

Also, what's with the polyamorus/infidelity theme? Do normal couples no longer do it for you?

Or is Ron/Hermione no longer considered canon based on that interview with Emma and Rupert about their kiss where she was less than pleased (Rupert was very happy about it)?

As for the movies being canon, I (and others) follow the Wiki's policy that when they're in conflict with the books, the books win, but movie-added info that doesn't contradict the books is canonical.

No. What you are selling as "canon" is the opinion of two actors who were paid to play two rather irrelevant 4th rate characters. Their opinions are not, in any form, related to what is or is not canon. If Rowling suddenly takes a break from her weird "let's shit right here" tweets and adds it to Pottermore, it would still not be canon. You'd have to rewrite the books, and that would be a poorly executed retcon at best.

That's your opinion and you're entitled to it --- but to me, someone officially hired to play a character has some degree of authority to declare facts about this character, so long as "higher-ranking" writers don't contradict them. TVtropes classifies this view of canon as a scheme where what the movie crew have to say is "Word of Saint Paul", while info directly from Rowling's mouth would be "Word of God", and it's a good enough metaphor.

Why would she need to rewrite the book? To be clear, the idea is that they eventually hooked up, not that they were dating all along.

********** Well, if it is to be canon then you need to include it in the canon somehow. Which means an altered epilogue at the very least since the books are the only universally accepted canon.

If Rowling would create an actual book like "The Wolrd of Ice and Fire" and either write it herself or base it entirely on the books, that would be another form of canon since it is a written work by the Author and not some web blog where you can alter things with a few keystrokes.

The GoT/ASOIAF fandom does not have that kind of discussions. GRRM's books are canon, everything else is not. So why does the HP fandom decide to cherrypick the movies for the parts they like instead of either accepting or rejecting them as canon?

** I've had multiple story ideas over the years that have led me to developing these headcanons.

Neville Longbottom x Hannah Abbott

It's canonical but I love this pairing! I see them being friendly throughout Hogwarts due to a shared interest in herbology. Neville dates Luna briefly after the Battle and they break up. Hannah was dating Justin Finch-Fletchley during the war but he was killed by snatchers. Hannah and Neville grow closer as friends after the war until one day he asks her out.

Ernie Macmillan x Susan Bones

Perhaps because they're both Hufflepuffs but I headcanon them as “Hogwarts sweethearts” who start dating while in school and then later marrying.

Dean Thomas x Padma Patil

Dean and Padma get to know each other through Parvati. (I headcanon that Parvati, Lavender, Seamus and Dean make up their own clique of friends.) Dean falls for the quieter and more studious Patil twin. They also both share a love of art. They get together post Battle of Hogwarts.

Seamus Finnigan x Orla Quirke

Orla is one of those characters only named during a sorting so she's a few years younger than Seamus. For my headcanons I tried to avoid pairing everyone from the same house / year. I headcanon that they meet years after the war because they live in the same Wizarding community in Belfast. Seamus has one daughter from a failed relationship to a muggle woman before meeting Orla.

Terry Boot x Michael Corner

Admittedly DAYD may have put the idea in my head, but my head canons for Terry and Michael are a lot different. Terry is the gay son of two muggle borns and after his parents are sent to Azkaban he keeps his sexuality quiet because he barley passed his own blood status and is terrified of being different and drawing attention to himself during the war. Michael is his best friend and while he has dated Ginny and Cho, has had confused feelings. They get together post Battle of Hogwarts.

Daphne Greengrass x Theo Nott

Pair the pureblood Slytherins. I do imagine they were a nauseatingly cute couple who cared for each other and Pansy made fun of them but was secretly jealous that her friend had found love while Draco had broken up with her.
