Day 10 of sitting in my Plague Bunker, and I'm willing to offer any wizard willing to reveal himself to the Muggle world the secrets of modern finance, in exchange for scourgifying my neighbourhood.


** March 30, 2020: Wizards looking to form bridges between the Muggle and Wizard communities prepare a presentation of simple charms and potions which protect one from Coronavirus.

April 1, 2020: Representatives meet with disbelieving Muggle heads of government, and, once they are convinced it's not some awful April Fool's prank, arrangements are made to announce these revolutionary treatments to the public.

April 3, 2020: Excited reporters breach social distancing recommendations and shake hands with witches and wizards. Touching pictures are posted on social media. Wizards are hailed as miracle workers.

April 4, 2020: Healers are deployed to Muggle cities and towns and begin administering these treatments. They work like a charm.

April 13, 2020: Muggle patients begin coming to hospitals in droves with green and purple rashes, some even have sparks coming out of their noses. Doctors are unsure how to treat them. Fires break out in a few hospitals, and 245 people die in these fires before hospitals begin turning more patients exhibiting these symptoms away.

April 14, 2020: Thousands more patients come to hospitals. The ones that don't make it die from respiratory distress. Muggle heads of government begin classifying Wizards as terrorists. Scared citizens go on Witch Hunts. Riots break out in the streets.

April 20, 2020: World War III is upon us, but we fight an enemy that is unseen. People walking across the street or sitting in their houses are killed by invisible assailants. Neighbor fights neighbor.

May 1, 2020: Blood supremacists, convinced they can end World War III and have a world only for Wizards, cast an Imperius Charm on Muggle leaders who are known to possess nuclear weapons. At nightfall, the earth is scorched, buildings flattened. Billions are dead.

********** Not a strict separation at least, but there is a separation. Of course there has been inter-mixing, but not to the extent that Wizards don't look strange when out in Muggle areas. Of course there are those that can pass as Muggle, but they seem to be in the minority.
