So basically, I'm looking for as many fics as I can get where dark magic =/= evil and/or Harry goes dark without being evil. I'll accept any pairing as long as it's written well. I generally prefer Harry!centric, and I'd prefer completed fics, but anything that's huge (120k words or longer?) is okay too. I'd prefer knowing if it's abandoned, though.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]]

129,927 words.

Great fic about what it truly means to be a dark wizard.

Unfortunately it's abandoned by the original author and by the looks of it the adopted author too.

*** That fic is absolutely amazing! It's the reason I actually decided this was the genre I really wanted to read, actually. x3

*** Wow. I don't think I've ever been more disappointed to reach the end of an abandoned fic. The later chapters were really something special.

***** It's too bad the author didn't see any benefit to writing that fic. In their notes they said it was just a waste of time and taking away from her/him working on a "real world" novel... but I can see a clear jump up in the author's writing abilities from the first chapter to the end chapter. It definitely honed their skills.

** The only fic I've personally read that is close to your criteria is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oath Breaker]].

It's told in Draco's POV but it's a Drarry story so Harry features heavily in it. I thought the story was pretty interesting. It's around 200k words and is complete. Just so you know, the Dark Magic user in this fic is Draco and not Harry.

Description: At the start of seventh year, the Malfoys perform a dramatic doublecross and Draco educates Harry in dark magic.

** Travel Secrets is a peggy-sue Slytherin!Harry where dark magic definitions and politics is a substantial subplot, especially in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9666829/1/Travel-Secrets-Second][year 2]]. Each year is a separate book; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][year 1]]; it's up to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10139565/1/Travel-Secrets-Third][year 3 wip]]. Altogether, around 230,000 words now.

** I suggest this one whenever I can:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]].

Completed at 405,903 words of horror. Fucking /Dark/. Holly and Dark magic aren't evil, but just about everyone else is. I get a standard 15% for rec'ing this everywhere (let's see, 15% of nothing, carry the nothing...).
