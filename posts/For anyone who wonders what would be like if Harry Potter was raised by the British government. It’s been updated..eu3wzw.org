Vernon Dursley died of a heart attack before Harry and Dudley turned three. Petunia in Desperation as she could hold down a job at save her life remarried as quickly as possible , To the first decent man she could find. Fortunately, for both Dudley and Harry He was the least ordinary man alive.


** In the completed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][Quoth The Raven Nevermore]], Harry gets raised by one of the Beef-eaters of the Tower of London, monitored and aided by several government agencies.

The name comes about because Harry is a natural Animagus with the form of a Raven, but the story as a whole is heavy on traditional mysticism and lesser-known folklore. Those who have never heard of the three-fold goddess Morrigan will be rather lost in several of the scenes.

Warning, it is a Harmony fic.

*** Okay, This is a crossover Fic for Sherlock and Harry Potter, in the first 7 chapter Harry is under the age of 10 and Hermione hasn't even been introduced to the story yet. Sherlock refers to Mycroft. As the British government a few times, That's why Harry is being raised by the British government because Petunia marries him after Vernon dies just before Harry's third birthday.

** Is it a parody? I only ask because how do you get past that first chapter? Also, unless chapter two goes back to the beginning and starts explaining, I have a boatload if questions and suspension of disbelief won't cut it.

** You know what, I love you a bit and I hate you a bit.

I love you a bit because I did not know this fic up until now. So thanks for that.

And I hate you a bit, because I know a story that has the exact same orogin (Vernon dead of heart attack, Harry raised as a "Royal Ward" - thats also the title) and that hasn´t been updated in a while, so I read your post, got really happy (because my dumb brain thought an new chapter of Royal Ward was up), then got really sad because it wasn´t.

​

But now I am happy because I have a new fic to read. So thanks for that!

​

Edit: "Royal Ward" was / is based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch
