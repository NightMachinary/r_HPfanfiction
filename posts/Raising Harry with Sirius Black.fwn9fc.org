I'm looking for a specific fanfic. It was where Sirius Black went and took over the house of black after prisoner of Azkaban and took in Harry. It went in to detail about the political aspects of pureblood families and the fic took place over the course of the goblet of fire. It was not wolfstar and I can't find it...... help please


** I am guessing it's A Marauder's Plan?
