In the past two hours, I've gotten Story Alerts for two different stories sent to my e-mail. However, there are no back-logs of Story Alert notifications from the past few days when they weren't working. I didn't expect that to happen, but it would have been nice.

But this is still very good news!


** Is anyone else having problems with the review function? I'm getting emails but can't see the full length of the review and then they're not appearing on the story itself so I can't actually see it at all. I think they're old too because I've had nothing all week but got ten just this morning.

*** Yes, I received several review alerts, and I checked - all are about old reviews.

*** I received a bunch like that. They were also duplicates of reviews I've received in the past and all for 'Chapter 1' of the perspective story. So it's probably another bug.

**** Yes, all mine were for chapter 1 as well. Someone was being quite critical as he went and I just felt crap that he'd left so many negative reviews on one chapter haha

** I got two for a story that was just completed. I was hoping that I would get the backloaded emails.

** +A couple of days ago I started getting them again, and yesterday I stopped getting them AGAIN.+ I found out that apple mail decided that all mail from fictionpress is spam and started putting it in my junk folder, probably due to all the alert problems.
