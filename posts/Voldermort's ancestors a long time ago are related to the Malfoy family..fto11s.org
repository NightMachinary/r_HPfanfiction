about 500000 years ago Voldermort's family are related to the Malfoys. The Malfoys are his followers [death eaters] but they possibly could be more than followers. Just thought because they are one of his biggest follower families.

** Well, 500,000 years ago, humanity had only *just* diverged from Neanderthals, so it feels like a bit of a stretch.
