I've read this story somewhere, but can't remember where. It's an M rating, as it is somewhat violent toward the end. I remember that the head of the coven has a son who is starting at Hogwarts while the war is on and Hermione meets him and helps him, as well as acting as an emissary for the coven. She is engaged to Snape at this point and the process within the coven for females to marry their mates means they have to go through this arduous process that is a trial, typically ending in the bride to be being pretty broken for that actual ceremony. Can anyone tell me what this story is? I'm at a loss.


** This sounds insane. If you fire out what it is I totally want to read this.
