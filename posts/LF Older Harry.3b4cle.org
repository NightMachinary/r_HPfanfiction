I'm interested in reading anything where Harry is older than in canon. Any pairing, slash or het, and gen are OK but I'd prefer no Harry/Multi or Harem!Harry. Thanks!

** How old are you looking for? This story features Harry in his sixties, along with most of the canon and Next Gen characters plus a fourth generation. It's a war novel with a strong element of mystery.

*** I was thinking more of like a Harry who is the same age as the twins, for example, or Cedric Diggory. Thank you for the rec though!

** This is a WBWL story with a seemingly perfect Harry where Harry is the same age as Cedric.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, Harry fights to stay ahead of enemy machinations. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
