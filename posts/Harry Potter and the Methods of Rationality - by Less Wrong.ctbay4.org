*** I've said something and been downvoted... this bodes not well... your comment leads me to believe that this is not a widely popular fan fiction on this subreddit...

Should I just delete the comment?

**** You don't /have/ to delete it, but... yeah, it's pretty much regarded as "not good"

**** This fic has a complicated reputation. Extremely popular, but disliked on many hpff forums including this one.

Leave this up of you have a thick skin. There are a few major fans of it that frequent here.

I will recommend [[/r/HPMOR]] if you want more positive discussions.
