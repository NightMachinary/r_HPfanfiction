Do you know anything similar to this one?

The closest thing to this is a fanfiction where in Harry was transported hundreds of years into the past. He got apprenticed to Merlin, but was actually named Myrddin. They were using staves but were in the process of slowly getting them smaller and smaller to wands. I forgot the name of that fic, and it was nowhere near as good as Shadow of Angmar, but it's the closest thing I can think of.


** I agree, It is by far the best Harry Potter/LotR crossover I've read. Perhaps the best crossover from the fandom.

*** Don't get me wrong I like the fic but if anything it is a good Lotr fic with Harry Potter she has little to do. There are / were other better real crossovers, in one that I remember that was similar to SoA, Harry was recruited from the dark legions and has his own ?Command?\\
In another that is deleted I believe Harry ends up in a time around / before Sauron lost his ring with people who are neighbors of the Númenor and live more or less in peace with them (the magicians a little darker Númenor).

**** I mean, sure? Neither of the stories you mention sound familiar so I can't say if they might sway me one way or the other. As for it being a LotR story with Harry I agree but it's one of the many iterations of a crossover and from my point of view is a very well made story it has build upon the lore of Tolkien works through the eyes and actions of a character from another series (Harry). While Harry is not a direct copy of its canon self most if not all changes can be traced to his experiences in middle earth.

In my experience crossovers aren't easy to make the more elements from each of the sources an author tries to add the more chance of a mess it has to become, is it possible that there are more comprehensive stories? yes, can they be good? sure, am I familiar with any other that I have found appealing and of consistent quality? only a few hence my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

I'm pretty sure I've read this a year or so ago, the last thing I remember is Harry and a party of dwarves and elves going to the mountain to battle a dragon, and the next chapter was a time skip with a father in a village telling stories to his child of Harry(?) the Wizard, the child was pestering him to tell him stories about wizards. Is this the same story, or am I thinking of another crossover?\\

******** Well, the original plan was somewhere in the region of 150-180k words per arc (or around 25-30 chapters) as I wanted to somewhat mirror the structure of the The Fellowship/The Two Towers/The Return of the King. That's a fairly loose guide however, as Shadow of Angmar isn't planned in the same way my more recent stories have been. This year I've been experimenting with much more comprehensive planning, and actually enumerate every chapter in my plan. Shadow of Angmar has a path mapped out, but the actual time it will take to travel it is not well known.

Really, I think I should maybe take a short break from updates to bring my plan up to my more recent standards, but I just haven't found the drive to do that yet (as the plan as it is is a massive rambling document that I don't relish trying to organise).

I want to say English is not their first language, but if it is, the first dozen chapters feel like someone who is learning the language. That said, I think that what keeps be going back is the incredibly interesting ideas the author puts forward on magic, it's source, and how it has shaped wizarding society. I also like how it is almost flat out stated that Dumbledore isn't “evil”. He is just so used to being the smartest and most powerful man of his generation that he can not fathom any idea that doesn't jive with his view point. He isn't malicious, but willfully ignorant which is worse in its own way.

**** It was intended to be a story with a somewhat canon-like feel, but with a deeper dive on characters like Dumbledore, and a greater focus on magic. Sadly, of the 100k+ words we did get it was mostly very well written slice-of-life stuff. The technical writing is really second to none, but it suffers the failing of so many fanfics where it was strangled in the crib before reaching the real meat of the story.

I think my love of it may be more centred around what I believe it could have been, than what it really is. I can definitely recommend it, however. In general terms, it is a smart, driven Harry, with supportive adults and directly helpful Dumbledore. It also has some amount of 'pre-shipping' of a Harry/Fleur nature (though it never really goes beyond friendship as far as I can remember).

*** You may be interested to know that I had the story planned out pretty much from the beginning, and I always knew the time-skip was going to be a sticking point. It's probably the biggest reason my updated fell off a cliff as I approached it.

Honestly, the popularity of the story (or, lets be reasonable here, the first arc) took me completely by surprise. I'd always intended to have three fairly distinct arcs, with different but related themes: Finding power, exercising power, and learning the limits of power. Readers really resonated with the finding power aspect, and I knew that my plans for the second arc would likely be less popular than the first.

But in the end, I can only write the story I know, I can't go chasing after what I think people want because that way lies only disappointment. Disappointment for me, as I diverge from the story I wanted to tell, and disappointment for readers as it becomes clear that my heart is not in the story.

I will admit that the current war section has probably stretched overlong. It should be reaching its purpose over the next couple of chapters (which should be the scouring of Goblin Town, and the Battle of Azanulbizar). From there, I am much looking forward to cutting the cast of active characters down significantly and returning to a much smaller-scale travel diary format.

  the popularity of the story (or, lets be reasonable here, the first arc) took me completely by surprise.
#+end_quote

That can be explained by the fact, that, you know, it's among the handful of lotr crossovers that actually respect the source material (instead of raping and then mutilating it).

Imma be honest though, I liked The Power He Knows Not a lot better. It was short, sweet and awesome.

** I don't think it's quite the one you're after, but Jasmine Potter is flung into the distant past and trains Myrddin (among many other achievements) in linkffn(A Long Journey Home). Note that it's officially incomplete, but due to its unusual structure, that doesn't matter; it gives the beginning and the ending, then the rest of it is just telling some of the stories from the middle, so it never really leaves you hanging.

*** I think the Bolrag is something that Harry might encounter in Elves Most Fabulous. I wonder how Howard would square up to such a beast.

On a more serious note, I can understand your disappointment at the time-skip. I planned the story a long time ago, and I could see the skip coming a long way off. I knew it would break the narrative and our connection to Harry, but in order to tell the story I wanted to tell in a timeframe that meant it might be completed before the heat death of the universe, I had to commit to the skip. I'm trying to regain that momentum now, as there should be no more big timeskips to contend with, but I accept that I've probably lost some folk with it.

Perhaps if I can find the time I can do a side-story which covers some minor adventure in the intervening years. I just need to work out what!

**** I think I've said this before a while ago, but the time skip would have been less jarring if you'd done maybe 1-2 chapters covering important events that happened during it in a short and episodic manner. Maybe a paragraph or two each - his first meeting with Gandalf, maybe a small dialogue about the nature of magic between him and Galadriel, A visit to Erebor, him browsing the archive at Rivendell, him talking with Glorfindel about the elven experience with immortality, etc.

It would have eased the blow considerably.

*** This is really heartening to hear. While I love Tolkien, and Shadow of Angmar is important to me it's not as fun to write as the DC crossovers have been. The amount of time and research that does into a single chapter of SoA could probably produce 3-4 chapters of my DC crossovers as is probably evidenced by the fact that I have written 175k words of it since February this year.

Shezza is, of course, one of the Old Gods of HP Fanfic, and cannot be denied.
