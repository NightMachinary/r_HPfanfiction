This can be interpreted in a variety of ways that I would be satisfied by, that I will list.

1. Full-on, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you." level of power, that, due to the Wizarding World being made up of a bunch of dirty pagans, they all attribute to Harry Potter's Boy Who Lived status, rather than God. This would be a nice inversion on the normal Jesus-Harry that is so common in fanfiction.

2. A more restrained version of the first, more comparable to Shirou Kotomine from Fate/Apocrypha's abilities, with Harry receiving divine revelations, and the like. Some people may believe him, and others won't. Harry Potter may or may not grow to have a cult that goes to war with the Death Eaters.

3. A version of Harry Potter that has been raised to be a proper modern Christian by his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon with relatively minor miracles on the level of finding car keys that can be attributed to accidental magic, if that much.


** I have just finished linkffn(12738075) and I have been surprised how low-key Christian could a HP fanfiction be. Highly recommended (for other things as well)!

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
