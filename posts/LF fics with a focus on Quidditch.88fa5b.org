It doesn't matter /too/ much who the main character is. The ideal scenario would be if it focused on a Quidditch league or World Cup as the main plot element, but I'll take what I get. The only requirement is that there should be as many long, detailed and exciting Quidditch scenes as possible. Even better if there are alternate rules that make the Seeker less likely to single-handedly win the match entirely, or if the author really makes it so that the efforts of the chasers and the keeper aren't wasted and it actually feels like they are making a significant contribution and interacting with the other players in a meaningful manner. (I understand that's a bit of a challenge since canon Quidditch is quite silly, and because it's hard to write about sports in an exciting manner to someone who isn't already a diehard fan of that sport, but I still wonder if someone managed to do it well.) Even better yet if the author manages to do all that while not having the main character be a seeker.

Thanks in advance!
