While the overarching plot does involve the usual recognition of feelings/ getting together, I feel as if it is wrong to classify it as a Jily fic. Rather, I think it's actually about the relationships between their various friends. The success with which this is pulled off is what makes The Life and Times a good read, and why it's one of my favourites of all time


** Can you post a link?

** The story felt like a James and Lily fic at the start, and I feel like it may have been the intention of the writer to begin with, but as the story went on, it expanded to other characters. For me, I would've preferred that not to be the case, if we could've had some proper resolution to Jily. Instead, 36 chapters and 600k+ words later, Jily still weren't together and other characters had more progression in their relationships. Eh. That story will always fall short for me because of that. Also, because the prologue is never tied up full circle, and so many things are left unresolved. The writer bit off more than she could chew, IMO.
