** It gets more Monty hall, and the end was /nearly/ a diabolus ex machina.

*** Yep... and then the sequel is a crossover with some sort of random anime, and said sequel is shared with another fanfic, at which point I just decided to quit.

** Yeah it doesn't get back on track. I thought it was going to be a Dark!Harry story, tbh it ends up more like a crack fic than anything else. I actually reread it the other day, it doesn't get any better.

** Is that the one when the author goes all Christian at the end? I liked that fic but that bit was a little bit jarring, even for me.

**** Not in a bad way! But one chapter near the end is almost completely taken up with one character gathering and giving a speech to all the others on the importance of Christ and God and a meaningful life and that we need a source of moral law, and it just kind of comes out of nowhere; there's no build-up to suggest that this character is religious beforehand.

Looking at it again it's not Brutal Harry exactly, but the sequel to it, Hero Harry.

***** See I've no issue with that if it's done well. Like I love the Chronicles of Narnia and they're one big Christian metaphor. But if a character spends too much time explaining a belief to another character for no reason other than to promote an authors ideals (looking at you MoR) it's just awful.

****** The ending of the Chronicles is really confusing though, especially since the first 6 are at least kind of kid friendly. The first six were still good, but the last one was so trippy.

******* The last book is basically one big metaphor for Revelations.

*** Yeah, that came out of nowhere. At least foreshadow your themes, people :( tbh i loved the fic for what it is, but i can't deny it switched personalities at FTL speeds every few chapters.

** It's been a while, so some specifics might have slipped my mind, but here goes...

It's a decently written fic that actually explores the consequences of the sort of abuse Dursleys are supposed to have inflicted upon Harry on his personality. On the other hand, it's many of the standard Powerful!Indy!Harry tropes, including, but not limited to wandless magic (which only Harry even bothers to even /try/ to learn); a Hermione who is oh-so-brilliant but doesn't actually get to /do/ anything interesting [1]; Muggle martial arts and knife wanking; an 11- or 12-year-old Harry casually intimidating adult adversaries, like Lucius Malfoy [2]; and I've probably forgotten the other tropes.

I've interacted with LordsFire in an online forum, and he is, indeed, a devout and outspoken Christian, and a rather conservative one, as far as I can tell; and he does not hesitate to incorporate his religious and philosophical views into his fic, often in ham-fisted ways [3]; but, then, neither does LessWrong in HPMOR. I do think that, as with HPMOR, it degrades the quality of the fic. It's telling that despite having rather vague memories of the actual plot, I still remember that while narration of Hermione mastering a number of magical and non-magical disciplines at a prodigious rate took about a paragraph, a long grace speech by Hermione's father [4] before the Christmas dinner was written out in meticulous detail.

--------------

[1] And, definitely not anything Harry couldn't do, but Harry is busy doing more important things, so she contributes.

[2] Teachers too, to some extent, but they feel legitimately guilty about what had happened to him.

[3] C. S. Lewis was about as subtle as a brick with his allegories, but LordsFire doesn't even bother with the allegory in the first place.

[4] Lamenting the secularization of Christmas, if I recall correctly.

--------------

*Edit:* To answer the actual question, yes, I finished /Brutal Harry/, though I remember only skimming the sequel /Hero Harry/, before quitting it altogether. I'm pretty sure that all the /really/ egregious tract stuff is at the end of /Hero Harry/. Still, I'd probably quit it much sooner than that were I to encounter it today.
