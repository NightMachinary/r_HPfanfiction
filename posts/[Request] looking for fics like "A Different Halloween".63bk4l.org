A Different Halloween by robst [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween]] linkffn(6439871)

I really like the idea of a small change on the day of Halloween makes all the difference for Harry and Hermione life. The writing style doesn't have to be anything like robst but I really like HHr pairings. Just looking for any fics that have the roughly the same starting plot and a happy ending. Please recommend.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

**** It also has a bit of religion from nowhere towards the end. Seemed a bit incongruous to me when reading it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily became paranoid after McKinnons got killed despite Dumbledore's ironclad assurances. They laid a nasty trap for Voldemort and got in a lucky shot. Then they scampered to the continent and tried to hide away, but weren't too successful and had to often run. Young Harry was NOT pleased....

** "30 Minutes That Changed Everything" linkffn(5178251).

Mixed feelings on this one. A time traveling mentor delays a young Harry by 30 minutes at the library, with significant changes to the timeline as a result. I liked the premise but the author later introduces an outlandish training scheme outside of Hogwarts that makes the story very divergent. (You want people to try something new, but sometimes that takes it too far out of universe. This is borderline.)
