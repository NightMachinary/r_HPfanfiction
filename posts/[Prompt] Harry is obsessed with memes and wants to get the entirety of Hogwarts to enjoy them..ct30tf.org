** Linkffn(Thinking in little green boxes) has a little bit like that, with Harry throwing around pop culture references like crazy.

After some time travel madness he tells Voldemort the "I am your father" line, for example.

** "You were expecting Sirius, BUT IT WAS ME, VOLDEMORT!"

"What...?"

"Yes, Potter I know all your fixation for this muggle drivel..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Oh, are you approaching me? Did you finally accept your death?"

"Yes, I cant sacrifice myself for my friends if I don't get closer."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hermione, You could ZA WARUDO and you told me nothing? I HATE YOU."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hello there", said Dumbledore amiably.

"Headmaster Dumbledore" a look of suprise was on VoldemortÂ´s face.

*** Harry launches a spell at the Death Eater before turning around.

"Ah! Your spells are about as strong as a mosquito's" gloats the masked man in the face of the apparent lack of effect of Harry's attack.

"Omae wa mou shindeiru"

It's monday morning and the students are eating breakfast in the Great Hall. They collectively turn their heads after hearing a voice shouting behind the closed doors leading to the rest of the castle.

"Somebody"

Colin Crivey who is close to the doors heads for it but before he can actually open it Harry Potter barges into the room kicking the door and Colin against the wall while loudly singing.
