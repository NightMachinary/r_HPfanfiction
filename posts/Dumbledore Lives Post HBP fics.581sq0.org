*** Dumbledore tends to play a major role in my stories - those he's alive in, at least - though they're mostly AUs where he's a tad more ruthless and more concerned with protecting the innocent than saving the guilty. His plans tend to rely much less on luck as well, and so do those of his opponents. He's not infallible, but he's not suffering quite as much from "adults are useless" as in canon, where kids are supposed to be the heroes.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I think it's not what you're looking for but in this story Dumbledore was alive after HBP. And also some bashing. If you don't mind fluff stuff, you can give this oneshot it a try.

And it's sequel:
