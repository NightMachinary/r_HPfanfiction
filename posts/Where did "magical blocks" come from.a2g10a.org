Okay so I've come across the idea of magical blocks a few times now when reading fics, in which Harry goes to Gringrotts, does a blood test and BAM Dumbledore blocked yah magic Harry.

It's also weird how specific things are repeated, like Harry having a block on his ability to memorize things.

Anyone know why or how these are a thing in fanfic?


** It's just an easy way of answering the "Why didn't he use that ability at this point?."

Just let him find a block and boom, new ability that no one knew about and an enemy (the one who blocked his magic)

** It's not just a fanfic thing, you see this in manga and anime in a sort of way. Like DBZ with the whole unlocking potential stuff. Just an easy, lazy way to power someone up without building up to it.

** Badly done it's just an excuse for Evil!Dumbledore and to power up harry, I've seen some that it's just something done to babies with too strong accidental magic so the dursleys aren't even more afraid of harry, then it's naturally dissolved or never really an issue.

*** I'd agree with that from what I've seen. Also enabling personality changes and dark!Harry I guess.

** Yeah people like to complain about magical cores, but this is so much worse. "Magical gift of occlumency - blocked by Albus Dumbledore". How the fuck can a Gringotts blood test reveal this? What does this even mean? What's a magical gift? Why does Harry have 30 of them and trillions of galleons?

*** Ignoring it being a bullshit excuse for a powerup, the "blood test that spots blocks" thing would actually be a pretty reasonable piece of magic.

Let's start with the assumption that magic has variable characteristics that can identify a person --- their soul's fingerprint or their personality's influence or whatever. It doesn't matter what it is, let's just assume that there's something special about an indidual's magic. We could even take parseltongues or metamorphmagi as extreme examples of this.

Assuming the above, you could use magic (and blood, to carry it) to test the identity of someone. In a world of shapeshifters and psychics, a form of "unbreakable" identity validation is good.

But if I were a wizard wanting to break into your vault, or at least keep you out of it, and I didn't want to fight goblins, how would I go about it? Well, I could either selectively seal the parts of my own magic that distinguishd me from you, or I could seal parts of your magic until you were magically unrecognizable.

And if the goblins are getting stolen from or are being tricked into denying legitimate customers, that's going to piss them off. So they develop a test that can identify what's blocked, who blocked it, and who the test subject is even when blocked and suddenly theives are caught and victims get a clue about their attacker (as well as their money).

Keep in mind, magic is capable of information processing. Magic paintings, the Maurader's map, animation spells, charms with conditions like blisters that spell words of you tattle or oaths that kill if you break them, etc. --- all of them rely on magic itself doing the thinking. If the "blood test" was like the Maurader's map, except it said "whose magic is here?" instead of "who and where are you?", you could have it spit out a list of things like "Mr. X had magic Y blocked by person Z."

** to the extent that fanfiction is escapism / wish fulfillment, this particular trope might be something like people wishing their particular problems like social anxiety or depression (or whatever) could go away in the blink of an eye (or through a goblin ritual, performed in their pure gold ritual chamber which can exist outside the normal timestream and only takes a blood sacrifice of three goblins per use and costs 100.000 galleons)

*** It usually seems to function to make Dumbledore evil though and enable dark!harry I think
