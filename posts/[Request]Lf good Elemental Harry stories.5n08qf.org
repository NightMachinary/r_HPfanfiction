I've read the elementals power and the elemental changes and im looking for more good ones like that.


** There's a really old one I enjoyed called linkffn(Elemental Genesis by Raven Dragonclaw). Like 2003 old.

I haven't read it in years, but I remember I enjoyed it. It's light on the HP canon, but plenty of elemental stuff. They bring back the HP world at the end/sequel, but the sequel was never finished.

** The only one I've read was Slowfox's /Harry Potter and the Third Key./ It was originally written back in 2002, as a post-GoF story. The basic premise is that Harry ends up having his magical powers drained, making him no longer a wizard. However, he develops a different class of powers instead, becoming what is referred to as a "Mage." Think elemental wizard for the idea of it: lightning bolts, fireballs, the works. He's not quite as versatile as wizards anymore, but has significantly more brute force. However, Mages were wiped out over a millenium ago by the Founders and they are widely regarded with fear and distrust, which puts Harry at odds with the Wizarding World at large.

I've read this story and its re-write a while ago and I recall it being pretty decent. It clocks in at 370,000 words or so, so it makes for a nice, sizeable read. I'd suggest giving it a try if you're looking for an Elemental!Harry.

** I like "Elemental Harry" a lot, linkffn(5648259).

"Harry Potter: Air Elemental", linkffn(11995519), is ok, but not outstanding. I feel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] gets a little too formulaic with his Year 6 indy!Harry stories.

  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.
