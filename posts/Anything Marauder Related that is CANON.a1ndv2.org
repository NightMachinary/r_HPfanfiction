  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it. (Fifth year COMPLETE.)

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, “Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying.”

I also have [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/66609][The Marauders Fics]] series - fair warning, there is one in the series that is tagged as Remus/Sirius but it isn't Wolfstar at all (but I won't spoil it).

Linkao3(all the young dudes by mskingbean89)

It's Wolfstar but takes a longtime to get there. And honestly it deals with it so well. Just read it. It's amazing

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! COMPLETE!WINNER of two 2018 Marauders Medals Awards:- Best Characterisation of Remus- Best Characterisation of James2017 Marauders Medal Awards:- Best Work in Progress
