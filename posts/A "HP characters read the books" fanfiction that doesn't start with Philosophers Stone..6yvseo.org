Goblet of Fire or Deathly Hallows is preferred, but I'll take any outside of Philosophers Stone

** I'm not entirely sure what you mean... If you mean like what year the characters are in when they start reading the series, linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by WhiteSquirrel) fits, but if you mean they start reading in the middle of the books I have nothing.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
