Hey guys (and girls),

I have an urgent need for new fics to read.

This time I am looking for fictions where Harry either outright kills Snape for reporting the prophecy to Voldemort (thus making him almost as responsible for the death of his parents as Peter Pettigrew is) or at least forces him to face some sort of punishment (even if it's "only" exile)

Bonus points of Dumbledore gets his, too (He after all set up Harry for neglect at the Dursleys (probably violating a will - as it't highly unlikely that the Potters, in the middle of a civil war no less, didn't have one!) and didn't support him adequately (not that the other professors did, they allowed bullying and sometimes engaged in bullying themselves!))

Note: No slash!

Thanks guys :)


** linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness)

One of the most violent fics I have ever read, to the point of people in the reviews wondering who dies next chapter. Also some very creative kills in there.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

** The reason you gave is not why Snape is killed, but he does get murdered by Harry in Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconias.

*** The reason was just an example - I am not picky...in a way only a dead Snape is a good Snape for me (unless the story redeems him or gives him a different start, like say having Snape discover Harry's upbringing in book one (so that he can NEVER think Harry is some kind of spoiled prince (no pun intended) or a James (or Draco!) 2.0)...I love to hate him as a character (can't stand bullies and not everybody who was bullied (note: I was bullied in school for 5 years, it's partly what made me loath school!) has to become a bully (I don't know if I would treat the sons of my bullies fairly if I ever met them, but I wouldn't outright bully them (not that I am a teacher thankfully, as I believe it's quite the thankless job and not payed well either!))

**** Harry kills Snape in "Faerie Heroes". linkffn(8233288)

If accidental killing counts, then my story "Harry Potter and the Spygirl" qualifies. linkffn(10959290)

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
