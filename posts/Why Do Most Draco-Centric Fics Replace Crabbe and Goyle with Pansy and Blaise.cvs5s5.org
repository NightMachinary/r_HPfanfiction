Any theories? In canon Draco is always with Crabbe and Goyle and they are his main posse. He's only been in a handful of passages with Pansy and only very few times is he seen with Blaise.


** Probably due to their lack of personality in canon, tbh. They're described as airheads essentially. You wouldn't make them genius' by any means, because they're supposed to be stupid or henchmen. Blaise and Pansy are side characters and as far as I'm aware, don't have many labels about their lack of intelligence or personality attached, which gives a larger scope for creation of personality :)

** Because of HBP and, tbh, I think they said more words than Crabbe and Goyle in the books. There's also the cool factor. Pansy is the girl Draco dates and fanon has built Blaise into a smooth, cunning, handsome young man (or beautiful girl depending on the age of the fic).

It's also an attempt to give Draco friends, which, I'm inclined to believe he didn't really have, /but/, going by what JKR says, Nott should be there instead of Blaise.

** I always liked to think that Crabbe and Goyle got into Slytherin because they only pretend to be as dumb as bread. Wouldn't it be hilarious reading about them as master manipulators that got everyone acting just like they want them to while staying unnoticed in the shadow of Draco?

**** Not sure, perhaps linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) or one its sequels? Something where Draco is at least reasonable villain not a caricature like in the books.

What I meant is that it is actual real problem for the authors of fanfic stories. You have to create some reasonable minions for Draco or the power balance is completely off: one Draco with two idiots against relatively competent trio of Harry, Hermione, and Ron (plus Neville, Luna, Ginny, et al).

** Apart from other reasons mentioned above which I agree with, I also think they make Draco look cool, especially when he's paired up with the MC. Also, they are apparently "silver trio" in fanon? (to Gryffindor's Golden trio)

*** I'm pretty sure the 'silver trio' in fanon refers to Neville/Ginny/Luna. I understand why people find Blaise and Pansy more interesting than Crabbe and Goyle, but quite honestly it's complete nonsense to call Draco/Pansy/Blaise a trio. They had like one scene together in HBP on the Hogwarts Express whereas Draco/Crabbe/Goyle are in almost every scene together from 1st year to 7th year.

I feel like Draco's friendship with Pansy and Blaise would be the equivalent of how close Harry is to people like Dean and Seamus. They're friends because they're in the same house and in the same year, but they don't hang out all the time because they're closer to other people.

**** You are right, and I'm right as well: [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Silver_Trio]] The whole point is they make Draco Malfoy attractive as a Main character, fanfiction would rather use attractive, smart Slytherins rather than Crabbe and Goyle. We know that's not true in Canon.

** Well, Crabbe and Goyle senior are both definitively death eaters while I don't remember if it is mentioned in canon about the Parkinson's or Ms. Zabini so I think a lot of authors make the leap that crabbe and goyle wouldn't want to (or be allowed to) associate with Draco if he wasn't his typical canon self.

** Because the actors of Pansy and Blaise are more attractive than the actors of Crabbe and Goyle. And many fanfics likes to either make unattractive characters attractive or outright ignore them.
