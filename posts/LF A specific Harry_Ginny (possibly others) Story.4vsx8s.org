Hello! Hoping the collective group can point me to a story. It involves (at least) Harry and Ginny. I remember Harry being a multiple animagus (own and... panther?). I believe it was time travel or Harry maturing super-quick. I also think he had some metamorphagus ability to appear older. He rescued Ginny from some sort of Diagon Alley encounter.

And now that I write all of that it sounds ridiculous. But hey, we all have our guilty pleasures.

Does that combo ring a bell?

*** Yep, this is it. Harry is a metamorphmagus, has two animagus forms (black panther, black owl), rescues Ginny from Diagon Alley.

***** It was a fic that was started in '06. I didn't get into the whole fanfiction thing until a year or two ago, but I'm pretty sure this one is where a lot of those kind of cliches come from, or it was one of the earliest of them. It's better written than my little blurb makes it seem.

The cliches were there well before that. Rosswrock's Power of Time, which is a similar compilation of the very worst indy!Harry cliches, came in 2002. Year of Rebellion came out in 2003. By 2006, all these tropes were well played out.

This fic is very popular though, so most people read it early in their fanfiction days and end up enjoying it. It is very much like /Nightmares of the Future's Past/ in that respect.

******* Eh, like I said, I'm relatively new.

That said, I still enjoy Taking Control from time to time, though the wandless magic frustrates me greatly. And Power of Time was 2002? I just read it recently because FFN claimed it was published Dec. 31, 1969.

"Power of Time". Story title checks out.

Power of Time is 2003, apparently. Atleast that's when the first comments on FFN are.

********* Yeah, I only read it because of the whole 1969 thing. Kind of amusing, but full of annoying manipulative Dumbledore crap, showing he didn't understand the Prophecy conversation in OoTP at all.

********** When you see a date of December 31, 1969 that means the date has been reset to zero for some reason (an error, or the value was lost). UNIX computers (used to?) measure time in +milliseconds+ seconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT and time zone adjustment puts zero into 1969 for many time zones (especially the U.S. where I'm guessing the FFN server is located).

Standard UNIX time is seconds since the epoch, yes. Javascript uses milliseconds instead.

**** Yeah! I really enjoyed my read through. As long as they are well written, I'm a sucker for some of the tropes that people usually don't enjoy.

I think I saw someone mention at some point that another author finished up the sequel. I think they said that it wasn't all that great, but that it at least provided some closure. I didn't give it a shot because it has been so long since I read through the original that I feel I would need to go back and reread it. And I haven't been up to the task yet.
