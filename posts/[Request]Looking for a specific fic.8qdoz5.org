I distinctly remember one scene in this fic, Harry is in the hospital wing and has to remove his shirt to get treated. However, in this story he has been abused, and makes efforts to hide his scars. Before he can protest enough they're revealed, and it's one of the most emotionally heart-wrenching scenes I have ever read. I don't remember who exactly is also in the hospital wing, but Hermione is definitely there


** I'm pretty sure its linkffn(Whispers in the Night) It has the exactly same scene, though it is a common scene in ff. Harry has a X or a slanted cross burnt in the middle of his chest and back right ? By Vernon on a Haloween ?

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

**** Sure. I agree, it was one of my first abused!Harry fics I've read and I'm not ashamed to say that I cryed like a wailing baby on that scene, specially because of Poppy and MInerva.

Reading back nowadays, for me, this fic is quite garbo, at least in regards to harem setting (really poorly done) with several tropes that I dislike a lot, like "I don't know how to love!Harry" or manipulative!Dumbledore. Just isn't my cup of tea anymore.

Heartwrenching scene and the fic itself is well-written though.

*** If I remember correctly, as his friends were being ushered away they cast a listening spell and eavesdropped on the goings-on, and when he found out he was even more pissed
