Most of us think of self-inserts as more of OCs because the characters are unusually ruthless or brave, but the more I think about it, the more I think that's unfair. Humans are capable of a lot more than we realize. Granted, I wouldn't risk my life to save the world or because it's the right thing to do, but I would do something if my family was threatened. I do think my brother would though, if for the challenge if for nothing else, so it isn't unrealistic that some people would try to change everything.

That being said, SIs where the character is the next coming of Dumbledore is not realistic. I'm talking about ones where they spend years practicing.

Editing to add that if I were in the position to leave, I would leave letters to Dumbledore and a few others detailing all that I know before emigrating to Scandinavia or some shit.


** I view my SI as an OC, because Johannes is not me. He's just different and has a different set of experiences.

A story about myself would always be rather boring.

** SI traditionally, as I understand it, stands for Self Insert. However, a large part of it is also Self Idealized. Most SI that I have read feel like a daydream that someone wrote down. Which is cool, I like them. But they are absolutely going to end up with more and better powers or resources than canon every time. The question is, did the author present it a manner which doesn't strain credulity or without jumping any sharks? Did they remember to increase the antagonists in a proportional manner? Because is you're gonna give Harry a lightsaber, you've gotta give Tom a Death Star.

*** I disagree about the antagonists for a simple reason, canonically Voldemort is ridiculously powerful against anyone /but/ Harry Potter. Harry beat Voldemort by a quirt of magic rather than any earned skill or power and i think you could write a really interesting SI fanfiction without empowering Voldemort by simply showing the terrifying gap between the average or even above average wizard against someone that powerful.

Just imagine someone as powerful and skilled as Remus... but in the place of Dumbledore during the Ministry battle.

**** Which is why any smart SI with knowledge of canon is going to do everything they can to avoid actually needing to fight Tom head on. Lots of allies, ambushes, traps, snipers, dirty fighting and cheating. Basilisk venom is a very conveinant tool for assassins, and if Tom happens to be resistant because of snake magic bullshit, is his wand? Are his minions?

I strongly disagree... I feel like Voldemort is best as a opponent that's easily defeated using the cheat of knowing about the/what horcruxes he has.

The challenge the SI can work against is the world itself... as in politics,incompetence, schoolwork/magic, relationships and so on....

no need to keep the old antagonists around/relevant. The act of Inserting an out of context element, then nullifying it by throwing a counter to it into the soup bothers me a lot.

**** I was being metaphorical about that particular line, kirbing the quote which is originally about Frodo and Sauron. Tom himself can absolutely be curb stomped, but there still needs to some form of tension or adversity. Albus is always a popular choice of alternate antagonist.

***** I like how you changed it to a Star Wars reference. It fits your user name.

****** Not many people that I'm aware of get that reference. Misspelling aside...

And actually, the original quote was LotR & Star Wars. "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, you have to give Sauron a Death Star."

*** It's fanfiction. You can write a power fantasy, and thats okay.

"bUt ItS nOt GoOd WrItInG!1!1!11"

So? Fanfiction can be completely about the reader and author having fun. I've enjoyed power wanks immensely, and I enjoy writing a strong OC.

If you don't like it: fair. No need to read it. I don't like stories with Dumbledore bashing.

But just because you don't like a type of story, it doesn't make it wrong or bad.

** If I see a fic labeled self insert /without/ a pairing. I'll give it a shot.

If there is a pairing, I run.

If it's an OC in a pairing I see Mary Sue and run.

If I see reader, I run.

The only SI's I read are ones where the author shamelessly inserts themselves into the fic and keeps it in their pants.

*** There's no pairing in linkffn(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff). She's just having a great time exploring the world of magic. Hopefully it's enough to make up for being a teen-ager again :D.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** I would change everything I could. If I was an OC I would study and stay quiet. But I would kill the troll and steal the stone. Get a rooster and kill that basilisk. If I'm Harry I'll make friends with it. Oh and no matter what raid the room of requirement. If Voldemort takes over I don't care.
