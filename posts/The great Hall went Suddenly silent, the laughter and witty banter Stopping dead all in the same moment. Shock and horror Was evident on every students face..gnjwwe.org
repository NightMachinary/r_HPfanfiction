The silence persisted until a Furious roar of angry was bellowed from the Slytherin table . Marcus Flint was stand screaming,” Bloody Hell!”

His outrage Seemed to break the Collective trance and And similar sentiments echo throughout the hall until Hermione Granger stood up on the Gryffindor table shouting over the Cacophony,” Everyone who remembers that I'm the Minister follow Harry and Ron into the Entry way. We seem to have a case of mass time travel . I need Susan Bones, Arthur fieldkin and Daphne greengrass with me Immediately. Flint , Can you get the hit wizard together!”

The assenting bellow from the Slytherin table finally Prompted the student body into motion.


** (I have no idea who Arthur Fieldkin is supposed to be)

Apparently, /everyone/ who had been alive at the time of their travel had returned.

It took Hermione less than thirty seconds to realize that, and it took her three to communicate this to Harry, who bellowed with a seemingly wandless Sonorus before stunning three students next to him.

"Auror Corps, assemble, get the Death Eaters! Non-Lethal! Then conjure badges"

In a blur of movement, Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, and an assortment of Slytherins and Ravenclaws were stunned and incarcerated in chains. Flint was holding Draco down with two other second-year Slytherins standing guard, a mix of other students were conjuring golden badges and transfiguring their robes to Auror red.

Ron lowered his wand and Justin arrived and saluted Harry "All done, Harry"

Hermione was talking quietly with Susan, when Daphne arrived a bit disheveled, she looked at Harry with an inscrutable look, which he returned, then she smiled and kissed him, before turning to Hermione and nodding to her and Susan.

"Reporting for duty, Minister Weasley, Director Bones"

Hermione huffed good-naturedly before nodding "Director Potter"

Harry after coordinating with Flint to take count of the students and contain the criminal ones, turned back to them, sidling with Daphne and taking her hand.

"So, have you guys figured it out what was it this time? By Daph's face, I am guessing it wasn't her people"

They turned to her while she was shaking her head "No, we had no major research going on the time room, certainly nothing there could case a mass soul regress like this" she gestured with her free hand to the entry hall, where students were gathered in a surprising mix of house colors, some were embracing and kissing, others had to be separated by the future Aurors in red and Hit Wizards in blue.

Marcus Flint arrived, dressed with the golden and blue robes of the Hit Wizard Commander, he looked at Harry with raised eyebrows before the now-teenager huffed and dragged his wand through his robes, turning them into the golden and red robes of the Head Auror.

"All Death Eaters stunned and accounted for Harry, we also got a few we know caused-are going to cause trouble in a few years, I hope you don't mind"

Harry just nodded, "That's alright Marcus, good thinking"

Hermione then clapped their hands, calling attention to herself "Good, now that we handled that let's go back to how our..."

"Souls." Daphne supplied

"Our souls" she winced, got transported back in time to October 30, 1995" she nodded at Susan who had cast a Tempus charm again and nodded.

Daphne opened her mouth but was interrupted by Ron speaking urgently, "Staff coming, the Toad is with them."

As one they turned to the direction of the door, where the Headmaster, The Heads of House and Madam Umbridge were standing, looking with surprise at the organized Entrance hall, especially at the uniformed students, Umbridge looked rather angry, she turned to look at them and began walking, but was quickly overcome by the Headmaster and the teachers.

"Miss. Granger, what is happening?" came the voice of Albus Dumbledore leading the group.

Hermione who looked like she was trying to recall something turned to Dumbledore and drew herself up "Chief Warlock, I require authentication for a Code Blue-43, clause 4"

Dumbledore immediately stopped, his eyes wide, the other teachers almost hitting each other due to the abruptness of his stop.

The Headmaster's face paled while he looked at Hermione with a piercing look, then he smiled proudly "Authentication is Wells-94, Madam Minister"

There were gasps at this, with an indignant shout of "What!" coming from Umbridge.

Hermione nodded with a relieved smile "Accepted Chief Warlock, may I introduce you to Director Bones, of the DMLE, Head Auror Potter, Hit Wizard Commander Flint and Director of Magical Research Potter, though by this time it was Greengrass" she presented each sending a sly smile at Harry at the end.

Dolores went around the group of teachers before advancing on Hermione, only being stopped when two students in red placed themselves in front of her with raised wands, she then looked around, noticing some 15 students in red and blue were gathered around them, wands in hand.

"Step away from the Minister," said Justin Finch-Fletchley in a very harsh tone.

"Minister! How dare this little-" she stopped when she saw the glare on Harry Potter's face and the ominous glow in his wand's tip.

"I think I can explain this" Dumbledore turned to his staff, "the code Miss. Granger"

"Weasley!" Ron supplied.

Dumbledore chuckled, a happy look on his eyes "Mrs. Weasley used is one only known by the Minister of Magic, Chief Warlock and the Head Unspeakable, in the case of time travel" there were more gasps at these, Snape was shocked, Minerva looked pale and the other teachers were surprised.

"Correct Headmaster, it appears every student of Hogwarts who lived until the year we came from, that is 2002, has returned to their younger bodies"

Dumbledore frowned before he looked back to Great Hall, and his expression fell remembering the many students still there, many younger ones.

The other teachers reached his conclusion and let out horrified gasps, then looked at each other and gaped.

"Wait!" Harry said "Minerva, Pomona, and Sinistra should be here too, and Hagrid, Vector"

"Babbling too" Daphne supplied beside him.

Dumbledore and Snape exchanged a look, noting their name wasn't cited.

Harry looked at Minerva "We had tea at Potter Manor yesterday Minerva, don't you remember?"

McGonagall was lost for words, before she replied: "I certainly do not Mr. Potter."

He turned to others "So only students them?"

"This is a coup! I knew it Dumbledore! When Minister Fudge-" Umbridge was now screeching, her face red and spittle was coming out of her mouth,

"Minister Fudge will cooperate or I will activate the Chronos Sanction and supersede him for rebellion, I am the Minister of Magic from the future, my claim supersedes his own and the wards on the Ministry will recognize it so" Hermione spoke with such authority that Umbridge cowered, before she countered.

"There's no such San-"

"Of course you wouldn't know, you are a mere Undersecretary, only the Minister knows of it, and he can't deny it without losing his post and probably being ejected from the building, now be silent or I will have you arrested"

Umbridge looked shocked, but properly intimated, a dozen wands from uniformed students and their harsh glares may have helped too.

"Good, with that resolved" she looked at Daphne who lowered Harry's wand arm.

"Chief Warlock, contact Head Unspeakable Croaker with the proper procedures, and then..." she massaged the bridge of her nose and sighed deeply "contact Minister Fudge" she rolled her eyes at the groans coming from almost every time traveler who heard her.

Dumbledore looked around with a smile then looked at Harry, "So I take it we won?"

*** Harry smiled and nodded, before rubbing he right eye "Yes, sir, we won, the cost was...high" his voice broke when he glanced at a crying George desperately hugging a confused Fred, he took a deep breath and Daphne placed a hand on his shoulders and started massaging and whispering to him, then he looked up at Dumbledore "but we won in the end, Voldemort was defeated, /completely"/

It was like a great weight removed itself from Dumbledore's shoulders, and he released a breath, before raising his finger and taking an errant tear from his cheek, he then smiled brilliantly and his eyes twinkled "I am so very glad and proud from hearing that Mr. Potter, and very glad to see each and every one of you achieved great things" he then looked at Hermione again.

"That of course, includes you, Madam Minister" Hermione was teary-eyed too but nodded with a smile.

"Well," he looked at the gathered students "It appears everything is in control here, I will go to my office and send the proper summonings" he gave one last look and went, the crowd parted for him with smiles and waves, some were teary eyed too.

Professor McGonagall stepped up, looking at the future Ministry staff with a smile, "I can't say I am surprised Miss Granger, or Mrs. Weasley would be more appropriate, always knew you would rise high, I also can't say I am surprised by yours and Mr. Weasley...situation" she gave a pointed look to the redhead who was wearing a conjured uniform and Auror captain badge on his breast, he grinned proudly.

She then looked at Harry and Daphne, her smile widening "Now, I heard rumors about you and Miss Gressgrass, Mr. Potter, but didn't think them true, is this a recent development?"

Harry and Daphne looked at each other, it appeared even past Minerva enjoyed gossip, and they had thought she had just been corrupted by the paintings. Daphne smiled and leaned into Harry, hugging his arm, amused by the look on Snape's face "We began on third year, Professor, when Professor Snape placed us in detention together" all teachers looked at Snape who looked like he had swallowed a particularly sour lemon and just glared at her.

Harry then continued among snickers "Yes, we fought for a bit, but by fourth year Daphne knew she loved me"

He laughed at her sharp elbow on his side "It wasn't like that, Harry was giving me lovesick looks by the second time we met"

"Well, and by the beginning of Fifth Year we-" but Daphne placed a hand on his mouth, and he suddenly realized where and when he was before nodding at her glare.

"As interesting as our future love lives are, Professor, we need to make an announcement and secure the prisoners" Susan indicated the bound students.

McGonagall's eyes widened at the dozen or so bound and stunned persons that were being guarded by other students in red uniforms. Snape looked furious.

"What's the meaning of this?"

Susan just looked him in the eyes and he was suddenly reminded of her Aunt "Those are students who are or will be Death Eaters and other kinds of criminals, some of them are already marked, she nodded sharply to Flint, who went and dragged Draco back to them, pushing his sleeve up and showing the Dark Mark.

The teachers gasped, Snape merely sucked a breath.

"Well can't say I am surprised by /that/, too" she glared at the unconscious boy, but couldn't hide the sadness and disappointment in her eyes.

"You can use one of the classrooms over there, you can use any...containment spells necessary"

Susan nodded to Flint and Ron, who left with a group levitating the prisoners. She then turned to Hermione."Well Madam Minister, do you want to do the honors? What's the procedure on this? Mass Oblivation? Confundus? Use Harry's...Special Items to cheat and fix time?" she looked pointedly at Harry.

Harry blushed at the implication "I don't think they can do that, and besides I left the..." he then palmed the side of his legs, rubbed them before his eyes widened "Never mind, it followed me here...bloody hell"

Hermione looked interested, Daphne just amused, while Susan just started grumbling about cheating and artifacts.

Minerva looked utterly confused, "I am sorry, I don't-"

"Ministry secrets, Professor, could you calm the students in the Great Hall? We will explain everything then" the stern woman just nodded and went back, guiding the other Professors, including a very shocked Dolores Umbridge, no one noticed Justin casting a light confundus on her.

When she was sure they were out of earshot, Daphne turned to Hermione "Ok, I knew about the Wells Protocol, but I never heard about the Chronos Sanction"

Hermione just looked at her with very Potter grin "That's because there isn't one, I made that up to shut that stupid cow" Harry laughed at that.

Susan just raised her eyebrow at the normally polite Minister's language "So, what will we do when His Incompetency challenges your authority in the Ministry, because if I remember him well, he /will"/

Hermione looked pointedly at Harry, who just sighed, resigned "All three of them"

She just smiled before gesturing them to come closer "Well, I think between mine and Daphne's knowledge of them and Harry's /Second Wand/, we can hijack the wards and make the Sanction real enough"

At this, all four of them smiled "So, my friends, who's up for a little /Coup d' Etat"/

This is just an excerpt from chapter 1 since I'm still working on rewriting it:

The Great Hall was as raucous as ever. With Valentine's day coming up, the Great Hall was practically bathed in pink and red as young couples and lovesick students try to outdo each other in their declaration of love. Hermione had to stifle her grin when she saw Harry dashing like mad into the Great Hall with a trail of singing-dwarves, flying letters, and, yes, even flying mistletoes, running after him.

“Hi! Bye!” Harry shouted to Ginny, Ron, and Hermione as he rushed towards the table and quickly grabbed a piece of toast and a couple of fried sausages before dashing off again as a trail of singing dwarves, flying letters and mistletoes flew after him. The Gryffindor table erupted in laughter as he left. Hermione tried to frown in disapproval at her laughing housemates, but even she couldn't resist the grin that was threatening to break across her face.

Suddenly, the Great Hall seemed to flicker. It was as though a wave or a ripple had broken across time and space and threatened to unravel the very fabric that held everything together. Everyone stopped dead in their tracks. The laughter died abruptly and the loud chatter drew to a sudden halt. Even the singing dwarves stood still.

Then, the entire Great Hall seemed to blur and spin around them. It was like being in the center of a very, /very/ fast merry-go-round where everything around you spun around at lightning speed. Yet, not one person felt as though they had moved or spun around themselves. It was as though the world spun around /them/.

Gradually, the spinning slowed down. As it did, new figures began to take shape all over the Great Hall. They were still too blurry to make out, but some of them appear to be human figures.

The air rippled once more and the spinning stopped.

Then, the entire Great Hall erupted into an absolute chaos.

It seemed to her that the number of people in the Great Hall had nearly doubled in a matter of seconds. There were students, wizards, and witches everywhere, most of whom she could not identify. She was certain she had never seen them before, yet many of them wore Hogwarts uniforms that are identical to her own. The floor of the Great Hall was filled with students. The Head Table was filled with unknown witches and wizards.

And the noise! Oh, the noise! Hermione covered her ears and stifled the urge to cast a silencing charm on everyone around her as many people spoke at the same time. There were confused voices, angry shouts, and all around loud chatter as people tried to figure out what just happened.

“Harry! Ron!” Hermione called out for the two boys. A throng of unknown students surrounded her. She could not see past all the heads. If Harry and Ron were among them, she had no way of knowing. She continued calling for them, but the noise was so loud, she doubted whether they heard her at all. And if they did reply, she wouldn't have been able to hear them above all the shouting.

She kept on calling their name while trying to push past the crowd. Suddenly, everything grew quiet. Hermione opened her mouth, but no sound came. She looked around her and saw equally confused faces amongst the students. Many touched their throats and looked around for some sort of explanation.

***** “MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION!!” A loud, female voice shouted from somewhere in the front. Everyone turned to look. A woman in dark blue robes was standing on top of the staff table with a wand pointed at her own throat. She must have used sonorus on herself to make her voice grow that loud.

Now that everyone's attention was on her, the unknown lady sighed wearily.

“Good.” She smiled at the sea of people around her. “Now, I have no explanation as to what just happened. And judging from your confused faces, none of you do, either. I suggest /all/ students remain calm and wait as we try to sort things out. I've taken the liberty of casting a silencing charm on all of you, and believe you me, it /was/ necessary. If you value your ears, I suggest leaving the charm on while we teachers sort things out. I promise, I will take the charm off in due time. That is all.” The mysterious lady smiled, then levitated herself off the table.

Moments later, they heard her mutter, “Finite incantatem.”

Hermione tried to speak, but no voice came out. She heard a slow murmur coming from the direction of the Head Table and realized that the mysterious lady had taken the silencing charm off from the staff, but not the students.

Since she couldn't see who's at the staff table, she settled down and tried to listen to the conversations going on amongst the staff. She heard snippets of conversation above the din:

“-- is impossible. You know as well as I do that you can't apparate on Hogwarts grounds.”

“... Death Eaters? What are those?”

“Doubtful. Remember that ripple? That's a tell-tale sign of a rip in time and space. I'm telling you--”

“...many are wearing Hogwarts uniforms, or did you fail to notice that too?”

“...time travel /is/ possible, you nitwits!”

“...is getting us nowhere. Can we at least agree on what to do first? We've far too many people in here and I'm not sure Hogwarts is equipped to handle this many people at one time. What are we to do with all these students?”

Silence ensued. For a while, no one spoke. Then, an elderly male voice spoke. It sounded vaguely like Professor Dumbledore's voice, but she couldn't be sure.

“Why don't we at least start with introductions? At the very least, it might clear up some confusion over this time-travel issue.”

“That is an excellent idea. I must admit, I am willing to consider even the slightest possibility of time-travel. We /are/ wizards, after all,” said another, younger male voice. He sounded very proper, almost regal, even. Then, he continued, “Very well, I suppose I shall begin the introductions. I am Godric Gryffindor, fellow Headmaster of Hogwarts along with my three esteemed friends here. And I do believe, last I checked, it is currently 998 in the year of our Lord.”

There was a collective gasp among the staff. Many of the students looked at each other with wide eyed shock and disbelief. Could he truly be Godric Gryffindor? But... Godric Gryffindor died a nearly a thousand years ago! How was this possible?

“Salazar Slytherin, also a Headmaster of Hogwarts along with Godric,” another male voice said.

Many people around her froze. Salazar Slytherin? /The/ Salazar Slytherin?

More introductions followed.

“And I am Rowena Ravenclaw. I'm also a fellow Headmistress, along with Godric and Salazar here.” said the same lady who had stood on the table earlier. Hermione finally realized that it was Rowena who had cast the silencing charm upon the Great Hall and called for everyone's attention in the beginning.

“Well, I suppose I'm next,” said a cheerful, yet gentle female voice. “I am Helga Hufflepuff, and I also happen to be a fellow Headmistress along with Godric, Salazar, and Rowena.”

There was absolute silence. It took a minute for the rest of the staff to digest this information. Finally, someone spoke in a voice that was far too calm for someone who had just found himself in a shocking situation.

“And I am Professor Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts as of 1997,” said Dumbledore.

After that, another voice spoke, “As for me, I am Armando Dippet, current Headmaster of Hogwarts in 1948.”

Hermione froze. More introductions ensued, but Hermione had stopped listening after Dippet's introduction. 1948. If Dippet's here, that means Tom Riddle was too. And that meant... Voldemort was here too.

****** Hermione paled.

She barely listened as the teachers discussed what happened and what to do with the students. Finally, they decided that it was indeed, a time-travel mishap. Or, more specifically, someone must have cast a spell that pulled everyone out of their own times and into... whatever time this was.

Now came the headache of trying to fit everyone into the castle.

The Founders offered to add more rooms in their respective houses and transfigure some things into beds, but with the bludgeoning number of students, everyone would still have to share a bed. Then, Rowena called all Head Girls, Head Boys, and Prefects forward.

Since Hermione and Ron were Prefects, they both made their way forward. It took a bit of effort just to get past this crowd, but they managed, eventually. Once the Head Girls, Head Boys, and Prefects were gathered up front, Rowena pointed the wand towards them and took off the silencing spell.

Hermione sighed in relief. She was glad to finally have her voice back.

Then, Rowena spoke, “We need to have all students stand outside in the field, where there is more room for everyone to stand. All Prefects, please guide your fellow housemates to the field. You know who your housemates are from your own times, I suggest you keep all your housemates together. /Do not/ take off their silencing charm! Otherwise, none of your voices will be heard over the noise. We will take off their silencing charm after everyone's settled into their dormitories, but not a moment before!”

She then turned towards the Head Girls and Head Boys. “Head Girls and Head Boys, you are to patrol the castle. Search for any stray student and lead him or her to the fields to join the rest of his or her housemates. Be sure to cast a silencing charm upon them as soon as they enter the fields. And do not go alone. Pair up. We do not yet know whether the person or persons who caused this had malevolent intent behind their actions. That is all.”

There as a shuffle of movements and a series of shouting as prefects shouted towards their fellow housemates to go.

Both Hermione and Ron waved and shouted for their fellow housemates to follow them, all while keeping an eye out for Harry. They led their housemates out onto the field outside, where everyone was lined up in pairs.

"I still don't see Harry, do you?" Ron said as he tried to peer over everyone's heads.

"No. We need to go look! Oh, I hate that we'll have to wait until we're in the common room. Who knows where he could've gone," Hermione said worriedly.

"Oi, have you seen Harry?" Ron asked Colin Creevey, who happened to be standing near the front of the line.

Still silenced by Rowena's charm, Colin could only shake his head.

"Oh, where could he have gone? Do you think he managed to leave the Great Hall before... it happened?" Hermione said.

"Don't know. He was pretty close to the door, wasn't he? Do you think the spell only affected the Great Hall?" Ron said.

"I hope not. But... merging time periods together would've taken tremendous amount of magic, wouldn't it? I would imagine the Great Hall alone would've been complicated enough as it is. Imagine doing that to the whole castle," Hermione said.

"What if it's not just the castle?" Some Gryffindor Prefect Hermione didn't recognize chimed in. Apparently, he had overheard their conversation.

Murmurs began to arose among the Prefects.

"Do you think Hogsmeade is affected too?" Someone said.

"Or the whole country, even?" Another Prefect said.

"No way. That's impossible. Can you imagine the amount of magic that'll take?" Said another.

Before anyone else could chime in, the teachers emerged out onto the field, including the Founders.

A/N: Sorry, folks. That's all I got for now. Still working on the rest.

** Two big questions would be what age they arrived at and exactly how many were affected. The description seems to indicate that the entire school was affected (or at the very least the vast majority, I suppose a few could've been unaffected and just be weirded out by everyone else starting to freak, but that depends on their personalities if they'd go silent or say something). Also, since there wasn't an instant battle with Quirrel, it clearly isn't early first year (i.e. at least not earlier than after his death). No mention of Ginny, Luna, the Creeveys, or Astoria though, so no clear delineation for if they landed later. Also, who is Arthur Fieldkin? Google failed to find him (and I've yet to actually fully read the play or go to it, albeit I've seen the spoilers), so is it an OC?

** Ok what if it's just the first years who went back in time? Like, Harry's class was attending their 20th year reunion when they accidentally get sent back in time. So the whole fic is a bunch of eleven year olds secretly collaborating together, all trying - and failing - to actually act like eleven year olds.
