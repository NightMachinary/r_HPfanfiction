The night when Voldemort comes to Godrics Hollow to kill the Potters he encounters James in the living room, Voldemort very quickly disarms James and doesn't exactly believe him to be a threat anymore but still doesn't discount the idea that James might know some wandless spells or had set up some traps so he raises his wand with Avada Kedavra on his lips.

What he wasn't expecting James to do was transform into a giant 400 pound Grizzly bear.

In another scenario if Voldemort had encountered a bear in a forest or even a highly transfigured magical battlefield he wouldn't have have had any genuine trouble but since James was a giant 400 pound Grizzly bear 7 feet away from him and in the small living room of a cottage it's understandable that he was caught off guard.

Voldemort is banished that night but not by Harry James Potter but rather by James Potter who comes to be knows as the vanquisher of The Dark Lord.
