** Oh boy I'm recommending this fanfic again... somebody needs to stop me. Actually, don't, this series literally has everything.

In Sacrifices Arc, in book 6, angry extremist werewolf packs start infecting Wizengamot members on PURPOSE so they can get legislation passed that treats werewolves fairly. Harry also has to battle a rogue werewolf pack leader who won't stop infecting humans out of revenge, and breaks off his friendship with Remus because Remus takes the werewolves' side over Harry's. The werewolves also threaten Harry's family/friends to force him into compliance.

It's like werewolf terrorism.

This all also happens after the Ministry basically declares genocide on werewolves, so you feel bad for pretty much everyone.

The first book in the series is linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave). Have fun getting to book 6 lol. There's some werewolf stuff in Book 3 as well but Book 6 is when the furry little problem goes out of control.

*** Woah thanks for the rec!

When u say "have fun getting to book 6" is that because the series is long or because the first few books aren't that good?

**** The series is good, I read the whole thing and I never really read slash before(book 3 onwards I think). It is long and some conversations can get repetitive. For me the biggest obstacle was the angst and interpersonal drama, and a lack of humour to offset it, plus a couple tropes that are now annoying like evil dumbledore. It is draining to read. I don't normally read fics tagged with angst or hurt/comfort, and only occasionally read drama/horror, so I'm kind of biased here.

It is probably the most ambitious fanfic series ever written, and you should give it a shot. I really liked the overall story and many of the AU elements.

**** All the books are amazing IMO, but they are very long, which is what I meant. My suggestion is that you give Sacrifices Arc a chance until the end of Book 2 (the first two books are relatively short). If you aren't captivated by that point, the series isn't for you and probably won't ever be.

** You know...I had an idea for a werewolf character once for D&D.

The concept was, he was from a town that had been cursed with mass lycanthropy, by a mad druid; at nights, each of them would turn into a beast reflecting their personality.

The thing about this particular curse, though, wasn't that it turned people in slavering ferocious wolves, but rather, heroic kind loving happy wolves...who still want to infect everyone.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
So it wasn't a case of painful transformations and easy-to-reject monsters full of hatred, the transformations felt like rushes of concentrated happy, and being a wolf felt great all the time, and it's awesome to play with others, and you just need to give them a quick nip so they know how cool it is.

But the catch is, if you start embracing the wolf too much, then you'll start transforming on more nights, and eventually you'll start having trouble turning back to human. Which would make casting spells and doing other things that require opposable thumbs kind of tricky.

--------------

So yeah, that could be one method of making lycanthropy a serious problem; instead of slavering monsters, it could be the best high ever, and you just want to share it with other people, and it'll last forever if you just give in and let it flow.

  Between Quidditch practice, pranking, Hermione Granger, detention (or, rather, gettting out of it), and, not to mention, helping the escaped convict Sirius Black, Fred Weasley doesn't have time to be a werewolf. But such is his new life, and he can't laugh it off this time.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
