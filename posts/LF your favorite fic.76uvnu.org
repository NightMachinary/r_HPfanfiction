** linkffn(Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi) and it's additional chapters on DLP.

It had a relatable powertrip. Normally when a fic is riding the coattails of a power fantasy it becomes really unrelatable, but in this one really get the sense that he's worked for it hard and that his diligence and not 'genius' has brought him to success. One of the first fanfics I've read, and I once even tried to continue it myself. Couldn't keep the quality and I'm not a writer regardless of my ideas.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word.

The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw)

Since the denarian renegade has already been mentioned this is mine. It's just so much fun to read I could not put it down. I'm reading it again now. First time I was distracted by just how nice it was to read but the second time around I can spare a thought to how natural and self-contained the world feels too. Great stuff.

You should read denarian renegade too. The action in that fic is so visceral it almost feels like it's happening right next to you.
