Hey all,

A few years ago in my youth, I read an interesting story which I remember myself enjoying, although I can only remember a few details about it. I've tried searching on numerous places to no avail.

Harry was taken by some wizards as a baby, and ended up being adopted into Grindelwald's family (or at least by parents sworn to Grindelwald)... his name is changed to something like Alexander (bah, I can't remember) and Grindelwald sees Harry as his protégé.

I'm sure that Harry attends Durmstrang and obviously heads over to Hogwarts in his 4th year for the Triwizard Tournament. Dumbledore is interested by Grindelwald's heir, and eventually finds out his true heritage, but can't convince Harry.

That is about it I'm afraid... I realise how crap this probably sounds, but I remember genuinely liking it. I want to get round to reading it again and see if it is still any good, or if it is actually crap!


** Have you checked on Wattpad.com or Quizilla.com? I haven't heard of any stories like that, but I'll keep an eye out for you.

*** Aaah! That's unfortunate. Do you remember what website it was hosted on? I'm still looking for it in my spare time so I'll make sure I let you know when I find it!

***** Thought I would let you know: I found that story, but sadly it has been removed. :( It was called The Crimson Vanguard I'm sure. Scouring the internet yields no copy of it, so sadly I think it's lost... seems as though a friend of the author had reposted some of his stories (with permission) so I will ask if they could post that one too.
