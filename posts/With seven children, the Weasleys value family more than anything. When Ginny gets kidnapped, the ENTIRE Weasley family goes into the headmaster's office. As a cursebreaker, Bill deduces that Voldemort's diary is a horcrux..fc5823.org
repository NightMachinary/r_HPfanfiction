When Harry gets kidnapped and claims Riddle returned, Ron feels guilty about abandoning his brother in all but blood and tells Bill what's going on. Realizing that the Dark Lord made more than one horcrux, Bill breaks Harry out of the Dursley's home and joins him and the trio on the horcrux hunt 2 years early.


** Yes so much this! I do wish that Bill had been used more in the series in all honesty. He was a curse breaker, he would have been useful for powerful spells that the kids couldn't do.

*** there's a lot of positives to Bill being brought in

- Hermione gets someone to discuss wards and runes and arithmancy with, who's ahead of her peers but gives her a goal to work towards - however, with most of his knowledge being tempered towards practicality, Hermione's tendency towards pure and dry knowledge gets tempered

- Harry gets to see practical magic in action, gain someone who's both a friend and authority figure - and learns the need to channel his emotions/magic constructively

- Ron benefits the most though - having to perform under the aegis of a brother he's looked up to will push him to perform better - and seeing that he's a valued member of the team, not just the sidekick, will teach him to deal with his envy

**** Yes definitely agree! Bill was underused in canon. He was a curse breaker yet we didn't get to see him do his job, we saw him at the Triwizard Tournament, Fleur got a crush on him, they started dating got married, he got attacked by Greyback at Hogwarts, and that's pretty much what we saw, also as a way to have Fleur stand up to Molly and tell her how much she truly does love her son, which should have been obvious in the first place, since she was wanting to marry Bill, but yeah.

***** This is what makes the original series not enjoyable anymore for me. There are so many little aspects of storybuilding and characterisation in them that have so much potential and just feel flat and not exciting at all in the books. For the specific case of Bill, is there even one time in the story where his job is needed for the story progression?

In the end, Harry Potter feels like an unimaginative love story and not like an epic fantasy saga.

****** That ist the negative side of fanfiction. You see many possibilities a canon story could go and find the original inadequate because of plotholes, mistakes and whatever. I have the same problem. I only see the manipulative Dumbledore and the idiot Harry in canon ever more because of fanfiction.

think of it less in terms of an epic fantasy and more of a swords and sorcery style fantasy with loads of little worldbuilding points to it

** A Different Professor linkffn(11950451)

Bill's fairly prominent here. He insist on getting Ginny mental help after the Chamber as well as helping his parents financially with the whole thing. He becomes aware of the horcruxes and is working on it, while also acting as a contact for Overly Helpful Goblins.

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor? Rated T for violence and gore

*** Magic number 7! There's also 7 players in Quidditch, though that might be more coincidental than anything. 7 years of schooling, but that follows from 7 books (or is it the converse?). I just searched for "7 in Harry Potter" and Wizarding World actually has an [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/the-significance-of-seven-infographic][infographic]] about uses of 7 in the series, though I can't tell which ones might be movie specific off the top of my head.
