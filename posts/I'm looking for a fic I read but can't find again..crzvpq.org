It's a snape fanfic where after the the war Hermione keeps snape in a five year magically induced coma for his own protection. Once he wakes up he becomes Harry's slave. Harry is still infected with a shard of Voldemort and is slowly becoming evil. It plays of For Want Of A Nail. Snape is tortured, and hermione, Neville, Ron, and, Ginny have to save both harry and Snape. I can't find this fic again anywhere. Any ideas where it might be.
