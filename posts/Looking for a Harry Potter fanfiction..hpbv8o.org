:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First of all this is my first time posting on reddit so my apologies if I am posting this in the wrong place.

I am looking for a Harry Potter fanfic that I once read on Potions and Snitches, I think it was also posted on FanFiction but I am not sure about that.

It was a oneshot if am not wrong and in it Harry had been transported to an alternate universe. He wasn't able to get used that universe and was mostly cold and silent. Snape was still his usual self and it was because of his familiar hateful attitude that hadn't changed that Harry end up starting talking to him and getting along with him.

Edit1: I think it was in third Pov from Snape's (or Harry's) side.

I can't really remember much of it but I think they talked about Harry's old world and how his parents were dead there and I think that at some point James Potter had learned those two were getting along and was jealous.

Edit 2: Harry's parents were alive and I think the Harry of the alternate universe was alive. If so he was very different from Canon/Og-Harry.

I am sorry for the lack of details, but I can't remember much of it.

It isn't much but I hope someone can help me find it, thank you.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

*** I have actually read this one before but no, it is not it. i think it was more in third Pov from Snape's side. I should have probably mentioned that in my above post. Thanks a lot anyway.
