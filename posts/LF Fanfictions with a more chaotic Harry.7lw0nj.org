Especially Fanfictions in which he stops following people like a well trained puppy. I dislike the fact that almost everything I have read until now was either - Harry sides with Dumbles or Harry sides with Voldemort. And dont get me started on those Harry/Voldemort stories. What the .... A more chaotic Harry, that is less superboy-Jesusreborn or wannabe-Voldemort. Hope there are stories like that.

Merry Christmas


** linkffn(11446957). A Harry that cares only about his own goals, with a Fleur pairing. Very good read.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Honestly. That would be more interesting than reading another Harry Potter/TMR/DM/SS whatever- slash story.

Something well written and more unique.

Or maybe a crossover in which HPs Magic is absolute. Simply because I hate seeing crossovers in which HP is a lil bitch.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

***** I second Havoc. Harry doesn't give 2 shits about local laws, and is generally an agent of chaos. I thinknhe actually gets called such at one point.

***** I started reading that one. I stopped somewhere around the middle, because it would be a shame to have to wait for more chapters. So I put it on hold until its done. I hate myself for it, but its going to be worth it :D
