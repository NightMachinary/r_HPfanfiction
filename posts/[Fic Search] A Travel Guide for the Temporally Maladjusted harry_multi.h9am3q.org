Hi I'm looking for A Travel Guide for the Temporally Maladjusted by jude and its sequel Anomie In Five Easy Steps. Harry/multi and it was originally on [[https://glassesreflect.net][glassesreflect.net]] .

Summaries below if it helps jog anyone's memory!

*A Travel Guide for the Temporally Maladjusted*

Colours fade; when he concentrates they return. The world swims in black and white, then sepia tones of lace-patterned afternoon sunlight through the curtained windows.

*Anomie In Five Easy Steps*

He turns around. He's standing in the middle of a grassy plain and behind him is a door in a door frame, and the door is still open so he can see his room, but he can't see the walls. It's like a door into nowhere. Another dimension. Hell, Hades, She'ol. A sequel, of sorts, to 'A Travel Guide for the Temporally Maladjusted'.

Lemme know if you have them and I will be forever grateful! I've tried the waybackmachine but the stories are password protected :(
