I've read far too many unforgiving Harry stories, you know the ones "the time to stun is over, Dumbolddork has been holding us back with his manipulative pacifism, let's kill and torture everyone who's ever been seen with a death eater and let's kill umbridge and maybe Ron too for falling out with me that one time!"

**** I'm personally fine with Harry being more forgiving with flawed people on his side, even though one was an asshole and the other a monumental failure in political and military leadership. But I would be utterly merciless with those sadistic genocidal maniacs knowns as Death Eaters. They shall have my forgiveness only after justice had been carried out to the full satisfaction of their victims. As for Voldemort, he shall have my forgiveness after rotting in hell for an eternity. For Umbridge, I would turn her over to the Muggleborns she had wronged and tortured. They would be allowed any means they deemed fit for her.

***** I think the problem here is that cannon is very black and white in terms of Voldemort+DE=evil, Dumbledore+Order=good

But I can imagine fic where it is showed that not all Voldemort supporters agreed with murdering/toturing etc. They could believe in blood purity and their supremacy, but they wouldn't want to kill/torture everybody else. Voldemort probably didn't look like a maniac from the beginning neither when they joined. But those people even if they didn't agree with Riddle, they couldn't step back - one doesn't simply leave the Dark Lord. So they had to go with it. Think about Draco's situation in the 5th year - you can go far to protect your family.

So I can imagine Harry to forgive some enemies, just like Dumbledore forgave for example Snape.

** Seconded. I would love to see stories with 'forgiving Harry' as well. But not 'stupid forgiving' but more like 'Dumbledore forgiving' :)

I know he is characterized as very forgiving in my favorite fic In Blood Only by E.M. Snape, but it is a severitus story with heavy focus on Harry/Snape relationship so it is not for everyone.

** Linkffn(the Pureblood pretense)

Harriett has a very forgiving nature there, although it's not advertised much. As the story progresses it becomes obvious that she is either very understanding of people's flaws, or just doesn't care enough to hold a grudge.
