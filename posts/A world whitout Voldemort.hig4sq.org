I would like to read a fanfic we're Voldemort never existed. There for Harry wouldn't be the chosen one and James and lily would be alive and abel to tase Harry. Or just a word that Voldemort is not a part of.


** It was a one-way trip to Harry's brain, and all of his nerves were instantly saturated by the current. He lost control over his spasming and jerking body, his limbs flailing wildly. He couldn't do anything, he was suffocating, writhing here and there as if his stirring could move him away from the infernal crackling. It lasted endlessly, every cell in him seeming to scream in agony, and he could not even bat an eyelash while the waves of pain swept over him, turning his body into a stiff, rigid puppet. The boy wanted to curl up in a ball but his arms were unresponsive and he could only tuck his head in, whimpering pitifully.

What had he done to deserve this? Why? Why were his parents torturing him by repeatedly using a taser on him?

Sorry, I couldn't resist after reading

** linkffn(7613196) In this series, 'Voldemort' doesn't exist because Tom Riddle became a successful politican instead of a dark lord, the war never happens, and James and Lily raise Harry.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** He didn't quite never exist, but thus far Voldemort has not posed any threat to Harry at all in linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay). Professor Quirrell? Stuck in the upgraded potions trap and abandoned by Voldemort. The basilisk? The diary was handed in to Dumbledore immediately, and the basilisk is now teaching Parseltongue to baby dragons. Peter Pettigrew? Found out by the kitsune twins, now rotting in Azkaban. Barty Crouch? Ambushed at the world cup by most of Harry's friends at once, also rotting in Azkaban. The Tournament? Proceeded perfectly normally, Harry helped operate a camera for the second task.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Harry ends up in an alternate universe without Voldemort and is placed into the custody of his the Potters. It's all about him learning to adjust to living in a world not at war.

linkao3(How Like Home by waitingondaisies)

Also, there is no Voldemort in linkao3(The Incantation of the Oak-Priest by relic_crown) because Tom Riddle inadvertently hitches a ride with Harry to a future where he no longer exists. But this world is not without its own nascent threats.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.
