:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the name of this fic. All I remember is Harry attends this school and the location was basically only known through word of mouth. Him and a group of random people had to go on this adventure through these mountains and plains that held monsters, traps and puzzles just to even reach the school.

I remember moody also attended which Harry mentioned to him at some point, I remember there being werewolves, vampires even a goblin werewolf. I believe he learned blood magic at that school? And it had a headmistress with some big cat familiar If I remember correctly.

Never actually finished reading all of it so hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about so I can finish it.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
