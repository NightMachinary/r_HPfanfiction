This is an idea I see often being proposed in fics and in discussion wrt Harry in Slytherin and I'm wondering if most people think it has basis in canon?

I guess there are a lot of factors to consider. Despite being in Slytherin and it's associations, they're all still regular kids, so we'd have to say at least 4/5s wouldn't be capable/willing offhand. Out of the rest (presumably older students) I'm sure there'd be a fair few who wouldn't be opposed to the idea of him dying, just based on the number of Death Eaters' kids who've presumably been raised to hate him, but I think you'd have to look at the practicality and reasoning. Mainly, what purpose would it serve?

The obvious being hatred/revenge for killing Voldemort, but if we assume most of the kids who'd be willing are children of Death Eaters, we'd have to consider that most of Voldemort's craziest most devout followers (the ones who'd happily screw themselves over killing Harry) are already in Azkaban. Although they could have kids in Hogwarts and be in some contact with them, most likely they're already mad and most of the kids have limited contact. The rest of the Death Eaters are intentionally free, like the Malfoys. I really can't see Lucius throwing away Draco's life just for revenge on Harry. Like most of the free DEs, he doesn't seem that pointlessly loyal. I think the rest would be similar, and wouldn't allow their kids to harm him properly.

Of course, if they could get likely away with it I'm sure more would be willing to take the risk. But I really don't think any students would have a decent chance at getting away with murdering the boy-who-lived in cold blood under Dumbledore's nose. Witnessses via students/portraits/ghosts/, veritusetum, legilimency, magic-detection, etc. would provide way too much evidence. I think they'd pull out all the stops for Harry.

Of course,we know one student successfully committed a murder and got away with it, but I think the Tom Riddle/Myrtle situation was too different to compare. The murder weapon (basilisk) was completely unheard of/unexpected, so no proof from that angle; Myrtle definitely wouldn't have earned the same fanfare as murdering Harry would; Riddle had already established himself as a charismatic popular prefect figure, which our killer likely wouldn't have since this would be a crime of opportunity; and Riddle has an easy scapegoat complete with convenient murder weapon (Aragog) in poor Hagrid.

Although I think some might want to, I can't see many (if any) kids being willing or able to throw their lives (or souls) away simply for vengeance on behalf of a Dark Lord they have every right to believe is dead.

It also begs the question that if any student was desperate enough, why would being in a different house stop them? Why couldn't they work out how to sneak into Gryffindor or get him elsewhere if there are such devoted bloodthirsty students?

What do you guys think? Would other students attack/kill him or is it a bit of a reach?

tl;dr: do those â€˜if Harry was in Slytherin an older student would murder him within the month' ideas/stories have any merit? Do you think any students would actually be willing/able to murder the BWL or do you think it's a bit of a dramatic exaggeration and doesn't have a basis in canon?


** I don't think it has a basis in canon at all. We know that Draco (death eater son and notorious bigot) attempts to befriend Harry. I'd imagine other Slytherins would try to do the same were it not for the house affiliation.

*** To be fair, the Malfoys aren't as bad as some like the Lestranges, who even hate half-bloods. Lucius is even described as hoping Harry would grow up to be the next Voldemort when the curse deflected off him. Still, I think it's more likely that it starts off with him being bullied, but as Voldemort comes to prominence it's more likely to escalate.

***** Sure, it's directly stated on Pottermore:.

#+begin_quote
  Like every other child of Harry Potter's age, Draco heard stories of the Boy Who Lived through his youth. Many different theories had been in circulation for years as to how Harry survived what should have been a lethal attack, and one of the most persistent was that Harry himself was a great Dark wizard. The fact that he had been removed from the wizarding community seemed (to wishful thinkers) to support this view, and Draco's father, wily Lucius Malfoy, was one of those who subscribed most eagerly to the theory. It was comforting to think that he, Lucius, might be in for a second chance of world domination, should this Potter boy prove to be another, and greater, pure-blood champion. It was, therefore, in the knowledge that he was doing nothing of which his father would disapprove, and in the hope that he might be able to relay some interesting news home, that Draco Malfoy offered Harry Potter his hand when he realised who he was on the Hogwarts Express. Harry's refusal of Draco's friendly overtures, and the fact that he had already formed allegiance to Ron Weasley, whose family is anathema to the Malfoys, turns Malfoy against him at once. Draco realised, correctly, that the wild hopes of the ex-Death Eaters -- that Harry Potter was another, and better, Voldemort -- are completely unfounded, and their mutual enmity is assured from that point.

And this matches up with what we see in Book 1. Draco immediately tries to befriend Harry when he realizes who he is, he doesn't try to demean his blood status or that of other half bloods.

**** Slytherins are /supposed/ to be opportunistic schemers. My takeaway from the books is that Malfoy embodies Slytherin ideals to the core, but makes a lot of personal and character mistakes, especially because he's the in the same year as Harry.

Harry surviving Slytherin would come down to a lot of old families agreeing to an alliance of sorts to "bring him over to the light" so to speak, and I'd see Harry being swarmed by people who not necessarily respect him, but honor him in some sense. A begrudging respect for Voldemort's defeat. They'd defend him, but not outright help him like Gryffindor does. Muggle-borns make it into Slytherin occasionally, too, and they likely need to be brought up to speed and/or have a good reason to be there.

You are right though, it does just take one lucky / pissed off 6th or 7th year to Avada the kid and be done with it.

** The others' reaction to Harry being in Slytherin would certainly be quite interesting.

I've been bouncing about my own ideas for such a story, but the basics are, most think he's probably the next Dark Lord and/or the reincarnation of Voldemort and try to suck up to him; others profess that it's their solemn duty to avenge He Who Must Not Be Named and murder him, but spend more time squabbling on how to do it than actually doing it, and when they do, it fails miserably; and there's a bare few /sane/ ones who long ago gave up on telling the rest of them that he's an 11-year-old kid who can't even cast /Wingardium Leviosa/ and is beginning to think they're all a little funny in the head.

(You get more of a plot out of this when you factor in those Slytherins who are themselves trying to become Dark Lord, with varying degrees of success and dedication. Plus the other Houses. Plus Professor Snape.)

How would Harry being in Slytherin make him a bigger target than he already is?

Sure there /may/ be more opurtunity for a Slytherin to kill a kid from their own house than from another house due to more shared spaces... But i don't think it would be likely.

** No. A slytherin is too cunning to be that blunt. Maybe ruining his repuation...but I only expect the diehard Vodemort supporters to think of that.

Truth is Slytherins seek items of value than can be used to thier ends at one point in time. Harry may have killed Voldemort but he is also powerful, has social status among both the purebloods and muggleborns/half bloods. He has immense political value- either as a minister, an influencer or just as marriage material. He is the "saviour of the wizarding world". Not even death eaters would risk the backlash from that sort of brazen kill. Maybe in the darkness in disguise but thats another story!

I think so too, and this is part of what I wanted to tackle in a as-yet-unwritten SlytherHarry fic idea I've had periodically nibbling at my brain for a few years.

Basically, out of the Slytherins - and especially the ones in his year - you'd have Malfoy and those like him, who would basically try to get on his good side, and then bully him almost constantly when that doesn't work out. You'd have a few more opportunistic ones who try to leverage his unusual fame for their own ends, and then you'd have one or two who, for whatever reasons, genuinely do want to get to know him and end up his friends...though they'd still think him weird for trying to be friends with non-Slytherins(because that's who Harry /is/), but they'd go along with it anyway.

Problem I have is, I want to set up a situation where the inter-House relationship is more complex than "Harry's House = Good/Other House = Evil and/or Stupid/Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff = Irrelevant".

** Nah, I don't think the Slytherin kids are murderers. People have this tendency to underestimate just how hard it is do deliberately murder someone. Look at Draco in canon. For years he goes around thinking he's big and bad, gleefully talking about how he'd like all Mudbloods to die... then in book six, when he's actually called upon to DO something and kill Dumbledore, he completely goes to pieces.

I think Harry's Slytherin housemates might THREATEN to kill Harry in his sleep, but wouldn't actually DO it. A few painful and/or humiliating pranks, though... that I can believe.

** The thing is: Why didn't it happen with a Gryffindor Harry? Sure there are less opportunities, but no self-respecting Slytherin would commit a /cold-blooded/ murder of opportunity. True, not all of them are that smart, but the ones not smart enough also have less opportunity.

I honestly think that a Harry who has established himself in the House by befriending some of them is about as save as he was in Gryffindor. Basically, if Harry shakes Draco's hand in the train, it lays the seed of doubt needed for a Slytherin to reconsider the plan. Malfoy means power. The Potter name means power. Such power also means an equivalent amount of retribution. No, the young Slytherins are too scared and the old ones too smart to risk it, in general.

If there are one or two fanatic outliers who want to avenge their parents, it only makes for a good little plotline, I'd say.

** No. The idea that being in Slytherin will get you murdered by sole virtue of being in that house is ridiculous.

Switching spells are a thing, and it's something that second years learn. If you really wanted to kill a student, all you'd have to do is brew a poison (or smuggle it in somehow) and switch it with whatever the victim was going to drink.

Disillusionment charms, and silencing charms are both taught in the school to upper years. Using those, and waiting at the entrance to the common rooms of other Houses to sneak in, and do whatever it is that will kill the intended victim isn't something that would be difficult for a fifth or sixth year student. Or even a talented third or fourth year student.

Same goes with invisibility cloaks - they're rare, but not unheard of. Getting one and using that as an alternative to disillusionment is certainly a possibility.

Or, just use polyjuice potion, you know, like a 13 yo Hermione, and implicate someone else with the crime.

Stunning spells are sort of fourth year material - it doesn't take a lot to stun the victim as they go to the bathroom, and fling them off a tower. Or even just use a beater's bat, if you're worried about magical signatures (or whatever else is used in magical forensics).

Being in Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw does not suddenly give you magic protection against these things just because you're in those Houses as opposed to Slytherin. If someone is that determined to kill, they are going to find a way to make attempts on the victim's life, no matter what.

TLDR; this whole "being in Slytherin will have you dead by the end of the week" trope is put forward by overenthusiastic authors (usually ones who are convinced that Slytherins can be nothing less than good little Dark wizards) who don't think twice before jumping the gun.

I could see one of the older Slytherin students going after Harry; would attack Harry I could see Slytherin Harry being a loner because of this; or even befriend Muggleborns who don't get the big deal of why Harry is in Slytherin, matters.

Perhaps Harry would try and show that him being in Slytherin isn't a bad thing, or will snap at people if they try and do anything to him.

There has to be a reason why the sorting hat told Harry that he could see him there (More than because Harry had a Horcrux inside him or other means); maybe he could change how people view Slytherins? Who really knows.

** I do think he'd be killed, but I don't think the entire house would be after him or anything. Most of the younger years are just too young to contemplate it, and there are always opportunists like Malfoys or the occasional half-blood who probably isn't out to get Harry on blood status. But all it takes is one 7th year, and the 7th years when Harry first enters Hogwarts are old enough to remember their parents, the end of the first war with Voldemort, etc. If Bellatrix had a kid for example, or if Pansy was a 7th year when Harry was a 1st year, I could completely see them killing Harry and making it look like an accident.

I also think there's a possibility that the older years would "bully" Harry but he could get accidentally killed.

** No. We don't have any reason to think the Slytherins would immediately be hostile towards him, Draco even tries to become friends with him, and even if they were, they're children. Even when things were getting serious in the sixth book, no one tried to kill Harry or anyone else inside the school.

To be honest, I think he would have ended up fitting in okay if he was in Slytherin. The Gryffindors are as bigotted as the Slytherins and people like Ron would have taken the same dislike to him as Draco did when he was sorted into Gryffindor. I think that would have pushed him into being friends with the Slytherins. There might be a few ridiculously fanatic people in Slytherin and he couldn't be friends with them, but most of them are probably just mildly racist at worst when they don't have Voldemort stoking the fire. The ones that were close-ish to him would probably tone it down when Harry was around.

** In my current ongoing, I have a fem!Harry named Rose who gets sorted into Slytherin - and survives mainly by being more Slytherin than everyone else. First night, everyone is reserved and polite, but obviously wary of her and others. Except our lad Draco, of course, who tells Rose that he will have her kicked out of the house because she doesn't belong.

Rose knocks him on his ass - winning the respect of her year mates, who were already tired of his shit, and of the older years, most of whom were appalled at how Draco had acted more like a Gryffindor by calling her out on the first night. Later, she verbally crushes Lucius Malfoy by quoting one of his own speeches, shaming him publicly while remaining completely polite and proper. She learns very quickly how to play the game, and she plays it well.

It works because not only does she lean in to what being Slytherin means, but that that particular version of Slytherin places more emphasis on subtlety, which she has to spare. The house goes along with it because, when they really listen to what she is saying, they can't find a single fault in what she has been saying all along.

So, would Harry get his ass killed in Slytherin? Maybe. It very much depends on both the version of Harry we're looking at and the version of Slytherin. Beyond Draco and his bookends, and maybe Pansy, we know little of his year in the snake pit, so most fics use Daphne and Theo and others to tailor the house to the story - which works, but doesn't really tell us how a canon Harry would do.
