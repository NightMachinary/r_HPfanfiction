Basically a scene where Harry has a sword and can block any wizard curse. He then goes on a hallway rampage and takes out all the death eaters and is bad ass while at it.


** 'Harry, I am your father' said Sirius dramatically.

'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO'

**** But Harry's blood was used to make Voldemort's body, so if anyone is the father it's Harry.

***** Wasn't there one where Harry time traveled into the past to fight Nazis, then later after he came back during the graveyard scene he reveals that he's Voldemort's real father?
