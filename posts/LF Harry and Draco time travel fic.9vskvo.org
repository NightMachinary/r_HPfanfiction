It starts off in a potions class where they are brewing a potion that allows you to glimpse a moment in your future. Harry and Draco make a mistake in their brewing which propels them into their future bodies. They have left the wizarding world for the most part and are living in a flat mostly as muggles. Hermione is married to a muggle and Ron is engaged to Lavender.

Any ideas??
