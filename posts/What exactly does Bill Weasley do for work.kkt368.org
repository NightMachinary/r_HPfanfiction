I know he is a curse breaker for Gringotts in Egypt. But...Gringotts is a bank. Why do they need to be in Egypt? And break what curses? Like are they looking for treasure that has curses protecting it?

This feels shady with very imperial/colonial vibes to me lol.

Are there more detailed canon answers? Any theories/head cannons? Or any fics that give ideas about this?


** My headcannon was he is a magical tomb raider. We have all the mundane tombs the goblins are searching and acquiring treasures from any magical space in the mundane tombs and finding magical tombs.

Otherwise I don't understand what a cursebreaker in Egypt would do.

** I am not sure if there is much of this in canon. So I am rereading for the first time since childhood and I know in one of the early books (I think Prisoner of Azkaban) it mentions his work in Egypt because the family visited him. And the twins tried to lock Percy in a pyramid (???) or something like that. Yeah, he breaks curses to get treasure from pyramids. We know about the treasure from the classic line about the goblins not giving a damn about what he looks like as long as he brings home lots of treasure. (You know, when Molly made comments about his hair and earring).

I can't remember if anything is mentioned in the later books. Young me passed right over everything Bill related, meanwhile adult me is all about him.

The other big source of information is in OotP when discussing careers:

  “You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.” He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking.

  “Listen to this: /Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad.../ They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!”

  “I don't much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?

** It's definitely got imperialism overtones to it, which I /assume/ shows how little thought JKR put into it. "Hmm, I need cool occupations for the older brothers. How about, uh, dragon tamer and, um... tomb raider." Because yeah, how does that work anymore? Either you're hired by the people who own the pyramid, or you're a thief. /shrug/

I've seen fanfics try to make this less gross, by having the Egyptian government hire Gringotts as general contractor for curse breakers (contradicting the bit in GOF where Bill says "no one at the bank gives a damn as long as I bring home plenty of treasure"). Or they'll have Bill working in conjunction with archeologists and anthropologists, and any treasure he finds must be sold to them at market value.

*** One way you could look at it is that perhaps Gringotts is having curse breakers search these tombs for goblin made treasures, because the goblins' cultural perspective is that these items should have been returned when the wizard owner died to their goblin creators (they believe these goblins to be the item's true owner per the seventh HP book). Given Bill's goblins sympathies this could also make sense. Either way a fic exploring either idea would be cool because it's definitely something that warrants further analysis.

**** I like this interpretation: Gringotts might have negotiated a discounted rate (or free?) in return for being able to take any Goblin treasures found in the pyramids. Gringotts gets cultural heritage returned and so does Magical Egypt.

This would be an interesting take, because it would probably make Gringotts' curse breaking wing the closest thing to a charitable organization that the Goblins would do. Would make what Bill does far less morally questionable.

Nobody uses the term "morally gray" but when one heroic character argues that slavery is wrong and another heroic character argues that house elves are happy, the reader can see that this is a complex issue. Likewise, the author can show the reader things beyond Harry's opinions by using some of her other characters.

I'll agree that JKR /often/ fails to discuss the moral ambiguity of her characters' actions, though.

** I think it could be a bit imperial, but I have always expected, that it is not like British are helping Egyptians, but that the local branch of Gringotts collects best employees from all over the world.

I would think that his job is being a tomb raider a bit, but combined with cleaning some old sites in Egypt from Dark Wizards who were complete dominating the area in the ancient times. So, the treasure is kind of payment for the services obtained.

I wrote this in one unfinished story of mine (Bill chats with Ron during the latter's stay in the Shell Cottage during DH):

#+begin_quote
  “Let me just ask couple of questions.

  What did I do last couple of years before I returned to England?”

  “You worked as a curse-breaker for Gringotts in Egypt.”

  “Exactly. And what do you think was my day-to-day work? What exactly did I do?”

  “Well, I suppose, breaking curses on some charmed objects? Breaking into pyramids and some ancient tombs, I suppose?”

  “Well, that's a nice way how to call it. Most of the time what we were doing in Egypt was being grave robbers with permission of the Egyptian wizarding authorities. Why do you thing Gringotts pay pretty nice salaries to specialist curse-breakers in Egypt if not for all treasure we get them?”

  “That doesn't sound so well, true. And why in the world Egyptian authorities agree with robbing their own country?”

  “Have you ever heard about the wizard named Herpo the Foul?”

  “That actually sounds like somebody I have heard of ... oh, wasn't he some kind of ancient Greek wizard? ... Oh, I've got it, he was on of the Chocolate Frog cards! Wasn't he the one who invented the method of creating a basilisk?”

  “Yes, he was one of the most advanced ancient experts on the Dark Magic. And when I say Dark, I mean truly Dark. There are rumours that in one of his rituals he invented, and which I really won't be studying ever if I can avoid it, you have to eat flesh of children of your enemies. Raw. Charming person!”

  Ron sniggered over that characterization. However, Bill hasn't finished yet.

  “You assume one thing incorrectly. He wasn't a Greek. Or, well he spoke Greek as his native language, but he was actually living in Egypt, which was then under the rule of the Greek-speaking Ptolemaic dynasty.

  He was one of the most nasty Dark Wizards of all times, our beloved Lord Moldyshorts is kind and cuddly comparing to him. He lived in his fortress in an oasis west of Alexandria. Currently it is a Coptic monastery and I admire enough monks who live there. The areal is so saturated with Dark Magic that even professional cursebreakers are not allowed to stay there for longer than a week, then we have to leave for at least a week, but these Muggle monks are chanting, praying and living there most of their life in peace and harmony. I have really no idea how they do it.

  The true reason why the Egyptian authorities are willing to let us take plunder from their archaeological excavations is that we are also cleaning up Egypt from some really nasty stuff which is found there. So, I had to spent in total two months in this former compound of Herpo the Foul getting rid of some cursed cave full of absolutely disgusting stuff.

  Which leads to another charming idea of Herpo the Foul, a horcrux. So, yes, I had to study a lot about them, all cursebreakers in Egypt have to. So, when I heard about what happened to Ginny, I knew that something about the official story I heard is wrong. I wrote to Dumbledore and he recognized I can contribute so he supplied with detailed description from Harry's memory of what all happened in the Chamber of Secret.

  Dumbledore was a bit lost, he is certainly one of the biggest experts on Transfiguration, Potions, and Alchemy, but he kept himself far away from any Dark Magic, and so certainly even with hundred years ahead of me he is not in the same league as most Gringotts' cursebreakers. After I told him a bit about what horcruxes are, he found even some books about it in the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library and immediately confiscated them."

  Ron was ashamed.

  “I am sorry, Bill, I am a complete moron. I have my own brother an expert on the Dark Arts and I never even thought to ask him for help! What an idiot!

  Harry was so much forced by Dumbledore never to tell anybody, we have kept everything only to ourselves three. I guess, now is the right moment to mention that Harry even pretended to break up with Ginny, because he wanted to kept her safe.

  Fortunately, it took just a week for Hermione to pull everything from Ginny, and another week before sending her to Harry for dressing him down. Actually it took her a day to persuade her, and then six days explaining how to drive Muggle train to Little Whinging (A delightful story how it happened is “Rows” by Antosha linksiye(9605). You get even an relationship advice from Hedwig!).”

  Both snorted thinking about their fiery very pureblood sister struggling with Muggle railway system.

  “She explained him very unequivocally that there is no breaking up with her, and assured him, and I don't want to know details, that she will wait for him until she is of age as well.”

  Bill smiled.

  “I have never doubt her, she really can take care of herself. But more important us now is what she learnt about horcruxes and this horrible stuff.”

  Ron shook his head.

  “Actually, they are really not idiots, I think Harry really found in our beloved sister a girl well built to stormy weather.”

** I think that Cursebreakers have several jobs.

1. Discover a Location
2. Go to newly rediscovered locations, both magical and nonmagical in nature, and search for curses, enchantments, wards, inferi, etc. that would cause significant issues with the Statute of Secrecy. All such magical items are to be recovered or destroyed. (That one incident with The Mummy really should've been caught before she got all the way to London and that muggle got possessed by that Dark Lord. The Ministry had a devil of a time covering that up.)
3. Discover the nature of said magical effects, record them, and how you solved them.
4. Recover any artifacts of a valuable nature that you discover.
5. Hide the location or make it suitable for Muggles to "discover".
6. Return to the Base.
7. Get Paid.

So that's the Curse-Breaking part of the job. Onto the next part:

1. Use any newly rediscovered magic deemed appropriate to ward locations chosen by your employers.
2. Get Paid.

The reason most people, including the ICW, hire Gringotts Curse-Breaking Department is that they have lots of experience. Goblins have been breaking into Magical Tombs since before the Founding of Hogwarts. You see, Gringotts might primarily be a bank, but they really engage in any enterprise that the Goblin King or Council of Advisors thinks will make them lots of money. So the Bank has many departments, with the list as follows:

1.  Gringotts Bank - This is the main department of the bank. They store gold, artifacts, and libraries (whatever the customer desires, with certain exceptions, for the right price) in their vaults. They charge lots of banking fees, but the customers receive a pretty good interest rate in return. There are only two other such banking enterprises in the Magical World, and those are the South American Dwarves and the Swiss Gnomes.
2.  Gringotts Records - The second-largest department at the Bank, they've got records of everything they've done since the inception of the Bank. If you need to know something regarding an action the Bank took or a customer took with the Bank, Records probably knows. (99.9999999% chance)
3.  Gringotts Security - They are responsible for all security measures in the Bank. Dragons, what wards and enchantments go where, Goblin Guards, enchanted statues, the layout of the labyrinthine mazes, etc.
4.  Gringotts Betting And Wagering - If there's a sporting event, tournament, war, important event, pretty much anything, you can bet on its outcome with this department.
5.  Gringotts Cursebreaking and Warding - exactly what it sounds like. You can hire them to build wards for you in any location for a price. They'll break any enchantment in any place. If you find a task they can't do, they'll pay you.
6.  Gringotts Construction - They'll build anything you want for a price.
7.  Gringotts Intermediary - For a price, they'll act as a go-between with any legal business.
8.  Gringotts Mercenary - By far the most expensive department at the Bank, you can hire a goblin as a guard, as an assassin, whatever. Also, one that technically doesn't exist, but government officials know all about it and don't do anything because they find it too useful.
9.  Gringotts Artificers - the second most expensive department at the Bank, you can pay them to make anything you want, with the understanding that if it isn't returned at the end of the commissioner's life, hefty fines will be applied to any endeavors the known possessor undertakes with the Bank.
10. Gringotts Legal - since humans and goblins are always trying to sucker each other into breaking the treaties or the law, they've got a large department making sure they understand everything going on in the legal/political world. For a fee, a Legal employee can be employed as one of the best lawyers in the Magical World.
11. Gringotts Muggle - You'd think that Gringotts has enough fingers in enough pies, but they understand that Muggles are a massive source of money, so they signed a contract with an in-the-know Muggle that they'd give him a huge amount of money, he'd invest it in their name, and then they'd both make massive piles of money from the Muggles.

Other ideas are appreciated.

*** Also interesting point with the money, I can totally see why the goblins were pissed at wizards in the 14th century(besides the discrimination, and we can take that with a grain of salt, cause it is the wizard's side of story), when Flamel made the Stone(and this is mostly a theory of mine btw), cause we know it could be used to create gold and silver, which are precious metals, and used by goblins for smithing, and the downsides it could have caused for the goblins. Probably goblins were waging a few of them to get the Stone for themselves(wizards could have used it to create their own currency, independently of goblins), cause they didn't want to stay out of the business.

So I guess the go off country and raid tombs and give any treasure that they find to Gringotts.

Funfact: Curse-breakers don't have any form of formal uniform, because Goblins of Gringotts don't care how Wizards under their employment represent them or pay attention to their appearance as long as they get the treasure and bring them.
