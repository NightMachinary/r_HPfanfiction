** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/][*/Victoria Potter/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][/Taure/]]

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** The first chapters are a bit rough, and there definitely can be annoying elements to this fic - "born politicians" Slytherins, Harry is very very OP, in general kids don't act like kids.

And some things I consider bad worldbuilding, like mindscape being an actual landscape, and the whole magical core thing.

But otherwise, it's a really great fic, and a rather unique one at that, both in its plot and its worldbuilding. I'd definitely recommend giving it a read beyond the first few chapters.

** The Alexandra Quick series is some of the best worldbuilding I've read in a fanfiction. The magic and different sort of "fay" realms is a pretty seamless transition from HP, and the system of Confederate Territories makes so much more sense than JKR's copy+paste method of worldbuilding in Fantastic Beasts.

It also helps that the plot and characters are pretty dang good as well.

** Not Fade Away by Slide (Linkffn(11648754)) is set at Hogwarts during the Marauder' era. Unfortunately abandoned but presents interesting takes on canon characters, moderately fleshed out OCs, and, best of all, an original in-depth magical Britain. The world is rather dark with ubiquitous overt and casual pureblood supremacism.

** Linkao3(6765496)

This one is pretty much entirely worldbuilding and plot. It tells the story of what happens after Secrecy falls, which really turns out to be a lot of stories all around the world. Big Pharma with potions, Bentley builds a flying car, NASA portkeys to the moon, religious fruitcakes start attacking wizards, the middle east becomes even more of a mess and Voldemort becomes interested in the North Korean nuclear program.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
