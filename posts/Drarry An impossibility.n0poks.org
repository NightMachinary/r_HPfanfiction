I used to read a lot of Drarry and I have even written one Drarry. But in light of recent experience, I wanted to hear your thoughts on whether it is at all actually possible given Harry's personality and the world he lived in.

Harry lacks family and is very loyal to Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys (and the Marauders). Given that Fred, Sirius, Remus and Tonks died at the hands of Death Eaters, would he betray their memory by dating a Death Eater (even if he was an ex-Death Eater)?

Draco may have not wanted to kill Dumbledore but he actively did things that helped Death Eaters come to power.

In my country, the Death Eaters voted in a Voldemort like character. All this time, the rest of us were complacent and magnanimous (I guess) and were waiting for the Death Eaters we personally knew to gain some experience and wisdom and change their minds.

However, this death eater government us now responsible for everyone's family members and friends dying. My best friend's parents are on their death beds. None of mine are in danger but if they were to die (like Fred etc) or be tortured (like Hogwarts students in book 7), would a person like me be able to forgive the death eaters we personally knew who enabled this?

I ask other redditors who have experienced actual family deaths in genocides and civil wars whether it is genuinely possible for someone who loved their family and then lost them to genocide to then marry someone as complicit as Draco in the genocide?

Hence, while theoretically reconciliation is ideal, canon depicts the sort of reconciliation that was possible much more realistically than drarry fanfics (no matter how much Draco atones for his past).

Therefore, do you think Drarry (or even Dramione) is even possible?


** I don't think Drarry is in any way likely if you follow the book canon. I find the "Drarry with book canon" fics where they try to legitimize Draco's actions annoying.

If the author tweaks things so Draco's not such a racist prat? Or it happens later on, as adults, when he's grown up? I can see it.

Now Tom Riddle/Harry? THOSE are impossible without mega tweaks, IMO.

** Firstly, cannon Harry is 100%, fully, completely straight. So even if Draco was the nicest, most not death-eatery guy Harry wouldn't ever even consider dating him specifically because he was a he and not a she. Secondly if Draco was a girl, or you replace Draco with Pansy Parkinson or someone like that then no, Harry probably wouldn't date them if they were even remotely sympathetic to the death eater cause. Despite fannon portrayal Harry is not a very accepting person in cannon at all, he probably wouldn't date anyone from slytherin in general even if they weren't death eaters.

** I guess I'm being down voted by the Death Eaters who claim their Voldemort is a messiah and that they are not death eaters. I have been trolled by such people before.

** While I'm not generally a fan of slash, and I dislike this particular ship on principle, I can see a very slim possibility of it happening (with minor tweaks) up until somewhere in /OotP/ like when Harry gets that Quidditch ban or Malfoy joins the Inquisitorial Squad.

By /HBP/ there isn't any chance of it at all.

** Realistically Drarry maybe but im stretching alot snd it would have to be decades later

Dramione i dont see at all because she's litterally the oppressed minority he was trying to actively genocide. He can reform but I don't see her being in a position where she can be intimate with him even if she can forgive him. Doubly so considering Hermione is very on board with promoting minority rights like say with the houseelves and her sympathizing with werewolves.

buuuut most Drarry and Dramione do alot of what if situations and create situations that were very different than canon often giving Draco very different experiences that could lead him into a position where ya you can see either ship become canon its very deviated from canon but thats kinda the point
