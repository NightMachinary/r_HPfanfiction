Somehow, the Wizengamot and/or the general Wizarding public get a complete and detailed accounting of the events of the graveyard (maybe a pensieve memory played at Harry's hearing?). One of the Darker pureblood lords stands and, after reaffirming his belief in the importance of blood purity and the superiority of purebloods over other wizards (and wizards over Muggles), calls out the Death Eaters as the /real/ blood-traitors. After all, here are a bunch of purebloods debasing themselves before a lowly half-blood son of a Muggle, and murdering other purebloods for refusing to do the same. Now the Death Eaters have new opponents - the Dark families.
