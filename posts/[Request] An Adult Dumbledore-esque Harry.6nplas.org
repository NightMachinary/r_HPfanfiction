Hey everyone, I'm looking for a story featuring a Harry who becomes a powerful and well respected figure in the Wizarding World with a role similar to Dumbledore's. I've always envisioned Harry growing up to become someone powerful enough to match Grindelwald, Voldemort, and Dumbledore in their prime but due to the events of his teenage years he chooses to be less involved in conflicts unless he's first specifically targeted.

Perhaps a Harry Potter that ends up as the Headmaster of Hogwarts or as a guide people visit for advice or inspiration or maybe even as a wandering hermit seeking disciples to carry on his beliefs whatever they might be. Bonus points if Harry himself never actually fights anyone but his prowess in magic is definitely demonstrated or otherwise mentioned.

I can't really think of an example for what I'm looking for so sorry about that and hope I made sense. Thank you!!!


** There's one where Harry literally gets Dumbledore's memories + old wand after book 6 that's incomplete (and probably gonna stay that way), but is fantastically done and worth reading. Give me a moment to look it up, or someone else chime in if they know what I'm talking about.

Edit: This is the one I was thinking of, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared]] linkffn(9778984), but there are apparently a couple others that run with this concept I haven't read.

**** Haha, as mentioned in their author profile, this one stopped at a big climactic battle about 1/3 through the planned length, and it would have been difficult to follow it up. Still, it has a reasonable stopping point that establishes the characters and changes affected by them.

**** Assuming you're the same as the author of the story linked one comment higher, have you any plans to finish it? I just read it this past hour or so, and ended it feeling rather unsatisfied.

I mean, sure, the implication is that Voldemort was "killed" ("Sic semper tyrannis," meaning, "Thus always to tyrants," a shortened version of, "Thus always I bring death to tyrants.") but we all know he has Horcruxes and was more probably just ejected from his body, like at the end of Harry's first year. He wasn't even "killed" in the sense of destruction of that particular soul piece, evidenced by his fleeing.

Side note, I haven't read your headcanon yet, but do you believe that an AK [a proper one, not a backfired/reflected one] to Voldemort would permanently destroy that piece of his soul, leaving only his Horcruxes? Would fiendfyre? Would basilisk venom/Gryffindor's sword? Is the main piece of soul somehow fundamentally different from the Horcruxes?

** I can only think of two, mostly they involve time travel, or dimension jumping. Not so much something where Harry is an old man running the school of wizengamot or anything like that.

linkffn(Basilisk-born). Harry get's sent back in time, lives for a really-really long time. This might fit your's best, but Harry does a lot of his stuff either in secret or under a pseudonym and ends up involved in a lot of history's most important moments.

The Lone Traveler. This is a whole series sort of. Most of them are by the same author, there are a few by rando's, I only have read one and didn't like it, but to each his own I guess. In this, Harry is a sort of God or something where he's jumping across dimensions setting things right or however he wants them to be. He's technically very old during some stories, but he's usually appears to be an adult or whatever age. I think the stories are pretty disjointed, think Discworld or something.

*** I've read Basilisk-Born and now that I think about it, it's actually pretty close to what I asked for, I only wish that he was more public about who he was. I sort of disliked how we never see, or at least haven't so far, if any of the things that Harry does on his adventure into the present changed anything at all. I realize that the story technically already happened but we haven't seen any changes pre 5th year.

The Lone Traveler seems exactly like what I'm looking for, I just hope that unlike you, I end up enjoying it. Thank you so much I'll read it now. May I ask what exactly did you not like about it? Or was it simply over the top wish fulfillment?

**** The only lone traveler I've read is "Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense". I think there were several other stories before because there were references to old plots and OC's. I gave up after reading 2/3 of it because nothing at all seemed to happen. It was just a bunch of typical time travel or dimension jumping "setup" where Harry is running around buyinf crap and righting minor wrongs with no opposition. I wouldn't call that wish fulfillment, but for me it got kinda tedious since I don't usually like those parts of fics, and I was almost finished with the book and it had never ended.

I remember reading the first few chapters a few years ago and dropped it when I still didn't really see what the AU of it was or what the special sauce of the fic was, so to speak.

Edit: If you could provide a brief summary that would be very much appreciated, thank you! - I'd rather not read upwards of 50k+ words just to find out that the AUness of the fic was something I wouldn't enjoy.

******** Basically, for an unstated reason, male wizards are insanely rare in the wizarding world (1 male for every 5 or 6 women). They are considerably more powerful than women in terms of sheer magical power, for no real reason, and so, to prevent men from just dominating women, there is a magical bond that saps men's magic. The bond, unsurprisingly, means !harems buuuuut, I think the world does a really good job at making that a central plot element in a way that really ties the world together.

Kinda sexualized, obviously, because 11 year old harry feeling up random girls for the first few chapters is always going to be weird, but you get some cool intrigue and muggle interventions and spy drama that ends up boiling into a full blown civil war with Voldemort playing spoiler to the fighting. I thought I would hate the series when I started, but the writing is above average and the world building is consistent.

Some characters that are men in the original work are women to make the plot transition more smooth, but I promise that it becomes relevant as to why they are women.

********* Seeing as how I'm lacking anything else to read at the moment, I guess I'll try reading that trilogy again - although that summary sort of makes me want to leave it on the shelf even more. Hopefully as you mentioned, the author does a good job at making it a central plot element although I can't envision how it will work.

I sincerely hope that it doesn't devolve into 11 to 17 year old smut but I'll trust you on this since you said you thought you would hate it as well when you first started reading it. I've read The Sum of Their Parts already and while I believe it to be one of the better stories to have been written, I still don't think it really captures what I'm looking for unless the author miraculously wrote a sequel to it.

[Spoiler] /"The Harry in this particular story is a budding Dark Lord that just defeated Voldemort who attempts to overthrow the government in order to create a better environment for his godson Teddy. I would say that Harry acted as Dumbledore would never have."
