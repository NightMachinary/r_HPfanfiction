  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?
