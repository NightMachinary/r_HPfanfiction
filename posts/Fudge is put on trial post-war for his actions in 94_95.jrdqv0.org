*** Let's start with /political persecution/ and being an accessory to torture, and go from there.

What he did, or ordered/enabled Umbridge to do, in Order of the Phoenix? Yep, that qualifies for a human-rights violation right there. His undersecretary /tortured/ people, possibly on his orders, for effectively holding a dissenting political opinion.

Just because he's not as bad as Literal Wizarding Hitler doesn't mean he's innocent. There's definitely enough in Book 5 to put him in front of the International Criminal Court (or the Magical equivalent thereof).

**** You can go further back than OotP - pretty much every book he's in he does something that should be prosecutable (except maybe HBP).

- *CoS:* Sending someone to Azkaban without charge or trial
- *PoA:* Unleashing Dementors on a school full of children; Keeping them there even after they repeatedly attack at least one child; Refusing to investigate allegations of a man's innocence before trying to have him summarily executed
- *GoF:* Preventing any investigation of the abduction of two teenagers (and the murder of one and wounding/torture of the other) or the alleged return of a mass-murderer

***** True. OotP is the Big One where everything comes to a head, but for every book where he's shown as being in power he's also shown as doing something that'd probably warrant a hearing - obstruction of due justice, undue imprisonment...

General corruption charges are also likely to stick - taking bribes and such. There's plenty of references to Lucius Malfoy bribing people left and right, Fudge probably took a few bribes from him.

I suspect the only reason he's not shown doing anything prosecutable in HBP is he's on his way out and no amount of corrupt dealings would keep him in power anymore.

#+begin_quote
  No formal allegations were raised to the ministry by any students or teachers of the use of a blood quill.
#+end_quote

Given that the Ministry appointed her in the first place, it can be deemed /extremely/ likely that any such allegations would have been summarily thrown out and any supporters included in the smear-campaign and persecution via the Daily Prophet, which is an infamously Ministry-influenced news outlet.

#+begin_quote
  a credible allegation was made and sustained against Rubeus Hagrid by Hogwarts in 1942
#+end_quote

Nope. He was expelled for harboring an Acromantula, the charges surrounding the opening of the Chamber of Secrets didn't stick. See also, he's still allowed on Hogwarts grounds - even Albus Dumbledore could not have protected him from being barred from Hogwarts grounds (at a minimum) if it was proven that his Acromantula caused the death of Myrtle Warren.

#+begin_quote
  Fourthly, the Crouch affair. A confessed death eater who has escaped the law on many occasions, murdered multiple people, and able to mislead and manipulate multiple people including Dumbledore, with access to polyjuice potion, was being held in a building full of foreign dignitaries and children. The Minister for magic is given powers to act to protect the security of Britain in such a situation, and the minister acted legally, proportionately and swiftly.
#+end_quote

Summary execution is a crime against humanity in international court, /full stop/. He did not act "legally" - there is no built-in justification, no possible policy that somehow legalizes it. There can be no such authority given.

#+begin_quote
  Based on that information, and the failure of Hogwarts to maintain security in the previous year, that the minister authorised the use of Dementors, an act ratified by the Wizengamot. Once the individual was captured, the use of the dementors kiss was entirely lawful.
#+end_quote

Nope. Sorry, still not a justification for summary execution - again, /there straight up isn't one/. Hasn't been since 1977. Further, indictment without a trial is another crime - and just because the previous government /started/ it, the fact that Fudge's government did not rectify the lack of trial and instead jumped straight to "recapture and summarily execute" on his orders just makes it /worse/.

#+begin_quote
  The only evidence for whose return was given, was an eyewitness account by an underage child who we now know contained part of Voldemort's soul within his body, and who Voldemort himself could possess.
#+end_quote

This is not public knowledge, and I'd just /love/ to know how they'd have gotten that one (EDIT: especially before said possession ever happened). Furthermore, said underage child disappeared under unknown circumstances, alongside a fellow student he was known to be on somewhat familiar and not-unfriendly terms with, upon jointly grabbing the Triwizard Cup - only to return half-an-hour later, visibly grieving the heavy loss of that student, and making his claim. There was no cause there to claim any sort of delusion or accident at that time, thus Harry Potter's claim should have warranted investigation at the very least.

Especially in combination with the other events of that school-year - the summer before, the Dark Mark was conjured at the Quidditch World Cup. All /through/ that school year, a Polyjuiced Death Eater had heavy involvement in the Tournament happening at Hogwarts, disguised as the Defense teacher.\\
Given such an increase in Death Eater activity, the apparent return of Lord Voldemort (oh shut up, he's gone for good this time) fits the pattern enough to warrant taking the claim seriously.

** Forget about Fudge. During book 7, Umbridge [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-Born_Registration_Commission][sent]] muggleborns to Azkaban for "stealing magic". It's in the middle of the North Sea, it's completely unheated, the prisoners are given the bare minimum of food and medical care, and to top it all off, the place is guarded by soul-eating monsters that inflict psychological torture on anyone nearby.

Azkaban is basically the wizard equivalent of a concentration camp, and Umbridge helped organize and carry out systemic genocide on behalf of Voldemort.

#+end_quote

In the absolute smallest sense of the word responsibility, yes. We have strong context clues that Fudge knew nothing about Umbridges actions, not the dementors not the quill and certainly not about the unforgiveable. His "responsibility" would end the second he said "oh no now that I know all that fuck that bitch".

Wasn't that the board of governors who control hogwarts demanding it from him? Not to mention, arresting the previous (considered anyway) guilty suspect of a crime that appears to be repeating the exact same shtick basically 100% makes arresting Hagrid the obvious right decision. We as readers (as well as Harry and Dumbledore) know fudge is wrong. Anyone with two braincells in their head in universe would agree with fudge.

Kind of unclear whether its obstruction of justice seeing as how Sirius was sent to Azkaban without trial or questioning, seems to be just the general policy to sentence Death Eaters to death/Azkaban without much legal proceedings. Blame the Ministry in general, not Fudge in particular.

#+begin_quote

The most Fudge did was call them insane attention seekers, then try to judge them extra harshly during their trial. The second is political persecution, agreed, but it also won't hold up in literally any court. Harry had a second violation of magic around muggles, was clearly warned, being harsh could be justified even if we as the readers know that he's not doing it just for justices sake. How did he persecute Dumbledore besides calling him names? Politicians are allowed to do that.

Except the first time wasn't an arrest at all - Hagrid was expelled for the Acromantula during his third year (and hey, if a Jarvey was enough to get Newt Scamander expelled...), it's never mentioned whether the word of Tom Riddle was enough to get him charged with anything outright criminal. The fact that he's /not in Azkaban/ and /still working near children/ at the time of Book 1 is a heavy context clue that it didn't stick.

Further, Your Honor, Hagrid had /ample/ opportunity to open the Chamber again if he was in fact the perpetrator the first time - which records would show he wasn't convicted of (see also: He's still allowed to work there). Where's the motive for a hypothetical repeat performance, and why wouldn't he have done it again sooner? Say, the year before? There's /plenty/ to throw Hagrid's guilt in doubt, same as there apparently was the first time (I'll say it again, /he still works there/ being your major clue).

And yet Malfoy got a trial. Snape got a trial. A /bunch/ of Death Eaters' trials were shown in Book 4 or mentioned in extended canon - Sirius Black was the only one who didn't get one the first time around.

On top of that, somehow I doubt that the head of the DMLE would have approved of summary execution without at least asking the question "How did you escape?", given he escaped from a max-security prison and whatever leak he used should definitely be fixed (both counts) - which takes clear priority over ending the threat of a single person, no matter who or where that person may be at the time.

Lastly, guess what? Even if it /was/ the previous government's policy, the fact that that policy still stands just means you're guilty of committing the same crime as your predecessor. And yes, even in wartime, throwing someone in max-security prison without a trial is a crime against humanity, no matter how guilty they seem. So is summary execution for /any/ reason, for that matter.

A single half-sentence from Wikipedia: "Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership".

The Ministry controls the Daily Prophet. The same Daily Prophet that, for the entire year, makes Dumbledore and Harry out to be criminally insane and dangerous. That qualifies.

PS. In most court cases, including this kind, the amount of charges is often /far/ more than what anyone could hope to have stick. If there's even due cause to /try/ him for stuff, and there is (because, as much as you rail on people for "the readers know this, the public doesn't", you're guilty of that too - a lot of those defenses aren't public knowledge either), there should be a trial.

Nothing in text specifies Fudge got bribed. I don't consider anything outside of books canon (given JKR poop and other such nonsense I'm not sure anyone can blame me), and even if I did unless it was explicitly mentioned that Fudge was bribed it's still not a firm confirmation, let alone enough in-universe proof to argue he was bribed.

Can't recall if it's fanon or canon that Dumbledore personally made sure he would only get expelled instead of arrested and charged since he knew Hagrid was innocent. I'd say him working at Hogwarts is a healthy context clue of Dumbledore more or less being able to run Hogwarts as he pleases without the Ministry's say so until fifth year.

And the whole "well he didn't do it for a long time when he could have earlier" has literally never flown in court as a reason someone didn't do a crime. It's circumstantial evidence at absolutely best against the strong evidence that Hagrid was caught doing it last time this happened, punished, and let go with a slap on the wrist due to his young age.

From my knowledge the books never actually tell the story of what actually happened - but Dumbledore's influence only goes so far. If there was enough there to actually convince people that the Acromantula was what killed Myrtle Warren (and there wouldn't have been - there would not have been any signs of poisoning, nor any wounds that match a spider bite), then Hagrid wouldn't have been allowed to become the Hogwarts gamekeeper.

Isn't her "I did what he ordered me to" defense (which, by the way, is also extended-canon - in the books she never has to field any questions about her conduct) a complete 180, then?

This is a series rooted in real-life to some extent, therefore we should be able to apply knowledge from real-life in these cases. Dictators IRL tend to give themselves all sorts of authority - which funnily enough doesn't make the use of those authorities any less of a crime against humanity in international views. The fact that it's carried over from a previous regime just means the Minister is equally guilty as his (dead) predecessor, if he used it.
