The Double Agent is a fic I recently discovered that really resonated deeply with me? Anyone know of any fics like it that are on the short side (one-shot, two-shot, etc.) where the ending wants to make you cries tears of both joy and heartbreak?

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

** I can't recall the fic's name, but there's a short one shot about Peter Pettigrew pranking the Death Eaters by impersonating Voldemort. It reads like a crack fic until the last (brutally emotional) paragraph. Can anyone help?

** While the couple of stories I don't exactly measure up to a well done adaptation of [[http://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/uploaded_files/1446611753-8df48ebd970dd2c4ee22ca480bd83483.gif][Itachi's life story]], I do have a few that are kinda sad.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/][The Twine Bracelet]] is pretty good. It's a fic about Colin's camera.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/][The Substitute]] is a bit long at around 40k words but it's got a happy ending in some ways.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7949998/1/I-Am-Not-There][I am not there]] is a pretty good fic. It's from the Fate/Stay Night fandom and it's about the main character finally accomplishing his dream.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][A Promise from her Boy]] is quite good. It's a non-creepy Harry and Animagus Hedwig friendship fic.
