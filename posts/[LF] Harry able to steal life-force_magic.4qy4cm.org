** linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) is a good one. Harry is blind, but can sense magic and [[/spoiler][can manipulate the magic within objects or people]]. Not dark however. So not a perfect match.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  When he was younger his Aunt and Uncle called him a Freak. They had no idea. And nor does anyone else. They say that some evil is so powerful that it never truly dies; it can only transform! But here's a question for you: what happens when said evil finds the soul and power of one whom was born to be a hero? Response to DZ's 'Evil Never Dies' Challenge.

** Kalistar's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dying Embers) features a Dark side wielding Potter. Okay writing iirc. Been a while since I read it. Good plot from what I can remember; it is complete too. Too bad the sequel isn't out though. Check Darth Marrs work he has Potter wielding the Dark Side more often than not in his fics.

** linkffn(Saving Connor by lightningonthewave) features a Harry with this ability who also has some level of dark-affinity. However, "dark" in this story has little meaning. And the magic-stealing power seemed a little...inconsistent, or at least loosely defined.
