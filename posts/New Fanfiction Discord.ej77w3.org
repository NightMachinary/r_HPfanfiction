I posted earlier about wanting a writing partner or someone to bounce off of, I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who wants this or is interested, so I made a discord for Fanfiction bouncing with channels for people to discuss their ideas,find beta readers,and even think of having a dedicated night to reading fanfiction on the voice chat with everyone as a different character! ect, channels for the discord are currently limited to Harry Potter, Star Wars and Game of Thrones but we can add more as we get more people the link to join is below!
