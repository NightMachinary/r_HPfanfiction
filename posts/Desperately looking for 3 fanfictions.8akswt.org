1. Harry is probably sorted into Slytherin, I remember he attended some kind of ball and he called Abraxas Malfoy "herai" or something similar (which was a name for original inner circle). There was also a term like "dominae" that was used for someone gay. [Possible Tomarry]
2. From this fanfiction I remember almost nothing, I just know it was in the middle/towards the end of the fanfiction (maybe it was even a sequel) Harry (who was the heir of Slytherin) was conversing about something with the Bloody Baron (who was some kind of a help for him, I guess). I think Baron was disappointed with Harry and disagreed with him about some decision. [Possible Tomarry]
3. Another one of less remembered by me fanfictions. I know that Harry was (I guess) past his 5th maybe even 6th year and was hunting for horcruxes. The diary of Tom Riddle was not destroyed (or was it a locket?) and young Tom was not pleased at all with his future-self's deeds. He helps Harry and at some point he even gets to have an actual, corporal form (I think Harry believed him and wanted him to have a body, while Sirius (?) and Slughorn (?) were not pleased by this at all). [Almost certain Tomarry]

Anyway, it would be great if someone would be able to help me. My only other hint is that all of this stories were long, possibly very long/having sequels. If you have any good, long fanfictions with slytherin!Harry then I would be glad to hear your suggestions. Cheers!


** I think one of these may be a fic called D minor. Or one of those related ones. Was TMR a chick in any of these?
