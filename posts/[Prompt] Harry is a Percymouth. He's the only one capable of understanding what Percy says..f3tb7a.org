The Weasleys didn't speak to Percy, not because they disliked him but because they couldn't understand anything he said. They thought understanding him a lost cause, until the summer of 2nd year where Harry stayed at the Burrow's and started conversing with Percy, to the disbelief of everyone else.


** "And this is my brother, Percy." Ron gestured widely with his fork at yet another red haired boy. This one had thick glasses, Harry waved shyly and the boy waved back. Ron shoveled more food into his mouth then swallowed and said "don't worry about talking to him, he makes no bloody sense."

"Ronald. Language." Molly chided. She did not, Harry noticed, correct him about what he said regarding Percy. Harry looked at the other boy curiously. "Really, don't worry, Harry dear. Unfortunately no one has been able to understand Percy. He gets by though, top grades in all his classes. Well... For the practical parts anyway. So proud."

"I'd get top grades for written too if anyone could understand me." Percy groused and Harry startled. He looked around at the others who had blank expressions on their faces. Except Ron, who shrugged and ate more bacon.

"Is your writing particularly bad? My cousin Dudley says I've got chicken scratch writing myself." Harry asked Percy, wondering if that was what he meant. Percy's mouth dropped, astonishment written on his freckled features. None of the others seemed to have noticed though.

"Can you understand me? What I'm saying? Repeat what I've said. Periwinkle!" Percy grabbed the edge of the table with such force, he nearly threw his glasses off from moving forward so fast. Harry panickedly looked at Ron who patted his arm comfortingly and said around a mouthful of food to not mind Percy. Harry looked back at the other Weasley.

"Periwinkle." He said with a small voice, looking into Percy's eyes.

"Yes, yes! Periwinkle!" Percy started laughing hysterically.

"What's going on?" Fred asked from his seat, wary of his brother.

"He can understand me! Finally! Wow! Harry, Harry, can I call you Harry? Could you please tell Fred and George that they are unbelievable twats and to keep it down with the explosions when I'm trying to study! Could you? Please?" Percy smiled brilliantly, relief shining through. Harry felt warm in his chest.

"Er, Fred. George." Harry turned to the twins. "Percy says, er, to keep it down with the explosions while he's studying... And also... Er. He called you twats."

"Harry!"

"What do you mean Percy said?!"

"Language!"

An explosion of chatter broke out and Harry felt small in the size of the noise. The Dursleys were never like this.

"Harry!" Percy shouted and he turned to him. "Could you tell them to shut up."

"I don't... I don't want to be rude to them." Harry's shoulders were up near his ears with discomfort. The other boy looked abashed.

"Sorry, maybe, instead, could you tell Ginny to pass the butter?" He asked with a nicer tone. Harry nodded.

"Can you really understand him?" Ron asked, prodding his shoulder with a sticky finger. Harry nodded again then turned to Ginny.

"Percy would like the butter, if you're done with it." He said to her. Ginny's eyebrows went up in surprise. She shakily passed the butter dish to Harry, who passed it to Ron, who passed it to Percy. Percy looked as if he had received the Philosopher's stone rather than a smushed pile of butter.

"Hang on, this can't be happening. There's no way some random kid can understand Percy." Fred looked baffled.

"He did survive the killing curse maybe he has other super powers. Like talking to crazy people." George offered. Molly shouted his name scoldingly as Fred muttered something which Harry made out to be "Shitty super power."

"Harry, if you can really understand our son, maybe you can help us." Arthur spoke up from his end of the table, voice gentle. "Could you ask Percy why he keeps taking the bead box into his room?"

"Oh, that's just to annoy Fred and George. They keep trying to shove a gnome in there so it will pop out and scare someone." Percy rolled his eyes at the idea.

"He says it's to stop Fred and George from shoving a gnome in the box." Harry translated. Arthur huffed a laugh as the twins immediately started denying their plot. "Can you really not understand him? He sounds like he's speaking perfect English to me." Harry asked, concerned this might be an elaborate Weasley lie.

"To us he sounds like he's speaking gibberish." Ron said then made inarticulate noises. "Like that."

"It's like the snake all over again." Harry mumbled. Ron's eyebrows drew up in alarmed confusion.

"Snake?"

"Harry?" Percy spoke again while standing up. "Can you... Do you want to... Would you mind spending time with me? I've never had anyone to talk to before."

"Uh, sure. Okay." Harry agreed. Honestly, he felt sorry for the kid. He knew what it was like when no one would speak to him. "Uh, if that's okay Ron?"

"If what's okay?"

"Percy was asking if we could talk some more, like, spend some time together." Harry said. Ron looked conflicted but his eyes turned to his mother who had her hands up to her face and her eyes were shiny.

"Sure. Okay. But I'm going to show you around after, okay? You're my best friend." Ron nodded. Percy smiled.

"Don't tell him this but sometimes I love my littlest brother." He said with affection and ruffled Ron's hair. Ron squeaked and batted his hand away.

"What should I tell them then?" Harry asked curiously.

"Oh, how about the fact that Mum's been secretly drinking firewhisky at night whenever Dad's relatives visit." Percy cackled.

"What's firewhisky?" Harry asked. Arthur clapped his hands loudly.

"Okay boys, if you're quite finished, why don't you go off and play."

"I'll tell you later." Percy said then laughed again. "Because I can! I can tell you. This is going to be so much fun."

Harry considered him and the rowdy family around him. Maybe it would be.

** Harry's first impression of the Burrow: dream-like. He'd never been in such a rambunctious but loving home. It certainly wasn't like the Dursleys'. Ron's mom, Mrs. Weasley, was the nicest person Harry had ever met. His dad was definitely on the top ten list for nicest people too. Ron's brothers were nice enough to Harry too- the twins, Fred and George, had been the ones to help take Harry back from the Dursleys'. Something Harry would be eternally great for. Their little sister, Ginny, seemed nice enough too, albeit a little shy. There was only one person who hadn't been wholeheartedly welcoming of Harry, and that was their oldest brother there, Percy. He'd been the most distant with Harry, never talking to him directly. It was always “Have Harry do this,” or “Tell Harry that,” Quite frankly, it annoyed Harry. No one seemed to find any problem with it though, so Harry let the issue drop.

Harry watched as the family dove into the breakfast spread. He felt like just another one of the brothers as he joined in. Several times he noticed Percy answering Mrs. Weasley's questions by just making some weird hand motions and occasionally pairing them with words.

“Sign language.” Ron explained, catching Harry watching. Harry didn't know why Percy needed to add sign language to his words, but he didn't entirely care.

Part way through the meal, Percy gestured to the butter on the other side of Harry and he could have sworn he'd heard the boy say “/Butter Please/”. Harry shook himself out of it and passed the older kid the dish. He heard a “/Thanks/,” as Percy touched his fingers to his chin and flicked them back.

“He says thanks,” Ginny told him. Harry wasn't sure why she'd felt the need to repeat him.

“You're welcome,” Harry replied.

“Uh, looks like the post is here!” Fred announced as a mangy owl flew straight into the window.

“/Joy, Errol's here/.” Harry heard Percy say. He turned towards Percy as soon as Ginny, who was sitting between them had gotten up to grab the owl.

“What have you got against the owl?” He whispered. Percy seemed shocked by Harry's question.

“/He eats off my plate/?” Percy's expression was confused shock and didn't support his answer, so there was no way for Harry to know what he'd said unless he could hear Percy.

“So what? The owls at Hogwarts do too.” Harry whispered again.

“/Can you understand me/?” Percy looked affronted.

“Yes?” Percy suddenly started a little dance in his breakfast seat,

“Oh, someone's happy.” Mrs. Weasley commented. He made a wild gesture at her.

“He what?” She turned her attention to me, “He says you can understand him?” Ron and the twins laughed.

“Yes, Mrs. Weasley, why wouldn't I be able to?” Everyone's mouths dropped open.

“Wait- for real?” Fred asked- or maybe it was George.

“Yeah?”

“He's non-verbal,” Ron started to explain, “It means he can't speak. Well, he tries talking sometimes, but no one can understand him. He has to use sign language.”

“/Tell them ‘Orange, Peanut, Gnome, and Quill'/.” Percy told me.

“He says ‘orange, peanut, gnome, and quill'?” Percy pulled a napkin to show the four words written on it already. Everyone was silent. Percy however, had a devious look on his face. He turned to Harry.
