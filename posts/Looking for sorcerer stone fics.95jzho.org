So I've read a couple story's where something happens between Harry and the stone or Harry does something with it. I know one story it absorbs into him another darkharry one he swallows the stone and it does stuff to him even read an incomplete one where he mails it back with Hewig to Flamel and they end up inviting him over. I think this is a amazing thing to base a story off of or have happen in one to add to it. So I'm looking for any story's where Harry does something with the Sorcerers stone either on purpose or by accident. Thanks!
