Fics that not only describe the final battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, but also the buildup and the battles. Preferably over 90k words. Thanks!


** All I can think of is linkffn(3155057). It features a time-travelling Harry, and it really gets down to the nitty-gritty of the war. I don't recall a final dumbles/Grindlewald fight, but I could have just forgot.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

*** Seconding this.

This is a really well written book as far as plot goes, and is worth reading if you want to read about Grindelwald and Dumbledore era Wizarding War. It's a pity the sequel is abandoned though.

** Well, a rather good one is linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB). Riddle-centric, with mentor!Dumbledore, Grindlewald being Grindlewald and "James Bond."

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
