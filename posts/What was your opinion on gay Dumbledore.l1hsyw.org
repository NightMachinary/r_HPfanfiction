** 'there were no mentions subtle'

His relationship with Grindewald was enough hints for me

' To change a defining feature'

How is Dumbledore's sexuality in any way a defining feature

** The thing is, though, there were /several/ subtle mentions in DH. Besides his sister dying and becoming a dark lord, what else could be so ‚Äúscandalous‚Äù about Dumbledore's past with Grindelwald that it caused people reading Skeeter's book to be...well, scandalized? And what kind of relationship is closer than that ‚Äúof brothers‚Äù? The only relationship between characters that comes to mind when I think of that is Achilles and Patroclus -- and I think that /more/ than speaks for itself, if you're knowledgeable about the myth.

I think your problem is that the books are written in through the perspective of a teenage boy -- which certainly isn't a bad thing, don't get me wrong! It's just not a reliable perspective for these kinds of things. Upon reread it became quite clear to me that Dumbledore was gay, both because of my reasons listed above and because of others that occur throughout the books -- Dumbledore and Pomfrey's gifts, Dumbledore avoiding flirtation, Dumbledore being described as ‚Äúeccentric‚Äù for reasons that are not solely because of his fashion choices and knowledge, etc. Plus, the fact that these books were written by an author who was also advised that people may not have liked them because of her gender probably didn't help, too, even if that was the least of JKR's problems.

** Dumbledore's sexuality doesn't really matter for Books 1-6. When it comes to Deathly Hallows though, I thought it added some interesting context to his relationship with Grindelwald and the whole situation with Aberforth and Ariana. I interpreted Dumbledore as gay in DH without it being told to me, the subtext was there.

I suppose the point is you can't really ‚Äòtell' if someone is gay if they aren't really advertising that fact, you don't need a big sign saying ‚ÄòI am gay' in order to be gay. Put this in context; How much did you really know about the teachers at your school growing up? Usually students don't know all that much about their teachers at all, the same goes for Dumbledore.

Furthermore, our narrator, Harry laments not knowing all that much about Dumbledore at all, and the only personal question he ever asked of him, didn't get an entirely honest answer out of him. That's not the type pf man to really be open about his sexuality. If we also look at it in cultural context, Dumbledore was born in 1881 and died in 1997. Since we do not know attitudes to LGBT+ people in Wizarding Britain, we don't know how they get treated but if we compare the attitudes of Muggle Britain of the same time period, we see that homosexuality was treated very cruelly. Prison sentences , chemical castration and all sorts of other punishments were levied against homosexuals. See Oscar Wilde, Alan Turing and the like. Homophobia was rampant in Britain at that time and its only in the last 10-20 years or so that attitudes have changed a lot. If we say that their may be similar attitudes in the Wizarding World, then that is yet another reason for Dumbledore not to have explicitly advertised it.

I would also argue that since it doesn't come up in the first six books and then the subtext is relatively subtle in the seventh book, the assertion that Dumbledore's sexuality was a defining feature of his character is flawed.

The fact that Dumbledore is gay doesn't do anyone any harm, but if we were to now say that he is straight would feel quite ‚Äòwrong' to me. I like the fact that Dumbledore is gay, and the fact that it has next to no obvious bearing on his character even more so. Though an argument could be made that Dumbledore swore off romantic relationships because of the damage that Grindelwald inflicted. As the old posters said

‚ÄòSome people are gay. Get over it.'
