I mean, unless you want to make Hermione not having read the books, I'm pretty sure it's safe to assume Hermione Bookworm Jane Granger would have read the books. Meaning, Hermione would know the plot and the important events that would follow. When I mean 'SI', of course, I do not mean you are projecting yourself into Middle Earth, but what you would expect from someone who read the books being transported into them would occur more or less.


** You can easily avoid this problem by ELIMINATING the LOTR books from the HPverse.

Similarly, any other crossover world should not exist as literature in the home universe.

*** That is a very good point. Although, my reasoning would explain why there seems to have no HP/LOTR crossovers with Hermione being in Middle Earth.

** I like SI fics and I like crossovers, so I'm in favor of this idea rather than just eliminating the LOTR books from the potterverse.

** A SI doesn't just mean someone who's read the books, it means the author putting themselves in the story. Unless Hermione is writing fanfic, this wouldn't be a self insert.

Of course, there's no assurance that fanfic authors get any particular characterization right. Authors can make a character do what the author would do, not what the canon character would do. Any type of story is susceptible to that issue.

**** I would direct you to write coherent sentences. SI means self insert. Yes, your last sentence says that you've chosen to give this common term a different definition than the standard one. That doesn't mean you'll be understood when you do that. I don't go around calling Harry “Snape” just because I feel like it.

***** Note that I said it would /amount to/ because, like the common SI story (note that I say common because some people use this term for all Real World people being thrown into the Potterverse, even though someone wouldn't be able to write the story of a projection of themselves of a world they know nothing about), Hermione would have knowledge about the world she's been transported into and the people living in it because in her homeworld it was a known and acclaimed piece of literature. Therefore, like the common SI, she would try to change the world (Middle Earth in this case) for the better based on her knowledge of the events to come.

****** SI still doesn't mean a character with knowledge of the books. It usually means a character with the personality and other traits of the author, with or without knowledge of the books. For example, authors will have a canon character fall in love with a muggle who has a lot in common with the author, except for having never read the books. When people criticize OCs as being thinly-disguised SIs, this is usually what they mean.
