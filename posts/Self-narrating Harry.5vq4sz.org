Hey guys! I'm looking for something along the lines of this story's chapter 16, but not a one-shot, just curious if anyone else stumbled across something like this. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12041762/16/Harry-Potter-is-an-Annoying-Little-Bugger]]

  Despite not having been around any of the Marauders for very long, there are times when it becomes obvious that Harry Potter is one annoying little bugger, and he soon makes it his life goal to get adults to question their, and perhaps his, sanity. Crackfic!

** Chapter 2 of this one has a funny bit where Harry narrates his entry to the Leaky Cauldron. Entire fic is hilarious, although abandoned. Still well worth the read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302068/2/He-s-Not-Normal]]

** I liked that chapter even though I don't usually like parodies/crackfics. I like the idea of a narration curse although I think it would be difficult to write a story with this premise that's more than a couple of chapters long.
