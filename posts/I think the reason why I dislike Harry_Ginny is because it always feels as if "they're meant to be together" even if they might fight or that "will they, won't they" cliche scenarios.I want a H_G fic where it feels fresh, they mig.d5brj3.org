No James/Lily allusions whatsoever, those cliche comments about the "Potter curse" and the fact they are like the mini-versions of Harry's parents. I hate this trope. Fics in which I liked the pairing were fics similar to Frequence, Amplitude and Resonance of a Soul, or there was another one where Harry never went to Hogwarts and became an Auror post war, and Ginny becomes his apprentice or something like that. Just no bashing, about pretty much anyone. I abhor bashing, even to characters that I hate, like Hermione.


** This reminds me of that thread that asked if you thought Harry and Ginny would get together if Harry wasn't the chosen one, and my response was that it would probably happen /faster,/ since Ginny wouldn't be under the pressure of thinking Harry was the Messiah and the stakes would be altogether lower. Even from her introduction, Ginny was presented as having an internal war between her hero worship of Harry and her normal, boisterous and self-assured personality. It's only the latter that Harry has any attraction to.

*** Though (as written) it's harder to know how much her hero worship of Harry played into her own attraction to him. Like it's a very strong one from the start - and then he saves her from the diary year 2? Not easy for that to go away...

A Harry without that going for him would likely be attracted to Ginny much faster, agreed - without her being shy and lovestruck around him, it'd catch his actual attention much faster. On the flip side... I don't know if he'd necessarily attract her, or really catch her attention to the same degree.

Then again, my HP opinions tend to draw mostly from the first four books (they're the ones that I tend to have /feel/ the most Harry Potteresque), and that includes the way I instinctively view Ginny.

**** Well, the question was if Harry wasn't the Chosen One. He still would have tried to save Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. I mean, Lucius dropping the Diary off was only tangentially related to Harry's status, and if Riddle didn't gun for Harry, he'd be even more likely to be around in the endgame.

But Harry is a reasonably good-looking guy who's far more capable than most his age (including any boys besides Ginny's own brother), would have been hanging around the Burrow and spending time with her at Hogwarts, and was a Quidditch star. I think Ginny would have wound up with a crush on him all the same. I mean, it's not like when he expresses doubts or acts /unlike/ the Chosen One (struggling to get a date to the Yule Ball, anyone? Failing to court Cho? Fainting from the Dementors multiple times?) she gets turned off.

***** I guess it depends what 'Chosen One' means to the HP series. Does it include the 'Boy Who Lived' portion of his story pre-books? Does it include all the trouble and heroics he goes off and does in Hogwarts?

It's not inconceivable she'd end up crushing on him, you're right - and in a fanfic, it's easy to write it however the author wants to have it go. But I don't think it's clear cut that it'd necessarily go faster than in canon. But like I said, part of it is myself/personal.

****** I believe - and this was months or possibly more than a year ago, so my memory is hazy - but I believe the scenario was that Voldemort died as per canon, but it was some freak accident and Harry had nothing to do with it, but was still an orphan raised by the Dursleys, and helped in some capacity with the events of the books, even if it wasn't exactly the same.

So he wouldn't be burning Quirrell with a touch, but he would have stalled him or something until Dumbledore got there, or done something similar.

** I'm not sure what kind of stories you're looking for, since I think an AU where they never met at Hogwarts is just another "they're meant to be together" and sometime with less buildup. However, here are some of AU where they never met at Hogwarts:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13116905/1/Natural][Natural]]. Quidditch AU. Harry moved to America when he was a baby and ended up meeting Ginny in some kind of Quidditch camp/tryout. There's no Voldemort so James, Lily, and Sirius lived. It's so sweet and fluffy you need to brush your teeth afterwards.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9326545/1/Too-Close][Too Close]]. Harry received death threats, Auror!Ginny is tasked to protect him.
- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty.]] Ginny received death threats, Auror!Harry is tasked to protect her.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16044434/chapters/37454639][we can't control (watch me unfold)]]. Friends-with-benefits AU. Ginny is an internationally famous quidditch player that met Auror!Harry in a bar, hook up for one night, and ended up with FWB arrangement.
- Easier to be by Hgfan1111. Ginny tried to lived as a muggle and met Harry when she tried to find a roommate. It's deleted by the authors from ffn but you can find the ebook if you looked somewhere in the internet.

That's the first five that I remember from the top of my head. There's a few muggle AU that I think is pretty good, but I'm not sure if you're fine with that. [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/97pyou/harryginny_fanfiction_megathread/][fanfiction megathread]], I'm sure you can find more recommendation there.

Ginny is made interesting by the fact that she retained all of Tom Riddle's memories from her time with the diary, so she knows all of the magic that he did, including the knowledge of horcruxes. The memories had a pretty profound effect on her, making her far more cunning and manipulative. She originally only pursued Harry because she saw him as a potential husband who wouldn't tether her down, and decided to try and manipulate him into such a relationship. Ultimately, things do work out between them in earnest, though.

**** A bit in the beginning, but it quickly sets itself apart. It has very little bashing (some Voldemort, Death Eater, and Umbrige, although they are played smarter than in the books), Molly isn't her usual smothering self, helpful Dumbledore, Harry and Ginny have history and different bf/gf's before they get together, Sirus is not just a prankster, Harry loses his Horcrux in a way that is not Dues Ex Machina, and overall has a darker feel to it (slight spoilers, Ginny is sexually abused by Riddle in year two and in year four Crouch Sr is flayed alive and left for dead at Hogwarts)

*** I respect your opinion on that. Personally, I think Hermione would have been even more forced. While they were amazing friends, I never once got the sense that there was anything romantic between them in the books. Not even a single hint of it. The movies are a bit different as I think the writers / directors liked to play that angle up a bit even if it wasnt going to happen. If Rowling had gone that route, I also think it would have been very forced, and mostly in this case to fit the whole "male and female lead always end up together" trope. I thought it was refreshing to see something different. Whether Ginny was the best choice... that's debatable. As a kid, I thought so but now as an adult I think Rowling had the opportunity to do something more interesting and lost out.

I remember reading fanfics before Books 6 & 7 came out that handled the development of their love story better. Sadly, I wasn't able to save any of those and I suspect they're no longer available on the web.

Just, no. Nowhere in canon is it said that Ginny looks like Lily apart from being redheads (with different pigmentation to boot). Saying that they are exactly like eachother is akin to saying every Japanese or black or even caucasians are exactly like eachother.
