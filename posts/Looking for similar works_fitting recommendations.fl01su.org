I was recently recommended a few works that I've greatly enjoyed, those being;

The Legacy Preservation Act written by James Spookie on ff.\\
Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived written by The Santi

Both of those are great Harry x Darker Witch, something I don't often see done and it's a type that I've greatly gotten into.

If you can't think of anything similar, I'll take any Harry work paired with a non-light sided Witch. They don't need to be insanely evil, just not one that's fallen into his lap due to who he is or instantly loves him. Time travel fics are fine, please no insanely OP Harry.

Thank you for all the recommendations, this community has definitely provided me with some amazing reads!


** Watching over harry. It's a harry/good!bellatrix tale. You.might enjoy it
