I'm tired of the cliche cartoon idiot villain Dumbledore who is defeated by an article in a newspaper.

Any situation with Dumbledore being Bamf is welcome.

Special request of him putting Edge Lord Potter in his place would be especially welcome.

Thank you for any suggestions.

Newt just thinks he's the last of an endangered species who's been on his own for far too long.

** In the Star Wars crossover story [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27701308/chapters/67795897][Harry Tano]], Dumbledore is a secondary character for most of it but at the story climax, he gets one of the most memorable scenes in the story as he pilots his starfighter to help destroy a weaponized landmark (it does actually make sense in-story).

In the Kancolle story Harry And the Shipgirls ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Thread 1]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][Thread 2]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-goblet-of-feels-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.772633/][Thread 3]]), Dumbledore shows his intellectual prowess as he, among many other things, helps set up events to protect the Magicals in the face of the inevitable collapse of the Satute of Secrecy.\\
^{He also rides a Segway straight down a wall as he escapes from an irate shipgirl.}

In Enter The Dragon (hosted on QQ, albeit in the SFW portion), Dumbledore is somewhat taken aback to discover that Harry is a Dragon, but he adapts quickly. He also slaps down Lucius Malfoy with a wonderfully terrifying speech during a rather unique lunch (roast Basilisk).

** Harry is shown a memory containing a battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort in part three of “The Prince of Slytherin” and it really demonstrates how powerful they both are.

I'd definitely recommend reading the fic from the start (it's one of my favorite fics) but it's very long so if you just want to skip to the battle, ctrl+f “enough.” in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15833898/chapters/40319318][this chapter]]. It's pretty much completely understandable without greater knowledge of the fic, HOWEVER, a major spoiler relating to someone's identity that was previously revealed is mentioned. You should skip the paragraph after the bolded word “fiendfyre” to avoid it, but I think it'd probably be better to just read the fic from the beginning to avoid the chance of it.

If you do start from the beginning, I have a few things to note:\\
* I (and apparently a bunch of other people) don't like the prologue. The fic is a subversion of a lot of tropes, but the prologue is written in such a way that it looks like it falls into those tropes.\\
* Yes, James and Jim start out shitty. They get better.\\
* This fic is a lot darker than canon. I don't think that would surprise anyone, but I feel the need to mention it in case anyone is turned off by that sort of thing.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
