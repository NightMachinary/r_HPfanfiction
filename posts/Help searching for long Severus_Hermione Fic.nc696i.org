:END:
I've been looking everywhere for this fic but can't seem to nail any of the keywords. Maybe I'm mixing up stories too...

But one of the big plot points is that Severus and Hermione become close and after killing Dumbledore, Severus becomes Hermione's â€˜source' on death eater plans and she meets him at his safe house on occasion (with plenty of smut) until he finally gets accepted into the Order again. Then Hermione gets hurt and she briefly doesn't remember that she was working with Severus and ends up getting tricked by Draco but Draco falls in love with her. This makes Severus jealous and he comes with a plan to save himself and throw Draco under the bus which gets him badly hurt but free from the Death Eaters. During this time, members of the Order of the Phoenix were suspicious of Hermione except for Remus. Kingsley also grows close to Hermione which makes Severus extremely jealous to the point where he flicks a pair of her underwear at her while her and Kingsley go for a drink. Lucius and Bellatrix end up being big enemies in most of the story and it ends with a huge final battle scene where Minerva dies while saving Severus. Hermione almost dies but Voldemort ends up getting defeated and they both end up surviving and reuniting.

Hopefully that sounds familiar to someone out there!
