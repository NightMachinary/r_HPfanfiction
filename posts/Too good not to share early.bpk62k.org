A small portion of one of my unpublished chapters that I recently wrote that I just had to share early.

Harry wasn't sure if putting down his nightmares into a journal for another person to read was such a good idea, but ended up deciding that in the off chance he had a ‘normal' dream, he'd put it into the diary. Otherwise, he would just make up some rubbish.

​

“Hey, Ron, what are some normal things a bloke dreams about?” Harry asked as everyone began to pack up to leave.

​

“Girls.” Ron said quickly before turning a bit red. “And, uh, other things too. Why? You're a bloke, you ought ‘ta know.”

​

“My dreams aren't exactly the standard fare,” Harry countered as Neville joined up with them. “What about you Nev, what do you dream about?”

​

“Girls,” Neville quickly said before he, like Ron, turned red. “And, uh, other thighs. THINGS! I meant things!”

​

“What do you mean, ‘you meant things'?” Hermione asked as she joined them on their way to Defence. Both Neville and Ron turned an amazing shade of red before Harry decided to answer her.

​

“Nothing. How was Runes?”

​

“Exciting!” Hermione bubbled as she began to try and get Harry excited about the prospects of working with hieroglyphics. However, Hermione, like everyone else, fell silent once they walked into the classroom Professor Umbridge had decided to use.
