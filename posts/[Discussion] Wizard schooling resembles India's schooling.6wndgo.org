Just an observation that I realized in the shower a few days ago

Basically in India you have grade school til 10th grade, take board exams, and then go to a college (based on those scores) for 2 years (called grades 11 and 12). After that, you take another exam based on what you specialized in (India has Commerce, Arts, Sciences subjects you pick within that), and go to a job or University again for a few years.

So in Hogwarts, you go through school til 5th year, when everyone is ~15 (10th grade), take OWL's (board exams) which determine what you take for 6th and 7th year (11th & 12th) as well as it being towards your future career, take NEWT's (just like the exams after 11th & 12th), and then graduate.

The only thing different is that there is no additional schooling after NEWT's, but as previous discussions mentioned, the UK wizarding world resembles the old fashioned apprenticeship system.


** I'm pretty sure NEWTs classes are supposed to be the wizarding equivalent of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level_(United_Kingdom)][A level courses]] in UK secondary school.

*** And OWLs reflect the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education][GCSEs]] (or possibly the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Ordinary_Level_(United_Kingdom)][O-Levels]] given JKR's age). Even choosing the optional subjects in third year is reflective of choosing your GCSE optionals.

**** India's school system is very similar to the UK's (or the same as, just with different name's for the exams and grade levels) because it was occupied by Great Britain until '47 and many of the states school systems still reflect that.

**** *General Certificate of Secondary Education*

The General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is an academic qualification awarded in a specified subject, generally taken in a number of subjects by pupils in secondary education in England and Wales over two years. It was introduced in the UK for a first examination in 1988 to replace O-level and CSE examinations.

One of the main changes to previous educational qualifications in the United Kingdom was to allow pupils to complete coursework during their two years of study, which was marked by their teachers and contributed to their final examination grade. There has been a move recently from doing coursework and modular examinations for part of the course when pupils would take exams throughout the course to an end of year exam after the two years of study (a 'linear' series).

*GCE Ordinary Level (United Kingdom)*

The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level, also called the O-level or O level, was a subject-based academic qualification. Introduced in 1951 as a replacement for existing 16+ School Certificate (SC), the O-level would act as a pathway to the new, more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (Advanced Level), in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Later the complementary and more vocational Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was added to broaden the subjects available and offer qualifications in non academic subjects. The O-Level and CSE were replaced in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the GCSE and later complementary IGCSE exams.

*** *GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)*

The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level, or A Level, is a secondary school leaving qualification in the United Kingdom, offered as a main qualification in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, as an alternative qualification in Scotland, and as an international school qualification worldwide.

A Levels require studying an offered A level subject over a two-year period and sitting for an examination at the end of each year (A1/S and A2, respectively), proctored by an official assessment body. Most students study three or four A level subjects simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16--18) in a secondary school, in a sixth form college, in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their further education. A levels are regarded as better in level to the BTEC Level 3 qualifications.

** I wouldn't know, I don't know anything about education in India yet that's an interesting observation. I wonder if JK Rowling did it un propose.
