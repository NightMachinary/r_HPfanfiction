** linkffn(8946250) has a Triwizard Tournament which has Louis participating on behalf of Beauxbatons and one of Percy's daughters on behalf of Hogwarts if I recall correctly but it's a minor plot in the story so I'm not entirely sure if it's what you're looking for. Also you'd have to read Books 1 (maybe not so much) and 2 of the series for the story to make sense.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 3/7. They call themselves Sandbloods. They're Squibs; less than Mudbloods, their magic dried up, like mud to sand. They've targeted the Potters. Unaware of this, and eager to learn to use two wands, Albus enters third year. But if he suddenly can't use even the simplest spells, how will he fight the Sandblood Rising? COMPLETE!
