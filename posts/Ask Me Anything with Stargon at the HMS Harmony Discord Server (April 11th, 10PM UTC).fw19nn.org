***** I've got nothing else going on and I read quickly. Â¯\/(ãƒ„)//Â¯

Can't actually think of too many questions, though, it was a fairly well put together saga. There are a couple plot points I disliked or disagreed with, but all told I think the story did what the author wanted it to.

****** This series will probably always hold a special place in my heart simply bc....well it had a goal from the start of Book 1 and I think it reached it by the end. Fulfilling.

Complete canon rewrites feel so ...rare so I appreciate this one all the more.
