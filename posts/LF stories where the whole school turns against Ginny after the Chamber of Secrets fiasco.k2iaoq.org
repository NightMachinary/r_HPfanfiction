And the people who got petrified especially have some beef against Ginny and refused to have anything to do with her. In other words, she becomes a schoolwide pariah.


** 1. “The Reason Not To by sbmcneil” linkao3(12670959) ... yes, it is about an attempted suicide, so it can contain triggers if it matters to you.

2. There are plenty of stories where Lucius Malfoy bribes the Ministry to put all blame on Ginny and send her straight to Azkaban. If the original intent was to destroy a reputation of Weasley family, what better way than to send their daughter to the jail for trying to kill whole lot of Muggleborns. The result is obviously usually pretty dark, so I don't like those stories much.

3. Azkaban is suggested as an option in “Petrification Profileration by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14031132), but the story is a nice fluff, so of course nothing comes out of it.

  Ginny is finding it hard to simply forget her troubles from her first year. Her brother are still ignoring her and her classmates are making things very difficult. She is lost and heading for disaster, but luckily Harry finds her first. *trigger warning - discusses suicidal thoughts and planning*

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
