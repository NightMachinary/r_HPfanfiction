Love Remus Lupin in the books and his death devastated me. I have loved reading about him in the fan fiction world and I would love some recommendations of what are some of the best Remus Lupin romance fanfics where he isn't paired with Tonks. I never quite believed the two of them together and would love to see some other options out there in the fanfiction world...

  A post DH AU in three parts. We all craft our own happy endings. Even in the best of all possible worlds, romances decay and constellations fall from the sky, but Remus Lupin will pin them back up in a world that has already forgotten what he sacrificed.

  Werewolf!Hermione. Remione. In which there are strange magical happenings, time and dimension travel, and other wolfy things. "Hermione mused, in some detached part of her brain, over how fitting it was that she was going to die on Friday the 13th. She'd never been much of a superstitious person, so she supposed this was life's cruel way of punishing her with the irony."

** Well, the best Remus/Hermione time travel fic I've read is linkffn(8619724)

There's also a whole slew of wonderfully written and generally brilliant Remus/Sirius fics out there. I imagine you're probably familiar with The Shoebox Project, but if not, that's where you should start. It's phenomenal and totally believable.

Other awesome R/S fics: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/315289/chapters/505632]])
