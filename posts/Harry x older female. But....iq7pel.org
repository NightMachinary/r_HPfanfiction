*** It says it's 'critical' of Dumbledore and Ron. Does it bash them? I really cannot take Ron and Dumbledore bashing anymore.

**** Tbf does it need to be bashing to be critical of Dumbledore and Ron?

Ron is pretty much a disgusting slob who isn't exactly a subtle creature, potentially redeeming qualities notwithstanding.

Dumbledore keeps secrets and if he isn't evil he's up to some background bullshit and being generally unhelpful. Where was his ass during the Umbridge Inquisition? Where the public service announcements in the Daily Prophet informing the country of Sirius' innocence or making it clear from Day 1 that one of the most powerful and magically knowledgable dark wizards might not be completely dead?

** Why no Fleur?

This is basically HarryxTonks or an OC.

I don't recall any HarryxTonks where there's no bashing though, but I would like some.
