  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I completely take back what I said below. It is absolutely very promising. It's written in several parts with three posted and the fourth presumably the last as yet unwritten, though the author is active. And those three parts are like holyfuckingshit good. Harry's quite OP but it totally works in context. Definitely worth the read at slightly less than 94k words.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** Funnily enough, Harry's abuse has had almost no effect on his personality and development, so if you just pretend that the Dursleys don't exist, so pretty much any fics where Dursleys don't play a part will do.

*** Maybe. Still, one could imagine that having James and Lily around might result in a Harry with far more confidence.

I'm not saying for a /second/ that the Dursleys stymied him, but knowing what we do of James and Lily's personalities, it is fair to think there would be a noticeable difference.

It respects the parameter of a kinder family and it was the only (beside hpmor) that came to my mind.
