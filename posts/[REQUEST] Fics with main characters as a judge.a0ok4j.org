I think it would be interesting to see a story revolving around (specifically Harry or Hermione) being a judge (as in court of law).

The plot bunny I imagine is that the structure of the judicial part of the ministry is changed after the war and Harry or Hermione end up as a judge.

I believe their approaches to the job would be interesting. Would Harry rely on this gut instinct for good? Would he or others try to temper that instinct with a firmer legal footing?

Really, it seems like a nice, high-stakes way to highlight some character traits in a new way.
