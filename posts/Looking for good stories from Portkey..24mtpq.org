** It greatly annoys me that almost no FF site allows sorting by length. I want to see the longest fics, then their rating, number of favs, etc. Why is this so difficult?

**** I remember a year or two ago I was able to alter the search URL in FF.net to look for fics longer than 100K words, but now, doing the same thing (ie. changing the 100 to something else in the URL) results in an error. They're improving some things, but making other things harder, and not for our benefit either, if the number of ads is anything to go by.

*** It really comes down to the fact that most people who run sites don't know the code their site runs on. Most people use some combination of frameworks that does 99% of the work for them, and don't do much other than configuring the software in ways that can be explained by cursory glances in the FAQ that comes with it... and even if they do have the technical knowledge to go beyond that, they do not have the time or are unwilling to pay someone to do it for them.

Most fan fiction websites don't have multiple programmers tweaking the code in order to implement strong search functionality. They have maybe one or two people who want their site to be able to function first as a capable repository for stories, is secure and fault free, and doesn't look like every other site; which is time consuming in and of itself when it isn't a full-time job.

*** Well, most HP fanfiction archives were made somewhere around 1998/2002 (the boom of HP fanfics), so that's expected. Most of them were probably crudely made in FrontPage 2000 for dial up connections, so there isn't much hope. The two big one nowaday (AO3, FF.NET) certainly has a better search function.

** I personally love the author madscientist and I can't remember draco being much of a character in most of his stories [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/4941][one of my favorites]]

** Portkey doesn't allow D/Hr stories or slash. Strictly J/L, H/Hr, RW/LL, and G/D, which is a godsend for people like myself who find all other ships distasteful.

If you don't mind epilogue compliant fics, Love Lost, Love Found is excellent. I won't spoil it for you, but if you're anti-Weasley it's perfect.

Harry Potter and the Circle's End is a great post 6th year fic.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/4941]]

Could you post about what rating you're looking for? The two recommendations I've made are M and MA respectively, so be forewarned. Also what sort of length you want as well.

The best T rated fic (imo) is undoubtedly Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion, but it's not on portkey.

I have to add a disclaimer, though. My taste may very well differ from yours. I'm only good at deciding what /I/ like, much like you set your own preferences. For example, I really despise angst and pathos but quite enjoy strong action sequences and fluff. I wish you luck!

**** I can get behind that sentiment. Too much negativity can easily spoil a fic. /Love Lost, Love Found/ doesn't have any bashing. It just doesn't mention Ginny or Ron.
