:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for the HP creature fanfic where Severus is Harry's biological father and when Harry came to his age, Severus and Lucius came to get him. I'm not sure if this was part but when they got there, they also saw the Dursley abusing him and when Lucius got Harry, Severus tortured and kills the Dursleys.

I also remember a part where Draco and Harry where taking a bath together and while Draco was scrubbing Harry's back, Harry accidentally moaned out loud. And both their father burst through the door.

This fanfic was a slash and it was a Dumbledore bashing. I also remember Draco's mates are Fred and George Weasley and Harry's mates are Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom.

I hope you know this fanfic and I really appreciate it if you would tell me. Thank you!


** Hello, I've never read this fic before but seeing as no one else has deemed to help you, I'd like to help you search for it---assuming you haven't already found it?

Do you remember what site you read it on? How many words were there? Was it completed? And can you recall any tags that might have been used?

**** I'm glad! This sub has... a tendency to ignore people asking for help when it concerns Snape---at least when he isn't portrayed as a baby-eater. Thanks for leaving the link :)
