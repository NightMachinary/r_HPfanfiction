Hey guys,

because we all know that Voldemort's horcruxes were really badly chosen (objects - with the exception of the diary - that anybody could identify! I mean he freaking stole a few of them from a prominent pureblood which who either collected or inherited them!) and not all that well hidden (places that are significant to Voldemort, instead of places that nobody in their right mind would go to, like Antarctica (wizards would probably not go there, they aren't into climate sciences I believe and they don't want to study polar bears either - Dragons are much more interesting after all!))

I would like your best ideas for horcruxes, both the physical object (or animal or maybe even another human being like a lover or something like that) and the location(s) (if any!) you would hide them (and if you would make more than one!)

I'll start us off:

I would probably not make more than one (doing so might have driven Voldemort insane, something I'd like to avoid) and I would chose a golden snitch that I'd enchant the crap out off (detects living beings (muggles, witches and wizards and especially magical animals like dragons and beings like dementors) in a several mile radius approaching and avoids them at any cost, is unbreakable (sure the horcrux supposedly provides that, but you can't be too sure!), invisible and disilusioned (thus hard to detect) and it can be re-called (so I can in theory destroy my own horcrux should I for some reason want to!) and it would also roam the world freely)


** 1. Make grains of sand into horcruxes.Â¨

2. Throw them at some beach.

3. Have them stolen by Saudi Arabian or Chinese cement companies.

4. Have them hidden forever in a shoddily built building.

5. ????

6. Live forever.

**** presumably to keep the option to destroy them yourself if needed. better to have the option and not use it than to need it and not have it. a self-mobile horcrux that is unreachable to anyone except when called for by its master from anywhere on the surface of the planet seems the most useful type.

As for "in orbit" - great idea, at least until the muggles start cleaning up space trash (ok: the device would probably avoid them, still can't be too careful!)

**** This line of thought always pisses me off. It cheapens the concept of a Horcrux so much. I will always maintain that a Horcrux is required to be something extremely personal and significant to you due to the fact that you are /tearing off a fragment of your eternal soul/ to stuff inside an object. It's literally an abomination of the natural order of life and death, not some anchor you shove off the edge of your boat and then cut the rope later and forget about it.

***** Why? It's not like Hufflepuff's cup was significant to Voldemort (he's not related to that house, is he?), he just wanted to possess it and went a step further when making it into a horcrux!

Seriously, canon doesn't say that! Yes, you can write a story that says that, but Harry himself could still use a golden snitch (the one his father was tossing about, because it is significant to him - it was his dad's after all!)

****** Voldemort was very ego-centric. It meant as much to him that others he considered unworthy would /not/ have it, as it would for him to have it. Also, the houses themselves did not matter to him, but the fact that these artifacts belonged to the founders of Hogwarts, the only place he ever called home, did. It was not significant and personal in the memories he had of it, but of what it represented. You'll remember that he also had Ravenclaw's Diadem and Slytherin's Locket. The only reason he didn't add Gryffindor's Sword to the pile was because he could never find it.

Yes, canon doesn't say that. This is explicitly headcanon, but really now! You. Are. Splitting. Your. SOUL. You are using the darkest of magics to disrupt the cycle of life and death and prevent yourself from passing on. This HAS to have a price to it, otherwise the action has no significant weight to it. In my opinion, the dire severity of this act absolutely necessitates natural counterweights in the form of personal significance and difficulty hiding it. Otherwise people could do exactly as they're suggesting in this thread and avoid death for as long as they please, and I simply don't think that's what a Horcrux is about.

Yes, Harry could use the snitch. No reason he couldn't. The only requirement would be personal significance, which you provided.

** Well if you have a way to regain your body without the use of your Horcrux, sending it in a place beings (even magicals) will have high difficulties to get like space or inside a volcano (or a star to mix the two ideas) wouldn't be such a bad idea if indeed it cannot be destroyed by other means than Fiendfyre and Basilisk Venom. Having on it a Fidelius (either the place, the object or both) and killing the Secret Keeper without letting him telling anyone or being the keeper yourself wouldn't hurt.

If you need it to resurrect well you better put it in a place hard to reach on earth but attainable if following a set of instructions. As for the location well either a place magicals wouldn't think of (muggle world) or just hidden in plain sight and even better in something that is already guarded by the actual government (might be risky though).

If you could put it in an animal well Phoenix can't be destroyed apparently (except if you consider it's rebirth as a destruction of the body...) so you would more or less have a indestructible Horcrux even more indestructible. Add to it that you would surely have control of the bird you could avoid people by flashing wherever you want and hiding during your burning days.

As far as we know Dementors are also indestructible so it could be an idea though maybe putting a part of your soul in a Dementor might have adverse effects.

Honestly anything in a decent museum is going to be well preserved and as a witch or wizard it would be pretty simple to borrow it, take it with you to a murder and return it before anyone notices it missing.

** HPMOR had an interesting way of addressing this, where Voldemort literally made hundreds of "horcruxes" (not actually pieces of his soul, but rather copies of his memories and experiences) out of ordinary objects and hid them in inaccessible locations- he put one on a space probe, one in an underwater trench, one in a volcano, etc. The issue ended up being that he couldn't use them to "possess" anyone since people weren't in contact with them.

Prince of Slytherin made a rule about Horcruxes needing to be magical artifacts, so he literally couldn't. but also gives the person with the Horcrux access to the magical abilities of the artifacts, i.e. it has Slytherin Locket drastically augment Voldemort's Legilimency capabilities.

Another common fanon interpretation is that the spells needed to make the Horcrux indestructible work better on magical artifacts than random rocks, and maybe Voldemort is aware that destroying his soul jars will destabilize him in some way.

In canon, the best explanation is just that Voldemort was super cocky/grandstanding in his choice. Canonically, we don't /really/ know what would've happened if Voldemort died but still had one or more Horcruxes destroyed. With less of a soul and no body, it's perfectly possible that he go would completely insane, but he could just stop existing altogether. The closest analog to a Horcrux I can think of are phylacteries (which hold whole souls for liches, the body doesn't have a soul at all), with a twist, but the mechanics of how a "fractional" soul works don't really have an clear existing basis.

** I would think that the entire concept of a Horcrux defies any attempt to make it impossible to find. You are creating an abomination of the natural order by tearing off a piece of your immortal soul. It's /supposed/ to be something significant and personal. It's /supposed/ to be something easily tied to you. That's the natural price of the /freaking Black Magic/ that you performed to escape Death itself. Without this it's just a cheap bullshit +1 life mcguffin that any dark witch or wizard can make as they please.

So, the best idea for a Horcrux is what is most personal to you, the creator. And to hell with the difficulties in hiding it.

*** People assume Horcrux are invulnerable to all damage, minus the 2-3 very specific counters. So throwing your soul into somewhere a wizard won't likely find it is better security than hiding it in an easy tofind place with the best protections.

Further they assume your soul can float around and possess animals/Quirrel without them needing to come into contact with your horcrux. Which seems to be canon since there were no Horcrux' in Albania
