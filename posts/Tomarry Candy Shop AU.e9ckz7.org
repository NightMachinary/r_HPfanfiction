Tom is temporarily working at a candy shop (but is soon to start his own business or something.)

He's irritated at his daily customer, Harry, who always brings a different girl with him.

Buuut, he slowly falls for Harry and becomes jelly of the girls.

Well, it turns out they aren't in that kind of relationship with Harry at all - I dunno, it could, for example, be his job to take lonely ladies on dates, but nothing more than a kiss.

Please, I need this AU, somebody, anybody, write this


** Well there is one that harry had a flower shop and is kinda your prompt

**** Don't have a link but I remember this, it's called something like â€˜don't fuck with florists (they'll fuck you up)'. That should be enough to find it if you haven't already.

****** No worries :) I came across the post and the title popped into my head (it's a great and memorable title) so I thought I'd share just in case.
