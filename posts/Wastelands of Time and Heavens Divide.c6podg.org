Good morning/afternoon/evening dear redditors,

Today, after kind of a flashback, I wanted to ask about your honest opinion about reading Harry Potter fanfiction while listening to music. Two years ago, I started to read Harry Potter and the Wastelands of time linkffn(4068153) while listening to a, at least in my opinion, magnificent piece of music, namely "Heavens Divide" (MGS fans could be familiar with this). In my humble opinion, these two pieces of art compliment each other in a way, that was never forseen by the creators. To this day, it is hard for me to put my thoughts into typable words, as I got to expierience the harmony between the written words and the composed chords without any outside input. Have you ever experienced anything in the same way? Do you prefer to listen to music while reading fanfiction or to you prefer the echo of your own thoughts without any outside disruptions? Feel free to share any thoughts comming to your mind here.

Best regards,

A pale moon presence


** The mgs series is one I always wanted to get into but got pushed back for other franchises. Need to get on it.

Love wastelands of time though. Do you have any other fanfics you'd reccomend in a similar vein? Like powerful Harry, quality writing, and good action.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
