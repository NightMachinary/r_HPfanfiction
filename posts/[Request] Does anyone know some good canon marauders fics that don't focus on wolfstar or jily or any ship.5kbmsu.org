I'd write the ones I've already read, but there are way to many.


** I'm currently writing linkffn(The Colour of Everything) which is the first wizarding war from Remus's point of view. While Jily is in there it's not the focus, and it's not wolfstar. At the moment only 3 chapters are up and it's a little slow paced, but should pick up with some interesting stuff very soon.

  For Remus Lupin, fresh from school and emboldened by the support of his friends, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything... The first volume in a canon compliant account of Remus Lupin's life, from Hogwarts onwards.

** "Casualties of the Coming War" linkffn(10880119), "Tin Soldiers" linkffn(11952805), "Dark and Dangerous" linkffn(11160186).

The first couple are by an author who writes a number of Marauders related fics, mostly centering on Sirius and they feature a lot of Sirius-James friendship too. Also, the last story is a Remus/Lily fic.

  After three years, the war was now bloodier than it had ever been and it was beginning to take a toll on their spirits. It felt like an uphill battle in which they never gained any ground. These days the obituaries were filled with familiar names. Could they really win a war if along the way they lost everything they held most dear? [One Shot]

  In hindsight, the signs were all there. Maybe if they had just paid more attention they could have been more careful. Probably not, but looking back at the events that had unfolded that night they all wished they hadn't had to learn this lesson the hard way. For this lesson may very well cost one of the Marauders his life.
