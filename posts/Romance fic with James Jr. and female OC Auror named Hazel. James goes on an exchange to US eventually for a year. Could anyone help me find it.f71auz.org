** That is from FloreatCastellum. She has some of her stuff on AO3, but I'm not sure all of her Hazel/James writing is. Should all be available on her Tumblr though.

#+begin_quote
  James Sirius Potter's hobbies include annoying people, leading his father to an early grave with his career choice, and managing to fall in love at the drop of a pointy hat, inevitably ending in heartbreak. Hazel's hobbies include trying to be professional, getting wound up by James, and consistently managing to end up in awkward situations. Following popular demand on Tumblr, a nonlinear account of James Sirius Potter's realisation of true love. Spoilers for In Mendax/Theia Higglesworth Trilogy, but can be read independently of that series.
