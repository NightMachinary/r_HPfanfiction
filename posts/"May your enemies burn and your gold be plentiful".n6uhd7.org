We can all recognize a standard ?fanon? goblin greeting when we see one. Rather than a standard greeting, what are some of the weirdest, grossest, most violent and/or longest greetings you've ever seen or can think of?

** The Goblin Leader inclined his head, "May you be reborn a Goblin of the first rank. By the unspoken Name of the Matriarch, It shall be done." Not a greeting, but in the one fic a goblin says it after making a deal. The story itself is good and the dumbledore bashing is explained later. Dumbledore was extremely senile and couldn't tell right from wrong.
