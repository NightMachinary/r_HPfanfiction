*** There's a wiki that has 3 Beauxbatons houses, ombre something, papillon something and I don't remember. And a silver arrow as a Sorting ceremony. I didn't give it much thought but then the other day I saw a quora answer which took that as truth. Is this something JKR has talked about?

***** Jkr did not invent the house system. School all over the UK have different houses and sort the students randomly into it.

So beauxbatons wouldn't not have houses because they want to do things differently but rather that the French don't have a school house system in place

***** Guessed so, but with JKR you never know. I would like a different system that houses, but still some sort system or peculiarity. Not sure what though.
