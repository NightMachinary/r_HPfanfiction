I really enjoy the occasional alternate universe H/Hr fics that build a completely different world and things are not quite the same. Can be as simple as H/Hr not meeting until 5th or 6th year for whatever reason (eg: What We're Fighting For) or even better, a complete alternate universe like (Hogwarts Battle School.)

Things I generally don't like: Dumbledore/Weasley (except for Molly or Ginny) bashing, harems, romance from chapter 1 (ie: Harry saw Hermione and she was the most beautiful girl in the world!!!)

Any suggestions? The longer the better!


** We, Alone by continuedinterest is a H/HR romance, adventure fic where both Harry and Hermione never went to Hogwarts. I enjoyed this but I thought it ended a little abruptly but the writer may eventually follow-up with a sequel

  Voldemort only waited five years. Harry Potter remained the unwanted nephew. Hermione Granger stayed the friendless know-it-all. That is until they found each other and magic. That is, until Voldemort found them. H/Hr. AU. Formerly known as Resolution.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
