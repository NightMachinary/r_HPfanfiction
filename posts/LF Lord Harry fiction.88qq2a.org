Hi I am looking for hp fanfics that have Harry independant , smart and emancipated. I am specially looking for management of the Ancient and Nomble Houses and political Harry in the Wizengamot in same time going to Hogwarts Ex : The Beguile and Devotion of a Black Heir (StarLight Massacre), Becoming Lord Potter-Black.(Dolceconbrio) . And without Hermione if possible I hate her


** Delenda Est by Lord Silvere, it has an excellent portrayal of politics in harry potter as well as the way lordship works with a lot of other stuff too, Unfortunately it does have hermione later on, but not as a main character. The pairing is Harry/Bellatrix done in a rather unusual (and subsequently quite enjoyable) way. Also, it has excellent time travel. (It is a time travel fic that doesn't use time turners or any cliche I can think of)

PS. It does have a sequel, but the it is a different story entirely set in the same universe, and it isn't nearly as good.

** I'm not so fond of Lord Potter stories, I always thought them a bit boring. Here's the only one I can think of. Dunno if it's good or bad, I never read it. As far as I know, there's a prequel, too.
