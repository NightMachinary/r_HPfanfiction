First magus and wizards have been separated for Millennia Compared to most other fic Which assume magi has been separated for the wizards relatively recently There has been several small Conflict between the two Societies over the Millennia

Wizards don't know about the existence of the holy church Thanks to the mage‚Äùs Association mostly due to fear of the Wizarding world reaction to learning of its existence

The Wizarding world doesn't know the existence of the grail war as well considering it's not well known within the world of magecraft

Wizards Generally fear the possibility of magi Getting involved because that's an massive escalation of whatever Conflict with the possibility that you whoever side the mages against being destroyed

Wizard-mage Exist But are smaller number Generally in the single digits every Century they come out from the crossing of two dominant magical bloodlines

Also enforcers =|=aurors actuality

What's the wizards Believe aurors=enforcers

I tend to stick to Both cannons most of the time
