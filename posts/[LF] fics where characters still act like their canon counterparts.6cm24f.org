That is to say, I don't want to read Dark!Harry or Dark!Dumbledore or an angelic Snape, or other sorts. I don't mind AU, as long as characters are still in-character (eg. Nightmares of Futures Past or the Innocent series). H/G would be nice, of course, but if it's not an essential part of the plot I don't mind other pairings.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is postwar Dark Trio. All of them are in character, but people change if they get pushed too far.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

If you think that Ron is OOC in LeQuin's work, may I introduce you to an average male teenager near you...

** Be nice if more fics had canon Ron, with dark humor laced with foresight and general being a good chum.
