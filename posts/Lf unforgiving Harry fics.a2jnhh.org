**** I don't think it is, that quote is in linkffn(9132770).

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  The extra bounce in his step the next day attracted quite a bit of attention. On his way back to the tower after lunch he was stopped by a blushing Susan Bones, who asked if he wanted to go to Hogsmeade with her sometime.

  Harry looked at her in shock. He remembered the redhead sneering at him in second year and warning Justin to stay away from him, and then wearing that accursed badge last year. And only a few months ago he remembered her nodding along in agreement as he was once more called a liar. He bit back his first response and counted to ten in his head; there was no need to be that harsh.

  "Thank you for the invitation, Susan, but I don't think that is a good idea."

  She pouted. "But... why?"

  He clenched his hands in fury, but his words came out in a civil tone. "I have a long memory, Susan."

  "Oh! I... I see." She bowed her head. "I am sorry, Harry," she whispered, before dashing away.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

***** You are correct!

I've still read Weary Wizard several times though. I quite like it.
