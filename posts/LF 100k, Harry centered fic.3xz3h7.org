After looking through the most recent "looking for long fic" posts, I decided to open another one for the ability to ask for more specific things. Cause.. yeah, I need stuff to read over the holidays. Oh, and I'd prefere complete stories, but well, not always possible..

Must:\\
* Harry centered\\
* long (does not have to be 100k+ really, but that's a nice guideline)

Like:\\
* Time-Travel, especially if it includes the founders\\
* independent Harry, smart Harry\\
* not-so-evil Voldemort and manipulative Dumbledore\\
* WBWL

Dislike:\\
* Multi-Ship\\
* Childromances (betrothal contracts be damned, but please don't start being romantically interested in each other until 4th year)\\
* evil Harry (I say evil instead of dark due to some fics having a totally different meaning for dark)

Don't like but can overlook if entertaining to read:\\
* OP Harry, dumb Dumbledore/Voldemort, (aka "everything is too easy")

I also don't mind pureblood-royalty, dark magic background etc etc, if done well.

Some fics I really enjoyed:\\
* Out of the night (one of the reasons I don't like starting incomplete stories..)\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/][Basilisk-born]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/][An Aunt's love]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/][Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/][Angry Harry and the seven]] (one of those "lot's of things I don't like, but I still find it entertaining" cases)\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/][The well groomed mind]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The cupboard under the stairs]] + sequels

Thanks for any help!


** If you want Harry centered stories, you probably want to avoid H/Hr pairings, because Hermione tends to steal Harry's spotlight.

I thought about recommending *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), a wonderful time travel story, but Bellatrix is very strong here and just as important as Harry.

So my pick falls on *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), a long (almost 300k) and very well written time travel story.

*** How are the chances of it getting updated again after over a year? How long was it between the last update and the one before? But even if it isn't.. hell, that length will take a while. I'll take a look at it, thank you :)

**** Reading a story of this magnitude is perilous. If it ever updates again, you'll likely forget what happened previously, and I don't know about you, but the chances of rereading a 1.25MM story to play catch up is just not a thing I'm interested in doing. The story itself has its highs and low points, but other than reading it just to say you've read it and seen what the fuss is all about, you could give it a pass.

That happens to me with much shorter stories if they take long to update and I've read lots of other stuff in between.. So I definitely see your point. But as a last resort, the length is a great selling point against boredom for a long time :D

****** Personally, I don't think I made it a third of the way through the story before I just grew bored of it. The worldbuilding itself was excellent, but there are just a lot of prickly plot points. Plot devices like a Parselflute that suddenly appears, random Sirius/Remus shipping, referring to a 12 year old girl as a blonde bombshell... my interest slowly waned and I can't come up with the desire to trudge through all of that again.
