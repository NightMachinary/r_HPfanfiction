I've been looking for this fanfic for ages, it's where Harry lives with Sirius and remus with FOB band members and can sing really good but he hides it from everyone. He pretends to go for guitar lessons after Patrick finds out Harry can sing. Patrick tells Harry that he has to sing at the competition that they are partaking in. I believe that Harry sings Take me home by Jess Glynne while practicing how to be a rockstar with Patrick in their "guitar lessons"
