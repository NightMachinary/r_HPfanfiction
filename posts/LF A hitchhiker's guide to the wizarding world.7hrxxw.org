Looking for any fics that read along the lines of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. My initial thought would be that whomever is sent to bring Harry back to the wizarding world gives him the guide or maybe he just finds somewhere.

** Given that Earth only got a two-word entry in the Guide, I don't think Harry would actually have much use for it while navigating the wizarding world. :)
