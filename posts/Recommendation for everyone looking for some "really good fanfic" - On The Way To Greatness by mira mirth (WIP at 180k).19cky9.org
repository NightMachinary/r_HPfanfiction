Retelling with Harry as a Slytherin. This is one of those stories that takes our favourite settings and approaches it with a serious mindset. Characters evolve and behave realistically, given the premise. Many of them end up very different from canon, but with good reason based on story line.

This is also not one those fics that goes entirely off on tangents or relies on original inventions - the author changed one major variable, and the story evolves from there rather smoothly according to the canon premise. No new superpowers or special gimmicks - except perhaps some spells that weren't in cannon, but those are not used to hold up the story line.

No slash. No shipping at all really, as this fic is focused on Harry, schemes and politics. This story should be palatable to all "shippers" due to this neutrality.

This story was introduced to me from [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1919i9/what_are_your_favorite_stories_with_harry_being/c8kkpoz][this]] thread, and I would just really like to make sure that no like minded redditor misses out on this gem. And big thanks to LadyLigeia for bring it to my attention.

PS. If anyone has read this already and knows some non-slash works of similar style, please give us a link. I've already read HPMOR.

** A pretty well-known fic. One of the best Slytherin!Harry fics out there. And yet, in terms of story-telling style, grammar, and characterization... it needs some help.

** Just out of curiosity, does it end up with cannon pairings?

*** WIP.

At this point the canon characters seem to have deviated quite far - this author definitely kept in mind that if Harry is put in Slytherin, than there isn't a Harry Potter in Gryffindor to do all the things the canon one did starting from the first year. Canon Harry had a major impact on character development of both Hermione and Ron. I've read other fics that tried placing him in different Houses and most of them missed the part about all the kids shaping each other and the differences another sorting would produce.

TL.DR Don't know for sure and don't want to spoil the story with speculations.

*** I don't know about "ends up" but one of the author's notes in Chapter 5 states:

#+begin_quote
  there will be no slash and no pairings. Romance will eventually happen---featuring no canon couples, though---but it is very much peripheral to the plot.

** This fic is a great alternate universe story. I like so far, just wish the more recent chapters had more meat on their bones.

** Poison Pen by GenkaiFan is pretty good. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]] Anything by Rorschach's Blot is pretty good as well, but it does have a fair bit of pairings. (But very-little or no slash)
