Writers, what is a unique story that you have had but never written or is on pause? Readers, what's one that you've wanted but never seen made? Thanks! Mine is wandless Harry who can conjure weapons and use telekinesis on them and has telepathy and teleportation, but still is not invincible.


** HP/LotR. Balrog wakes up beneath Gringotts. Its presence transforms goblins back into their true nature, once again in the presence of a guiding mind of power. To feature Head Auror Harry Potter chasing a rampaging Balrog through Muggle London.

--------------

Christmas fic #1. Pre-Hogwarts, Dresden Files crossover. Nine-year-old Harry Potter never gets any Christmas presents and he wants to know why. He decides to take matters into his own hands and crawls up the Dursleys' chimney to find himself in a winter wonderland. Kid!Harry and kid!Maeve going on an adventure together to find Santa Claus.

--------------

Christmas fic #2. Dobby recruits Harry into a trip to the North Pole to help liberate the House Elves from their cruel master, the dark wizard Santa Claus.

--------------

Subversive Harry/Pansy romance that pokes fun at the misunderstood Slytherin girl and marriage contract tropes.

Essentially, back in sixth year, Pansy tricked Harry into signing a marriage contract by playing the "I'm just a poor, abused Slytherin girl who just wants to escape my Death Eater family and join your side" card, leading to a whirlwind romance where Harry, thinking with his dick, signs a marriage contract so that he can have sex with her. The moment the ink was on the page she reveals the ruse: she never cared for him, she just wants to inherit his money when Voldemort inevitably kills him.

Unfortunately for Pansy, Harry beat Voldemort and now the two of them are stuck together. The fic opens post-Hogwarts and follows Harry and Pansy as they each try to make each other's life so miserable that they ask for a divorce (the party requesting the divorce loses the cash). To feature both of them sleeping around and attempting to cock block the other.

I wouldn't want to play the fic as a straight-up romance because that's not the point, but the idea is for the two of them to develop a kind of camaraderie based on this competition they have going between them, and ultimately end up quite comfortable/quasi-affectionate with each other.

--------------

Poking fun at the "Ice Queen" thing by taking it entirely literally.

HBP divergence. When Scrimgeour comes to the Burrow at Christmas, he has a task for Harry: he must help the Ministry secure an alliance with the kingdom of Svalbard, one of the most powerful magical nations in the world. How? Rufus recommends starting with the King's daughter, the Ice Princess: Daphne Greengrass.

--------------

Speaking of ice...

When Elsa's powers leave Anna injured in the prologue to Frozen, her parents decide there's only one thing for it: she has to go to Hogwarts.

An Elsa-centric exploration of Hogwarts in the 1780s. Focus on drama and politics (Elsa being a future queen, the first magical royal in centuries, albeit of a small kingdom).

--------------

GoF peggy sue (fic where Harry's consciousness goes back in time to his younger self). Unlike other peggy sue fics, this is one year only. Harry grabs the portkey to escape the graveyard at the end of GoF just as Voldemort's spell hits it. When he lands, he finds himself just after he's been selected as a Champion.

(Important plot point: remember that Harry doesn't know about Moody at this point, though he does know that Voldemort has a servant at Hogwarts. Harry will be prevented from Gary Stu victory by confiding in Moody mid way through the fic).

--------------

HP/Buffy fusion fic where HP characters are merged into the Buffy world. Hogwarts is the code name for the school where the children of Watchers are sent. Tom Riddle was a powerful warlock who tried to take over the Watcher's Council. Harry's parents were Watchers killed by him.

We join the fic in Harry's second year at Cambridge university, where he is studying Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Norse, having been mentored under the magic expert Albus Dumbledore at school.

The plot is centred around an attempted resurrection of the necromancer Gellert Grindelwald, whose body was sent to Sunnydale to be protected by the Slayer. Unfortunately no one seems to have told her this... so Harry is sent by the Watcher's Council as part of a team under the Watcher Sirius Black to inform and assist Buffy.

--------------

HP/Stargate fusion. Post DH, no epilogue. Everything from Stargate has been "magicised": the Goa'uld are immortal non-corporeal magical beings which possess people magically, the Stargate is a magical portal between worlds, no space ships. When the Stargate is discovered in 1928 by a British expedition the Ministry of Magic appropriate it and it goes to the Department of Mysteries. They figure out how to activate it in 2008.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter has been gaining a name for himself as a globe trotting adventurer and has attracted the Ministry's attention thanks to a mysterious armband he found in Egypt. They bring him in, determined to take the arm band off him, and they reach a deal... Harry will let them borrow it, if they let him in on their secret project.

And so it is that Auror Ron Weasley, Unspeakable Hermione Weasley and adventurer Harry Potter go through the Stargate for the first time, accompanied by various other wizards.

As well as the obvious, the story would also uncover bit by bit the back story for how the various characters ended up in these situations.

--------------

CoS AU. Harry has never seen or even heard of house elves before, so he's dangerously naive. Dobby comes along, claims to be a house elf and claims Harry is in danger. All he needs to do is follow Dobby and Dobby will get him to safety...

... it turns out Dobby is not a house elf at all, but an erkling:

#+begin_quote
  Erklings are elfish creatures, three feet tall on average (making them larger than gnomes) with pointed faces, which have a particular affinity for the taste of children. Their high pitch cackles are particularly entrancing to children, and they use this to lure them away from their guardians to eat them. These creatures also enjoy shooting darts at unsuspecting victims.

Harry goes with Dobby and Dobby eats him.

*** Combination of a number of different plot bunnies into a single AU world:

We start off with elements from Lords of Magic, with alterations:

- Certain very rare wizards are born with magic which is qualitatively different from other wizards, making them significantly more magical beings. This does not just mean that their spells are stronger, it means that they have a greater connection to magic more generally e.g. superior magical instincts and senses. These wizards are known as the Alchemists.

- Alchemists have the power to perform true human transfiguration, not just of the body but also of the soul. This means they can use transfiguration to de-age your body and your soul won't remember your true age. By this means, alchemists are able to give themselves and anyone they choose immortal life (or at least, eternal youth).

- The wizarding population is significantly larger than in canon due to many wizards never dying (due to being deaged by the Alchemists).

- Due to the combination of the above factors, the politics of wizarding society is dominated by the rare Alchemists who are the source of immortality. Many of them are famous historical wizards from canon. Each alchemist has their own court - the set of families loyal to them, for whom they provide immortality in return for service in a feudal type relationship.

Now we veer off into new territory:

- The International Statute of Secrecy was never passed.

- All over the world, wizards actively and openly interfere in Muggle government (or rather, since there is no separation, simply THE government). In Britain this occurs to the extent that the political class is almost entirely the same as the magical elite. There are very few Muggles who occupy the top level of society. The wizarding elite rule the Muggle world directly, both politically and financially.

- Despite this, wizarding inequality remains - there are still poor wizards, though they're doing better than poor Muggles.

- The British Empire remains in full swing.

- Honour duels are still permitted.

- Technology has taken a different direction to the real world. The most notable absences are the lack of widespread electrification and the lack of development of rocketry (also no nuclear weapons). The industrial revolution still took place (with a magical twist) and there is a generally steampunky feel to technology. But it's not all bad news for Muggles: the proliferation of magical items for Muggle use has resulted in some novel technologies the modern Muggle world lacks, especially in the areas of medicine, transportation, and "magical AI".

- AIR SHIPS.

- As the wizarding elite became more and more embedded in the rule of the Muggle world, so too did they become more and more wedded to physical locations, and in particular London. As such, wizarding power and wealth have concentrated in London, and along with it so too has demand for local magical services.

- Over the years, magical theory becomes ever more complex as further advances are made. On top of this, new areas of magical study are developing relating to the use of magic in ways that did not occur in canon e.g. magical engineering, magic on the mass scale. These factors have resulted in a growing demand for magical tertiary education.

- The combination of the above two factors resulted, in the mid 1800s, in the founding of the Westminster College of the Magical Arts. It serves largely the children of the magical elite i.e. Hogwarts students.

- The Potter family are not part of the magical elite, but are rather solidly magical middle class (which still corresponds to a pretty high level of privilege, but which still means a large gulf separates them from the empire-spanning titans of commerce who occupy the top levels of society).

- Tom Riddle is a young Alchemist who promotes that wizards return to the "old ways" where they are less focused on industry and material wealth and more focused on individual magical achievement. He bemoans the impact the Muggle world has had on wizarding life and feels like wizards have lost their way, steadily making themselves more and more like Muggles and losing touch with their magic. He wishes to enact a separation between wizards and Muggles where wizards create their own society based entirely around magic and they leave the Muggles to their squalor and dirt. He promotes this cause through political means but of course uses plenty of underhand, illegal and immoral tactics. Many of the wizarding young and poor - those who are disadvantaged by the structure of wizarding society - flock to his cause. No "Voldemort", no civil war (except in the form of murders and disappearances).

- James Potter foolishly challenged Tom Riddle to an honour duel and was killed in that duel. Harry and his younger sister are raised by Lily.

- Harry does not attend Hogwarts, which is beyond his family's means, but he attends a decent school and achieves excellent grades, considered by all his teachers to be a magical talent. He is therefore able to secure a place at Westminster College, where he will rub shoulders with the magical elite.

- The story opens as Harry, age 18 and already accomplished in the magical arts, starts at Westminster College.

The focus of the story is largely political/social/relationship based, tracking:

- Harry's friendships and relationships at college, including a romance with Daphne Greengrass, someone who is socially completely out of his league.

- How he goes from being an outsider to beginning to break into the social circles of the magical elite.

- How he begins to attract the attention of both Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore due to his rapidly growing magical talents.

- The mystery of what led James Potter to challenge Tom Riddle to a duel, and Harry's potentially misguided desire for revenge.

--------------

Interdimensional HP Hunger Games. Head Auror Harry Potter is pulled through dimensions by a group of mysterious beings. It quickly emerges that he, along with a number of other people from other HP alternate universes, have been kidnapped in order to take part in a Hunger Games style tournament.

Whoever wins the Games gets to join the group of mysterious beings.

The competitors:

- Canon Harry, age 54, Head Auror.

- A Dumbledore from a universe where he sided with Grindelwald (before stabbing him in the back).

- A sane, coolly rational and deadly Lord Voldemort who won the war.

- A Lily Evans who led a bloody anti-Pureblood revolution.

- Helen of Troy, the Veela who launched a thousand ships.

- A Goblin banker, Head of Gringotts Mergers and Acquisitions.

- A Neville Longbottom in his 30s with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. (It will turn out at the end, after he tricks Harry into an alliance, that he's from a universe where the BWL was kidnapped and raised by Voldemort)

- A wand-wielding House Elf from a universe where he Elves overthrew wizard rule.

- An Incan wizard-king who harnessed mass human sacrifice to gain immortality.

- Gilderoy Lockhart who actually did what he says he did.

- Hagrid, from a world where Tom Riddle took him under his wing.

- Mia, an apparently average Hogwarts schoolgirl who seems to have been dragged in by mistake.

Each competitor is provided with a mentor. Harry is provided with the ghost of Severus Snape.

Fic is to focus not just on winning the games, but also on ultimately overthrowing the group who organised them.

Wildcard element, out of the control of the organisers: Sirius Black from Harry's universe, who ended up in the arena when he fell through the veil and has been living there for years.

The Room of Requirement was able to contain the Fiendfyre, but not stop it. For 19 years it has burned, the spell sustained by the nature of the room. For the Room of Requirement gives its occupant whatever it wants...

Next gen fic with a new villain: a sentient magical entity made of fiendfyre, born in the Room of Requirement.

--------------

AU where Harry was left a squib by Voldemort's attack in 1981... except he is a metamorphmagus. That power survived the attack. The fic would have Harry going to Muggle high school and would model itself roughly around the story structure shown in Buffy. Remus Lupin would become Harry's mentor, taking a role at the school, and he would have a few Muggle friends too. Together they interact with the fringes of the magical world, the bits that the wizards in their arrogance ignore as inferior and not their concern: werewolves, vampires, hags, etc. Wizards are a distant presence in the fic, like the Watcher's Council in Buffy.

--------------

Post-DH epilogue compliant time travel story where it's a Voldemort sympathiser who goes back in time, not Harry. There's a break-in at the Department of Mysteries and Auror Harry goes it investigate under his invisibility cloak. He arrives just in time to see a mysterious wizard in the time room fiddling with an artefact. A magical backlash knocks Harry out.

When he wakes the world has changed. His scar tingles: Voldemort is alive. He quickly realises that he is living in a dystopian world where Voldemort was never defeated.

After some near-misses with the authorities, Harry finds the remnant Order, who are very suspicious of him. Harry learns that he was killed in his summer before sixth year, assassinated by a mysterious assailant. It becomes clear: the wizard in the Department of Mysteries went back in time and killed Harry.

Harry tries to persuade the Order to make one last effort: they have to get Harry into Voldemort's Ministry so he can break into the Department of Mysteries, go back in time and prevent his own assassination.

The Order is sceptical, as their spirit is broken. Everyone is different to how Harry remembers. Remus and Tonks, for example, cannot bear to look at each other: Tonks is their mole within Voldemort's ranks, impersonating Narcissa Malfoy, whom the Order assassinated years ago. Remus can't stand that she is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy as part of her cover.

But eventually the Order relents. They assault the Ministry and make it to the DoM at the cost of many lives. Harry uses the time machine, goes back in time and prevents his own assassination.

And is stuck in the past. The alternate dystopian timeline is now but a figment of Harry's memories. It has corrected itself out of existence.

Epilogue: Harry, still in the past, goes to meet Albus Dumbledore. He confesses everything. Dumbledore explains how it is that Harry survived the change in the timeline: Harry's blood in Voldemort's veins. Voldemort being alive once more meant Harry could not die. This combined with Harry being under his invisibility cloak at the time of the change resulted in Harry both surviving the change but also not being displaced by it.

Harry confesses he has no idea what to do now. He misses his kids.

Dumbledore asks him some probing questions. He was able to walk into an Acromantula nest at the age of 12 and survive? He was able to take a portkey out of the graveyard, though Voldemort would not have planned for the portkey to be two-way? He broke into the Department of Mysteries aged 15 without any trouble? He was able to evade Voldemort's Ministry for months at the age of 17?

Harry understands. Like his experience with time turners, this was always meant to be. His presence in the past was already factored into the future. Harry would protect his younger self, guiding him from the shadows, unaware that he ever existed. He would return to the future the long way around. He will see his children again, on the day that his younger self disappears into the past.

--------------

For a while now I've wanted to see a HP story that deals with Harry and co. fighting against a curse. Not a "point and shoot" curse but one of the more arcane, mystical types of curses, like the DADA curse, or the curses on some of the books in the restricted section.

I see it as an in-canon mini-adventure that takes place within one of the books, between canon events. A long one shot or novella would work best. Like an episode of Buffy.

Not sure what the curse would be though.

--------------

Post-Deathly Hallows fic with a Harry/Fleur extramarital affair. A lot of plots going at once: Harry's relationship problems with Ginny, who is doing her last year at Hogwarts; his Auror work: part time training, but also working to capture the last Death Eaters; his developing magical ability, which has four causes - the removal of the horcrux piece, which he'd been unconsciously fighting for years, the mere fact that he can focus on magic for the first time in his life, his mastery of occlumency at the end of DH, and his Holly wand teaching him things it absorbed from Voldemort; Kingsley increasingly leaning on Harry politically, dragging Harry into the post-war political arena; and Harry's desire to be a part of Teddy Lupin's life, which is his point of regular contact with Fleur, who is helping Andromeda look after him. Also features a new form of full contact Quidditch which is quickly replacing the old in terms of popularity, which uses Voldemort's flight charm, reverse engineered by Flitwick. Episodic in format, each chapter being like the episode of a TV series - telling a contained story but also contributing to the greater arcs.

Envisaged as the backstory to the HP/Stargate fusion above, where the drama caused by the Harry/Fleur affair is what results Harry in leaving England and going travelling.

--------------

Teen comedy. Post-OotP, summer fic. Don't tell the Muggles, they said. Don't let them see. But Dudley's friend Mandy has amazing tits, and impressing her suddenly feels very important to Harry. International Statute of What?

** A story that shits on "werewolf culture". I remember reading a story where Hermione was bitten by Lupin in PoA, then some ministry dude showed up and started rambling about getting Hermione a pack, an alpha and all that stuff. Hermione, for some reason seemed quite happy with this.

That got me wondering why there are no fics where someone gets bitten but simply shrugs it off. They are different for 12 hours once a month. There's no reason to change your entire life due to that. Yes, there's a social stigma, but If you are trying to prove that you are still a functional member of society, perhaps living in a "pack" is not the best way to go.

Instead of romantising the whole werewolf thing, I want to read about a character who tries not to care about the whole thing. A character who rejects the idea of letting an illness define him/her but fight against both, the stigma and the victim mentality.

And preferably without turning Lupin into a good guy. The man did absolutely nothing for Harry but had to take marriage advice from a virgin too young to buy a pint of beer. He let the illness define him. He is the exact opposite of what I'm looking for.

*** I agree very much with this sentiment. I can't see Hermione hiding it if she had lycantropy, she's too much of an activist. I feel like Hermione would stop being a kick ass woman who happens to have an unfortunate disease to become The Werewolf who also happens to be Hermione. However I also don't see her going along with all of the bad muggle romance novel tropes either.

I can see Ginny playing off her lycantropy as a bad period and being very in your face with anyone who wants to challenge her on it. She would continue to be a famous Harpy and a mother and wife, and only much later when she decides to write her autobiography she slips in the details of being a kick ass sports star, prolific journalist, and mother while also turning into a werewolf once a month on the sly.

** Oooh pick me pick me!

I've been trying to write this for the past few months but realized I am not good enough to do the idea justice so its on hold, while I write other things. (HP/IC crossover at the moment)

I tried to make this a one shot but it just kept getting fleshed out so I sort of ran with it.

/Second Choice/

Brief Summary:

AU: Voldemort wins, Harry is not the child of prophecy and his parents are killed in the war. He is raised by Regulus as his brother's dying wish. Hogwarts only takes those of pureblood from good families, the rest are sent to trade schools. Ginny Weasley manages to get into Hogwarts due to something something power level something haven't figured out. While at Hogwarts Harry/Ginny become close, even though Harry knows she is below his station. Lots of stuff happens and bam its 4th year. Harry takes Daphne to the ball as the Greengrasses have been courting him, as the Potter name is old, even if disgraced slightly by James's treason. Daphne and Harry don't really like each other, but Daphne goes along with it as it is her family's wishes and Harry does as he is already in a precarious position (Voldemort won't forget the son of one of his enemies); this marriage would be a chance to cement his good standing.

So basically what I want to happen is Harry has to choose between Ginny who he loves, or Daphne who would grant him political immunity, wealth, and status. I plan on having three endings.

One with Ginny: In short they have a loving relationship until Voldemort kills him.

One with Daphne: He is miserable and lonely trapped in a loveless relationship.

The last where Harry unleashes Fiendfyre in the Wizengamot killing himself but taking the government with him.

My goal is to not only write a decent romance, but have the reader really think about the choices that are presented to them. Which ending would you choose would be what I want them to walk away from the story asking themselves.

** /The Sequestration of Draco Malfoy, or "Why didn't JKR have Hermione help Harry Investigate Draco in HBP?"/

--------------

/[In the Great Hall, about a half way through HBP. Harry and Hermione are eating breakfast. Harry expresses another suspicion regarding Draco. ]/

*Hermione:* [slams down her utensils] Fine. I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, and even if he were, he won't pull it off, but just so that you would leave me alone about this, fine, let's do something. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* Um... OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now. Also, here are your things.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practicing nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the Draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

*Harry:* I guess that's as good a solution as any.

--------------

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Hermione:* Yes, Harry, why did we put him in there? We still don't know if he was even planning anything!

*Harry:* Hey, you're the one who came up with the plan! I just wanted you to help me investigate!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

** There's no rule about posting more than one idea so back off I'm coming in with Plot Bunny number 2!

/Neutrality Above All./

Eventual Harry/Ginny. The story starts in the Chamber where Lord Voldemort gives Harry an ultimatum. Either get me a new body or the girl dies. Harry makes an unbreakable vow in return for an unbreakable vow not to hurt Ginny or Himself. His part of the vow is that he must take the diary and obtain Voldemort a new body which he does.

Over the summer Harry manages to resurrect LV with the diary's help. LV acknowledges his help and reminds him that his promise of not hurting Harry is only valid if he stays out of the way.

Harry says he understands, but while at Hogwarts he begins to feel guilt. He goes to Dumbledore hinting at what has occurred. (cannot say exactly, vow binds him somewhat)

Draco approaches him, (rumours of chamber) and asks him what happened. Harry hints at LV being back sublty, which Draco promptly demands to be taken to him. Harry sets up the meeting and Draco thanks him.

War progresses. Haven't fleshed the rest out yet.

TLDR: The premise is that Harry was trapped into helping LV and tries to toe the line between neutrality and helping each side occasionally. Eventually something happens that causes him to pick a side for good.

*I've never read a story where Harry truly tries to play both sides, both giving Voldemort just enough help to keep him placated, while helping Dumbledore enough to assuage his conscience while staying under the radar from LV.*

** The Sorcerous Seven: a retelling of the Seven Samurai in the Potterverse.

Summary: 19 years later, Goblins are arming for war. The one man who Minister Draco Malfoy believes could possibly stop them is the same wizard they've been trying to kill for the last twenty years- Harry Potter. Story based on/dedicated to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.

Starring: Harry Potter; Luna Lovegood; Cormac MacLaggan; Dean Thomas; Seamus Finnegan; Dennis Creevey; and introducing Harriet Orla Quirke.

With Appearances by: Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Percy Weasley, Daphne Greengrass, Asteria Greengrass Malfoy

Special Appearances by: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley

Act 1 - Draco realizes his huge mistake in trying to bluff the goblin clan. Blaise points out that everyone else who knew how to magically fight- not duel, but engage in lethal mass battle- had left Britain when Potter did. Draco sends Asteria and Daphne to lure Potter back to Britain in order to help.

Act 2 - The Greengrass girls find Harry solving a tricky situation by giving up his wand and taking down a possessed/dark wizard using a magic blade. Also witnessing the fight are Dean and Orla. Everyone meets. Harry agrees, despite protests. They find Dennis at the transit station and he shucks his uniform and says 'So, where are we going?' They bump into McLaggan while looking for Seamus in Ireland.

Act 3 - They meet with Draco and a few advisors. Draco insists that they operate anonymously, so that his Ministry can take credit if they win and blame poor hiring choices if they lose but survive. Harry accedes. He leads them to Luna, seeking guidance on how to win this fight. She tells them it is unwinnable. So, she'll come along and see if she's right. Retraining the Aurors, LEDs and militia to fight goblins takes time and stealth. When the first cadre gets rambunctious, they fight a sally force of goblins. While the cadre is decimated, the goblins weren't expecting any resistance at all. This will trigger the full invasion.

Act 4 - Luna sneaks into Gringott's to steal their plans. McLaggan tries something similar but gets his lieutenant killed. Orla falls in love with an amiable wizard who gets killed. The veterans console her by mentioning their own lost loves (Hermione; Ginny; the Patils; Susan Bones; Natalie McDonald)

Act 5 - using Luna's captured plans, they stage ambushes to handle each of the goblin armies that rise from the depths to invade. The battlegrounds include shopping malls, zoos, museums, low grade housing and King's Cross station; each commander handles their force as they will. In the end, they blunt the attack well enough that goblins sue for peace.

If you've seen the original, you should know who survives.

** I have three very different Voldemort-centric stories. The first two I have begun to write but abandoned for now because I wasn't happy with the results. The third is an idea too epic for me to do it justice and I haven't even tried.

- An AU diverging at the end of the first book: his ten years of agony as a flayed-spirit-thing in Albania, instead of turning Voldemort crazier than before, have driven him to reform. He only wanted the Stone to go back to a body, but would just use it the one time and then returning. Only, he still distrusts Dumbledore and thinks the Headmaster would just kill him on sight rather than listen to his plight. Faced with these facts, what's Harry (a Harry who does not yet have /that/ much reason to idolize Dumbledore) to do?

- Voldemort in Neverland. Young-adult 1960's Voldemort's world tour includes a stop by the magical land of Neverland, where he hopes to get the secret of unsupported flight from Peter Pan.

- Title: /The Horcrux Lords/. The year is 2011. Twenty years ago, a bold plot by Death Eaters who didn't quite understand how these things work led to all the Horcruxes getting body of their own like the Diary, plus the original Voldemort getting a body back. Ever since, the different Voldemorts have been waging war against one another. The Statute has fallen and the world is riddled with expanding kingdoms each ruled by one of the Voldemorts.

** I do have one I have been chewing on

I wanted to do a 'grey vs grey' (Voldemorte wasn't so bad, Dumbles wasn't so pure), and I also wanted to play around with the 'family magic / lords and ladies' setting.

Basically, the story would be Hermione confronts Snape about how you could have such a string anti-muggleborn movement when there are so few / they do so little in the Wizarding world. Snape struggles because she reminds him of Lily but eventually decides she deserves to know, and starts her on a path to discover the world isn't quite what it seems.

The world history is as follows: Early on, new Witch's and Wizards would get assaulted by the chaotic magic of the world. Those who survived were the stereotypical 'witch in the forest' type. This is because raw magic is so chaotic and against the order of the human mind that it burns them. Those who survive wished to protect their children, so their magic created a sort of 'shield' for members of their family. This would be the origin of magical families. A Child's magic would instinctively shield itself in the magic of the family, becoming a sort of self-enforcing system. A child considering itself a member of a magical family will have his magic enforce the subservience to the family's magical head.

Muggleborn's don't have the protection of a head of family, so you eventually see the evolution of an 'Apprentice' system, where existing magical families would take on Apprentices, thus giving them the protection of the families magic and protecting them from the chaos. Of course, if a muggleborn stayed independent for a generations, they would start a new magical line, but eventually this becomes very had to do. This would evolve into a national magical system (So because the wizard/witch considered themselves a british wizard or witch, their magic sought shelter in the 'old families' magical system, thus subserving themselves to that system. The formal apprentice system melts away, with Muggleborn's magical loyalty going to whatever family ends up needing them first.

The Grindelwald war was about the future of the muggleborns in the system, with Grindelwald wanting to abolish the entire system and force Muggleborns to be excluded by magical society. His vision would be to take the ones that survive into a second generation into the magical world. Dumbledore's side is for the status quo, with the muggleborn's being integrated into society but (quietly) losing their independence to the system.

After the war, most of what was being fought over was lost. The 'purebloods' who lost the war shunned the muggleborns, as a way to keep from taking them over. Of course, over time, the originally reasoning melts away, and ends up just being hostility toward muggleborns. The 'light' side sees no problems with Muggleborn's being inducted (non-optionally) into the major families: They get the protection, and the major families get operatives.

Fast Forward to the Marauder Era. Riddles official position is he wants to enforce a 'separate-but-equal' society with Muggleborns. Unlike Grindelwald, who simply wanted to cut the muggleborns out, Riddle would let them exist in a separate magical society until they have established a magical family, when they can be promoted to the 'real' magical society. This appeals to a young Snape, who saw his friend Lily get inducted into the Potter family: Her ambitions and dreams fading away to be replaced when James Potter gets elevated to head of family and has a 'purpose' for her. The real screwy thing of this is it is her own magic that does this to her, because of the system.

Of course, Riddle is going insane because of his Horocrux's. Dumbledore fights for the existing system (so what if the muggleborns loose some of their autonomy, they are part of society). Thus how the war devolves into the one we know.

Snape is of course, horrified to watch it going on over and over again in his students, but since his side lost, he really can't do anything. The pureblood side has mostly forgotten its history, and the light side doesn't really ask how the muggleborns they know end up serving them when they have need. Snape's hostility to Harry he is head of family and he sees another Potter Head taking a promising Muggleborn with her own dreams and ambitions.

Of course, Snape doesn't know all of this, so Hermione only gets a taste. She is appropriately horrified by the notion of losing her autonomy, and goes on a quest to figure out how the system works (thus learning the above over the course of the fic). It would include her explicitly setting it up so Harry (as a family head) needs her to find out the truth, thus protecting her from falling under the sway of other families. You can't flee the country, because the magic is based on ones self-image, and as long as you considered yourself a British Witch, your own magic would force you into the system.

It would deceivingly NOT be a H/HR fic, as that possibility would be one of those sacrificed by Hermione using Harry's position as family head. She could never be entirely sure of her own feelings.

Not quite sure where to set the intro, probably during GOF or POA.

**** Not sure why that is a plot hole?

Snape isn't going to know the world history, only his slice of it. Thus a good part of the story is Hermione discovering it

This isn't a very visible thing: concept is that the world remains as JK described it but with this sinister workings in the background. The system is there to describe why muggleborns all keep to the SOS & never really gain power. This is about soft power, not hard power. (A muggleborn businessman might start out for himself but after meeting the first head of family that needed him, he would start shifting to taking favorable deals for that family and bad ones for their enemies.)

The 'leave the country' is intended to be a viable option, but not overly desirable. The other countries systems are similarly problematic

Maybe I can clarify the magic system more: At the start each magical family member was (passively) pooling a bit of magic to be used to shield the families children. The children's magic sought shelter in this shield, and in exchange the children's magic molds them into what it considers appropriate for their family (yes there are loopholes here)

Now the national system grew out of using apprenticeships to extend this shield to muggleborns. Over time this resulted in a 'national shield'. Each British witch puts a bit of magic into a national (basic, less than the family shield) shield can protect young magic users. When a young witch's magic seeks shelter from the chaos, it seeks out this shield. In exchange, their magic molds them in accordance with the national system.

Thus if the British system is Lords and Ladies, magic helps shift the muggleborn views into accepting that. Of course, if you could change your self image, your magic would seek a different shield. But they would also come with costs, based on the priority of that group. For example, America (and other newer counties) would likely not have the "Noble family" type system and instead have a more nationalistic system. That can easily be portrayed as just as bad yet different.

I intended 'running away' to be a viable option to be explored after they figure out how the system works, but to have enough problems to make it not practical

/The Lion's Tale(s)/

/Massive/ 5 arc* thing (AU after the second arc). Lots of world building,loads of canon and non-canon stuff,even crosses over with LoTR and ASOIAF.

*1st arc:Marauders era. Notable in that it will feature Tessa Netting and Anna Brisbin,a pair of real-life Potterheads.

2nd arc:first war with Voldemort. Three points of divergence:

- Regulus lives

- Peter sacrifices himself so that all three Potters live

- At the same time,an assault happens on the Longbottoms,but Aurors arrive in time and they stay sane. Bellatrix and Barty Jr are still sent to Azkaban,Rabastan and Rodolphus are killed.

3rd arc:Harry's childhood. Obviously different for many reasons. Harry has his parents,Sirius,Regulus,Remus,and others to raise him and teach him about magic, and he has many childhood friends/future Hogwarts classmates. Oh,and Petunia marries somebody else.

4th arc:Harry's Hogwarts years. Lots of similar stuff to OTL,but also differences where possible. The following people get spared:

- Quirrell (his non-Voldemort half)

- Cedric (obviously)

- Sirius (obviously)

- Dumbledore (for a while)

- Remus and Tonks (obviously)

- Fred (ditto)

- Regulus (ditto)

- Lavender (who's in Middle Earth)

5th arc:the next generation. Haven't spent a whole lot of thought on this one yet.

It would be cool to explore Durmstrang or Beauxbatons and the logistics behind taking an entire year of students to a different country for like 9+ months. And any excuse for slow-burn Sirius/Remus and Lily-as-part-of-the-gang lol.

I think my plans are a little ambitious, though xP Coming up with interesting puzzles and challenges is a lot harder than writing the bits in between. I know it's not exactly a unique problem in this fandom, but I'm also not really sure how far to go in terms of filling in the gaps. If the Tournament had never been cancelled it's easy to assume that certain things would have changed a bit over 200 years. Like maybe they wouldn't have challenges where the audience literally sat and stared at a lake for an hour until something happened. My imagination tends to run wild in this fandom, and I don't really know how far to deviate from canon for the sake of world building and plot.

It would be fun to write though, lol.

Harry is the first who does, coming back from two decades of war from a world ruined by world war 3, started by Voldie etc. etc.

And then when he first enters the Hogwarts Exress he finds that Hermione did it as well, except she was smarter about it, going back as far as possible. (The day of her birth). She is also now a highly logical semi-dark techno-mage intent on bringing humanity to the stars.

And on and on it goes until practically no one of importance haven't gone back in time (by various methods and utility), and they all realize they will probably be trapped forever in this endless timeloop because whenever one side wins, the other just goes back in time and tries again.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

** So Harry died in the chamber of secrets but divine intervention resurrected him and combined him with the Basilisk and Fawkes (dead to Dark Ice curse). He basically has them as his animagus forms but also as metamorphmagus material? so he can look like a redhead because fawkes' plumage but he can't freestyle like Tonks. He takes the Diary (with Ginny Weasley in it) and eventually takes the Sword of Gryffindor and stabs Riddle back into the diary while destroying it, shunting Ginny back into existence moments before stabbing the diary. She becomes his devoted servant.

Oh, and he gets bit by Remus and throws werewolf powers in there. 50/50 on him making out with a Dementor and eating it too?

Since he has more dark creatures than light creatures, he is technically a Dark asset, and as such the Divine Entity that intervened with his death turns its back on him. Identity crisis ensues, oh look also a murder tournament.

Harry is pretty good at concealing his creatureselves, right up until the First Task.

#+begin_quote
  Moony (his werewolf-self): BIG LIZARD ROARED. ESTABLISH DOMINANCE.

  Fawkes: Oh yea, show everyone how majestic we are.

  Sal (the Basilisk): haha yes we are the King of Serpents let us show this silly little winged thing its mistake.

  Harry: THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY, PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL PLAN FOR THIS-

  Fawkes: Too late.

  Harry roars and becomes a basilisk sized, phoenix-winged, werewolf-shaped pile of danger and throws himself at the dragon, beating the crap out of it. The audience is entirely silent.
#+end_quote

Harry wins the tournament by sheer intimidation, has another Voldemort showdown, and comes back really really angry.

Fifth year, he gets kicked out of Hogwarts (Ginny follows him), and seeks a way of reassuring himself he's not evil. He hears legends of the Visalis, Sword of Light and Darkness, a blade that reflects the truth of the wielder. He eventually locates it. When he wields it, it is covered in oddly comforting black flames. Harry has a revelation that Dark does not mean Evil, and goes back to Hogwarts to defend the school from Umbridge.

He basically forms a vigilante group with a bunch of chill Slytherins, and sneaks into dormitories to heal people's Blood Quill wounds. Hermione started a group of people who would wear headbands with notice-me-not charms on them and draw Harry's scar with the blood quill. Never really thought about how they'd get rid of Umbridge, but Sirius doesn't die.

Harry makes a gang of Dark But Not Evil and makes a third side, since the Order are a bunch of wussies and don't like him anymore even though he is literally the phoenix they named their group after. Sirius, Remus, Hermione, the Weasleys, and the P.A. (Potter's Army) are kind of in limbo between the DBNE and the Order until the Order actually tries attacking Harry's faction.

Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort have this massive three-way battle, ending with Harry grabbing Voldemort, asking Dumbledore not to punish the D.B.N.E, and phoenix-flashing the Dark Lord into the sun. Last words: "Hot enough for ya?"

Plot twist Harry is a phoenix and doesn't die permanently, Earth is hit with a flaming, winged, baby-on-a-meteor about a year later.
