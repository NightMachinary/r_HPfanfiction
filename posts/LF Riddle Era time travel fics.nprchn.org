  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  ‚ÄúWhat I find absolutely fascinating,‚Äù Riddle said, stalking closer, ‚Äúis you.‚Äù He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. ‚ÄúDo you know why?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.‚Äù

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. ‚ÄúThat. Right there.‚Äù One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. ‚ÄúNathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...‚Äù

  He leaned closer, ‚ÄúYou look at me like you want to stab me.‚Äù After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. Seeking answers to his strange predicament, Harry returns to Hogwarts, and causes quite the stir through staff and students - especially when they come to realise he is not the same boy as before.He tries to avoid suspicion, but as his quest for the truth draws more and more attention to him, Harry begins to think that he might not like what he will discover.

So I'm going to pretend that I just thought of these and I don't have a dedicated doc for Tomarry fics sorted by tropeüò≥ because I definitely don't. nope. anyway, I have forgotten what a lot of these are like but they're all Tomarry apart from the ones I've specified aren't.

Edit: so I have just noticed that the post actually says ‚Äúprefer gen, tomarry fics are okay‚Äù rather than what I read when the words got mixed up in my head which was ‚Äúprefer Tomarry, gen fics are okay‚Äù. Whoops, hope you enjoy anyway!

I'll add this one then: linkao3(princeps by lomonaaeren)

  ‚ÄúBack the fuck off, Riddle.‚Äù

  Tom's heart stops abruptly in mid-beat. Did the new kid just--- He opens his mouth, but slams it shut quickly. No. He has to say something non-generic. He settles for, ‚ÄúIt is common courtesy to speak your first words to strangers with a certain level of politeness, Harry.‚Äù

  The boy doesn't so much as blink, and Tom is hit with the soul-crushing realisation that maybe, probably, his soulbond isn't reciprocated.

  There's a chamber in the Department of Mysteries that's [quote] Sorta like the Room of Requirement in Hogwarts except--- [endquote] it doesn't operate on your requirements, but rather your soulmate's. Harry and Hermione rush into it in hopes of finding a medical kit (anything to help their injured friends, really) and end up somewhen else.

  The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular.Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?

  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know. Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. It isn't long before they're tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why.

  Hermione Granger is in a losing war, one causing the world to fall apart at the seams. Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts, things have only grown more dim, with Voldemort creating even more horcruxes and his army growing larger still. The order has been disbanded and those she loved are either dead or soon to be dead. But even when the world is at its darkest, light will find a way to break free, and she may be the key to turning the war around- long before it took a turn for the worst."1943? And you'd like me to...kill Tom Riddle?" Dumbledore shook his head, that annoying twinkle glowing thrice as bright as before. "No, my dear. I'd like you to join him."

  A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it--smashing it--nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century.

  ‚ÄúThis is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,‚Äù Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù the boy hurried to correct. ‚ÄúJust Harry.‚ÄùAnd then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
