Like the ones such as Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, etc. I'm not new to fanfiction but have never figured out why it's there.


** It is used to identify a trait for a character that differentiates them from the original or other versions.

It also allows for a shorthand way to determine a characters actions/personality. For instance: "Dark!Harry" denotes a version of Harry who acts darker/more evil than canon Harry, using dark magic to achieve his goals, usually with no regard to the consequences.

** That's just what people put there to make it so the words don't run together. No deeper meaning as far as I know.

*** "In Harry Potter fanfiction, usually in stories written after the release of The Half-Blood Prince, this is typically used to indicate a female Blaise Zabini."

That isn't even close to the most common use of fem! In hpfanfiction...

OP - it is just another informal nomenclature, like "/" is used for pairings.

**** And "&" is used to denote platonic or familial relationships. For example, Harry/Hermione means they are probably banging in that story, Harry & Hermione means platonic cuddles at most.

**** Sure, but it still gives the general gist

TVTropes can be weird, outdated, or both- there was something I read there about a fandom-specific plot in Harry Potter where he starts out just as spoiled as Dudley, but I don't think I've read a single fanfic about it

** It's a way of referring to a character that is specifically one particular trait.

If anyone is curious, this explanation by hosekisama on tumblr explains where it probably came from:

/“Bang paths” (! is called a “bang" when not used for emphasis) were the first addressing scheme for email, before modern automatic routing was set up. If you wanted to write a mail to the Steve here in Engineering, you just wrote "Steve” in the to: field and the computer sent it to the local account named Steve. But if it was Steve over in the physics department you wrote it to phys!Steve; the computer sent it to the “phys” computer, which sent it in turn to the Steve account. To get Steve in the Art department over at NYU, you wrote NYU!art!Steve- your computer sends it to the NYU gateway computer sends it to the “art” computer sends it to the Steve account. Etc. (“Bang"s were just chosen because they were on the keyboard, not too visually noisy, and not used for a huge lot already)./

/It became pretty standard jargon, as I understand, to disambiguate when writing to other humans. First phys!Steve vs the Steve right next to you, just like you were taking to the machine, then getting looser (as jargon does) to reference, say, bearded!Steve vs bald!Steve./

/So I'm guessing alternate character version tags probably came from that./

The whole discussion can be found [[https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/95133324733/hey-whats-up-with-the-in-fandoms-ie][here]] if anyone is particularly interested. I think internet history, especially fandom history, is pretty fascinating.

** Well, the exclamation point does grab your attention, it says, hey, this ain't canon, the main character is fem! or in a different house! So please do not bitch, even though the trolls who need to nitpick at stories always do.
