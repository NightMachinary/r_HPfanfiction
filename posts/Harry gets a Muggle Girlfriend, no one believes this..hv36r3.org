Some time during the summer after another nearly deadly year at Hogwarts year Harry meets and hits it off with a nice girl.

And before he knows it he has a girlfriend!

But whenever he tells anyone they act like he's lying, with some girls even getting really mad when he does!

What Harry doesn't know is that "I have a muggle Girlfriend" is the Wizarding World's equivalent of saying "I have a Girlfriend in another country"


** I never thought of Harry getting a muggle girlfriend and it's such a nice concept. Like, imagine Harry being happy with a girl and away from the war for a while. He deserves it.

*** I've actually been working on an idea like this with a Sailor Moon crossover. Harry starts dating Minako before she returns to Japan.

Writing the two of them being sickeningly sweet is tooth rotting fun.

Writing Hermione's observations of just how /happy/ she makes Harry while Ron just goes "Wow, she's pretty, lucky you mate!" Is hilarious fun.

***** They're completely different systems, and I'm not really focusing on the Sailor Moon side of things. There's some references to where they are in the story, but Harry is largely staying out of the Senshi's fights just like they're staying out of his.

They're over 5,000 miles away from each other after all, aside from some short moments of Minako visiting Hogwarts, specifically for the Yule Ball, and Harry running to Japan for a while after 4th year, he's not going to really interact with their fights.

He will however be subject to the most terrifying grilling of his life from Minako's closest friends, two cats, and possibly infuriatingly annoying remarks by Chibi-Moon.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Senshi of Love by fitzgerald) is the only other one I've read, and I didn't think it was as good. It's a one-shot, and seems too abrupt. Being longer could have really helped it, I think.

*** linkffn(10751741)

The girlfriend is not a muggle but one of the name-only Ravenclaws, yet there is very little mention of magic and it is mostly summer fluff, teenagers acting as such and period-accurate pop-culture (as far as I can tell).

It is perhaps not the best fanfic ever written, but it is the perfect read after one too many IndyHarry fics where he becomes Lord Potter and gets a harem after Sirius died. One of my all-time favourites exactly for that reason.
