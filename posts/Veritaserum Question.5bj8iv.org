If someone took Veritaserum and was given a series of difficult math problems that could not be solved by a passing thought, what would their response be to them?

IIRC (this might be fanon... goodness knows I can hardly tell the difference when it comes to nuance), you can't resist answering for long if at all.

Would they be inclined to say "I don't know" since the answer is something not readily accessible to them? I don't think this is entirely honest, because they COULD know if they had a quill and parchment to solve. If you must answer immediately, however, it would prove the only credible response.

I might just be thinking too much into this, though.


** Well, it compels you to tell the truth as you know it, so they probably would tell that they would need time, pen and paper to solve it.

This applies to tons of questions - one /could/ know the answer if one attempted to find it. Veritaserum just compels someone to tell the truth as they know it. You could even /unknowingly/ lie under Veritaserum if you thought/believed that you were telling the truth.

That's not lying as such, though. You're still answering as honestly as you can. (But you of course know that, I'm just being pedantic.)

**** What fun is that you can still /deliberately/ unknowingly tell a mistruth, with careful obliviation and/or manufactured scenarios / memories.

***** Ah, now that sounds like interesting fodder for a plot detail in a fanfic. (Then again, now that I think about it, that happens in Conlaodh's Song by Enembee.)

** I think if they can't give an answer they believe to be true straight away, they'd say "I don't know". If you asked me what the sq rt of 239 x 17 is, even though I know how to find out, I wouldn't know right now, and I would /know/ that I don't know, so if I'm compelled to answer honestly, I'd say "I don't know".

It would be like asking someone what the capital of Ghana is. They know how to find out, they just don't know right now, so they'd say "I don't know" (unless their Ghana geography knowledge is up to scratch).

(it's Accra)

** I'd tend to write it as forcing a person to report things they already consciously know. If something requires more than a second of thought, they would reasonably be able to answer that they don't know.

** If I personally would be given a complex math problem and asked, under veritaserum, if I can solve it, or whats the result, I could honestly say that I have no clue. I didn't have use for complex mathematics for a good eight years now. I forgot most of its rules and logic and therefore cannot answer such a question.

Veritaserum is an interesting thing because one would have to ask beforehand "What even is (the) truth?". A philosophy-savvy person knowing Platon could probably answer, truthfully, that he doesn't know what happened as he would be aware that his personal perception was anything but an objective truth, let alone the whole truth.

Then again, maybe that goes too far. The Serum may just compel someone to speak of his version of what happened without lying about anything. Then, however, we could deduce that a Obliviate or different mind-altering magic may very well make any testimony given under veritaserum useless. One who cannot remember correctly and cannot lie, speaks only subjective truth.

An interesting version of veritaserum I once read about is the one that knocks out the subjective part of a brain and draws from the world the tidbits of information that the subject lacks, has forgotten, or hasn't even registered the first time, like a pensive in liquid form. Then speaking the truth would have an objective quality to it that made the serum usable in criminal prosecution and trials.

  A series of Vignettes involving possibly the second most powerful but underused magic in the HP universe, Veritaserum. AU after GOF. Rating increased to T due to a bit of implied sexual situations, attempted suicide, abuse, and other nasty stuff.

** Veritaserum forces the one to not try to lie (so they'd say what they think to be true), while at the same time inhibiting one's faculties to some degree (though how much exactly, we do not know) and either making them focus on answering the questions or making their focus totally crappy so they can't do anything but answer the questions as they come.

Whichever case it is, I highly doubt anyone dosed with Veritaserum who had access to a quill and parchment would even attempt to solve whatever problems they were given, and instead they'd simply answer “I don't know” because they do not know the answers right now so it's the one truthful response they can give.

It isn't about whether or not they “could know the truth”; it's about them giving an answer that they think is true the moment the question is asked. This is why it's so potent a truth potion---it does not allow you to freely think and act and then decide to go on a logic trip that would make you accept truth as “technically not true” and thus not say it---but also why it has to be handled carefully as badly-formulated questions could result in useless answers and if someone prepared beforehand they could erase the answers you are looking for which means you'd get “I don't know” (or worse, a manufactured answer that's actually completely untrue) instead of what you wanted.
