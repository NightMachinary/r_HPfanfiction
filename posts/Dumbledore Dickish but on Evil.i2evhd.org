I really don't stand bashing, it is OOC and as soon as I see any kind of bashing I'm out of a story. Dumbledore or Weasley bashing, but others as well. Even Draco bashing, if they make Draco wey more evil than he is in canon and more intelligent, I back away.

So, as a few recent posts on Dumbledore bashing and people justifying it, I decided to go through this good list of stuff people complain about Dumbledore and argue about it. The list was made by [[/u/rohan62442]]. My intention here is not saying that Dumbledore is a saint, but to put him where he is in canon, a grey dude who wanted to do Greater Good yes, but not one who would do evil acts left and right to accomplish his goals. Dumbledore is kind of an arse at times, but he is not downright evil. So let's go through his reasons and see which are valid and which are not.

​

#+begin_quote
  Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
#+end_quote

It is never mentioned if he gets the chance. And outright stating it as a flaw it's assuming Snape didn't apparate away the moment Dumbledore turned. Snape could have done so only to return soon asking Dumbledore to save Lily and there would be no fault in Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
#+end_quote

About taking care of his custody, it seems like a sensible option, Remus surely wasn't excited to have it because he was a werewolf.

Now the abuse is the biggest topic. There is no canon evidence for physical abuse, as some fics like to exaggerate. Maybe Dumbledore did have detection or something to inform him of physical abuse, we don't know. What we know it was that it was emotional abuse, belittling, making him do more chores than his cousin (Not on the level of cinderella, Harry was not washing Vernon's clothes or anything, Petunia still seemed to do things around the house, yet somewhere close). Not taking him out or letting him have fun when it risked other people talking bad about the Dursleys. Still, the Dursleys did try to find him what they considered a school that would be good for Harry, and tried to "fix him" as misguided as that was. Dudley hit Harry, but there are no indications that his parents even knew about this. There is no Petunia or Vernon quote encouraging Dudley's physical abuse on Harry. I think we hear something like they support "corrective discipline", from school or something, like spanking, but not Dudley hitting Harry for fun.

Now the grade of the abuse is cleared out. Let's see what's Dumbledore part was in it. He did leave Harry there as a baby, which was sort of a dickish move. However, he could have placed warming charms and concealments before leaving. And in that way, he didn't wake up the Dursleys and had them angry and the sort. Which doesn't excuse the fact that he could have talked to them in person the next morning and take care of Harry until then? However, it is more neglectful than downright evil. How much did he know about the abuse though? I venture to say that a big extend of it, he had Mrs. Figg there. So here is the thing, I don't really think this was evil, even if dickish move.

Consider that:

- Dumbledore had info from Mrs. Figg, so he knew Vernon was not hitting him. He might had had the occasional bruise from Dudley but nothing big enough to wince if Mrs. Fig held his arm or the stuff.

- Dumbledore could as a magical guardian sort of talk to Petunia to stop Harry from being physically abused. But, most of what Harry was subject to in that place was discipline, chores, and emotional abuse. About the chores and the discipline, there's no much he can do. I mean the Dursleys are the guardians if they think washing the dishes or doing this or that were his assigned chores or that Harry needed to be locked down because he misbehaved, what is Dumbledore to do? Go and ask Petunia for all the specifics on why did he send Harry to the cupboard? Pretty sure Mrs. Figg doesn't find about that stuff. Yes, Dudley didn't get to do those things, which is what the fandom hates, the spoiled kid. However, that is barely an argument, Dumbledore is not going to to to their house or to the ministry demanding that Dudley gets to do the exact same chores Harry does.

- About the emotional abuse, he couldn't do much either. The Dursleys had their mindset, and Dumbledore wasn't about to convince them that there was nothing wrong with being a wizard. Also, he couldn't really force them to love him. And, as in the point above, Mrs. Figg didn't saw most of this. Yes, she surely knew of their disdain for magic and them not wanting to talk about it, but she wouldn't have exact quotes to throw at Dumbledore that was bad enough. What's the biggest line? "Your father was useless and we're trying to make you not as useless as he was" or something like that? It is certainly bad for a kid, but there is no evilness there. Just plain dickishness.

- About not taking him out to have fun. Well, that's even sillier for Dumbledore to try to enforce. But guess he did prefer Harry to stay inside the wards and not outside.

- Dumbledore could have visited, but what would that accomplish? The Dursleys are not going to mistreat Harry in his presence.

- The cupboard. Yeah, it makes Harry feel so much less than Dudley. But then again, it was a space to live, he had his bed and his things. Lots of people live in worse conditions. He used hand-down clothes, so do many people. Harry is not living in the backyard. The Dursleys could easily justify this with "there was no space left in the house". And I don't think the Dursleys did this to punish Harry for anything, I do think they have Dudley so spoiled that they just thought Dudley's toys were more important than Harry. I think if they had had a third room, it could have been Harry's.

Now all of that points to Dumbledore being aware of things. Yet, nothing extremely bad he could do much about. It might be possible he would have taken more serious actions if he had found out he was being physically abused by Vernon, but we might never know.

What we can blame on Dumbledore is he leaving him there in the first place, instead of some other place. But then again:

- Who? Remus and Sirius were out of the game. Dumbledore had no time to raise a baby. Giving him to a family like Weasleys is what some people claim, but who? How does he choose? Would other families accept that Dumbledore chooses a family arbitrarily? Would the Ministry? On what authority does Dumbledore give a kid who is not related to him to a family the kid is not related to either?

- The Ministry would have intervened. If Dumbledore tries to put Harry with a family they are not related to him, the Ministry would have stepped forward as a more formal authority to the man who used to be the kid's parents headmaster. And once in the Ministry court, Dumbledore would be unable to stop FUdge from giving Harry to a family like the Malfoys.

- How does Dumbledore ensure the safety if Harry ends with another family? Suppose it is not an evil twisted family like the Malfoys, suppose is a regular family, like the Bones. First, Dumbledore would have to do and tell them, "You have put your family in mortal danger by accepting this boy, you have to let me put strong wards around your house"... how would that go? Wouldn't that make the family unconsciously blame Harry for the security of their other children?

- Lily's wards are specified clearly as the strongest. Maybe wards he puts on other houses can keep away Death Eaters, but not Voldemort. Lily's wards could.

- How does he keep a check on Harry? A wizarding family is not going to be fooled by a Mrs. Figg.

- The "let Harry leave away from all of this" is a valid point, keeping in the dark about his fame. Though not the sole reason to decide, it is a valid point.

Overall, I think Dumbledore could have done better, but so much worse also. His priority was the boy's survival, keeping him away from the Malfoys and safe. And honestly, he didn't have many options. Could he have tried to improve things to Harry? Yeah, but not by much. There are some things over which he has no power (like deciding chores in a house). The thing is that some fanfic writers turn Harry's neglect and emotional abuse, into a full blown slavery and think anything short of Harry growing up loved, with tons of money and enjoying fame is a crime. Some writers do not conform with Harry having a regular childhood, but they just want him to be as spoiled as Dudley.

#+begin_quote
  Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
#+end_quote

Dude. What was he going to do? Lie to the Wizengamot? Everything pointed to Sirius, and not once did Sirius said: "I didn't do it"... As far as Dumbledore knows, Sirius was the secret keeper. And probably Dumbledore was mad at himself for not discovering Sirius treachery in time. There were witnesses of Sirius cornering Peter and killing a bunch of people. And Sirius didn't deny it. Sorry, but this is on Sirius. Saying anything aside from laughing during the whole process would have ticked Dumbledore or anybody else into looking into it or demand a trial or whatever.

​

#+begin_quote
  Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
#+end_quote

Snape is an asshole and Dumbledore should have put him in his place. He was not impartial, which should have been enough for Dumbledore to act, I'll give you that. He especially knew Snape demanded more from Harry than the rest, which is a red flag. Though no indication that Dumbledore knew of specific incidents such as making fun of Hermione's teeth.

Lockhart was not his fault. He was running out of options, it is stated. No one wanted to teach a cursed position. He didn't want Lockhart there.

Lupin is actually a good teacher and one who he was glad to receive. But again, there were not many other candidates to contest the position.

Hagrid was knowledgeable in magical creatures, even if not the best. He was definitely not more dangerous than his predecessor.

Trelawney, he did so to keep her safe.

Binns was boring, should he fire him for that? We have no indication that his class was inaccurate.

Filch was doing his job, and we have no indication he was actually performing the punishments he wanted to and Dumbledore finding about it.

​

#+begin_quote
  Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
#+end_quote

With Snape it is his fault, as stated above. Though Dumbledore shouldn't be going about the hallways punishing students, that's his staff task to do. Umbridge is out of his hands, he was overruled.

​

#+begin_quote
  Keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts knowing a Dark Lord was after it and thus risking the lives of all students.
#+end_quote

​

That is on him. Though we have also to recognize that Hogwarts is no regular school. It's a castle with ancestral dungeons and shit, and badass protections. There was no indication people might actually be fool enough to try to steal it. Especially in year one when Hogwarts has gone practically unmolested for a long time.

​

#+begin_quote
  Suspecting Quirrel but not confronting him even after there's an attempt on Harry's life during the Quidditch match.
#+end_quote

​

He should have found a way to solve it, though he did try, weak attempts as they were. Snape was tracking Quirrell after the match and even confronted him on Dumbledore's orders. Maybe what stopped Dumbledore from being more energic was that Quirrell would deny accusations on the Ministry or Dumbledore wanted more intel. Whatever the reason, Dumbledore made sure to spy on Quirrell and not let anything happen to Harry on the next game.

​

#+begin_quote
  Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
#+end_quote

This is very vague and conjectural. I don't think Dumbledore wanted Harry to confront Quirrell, much less on 1-1. No indication on the text for that.

​

#+begin_quote
  Not doing anything about the Chamber of Secrets even after five decades, though he knew Voldemort was the culprit. Twelve year olds solved the problem.
#+end_quote

Cold case man. Maybe he did look for the chamber but he didn't find it, Dumbledore was no parseltongue. And without evidence, he couldn't really clear Hagrid.

​

#+begin_quote
  Leaving the petrified Muggleborns in the hospital wing for months rather than buying the restorative draught. Not evacuating Hogwarts even though the attacks killed a student last time. (Why was the Ministry not involved except to arrest Hagrid?)
#+end_quote

Yeah, book 2 was kind of a mess. EVeryone acting stupid just for the sake of the plot.

​

#+begin_quote
  Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
#+end_quote

We don't know how close was Dumbledore to the place, or when he found about it. He can't apparate in Hogwarts, no matter what the movies say, and he is too old to run at the same speed as Fawkes. I think this is not a case of not wanting to go, but more of sending help while he manages to get there.

​

#+begin_quote
  Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
#+end_quote

First is another case of making the wizarding world weird in its rules for the sake in the plot. Not accompanying them was important, for outside of the room he meets Snape and Fudge. What if Dumbledore disappears and at that very moment FUdge reenters the room? Better to have someone distract suspicions of the minister.

​

#+begin_quote
  Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
#+end_quote

​

Okay, so the election is not a valid complaint as he as evil. It can be argued that he didn't see that coming. For all, we know Barty Crouch did unexpected dark magic there to trick the goblet. Now is reaction is interesting. Harry has to compete and give some effort, that much is clear. Dumbledore couldn't really help him win, for that wouldn't be fair, but helping him keeping him alive was fair game. We don't know if crouch jr as Moody told him that he was keeping an eye on the boy.

​

#+begin_quote
  Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
#+end_quote

​

He accepts this a mistake and gives his reasons. You can decide if you don't accept them. But he is not evil or manipulative on this part.

​

#+begin_quote
  Then, telling him half the truth when Harry was emotionally vulnerable after Sirius' death. Emotionally manipulating him throughout the conversation.
#+end_quote

Manipulating him exactly how? What did Dumbledore achieve with his tone here? And half the truth is an exaggeration. He told him everything but the "I think you have to die" part... which is important but not really the time to talk about.

​

#+begin_quote
  Isolating Harry in an abusive, neglectful household and forcing his friends to cut meaningful communication, even after he's witnessed a student's death and the resurrection of his parents' murderer, even though there were viable and safe means of communication available like the bodyguards following him secretly.
#+end_quote

Already talked about the Dursleys. We know why he did the communication blcoking. The horcrux in his head and Voldemort spying through Harry.

​

#+begin_quote
  Having bodyguards follow Harry /secretly/. Trusting Mundungus for the position.
#+end_quote

Mundungus was loyal to the cause, though shady. And surely you can't have a skilled man like Kingsley in guard duty, not doing anything for a whole day. Even if you have talented people there, some have to rest. It is a decent job to watch and report for Mundungus.

The secret part wouldn't have changed much but made Harry angrier. "You're watching me? Why? What's happening!? Tell me now!"

And honestly, Harry feels a bit entitled in many parts. The BWL thing kind of gets to him. "I'm the one who saw him return!" Yeah, he did, and he is an important part, but the dude is demanding info other people's info even before turning 15. Classified and dangerous info. Info that none of his other friends who are stuck in the situation with him have. He saw him return yeah... but are victims of crimes in place to demand info on FBI investigations? Harry was not part of the Order, he was a witness, he was not supposed to be hunting for Voldemort. The Order was.

​

#+begin_quote
  Allowing Malfoy, a wannabe murderer and terrorist, free access to the school knowing that he's been tasked to kill him, even after two students are nearly killed. Admonishing Harry when confronted about this and then blatantly lying that he gives a shit about the students.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is a Greater Good wacko yeah. I cannot add much more to the motives he explains in canon. Dude should have been more careful if he really wanted to track Malfoy. He was looking after Draco's life we know, but at some point, he must had realized that he was putting Draco's life above every other student. (Although, at that point it was not only Draco's life anymore but Snape's as well)

​

#+begin_quote
  Leaving the hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes to three teenagers rather than a few trustworthy and qualified adults. Not telling Harry /how/ to destroy horcruxes straightaway.
#+end_quote

Destroy them was a task for aurors yeah. Though, it can be argued that what Dumbledore saw in Harry was not him being more capable of destroying them, but being more capable of finding them. Also, add keeping info away from aurors and reliance in prophecy. You can understand why he did it, even if misguided.

Not telling about how to destroy them is a big one. Though, maybe he was just a procrastinator and was planning on having a big conversation with Harry about it. It is perfectly plausible that Dumbledore didn't want to "tell" Harry how to destroy Horcruxes, but wanted to "show" him. It is very likely that Dumbledore wanted to destroy the locket in Harry's presence, maybe even have Harry do it. Tell him some other stuff. He didn't plan to die that night before it.

​

#+begin_quote
  Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)
#+end_quote

Trust does not make him evil or manipulative. And maybe he had other reasons as well. Maybe Snape did unbreakable vows with Dumbledore as well. Dumbledore interactions with Snape are so secret to us that we can't really assure anything for one side or the other.

​

#+begin_quote
  Scheming Harry's forced suicide-by-Voldemort with Snape, leaving Harry with no *practical* choice but to walk to his death because he was informed at the last possible moment that he was a horcrux. (Why? Because his answer is the only possible answer and that no one else could've found another way?)
#+end_quote

Yes, that's the only in-universe answer. Dumbledore looked but didn't found another way. He had certain doubt that Harry could survive it either way, though he wasn't sure. He wanted Harry to be informed at the last to ensure everything fell in place. That is canon.

This is his biggest manipulation, you could say. But it is not an evil one, it is a heartless grey choice. He does it to save people, even if it is a very morally questionable act (see Stannis Baratheon, books, not TV). Fandom Dumbledore manipulates people for everything though, even manipulates people into choosing vanilla cupcakes so he can get the chocolate one for himself.

  There is no canon evidence for physical abuse
#+end_quote

Ah yes, watching your sister set a dog on the child in your custody is just good manners. There is a bit in canon where Vernon hits Dudley and Harry does not find it remarkable, implying that at least the occasional punch happened. And the "diets" Harry gets in CoS and GoF are way below what you got in the bombed out ruins of postwar Germany. Also, the bit where Petunia swings a frying pan after Harry's head, well that can quite easily be called attempted manslaughter because good luck convincing her majesty's judges that your nephew is magically resistant to blunt-force trauma.

It is not "Harry gets beaten black and blue every day, but physical abuse is canonical.

***** More or less the same as he ignored my 20 or so points in the article and just focused on "There is no canon evidence for physical abuse"

So some points:

- Where does it say that Vernon or Petunia watched the dog doing this? Marge could have been easily left in care of the kids while Vernon and Petunia were away. So no chance of "Don't bother with the boy Marge, leave him alone"

- We don't know how hard she swung that pan, it could have been more a slow swing to put him away than an attempt at manslaughter.

- For a kid even missing a meal is a big deal... and he is an unreliable narrator to some extend. When Harry says "periods of near-starvation"... it could have been exaggerated. It surely was more than going to bed without dinner one night (which many have experienced in childhood) but I don't see the Dursleys actually trying to starve him. He is scrawny, though fanfic writers like to forget that his father was too to some degree, might as well be hereditary. No mention of denutrition symptoms in the book, always had pretty of energy to run away from Dudley for example. Which points more to the food removal being a temporary punishment than something the Dursleys did on a regular basis.

And the fact that Vernon hit Dudley then it adds more to it being Vernon's style of discipline than a tendency to hit Harry without reason. I would say Vernon is closer to a hard discipline guy overdoing it, than the maniac hitting Harry with tubes and logs for no reason at all that appears in some fics.

The fact that the cupboard was designed as storage does not make it a dungeon just by having the label "cupboard".

Harry was not in chains. Harry could go in and out of the cupboard on a regular basis. Harry was not a slave, he was not in chains. Harry had a roof and a bed and blankets. He had privacy as well. A place he could call his own. There is absolutely nothing illegal.

The wrong part is obviously that there was another room in the house. But it is not illegal to provide a smaller room even if they had another available. The Dursleys just have to provide something adequate, which they did.

The outrage of the fandom at the cupboard is more symbolic. Because "how can poor Harry can live in a cupboard when he is rich and should live in a massive room with all of the luxuries available?"

It's about 8 foot long with 2 feet not being usuable due to the height of the stairs at that section. They are also less than 3 foot wide. If we housed prisoners in spaces like that we would be charged with cruel and unusual punishment. And you actually think that it is an appropriate place for a child? A storage space is not a room.

Here i have an idea. Especially if you have kids. Why don't you put your child in a cupboard under the stairs and then have social services come out to check on your new room for your child. I'm sure you would be in lockup in about 15 minutes.

******** Correct I assuming the dimensions (though based on the movie scenes when the cupboard door and stairs are shown I'm most likely being generous). 2. The width is based on the width of standard stairs. Which means the inside dimensions of the space is smaller. My first question though is why you insist on calling a storage space a room it is not.

Two. What conditioned? There is nothing to suggest that anything was done to improve the cupboard. And I would be surprised if a small single mattress would fit in there though a bed with frame wouldn't due to the restricted height.

Your basement and garage counters are nonsensical as they are actually full size spaces that can be improved eg a large garage in the uk is 10 x 20 feet. A small is still roughly 8 x 16. Those spaces at a minimum are at least 5 times larger than a space under the stairs.

You obviously have never dealt with social services. Vernon would be charged with neglect/abuse. The fact that he has a child living under the stairs when he has two spare rooms (one of which is his son's second bedroom for all his broken toys). The fact that the child doesn't have a single item of clothing that fits him. The fact that not a single photo of him exists in the house which show they don't consider him part of the family. Then after talking with both boys the fact that Harry has all those chores while Dudley has virtually none and the fact that he gets scraps from the table and food is often withheld from him as punishment. That he has never received a single gift while Dudley receives dozens and the fact that he is often forced to stay in the cupboard. The fact that he hasn't had his eyes checked nor seen a doctor regularly (implied in the story) whereas there is tons of evidence that Dudley has.

Adding all those things together with the fact that the Dursleys are not poor would see Vernon and Petunia charged and locked up for a very long time.

"He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."

"The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of tinned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray."

"He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup."

"‘You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?' roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised."

"To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's."

"The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks,"

"Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat."

"Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling."

"Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible."

"Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."

Nope. No evidence for physical abuse there at all.

#+begin_quote
  The cupboard. Yeah, it makes Harry feel so much less than Dudley. But then again, it was a space to live, he had his bed and his things. Lots of people live in worse conditions. He used hand-down clothes, so do many people. Harry is not living in the backyard. The Dursleys could easily justify this with "there was no space left in the house". And I don't think the Dursleys did this to punish Harry for anything, I do think they have Dudley so spoiled that they just thought Dudley's toys were more important than Harry. I think if they had had a third room, it could have been Harry's.
#+end_quote

Generally when people live in worse conditions their entire family lives in those worse conditions as well because of systemic poverty. When one child and only one child is singled out to live in worse conditions, we call that abuse.

Even if they were living in only a two bedroom house, you cannot justify 'there was no space left in the house' because children sharing a bedroom is not uncommon.

More importantly. They bloody did have room. In fact, they had /four/ of them.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.

*** Okay, so let's go over this. Which is bad, but is obviously inflated by the text and by having a boy as an unreliable narrator here:

#+begin_quote
  "‘OUT!' roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall,"
#+end_quote

He took them out of a room forcibly. Harry and Dudley in an equal way. Neither complains afterwards as if was a particularly serious bruising or anything. Pretty much the equivalent of dragging someone out of a room pulling from an arm. This after telling them, as Guardian, that they should leave and they ignoring him.

#+begin_quote
  "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall."
#+end_quote

Against dragged forcibly out of a section of Vernon's own house where he doesn't want Harry at the moment. Notice throw into hall, as in just out of the room, not as in slammed against the walls.

#+begin_quote
  "As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan."
#+end_quote

SO Harry, our unreliable narrator is telling us what Petunia feels and sees. How is he certain that from Petunia's point of view the woman is sure Dudley is unharmed or that he wasn't put at risk. Harry is supposing here. This is clearly a hot-headed reaction and not planned action to do harm to Harry out of nowhere. He didn't actually hit him as well, for all we know it could have been a slow swing more intended in scaring the boy away and Harry feels it differently. There is no indication that says Harry has actually been hit a pan before.

#+begin_quote
  "While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re-painted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck."
#+end_quote

These are chores. As I pointed, Dumbledore doesn't really have power over which chores Harry is assigned. It is bad because Dudley is not doing anything, but this is hard is abuse. But abuse is not defined in base of what others get or not get to do. I could do all these things as a kid on a weekend but because there was no Dudley they really didn't look bad. The burns could be just the usual stuff from working outside, no further complains other days that his neck ached or anything. This is just working. And if those were really unbearable burns... we don't see Harry telling anyone he is hurting.

#+begin_quote
  "And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs."
#+end_quote

Laughing as a maniac is no crime. Against dragging forcibly. Which is hardly abuse if it's not followed by "he beat me up when we arrived upstairs".

#+begin_quote
  "He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."
#+end_quote

He was grounded. Unjustified or whatever, but they didn't do this on a daily basis, Harry was free of going out of his cupboard regularly. Even out of the house for he was familiar with Dudley's friends. Still he got food. Small if you like it, but three times a day, which points at the Dursleys not wanting to starve him.

#+begin_quote
  "He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup."
#+end_quote

This is an expression. Obviously the food did go in his system. Many children are sent to their rooms without dinner after a punishment, or get blocked from bread and desserts on following meals. The Dursleys are more intense and horrible persons, but they are still feeding Harry.

#+begin_quote
  "‘You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?' roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised."
#+end_quote

No evidence of physical violence. This kind of stuff is said by people who don't actually hit people all the time. This is a threat. More an emotional abuse than physical.

#+begin_quote
  "To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's."
#+end_quote

Yes the Durlseys are not impartial and have a clear favorite. They are willing to do the "all the same" for Dudley but not for Harry. Still this is hardly an abuse as well. They are all in diet. They are guardians, they get to decide what's to eat each day. They are not even being mean to Harry in particular here, Vernon and Petunia also share the diet. It could be that it's just Harry's perspective that makes him think his slice is smaller, but it could be that they are the same. Even if his is smaller, it could just be that he just got the smaller fruit by sheer luck. In a way, Harry could be predisposed to only notice the things that are worse for him and not the rest, maybe he got a larger apple the next day, but he doesn't mention that. And, at the end of the day. How much difference in size can there really be between a quarter of 2 regular grapefruits?

#+begin_quote
  "The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks,"
#+end_quote

Again it's an expression that you chose to quote partially. This is part of the family diet, no punishment on Harry. And Harry is exaggerating, they just had a grapefruit it's obviously not only carrots what he is going to be eating. It's just a diet based on fruits on vegetables. Which a vegetarian wouldn't see bad at all. ANd either way Harry is quick to get sweets from his friends. Which he doesn't share with Dudley btw, so Harry is vengeful about the favoritism he has experienced.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat."
#+end_quote

Text makes it seem as he is strangling him, which he is not. Vernon is holding him from the neck, only that from the other side after he sees Harry pulling his wand (which he knows is dangerous) for what seems like no reason at all. Harry gets dialogues after this before released, which points to Vernon not putting strength enough to cut air, which he could totally could do if he wanted at this point. SO Vernon's intention is not harm, it is to stop Harry from doing whatever he is planning to do next. Which he does have reason to suspect, remember by this point Dudley's tongue has been enlarged and Harry has made Marge a living balloon.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling."
#+end_quote

Again, expression. He did not strangle him, he held him. It is just an expression of distance, as Harry didn't want to be held again.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible."
#+end_quote

This could mean that he doesn't want to be dragged or held, as I said there was no strangling before.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."
#+end_quote

This could pretty much be an exaggeration over the diet. No direct abuse against Harry in putting the family in diet.

So, in summary. I concede some level of physicality here, but more on the lines of a harsh discipline Vernon who is misguided and overreacts than a real attempt at causing physical harm to Harry just for harm's sake or they hate him or anything. Again don't disagree that they are horrible people, but there is no indication of these things being reported to Dumbledore as nothing more than:

"Harry hasn't gone out of the house in days, it seems that he is grounded." "The whole family is in diet now" "Dursley has rude manners, he boasts of being a heavy disciplined. Though, I haven't seen bruises on the boy."

#+begin_quote
  Generally when people live in worse conditions their entire family lives in those worse conditions as well because of systemic poverty. When one child and only one child is singled out to live in worse conditions, we call that abuse.
#+end_quote

You can call that emotional abuse if you want because of Dudley, which I already covered. But the cupboard does not represent bad living conditions at all. And it is not illegal. He is not sleeping on the floor in a corner. Are there any laws saying people can't live in rooms not conceived as rooms by the contractor? Because if so many people living in conditioned garages and basements are breaking the law.

#+begin_quote
  ‘No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully. ‘He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know.

#+end_quote

Wanting to know about the mirror, and wanting to learn of the stone does not mean that Dumbledore wanted Harry to face Quirrell face to face. First, these are all Harry's suppositions, not Dumbledore's statements. And we do know that Dumbledore was tricked out of the school the day Quirrell tried to take the stone and hurried at once. Hurried into the trap door and got to Harry just as he defeated Quirrell. So it would point more to Dumbledore wanting Harry to learn in a controlled environment (which fits his mo).

**** There actually is a law in Virginia about bedrooms for children having "adequate square footage" among other requirements. Additionally, I believe there is a law about bedrooms being required to have a functioning window/exit in case of fire and a closet of a specified dimension. I shared a room with my sisters even though we had a basement because it had no opening windows which made it a fire hazard. Incidentally, the house actually burned down later on (luckily no one was in the basement at the time). I can't say I know what the UK laws in the 90s looked like though.

As far as everything else, I agree that Dumbledore wasn't evil and was probably not even as manipulative as he comes across. I dislike how you downplayed the abuse, emotional abuse can actually be more insidious than physical abuse and while Harry might be an unreliable narrator he's the only one we've got. However, I don't think it was some grand evil scheme by Dumbledore either. I think what bothers me about him in canon is how willing other characters are to ignore his flaws and how he doesn't seem to listen to the good opinion of others. Like McGonagall not liking the Dursleys perhaps should have led to him checking in on Harry. Hermione states several times that they should trust the staff because Dumbledore hired them even though he has a habit of hiring incompetent or dangerous individuals. Maybe that was simply because he was scraping the bottom of the barrel, but the point still stands about other characters reactions to it.

For me the villanization of Dumbledore is actually more of the same, we assume everything that happened was due to some grand plan. In reality, I think Dumbledore's greatest flaw is his hubris, his belief that he alone can be trusted with the truth and he alone can make the right decisions. His influence barely wanes even with his own death.

Not trying to start any arguments, just wanted to leave my two cents.

Again, tell that to Crouch or Bagman. Dumbledore was not responsible for the tournament, the fact that it was carried on as it was is not an example of Dumbledore being evil. For all we know Dumbledore could have argued for something like that but Bagman wanted to enforce Harry there.

> Except that they are neither monitoring his mail at this point nor the Royal Mail. They would not know about it.

How do you know? And more importantly how is Dumbledore sure of it? Harry is just mounting drama honestly. He can't wait a few weeks to ask personally? Ron and Hermione did tell him that they would tell him everything when they saw him.

What was Harry going to do with info on Voldemort's movements either way? Go after him? That info is for Order members. People complain that Dumbledore gave the Horcrux mission to Harry instead of to some aurors, yet they still want Harry to be informed of the Order secret movements as if he was really doing something useful at the moment.
