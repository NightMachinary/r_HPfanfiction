:END:
I read this fic a while ago. I think it was supposed to pair Harry with Daphne (though ive no idea how)

Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the Hogwarts express i think starting their 5th? year, and got into a fight? with Daphne. I believe she was looking for Harry and found him with his friends, but she insulted them and things escalated. She beat all 3 of them on her own, took their wands but snapped Hermione's (with her boots) saying that in her eyes Hermione doesn't belong in Hogwarts. Her character was extremely cold and a blood supremacist and only spared Harrys wand because he too belonged to the sacred 28.

Anyone read this? It was just a few chapters, and im hoping its been updated since.


** Wow that sounds drastic... wouldn't she technically get some kind of punishment

Edit: imagine her family having to pay for Hermiones wand ðŸ¤£

  One change has long-reaching effects. Mad-Eye Moody foils the kidnap attempt against him the night before starting as the Defense professor. How will Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry change as a result? And what do life debts have to do with all this? Eventual H/G/DG

**** Eight months since the last update isn't quite enough to kill any hope I have of it updating, but it's definitely getting there. But I wouldn't be surprised if the author couldn't figure out how to make a Harry/Daphne romance make any sense after that start, so they gave up on the story.
