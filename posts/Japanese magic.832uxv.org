** I was thinking about this on the way home. Japan has a lot of potential!

Wand cores can be from things like a Kitsune or Tanuki. Instead of Boggarts, they can have Bakemonos and Bakenekos instead of Kneazles.

Earthquakes are very common--maybe Japanese wizards have figured out how to harness the power of them? Bottle it and save it for later? Same thing with hot springs--maybe some of them have magical properties?

Cherry blossoms are big in Japanese culture. Maybe they have special potions that use them and they're very rare and expensive because the blossom season is so short or they need to be gathered under special conditions? Moonless night, full moon, windless night ...

Mt Fuji can be a whole other thing. Special spells or potions worked with soil from the sacred mountain. A dangerous journey to gather snow from the very peak to use as water in a potion.

So many different things you can do with Japan!

***** If a story were to worlbuild about Runes as a knowing departure from canon, fine. But you suggested Kanji as a "replacement" for magical runes, as if it were perfectly normal that there be magical runes in the first place.

****** My point was that it's common in Japanese fantasy to use these seal tags to do whatever magic is present in the fiction. IRL, Runes were sometimes supposed to allow one to do magic. That's really all it is, just a way for some distinctly Japanese magic with an element from fanon, not because I think Runes in canon are magic.

** Gems

European wizards use body parts from magical creatures as a core which are encased in wood.

Japanese wizards use magic infused crystals created through various rituals at different parts of the year. They are carved into 7 gemstones and embedded into their bodies. These gems focus their magic and act as the [[http://www.chakras.info/7-chakras/][chakras of the body]]. A Japanese wizard is considered ready for schooling once they have successfully crafted their seven chakras which an adult wizard then implants into them.

**** I would say that the Japanese ministry doesn't bother with muggleborns. They have a "you come to us" attitude. However there is a tradition within the old families of profiting off of them.

The old families have ways of detecting muggleborns. They'll approach a muggleborns family, provide the proof, and lay out a business offer. Rich muggle families will generally just pay a lot of money and their kid will receive training to know the rituals and craft their chakras before entering one of the public academies. A poor muggleborn will usually sign an exclusive work contract for the sponsoring family and generally takes about 30 years to pay off their debt once their schooling is over.

It is voluntary, the family isn't forced into it. However it is almost never passed up since this is a very good way to elevate a poor muggle family.

***** Sucks to be a muggleborn, then. But good to see that you're not making Japan a better country for muggleborns than Britain - too many stories make out Britain as this cesspit, while everyone else is so far more tolerant and advanced.

**** Well, to flesh this out a bit more...

I would say that each ritual produces the same gem for everyone. However each ritual can only be used once per year and poor quality starting materials, like glass or crystallized sugar, means that you need multiple years to craft that chakra. This in turn means that rich kids start learning magic earlier and it would be common for poor people to be 16 or even older before they have their chakras.

Chakras can only channel the magic of the person who made them. There are exceptions to this, usually twins, but generally speaking you can't use someone elses chakras. However you can hire professionals to cut chakras into usable gems once they have been created by a ritual. Another advantage rich people have over the poor.

The gems need to be cut after a ritual produces them. The cut of a gem determines its affinity, the kind of magic that it does best. Since wizards have 7 chakras they choose 7 affinities. Affinities can stack. Most people have three or four affinities and double or triple up on some.

If you choose the same affinity for all 7 you're a purist. Purists are both handicapped and without equal. They can only use spells that are aligned to their affinity but their magic costs nothing for them. They can channel their entire power 24/7 with no ill effects and some spells can only be used by purists. It's generally considered not worth it to most folks because they don't like being cut off from the other fields of magic.

The longer you use a particular chakra the attuned it becomes. A chakra with 11 years of use reaches maximum attunement and is roughly three times as powerful as an unattuned chakra.

Chakras can be changed out once per year on Halloween.

Rarely a Chakra can attune itself to a family line rather than an individual. These are generally kept within a family indefinitely. There are also some families that can produce chakras other than the publicly known 7 but they do not reveal their hidden knowledge.

** It shouldn't be /too/ different, but I imagine they use different spells --- spells developped with similar phonetics as the Japanse language, rather than the English, Latin and Hebraic incantations European Wizardkind favors. Note that this is only for everyday spell: as the spells become more complex, it becomes harder and harder to create an equivalent with a different incantation, so for instance, the Japanse would probably have their own /Wingardium Leviosa/ but not /Expecto Patronum/.
