This was inspired by the glasses post. I know many people get annoyed when characters in fanfiction do things the "muggle way", but what are some things that you think there isn't a spell for? Like fixing eyesight, for example.

Obviously things like creating food and bringing people back to life are mentioned in the books, but what are your personal headcanons for the limits of magic when completing everyday tasks?

** Muggles lead in:

Communication: especially instant text, video, and voice

Computation: wizards need to adopt computers for their arithmancy

Distribution: provide products and services to millions, if not billions of individuals fast and reliably; wizards don't have an Internet to spread their information quickly.

Manufacturing processes: where are the temperature and environmental controls for their potion production?

Mass Production: Gemino curse is cool, but try casting it 100 million times (number of iPhones sold in a quarter)

Organization: ruling ten thousand people is hard, but how about ruling a billion? Or what about running a business with 4 million employees, or command a military of 10 million soldiers?

Space technologies: I don't know what wizards teach in astronomy, but it seems they didn't go beyond 19th century muggle astronomy, which is to say hopelessly outdated.

The rate of muggle tech advance is rapid, how about wizards? Thousands years old stuffs (Hallows) were still cool, but you want to compete with 100 years old Muggle stuffs? Tough luck.

At current pace, how would Muggle world look like in 20 years, or 50 years?

--------------

Finally, let's take a look at differences in their mindsets:

Magical world, at least the pureblood segment, was zealous about keeping tradition and maintaining their own way of life. Because of magic, there was no real material scarcity. Healthcare was relatively cheap and painless. Personal comfort level was high. They saw their society as perfect and superior to Muggles, and they relished their self-imposed segregation. Even Muggle friends like Arthur Weasley viewed Muggle world only as some kind of curiosity. So to speak, there was a strong sense of complacency among Magicals.

Muggle world, ever since the Industrial Revolution, has been bent on progress. Traditions are discarded in favor of 'change', efficiency, and productivity. Tech visionaries such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Jobs are being worshipped, while reactionaries like Donald Trump are being spit upon. Just take a look at [[/r/Futurology]] and you will have some idea of the crazy stuffs that are being worked on. Muggle world is constantly facing material scarcity, resource shortages, and threats from all kinds of disasters. As a result, Muggles are in a persistent crisis mode.

Which society is more likely to advance faster (gain power faster) in the future?

*** This is a long reply but I can't let this post go unanswered. You are painting a muggle-biased view. You are also comparing modern society to a book whose setting is 20 years ago. Basically, your entire argument is largely invalid. Point by point responses:

In 1998, most muggles did not have quick or easy access to text or video. AOL and other ISPs were in their prime, but 56k modems were still the order of the day. Additionally, a phone was wired to the wall for the majority of the world. The floo network is equal to or superior to a landline phone - you can see the person you're talking to.

Computers in 1998 had trouble with nonstandard mathematics. We also know zero about arithmancy in canon, aside from it being a method of predicting the future through numbers. Computer modeling was woefully inefficient in 1998.

Distribution: wizards can apparate (teleport) or portkey anywhere on earth in seconds. Wizards win.

Manufacturing: We only see Snape and Slughorn's potion making. What is to say that all potion makers do it that way? Also, is every high school set up with a medical grade chemistry lab? Middle school? Hogwarts teaches the basics. There is no evidence for or against higher education.

Why would wizards need 100 million anything if there are, by your assertion, only a few thousand of them? Furthermore, Fred and George are able to manufacture enough products in a couple months to keep their store afloat and maintain stock.

Organization: again, why would they need to? Why develop laws to rule 10 million people if there are only 100,000 to be ruled?

Space technology: muggles do win here, but there is a caveat. What you don't account for is why astrology and astronomy may be important to magic. Furthermore, what have we done with all our technology? We take pictures of places no one alive will ever visit. Whee.

The hallows were mythical objects that people had been searching for for centuries. Are you seriously saying no muggle treasures or searches for old things? We don't have museums? We didn't have people searching for the Holy Grail? We don't venerate the Mona Lisa or the Sistene Chapel? We also have ancient technologies or developments we still try to understand such as Greek fire and Damascus steel.

We see no real development in the magical world because we see a novel written from the PoV of a preteen-teenager. If Rowling writes a real sequel (cursed child is bad fanfic) then you can compare modern tech to modern wizardry.

Mindsets: most of what you have cited is fanon, not canon. You're also strongly projecting here. We do not know how average wizards live. We see all of seven wizarding households in the seven books - Malfoy Manor, the Burrow, Shell Cottage, Bagshot's house, the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow, Grimmauld Place, and the Rookery. You MIGHT be able to consider Figg's house too, but she is a squib. Only Grimmauld and the Burrow are present in multiple books in the series. How does Flint live? What about Anthony Goldstein? Katie Bell? Morag MacDougal? We. Know. Nothing. about any characters' lives except Malfoy, Sirius, Harry, and the Weasleys, and eventually a bit about Snape. We don't even have a canon name for Hermione's parents ffs.

Who is more likely to not worry about gaining power - someone with already nearly absolute power (wizards) or someone constantly trying to one-up everyone?

**** I agree with you, mostly, except for that little point about space travel. It was a bit illogical.

Maybe I'm misreading, but I'm not sure how "astrology and astronomy may be important to magic" related to your point? That sentence felt out of place. I think you were trying to say that wizards definitely had astronomical knowledge (due to its importance in magic), comparably with Muggles, but they haven't either utilized it, or advanced magic enough to catch up with Muggles when it comes to actual travel or satellites/imaging.

That last little point about "take pictures of places no one alive will ever visit. Whee", I thought was inaccurate. It felt like a last ditched attempt to mock space advancement with a "Well, muggle are better, but wizards are still better because what muggles are doing are pointless".

*** In the seventies in the HP world existed instantaneous telecommunication devices. As in, those mirrors James and Sirius would communicate with. That's way better than anything we have, 40 years later. Hell, with the DA galleons Hermione basically invented magical pagers (assuming those didn't already exist).

You can cast the Duplicating charm 24 times and get 16777216 identical copies of something (2^{24).} Beats out Muggle manufacturing easily.

That's just all I feel like pointing out from your post.

You're also just making a bunch of... bad comparisons. Basically everything [[/u/Sturmundsterne]] said is true.

***** It can double or multiply constantly if the caster is interrupted, so it sounds as if there's enough wiggle room to tailor the spell that way.

That being said, copies are said to deteriorate faster over time, so the value of such objects would be called into question if planned obsolescence was illegal in the Wizarding World... probably not, though.

EDIT: Surely the Lestrange Vault is a case in point?

***** Duplicating charm and Gemino Curse are probably two different things, /and we don't know if they can only be cast on one thing at a time/. Of course, since the copied thing is /exactly/ the same thing as the original, to all intents and purposes (maybe even some intensive purposes) they are the same thing, and you could be able two. Mental tricks.

***** I try not to think about what Pettigrew does by himself, but assuming the hand responds to external factors there's no reason it has to be cold. He could have a thing for the sensation of metal, and if he's got a danger kink then the over-strengthened issue would be a benefit. Plus, who knows, maybe magic mercury has a certain tingle to it.

All I'm saying is you never what he might be into.

Also, wizards are humans and humans can be fucking weird and highly ingenious. There's no way no witch or wizard has ever used their wand as a dildo. God only knows what it would feel like if you cast a spell at the same time. Chances are there are buyable magical dildos as well, with various features. Sex shop in Knockturn Alley, anyone?
