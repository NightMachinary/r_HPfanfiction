** [[/https://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Forever_Yours_and_Yours/index/][This story]] by the infamous Kinsfire has Harry in a three-way relationship with Hermione and her mother. While it has a plot, it's a pretty crap story though--like most of what Kinsfire wrote. (Case in point: Harry's seed is apparently so deliciously potent, a coupling with said mother is sufficient to turn her into a witch.)

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6644695/1/Harry-Potter-The-New-Life]])

I remember reading this one quite a while back. It is abandoned of course, and quite old. I do not remember if it is well written or if it even has a decent plot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9762328/1/Throwing-Out-the-Script]])

Absolutely no clue about this one. Might be interesting.

If I remember more, I will come back and make an edit.

Unfortunately, finding an actual decent, well written plot is going to be hard. Hopefully someone comes along and recommends something you really like :D

*** About Throwing Out the Script; it was abandoned so early there's not even any real inkling of pairings, so OP will not find what he is looking for. For what it's worth, those 30k words are pretty great. Really wish someone capable would pick it up, not even to complete it, just to push it a little further.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

** linkffn(For Love of Magic) has Harry get with Fleur and much of her extended family IIRC. linkffn(The Price of Being Noble) is Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Gabrielle I think. Outside of that I think you're mostly looking at plotless smut.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** linkffn(The Rise of Overlord Vulcan) - Hermione's OC sister, her mother, Gabrielle and Appoline, Luna and Ginny, and his own imaginary sister/mother/anyone he wants. The plot is actually good tho, sadly its either in a massive hiatus or abandoned. if there isn't smut on ffn, you can look for this fic on ao3 which definately has smut, and quite good one, one of the best i've read.
