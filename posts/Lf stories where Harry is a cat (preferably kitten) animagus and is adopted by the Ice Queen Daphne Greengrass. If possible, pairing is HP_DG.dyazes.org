*** Or any other person. I just really like what Harry would do when he became a cat. Ever read the Thief of Hogwarts? Now that's the kind of stories I'm looking for.

**** Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has cat Animagus Harry, who ends up with Hermione's family. No romantic relationship between the two, they're practically brother and sister. Sequel is updated up to fifth year so far, with good international worldbuilding.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Hermione as the cat Animagus literal catburglar and thief. Harry is the auror investigating the case, unaware that he's dating his target. Very good action scenes, if you like heist movies you'll love it. Hermione's psychology is a little messed up though, her experiment to modify it had some side effects.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle]]) Not Daphne, but Ginny. Very hilarious but I don't think there is a pairing.
