** This fic is unironically every bad Slytherin Harry trope and no one seems to care, it's mad to me how popular it is.

*** If borderline crack fics like Harry Crow can be as popular as they are then PoS is not that ridiculous, I think.

*** No that's Sarcasm and Slytherin. This fic at least attempts to modify the tropes and make them less ridiculous/annoying. Whether it suceeds or not will vary, but personally I liked this approach better than fics that use them completely unironically.

*** On the contrary, it's every trope ironically (or at least tries to be), and that annoys me far more than any unironic story ever could. But yes, I don't see the appeal either. On a technical/conceptual level, it's pretty terrible.

** Ugh.

I dropped this fic about ten chapters ago. Nothing bad ever happened to the 'good' guys and the amount of shit that happened to James Potter was fucking ridiculous.

He needs to learn that better does not mean more.

I hate how many reviews it has. Far better fics have far less reviews.
