HarryxFemale Remus Lupin or a female werewolf


** Come to think of it, I don't think I've read a gender flip Marauder Era fic. That might be a fun time travel / dimension travel premise. Harry / Fem!Sirius maybe?

** There's a good Remus/Lavender werewolf fic that goes into detail about stigma and activism. Linkffn(stars fall by lady altair)
