  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  Harry and company have succeeded in their goal of making a viable space program so they can move all the wizards to their own world. Even with magic, moving an entire civilization takes time and effort. Will they succeed in taking the wizards to the stars before SHIELD or HYDRA find them and stop them? Only time will tell.

Upon discovering their sister's death, Thor and Loki swear to protect their niece, when they find her. How will the discovery that she is one of the Aesir change the events after fourth year?

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
