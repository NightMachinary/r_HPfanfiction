(I just wrote this in response to a [[/r/AskScienceFiction]] question. The question was actually about Neville as the Chosen One, and Ginny+Luna making up his Golden Trio. I misunderstood the question and rolled with it when I noticed)

  Born sister of six brothers, born with fire in her hair...\\

  but she will have power the Dark Lord knows not.../

*1982:*

Johnathan Prewett woke up to a shrill piercing noise to his left. He promptly punched the top of his alarm clock, quieting the noisy timekeeping device. Regardless, it started ringing again less than a minute after, louder than before. He punched it again, but this time it didn't stop. He got up, and followed his morning routine between grunts and grumbles. As he opened the door to outside from his house at No.4 Privet Drive, he was greeted with a rather shocking sight.

In front of him stood an assemble that'd look very odd to all muggles around: A very tall old man, with silvery white hair, a matching beard so long that it reached his waist, holding a bundle with what seemed to be a baby. Around the men were six children, all red-haired. The oldest (11 or 10) was holding the hand of the toddler. The second oldest (probably 8, he guessed), was holding the hands of a pair of twin four year olds. The six year old was sitting on the lawn. The three oldest have clearly been crying, eyes red and puffy.

The old man spoke:\\
"You are Johnathan Prewett, second-cousin of Molly Weasley, maiden name Prewett, correct?"\\
Johnathan nodded, and recognition struck him like a punch.\\
"And, not to sound conceited, I believe you know who I am, correct?"\\
Johnathan nodded again. Why would Albus Dumbledore visit a squib with his cousin's children.

"Mr. Prewett, I have sad, but important news, and I..." - he paused, motioning at the children - "We need your assistance. May we come in?"\\
Dumbledore approached, and Johnathan could see the bundled baby. She already had a full head of red hair, but what really drew his eyes was the odd scar on her forehead, shaped like a lightning bolt.

*1992:*

Johnathan had no idea how he survived the last ten years, a squib raising seven magical children. Sure, the assistance from the Ministry's welfare fund helped, and many members of the wizarding community donated to the Weasley Fund, but that was just enough to make ends meet. Molly's "Burrow" had been permanently converted into a memorial monument, and his house in Little Whinging was too small for such so many children.\\
He had surprised himself with how quickly he took up the call of dropping his muggle life in London to raise his seven second-cousins once removed (Or, as he called them now: his little weirdos). Moving to Godric's Hollow was the best idea he had. The Potters, down the road, were more than happy in helping him when he needed magical assitance, and it was great for the children to have little Harry to play with.

Johnathan got out of his reminiscence. They were in Diagon Alley, and Ginny had just left Ollivander's bouncing in glee, swishing her new wand around and making sparks fly. Finally, after six visits to the wandmaker, this was the last. He smiled and grabbed the hand of his littlest weirdo. He had a feeling she'll be okay at Hogwarts. The other six were, so why not, right?


** Ginny Colin and Luna running around solving mysteries and getting into trouble?

Harry with a crush on the girl who lived?

Yeah I'd read this.

**** Do you plan to expand it? Ginny would have six overprotective brothers teaching her everything they can about fighting- and the first two are a curse breaker and a dragon tamer! Percy could be really badass as the Weasley representing the interests of the Girl Who Lived in the ministry, and the twins are clearly suited to creative guerrilla warfare. And Ron could be the self appointed body guard for her at Hogwarts since he's the closest in age.

Honestly the Weasleys are a badass family in canon anyway, it would be really cool to see Ginny's older brothers go all out to transform themselves into a fighting force to protect Ginny and teach their little sister how to kill Voldemort. And I don't think they'd be locking their brooms away from her either!

****** If you want some examples of short fanfics that cover all 7 years of Hogwarts by skipping between scenes that are changed in an AU without rewriting the whole series, here are some!

Female Harry: linkao3(7809337; 3694820)

Lily Luna potter (fits with canon): linkao3(666224)

Petunia is a witch AU: linkao3(390762)

They're a bit more purple prose-ish than your style, but most of the shorter fics have less dialogue, which keeps the word count low. I figured the shortfic structures might be informative/encouraging though. I think you should go for it. The premise is unique & popular and you're a good writer.

  When Lily is eighteen, she cuts her hair and joins the army. The British Army. The British Muggle Army. Despite what the gossip papers say, she leaves her wand at home. She's not a complete idiot. -- -- Oh, right. Maybe take a few steps back.

  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

** I love different Chosen One stories. The Neville ones normally suck, and the Potter twin ones are kind of annoying due to them almost always having Lily and James abusing or neglecting Harry.

I looked for a Ron BWL story, but I really want this one to be a thing.
