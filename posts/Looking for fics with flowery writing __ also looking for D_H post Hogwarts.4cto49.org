I have pretty much read all of [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic/works?fandom_id=136512][dirgewithoutmusic]] 's works, and I love the gorgeous way they have of putting things. Am looking for any recommendations of fics that you just think are written beautifully. I'll read anything, though I'm not the biggest fan of slash.

Also, a separate request, but I loved [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/90292/chapters/122722][The Politician's Wife]] and am now on a quest for Draco/Hermione post Hogwarts.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) has some of the /best/ writing I've ever seen in fanfiction. The voice of the writer is gorgeous to read.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** linkffn(8213855) has some of the best imagery I've ever read.

And just FYI, D/H usually means Draco/Harry which doesn't fit with your earlier statement about slash. D/Hr might be more in line with what you're looking for.

  Hermione gets the cat, the flat, the food, and the furniture. Ron gets the family and friends. Harry gets the boot, his little book, the blame, and the shame. Ginny gets a new bloke and a haircut. New circumstances mix with old patterns, and Harry and Hermione find their friendship put to the test.

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4314892/Colubrina][Colubrina's]] work is lovely and she has a few post-DH Dramiones including Rebuilding, The Muddy Princess and half a sorrow.

Editted: The Die is another of hers that is post-DH Dramione and very beautiful.

  Hermione thought she was the only person in the world who would spend Valentine's Day in a Graveyard, but she was wrong. He's there. Every single year, with his gloves, roses, and answers. Dramione Valentine's Day one-shot. Post-Hogwarts. EWE.
