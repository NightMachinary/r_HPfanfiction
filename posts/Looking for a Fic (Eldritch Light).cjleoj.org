I was wondering if anyone has read and knows what happened to the story Eldritch Light? Or where I can find it? I remember it last being on ff.net but it seems to have vanished. It is, without a doubt, my favorite fanfiction of any fandom. Incredibly written with a realistic timeline, it focuses on Dumbledore accudently going back in time and adopting a young Tom Riddle. If anyone perhaps has a saved copy and wouldn'tt mind sharing it even I would be incredibly grateful!


** You seem to be describing the story "Eldritch" by Eldritcher. I don't know why, but they got rid of their FFN account at some point within the last 6 months.

You can still find some stories by Eldritcher on their [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/eldritcher/pseuds/eldritcher][Ao3 account]] and you can read their stories that used to be on FFN (including "Eldritch") on MuggleNet: [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=163971]]
