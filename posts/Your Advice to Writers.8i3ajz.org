What advice would you like to see authors take into consideration with their writing? Pitfalls to avoid, things they should strive to do - that sort of thing.

One that comes to mind (from a discussion I had elsewhere) is:

Subversion does not equal Better. This applies to art generally as well. Just avoiding something or doing it differently than what the reader expected doesn't mean it's better, just different. An event which was foreshadowed and built up to is nearly always going to better than something that's different simply to be different.

People have complained to death about it, but /The Last Jedi/ comes to mind with this criticism. The expectations many had for the events and revelations were dashed and many defended the movie by effectively saying not doing the expected actually made it better.


** If canon gets in the way of your story, canon has to give way. Slavishly following canon is not a good thing - the needs of a good story take priority.

** Definitely agreeing with that. Having an out of the blue twist is like saying everything that happened in the whole story didn't really matter. It's like the '... and it was all a dream' twist. It's unexpected as hell, but only because nobody expects you to just have a twist that negates the entire purpose of the story. Of course, there are ways to do it well, but in general, the 'it was all a dream' twist is universally acknowledged as shit.

For some general advice that I think is important and that I've only learnt fairly recently: don't wait for the muse. Just write. The muse is a fantasy, and while it's nice and all, you could wait for years before that muse graces you with its presence. And if you wait years for it, your writing has rusted away in the drawer for equally that much time. If you're serious about wanting to improve your writing skills, just write every day. Even if it's 50 words and you delete it all the next day, as long as you keep writing and don't wait for something mythical and magical to give you inspiration.

Otherwise... Fact-check, I guess. It ruins the immersion when you call Alastor Moody as Aloster Moodey or whatever. It's very easy to just Google the name and get it right. Punctuation skills are important too. Use Grammarly to help you if you aren't confident, though keep in mind that Grammarly was made for academic writing and not fiction writing.

*** Similar to your last paragraph: make sure you're using the write word. Homophones exist and are damned annoying. Also double and triple check your writing. I'm reading a story currently that's otherwise decent, but every so often a word is and I have to figure out what the sentence means.

*** The bit about the muse is something I can very much agree with. For me anyway, since my stories are planned out in an outline, I know where I want to go. So my problem has never really been writer's block, but rather lack of time or energy to do it.

** Not a writer. But as a reader, I'd say the very basic 'show, don't tell'.\\

*** Yes to this. I think what happens is when a story is well-crafted, the reader doesn't really realize how deeply they're experiencing the story, so when they go to write, they think all they need to do is relate the events as they happen. Which is fine if you're putting together a grocery list, but no so much if you're trying to tell a love story.

*** It's nice advice in general, but I think one has to be careful. "Show don't tell" applies when you're writing dramatics (dialogue basically) because it's more natural to explore dialogue "on screen" as it flows better (i.e. like real life dialogue). But for narrative, telling usually works better because it trims down the content to what's necessary to explain what's going on.

**** I couldn't disagree more. It's during narrative where "Show, don't tell" becomes important.

I actually prefer to use the phrase "Actions speak louder than words" when dealing with characterisation. For example, there are a lot of fics out there which exclaim at length in their narration that Dumbledore is a master manipulator, cleverly pulling everybody's strings so that they dance to his tune, yet he is easily thwarted by Harry's simplistic opening gambit, losing everything he had built up almost immediately. This is obviously bad writing. If the story had instead shown Dumbledore expertly manipulating situations to his advantage, and beating down Harry's attempts at rebellion until Harry eventually manages to come up with a way to win, it would be much more believable.

Showing the reader what a character is like through their actions and reactions adds much more realism and depth than simply telling them "This is how it is" "Why?" "Because I said so."

***** Showing is done principally in dialogue. Narrative is what you use to set up scenes, scenes are where "action" occurs. To do otherwise ends up bloating the story. Canon HP shows this demarcation rather well. "Show don't tell" is too simplistic to be taken at face value.

Like take your example. If one showed (e.g. as action, onscreen) all the times Dumbledore manipulated things, it becomes tiresome because the readers gets it after they see it a couple of times. Afterwards, simply telling the reader (or even just hinting at it) at some point that Dumbledore was manipulating things behind the scenes is more economical and reduces reader boredom at having the same piece of characterization being shown repeatedly.

** These are the 2 biggest things that bug me, and they're both fairly specific to fanfiction:

1. Think carefully about using tropes and cliches. If you've seen them in a couple fics, chances are an avid reader has seen them in many and is sick of them. The phrase "so mote it be" is damn near enough for me to drop a fic completely at this point.

2. Spells have names. Their incantations have correct spellings. And if you're going to make up your own spells, please please please bastardize the Latin (or Greek or whatever language). Don't just plug a phrase into Google translate. There are those of us in the fandom who can actually read those languages, and I guarantee you that can recognize when someone tries using a language they dont speak at all. JKR's spells were a couple words, a few syllables at most, and most weren't actual translations of anything.

** So, like, slow down man. You know, like, chillax. Like, take things slow, quell the hype you know. Cause when the muse hits ya she wants you to vomit plot point after plot point without connections or flesh, she likes the shape of life so she wants life but she's so lazy she doesn't care if there is skin or flesh or even marrow in those bare bones, you know?

Like, make your shit internally consistent, flesh things out, never "hurry to the meat of the plot", and always use narrative devices to save writing time and page space to flesh out your shit. Like, the other day I was reading this novelette space opera thing and there was a time skip that did nothing but increase the power of the MC's fleet. Good examples of this are nearly any biography or the yearling

On that note, the world is. Your characters and shit aren't the focus, the world is. Don't look at them, look at the world they are in where and when they are. A really good trick to fake it if you can't make it is to have interludes of side characters or even people not or barely mentioned that have nothing to do with your main cast, see Worm for good examples of this.

Further, use genre as a template of feelings to capture. Action should get your blood pumping and make you sit up, adventure should make you feel small and insignificant in the good way like when you are in a broad plain or the open ocean or a desert or a great forest or such and feel how immense things are, horror should make you twitch and check your surroundings, humor should make people on the subway look at you funny because of your reactions, angst should make you feel rage and sadness and all those depressed emotions, etc. etc.

A good story is compelling and makes you read it, a great story makes you feel it. Don Quixote is a wonderful example of this as are any Madeline L'Engle books, many waters in particular, not to mention the canning season which is one of the few books I can list off the top of my head that does angst right.

Further, fuck plot. Plot does not actually matter, storytelling does. Plot only matters as much as it acts as a vector of storytelling. I fucking hate myself for this but for this see the little prince or the existence of comics and manga as things, ah there is also le comte de monte-cristo. Don't forgive me for my sins I have just begun **base drops*.*

I cannot say this enough though, *Do not tell a good story, tell a story good.* This is one of the biggest pitfalls I see in modern literature, people want to tell good stories and they think they want to read good stories and to a degree these both make sense but what people really want to tell and read are well told stories. See luis carol, le comte de monte-cristo, and the little prince for examples of this

Always do at least a little bit of slice of life. If you're writing badass spess marines make a few scenes where they talk and joke around or mourn or clean their guns or have lunch or prepare for bed. Unless it's a part of the plot like in the sixth sense these scenes are 100% needed in any good story. for this see enders game or basically anything by ayn rand overrated as fuck but perfect example is atlas shrugged, god I couldnt stand that book but it has some of the most well done off pace but still significant slice of life I have ever seen.

Power wank to your hearts content, spend three or four chapters giving tech specs on a gun or whatever but always use technobabble and things other than that gun. Like, do it, but do it well and do more than it. Seriously, it's that simple. See doctor who or basically any cyberpunk or space opera for this.

Power scaling... doesn't matter. Not even in genres where power is a theme like action or drama does power scaling matter. Like, if you give frodo a lightsaber he's frodo with a lightsaber and that doesn't really change anything because despite combat being important to LotR there is maybe 3 pages actually involving frodo's combat prowess. See LotR, zombies as a genre and +our glorious mistress of escalation+ worm for examples.

Uhh, I got shit to do so that's it for now but maybe probably potentially I'll write another list like this.

** Write the whole story before posting it.

Re-read it, find a beta and re-read it together again.

Fix mistakes, plot holes, inconsistent style and other issues.

If you abandon your story, you'll disappoint your readers.

If your story becomes inconsistent, because you can't return back in time and fix posted chapters, you'll disappoint your readers.

If first chapters are bad, you'll lose readers.

Finish the story, prove that you can do it and then start posting.

In that way you can still post with some schedule and make minor changes using your readers feedback.

Everyone will be happy.

** Write everything with a purpose. Too often I'm reading a fic and I actually have to scan through irrelevant information because there's no reason for the author to include it.

The most common example of this is rehashing canon facts that we already know. You don't have to include a whole conversation about Harry's accidental magic as a child if it's the same accidental magic as the books.

Another example is when authors are writing the internal monologue of a character where they're thinking about another character (most commonly Harry thinking about Snape or Dumbledore) but then the character that we have to spend time reading about (Who isn't present in the scene or a part of the plot right now) never actually affects the story in any way. There's no need to include the monologue if the character isn't important.

** My advice is to always remember that when writing your characters That they are supposed to be human beings. Human beings are complicated human beings are messy We have drives desires Demons And normally a host Psychological issues. As a rule if a character is going to be speaking or interacting More than once Any given chapter You should have some sort of basic profile written out for that character. My primary secondary and tertiary characters Should have more than just a few lines In their profile indicating what they like and don't like They should have loose backgrounds facts About how they grew up on influence them their desires The reasons why they act the way they act. This is perhaps one of the greatest failings of most of the amateur writers whose work I've read They fail To make their characters alive Instead they read as 2 dimensional and flat.

I apologize for my punctuation spelling and grammar Speech to text sucks but I'm not tapping this out on a tablet.
