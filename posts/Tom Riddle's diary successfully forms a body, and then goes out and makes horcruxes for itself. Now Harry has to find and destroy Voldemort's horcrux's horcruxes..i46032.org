** And then one of the Diary's horcrux forms his own body, kills the Diary's physical form, and makes Horcruxes of his own. OG Voldemort does not like this at all, so he rides to war against himself.

** This reminds me of the plot of the Imperial Raadch. Spoliers- the antagonist is fighting herself, because one faction of her regrets her war crimes, another wants to double down on the war crimes, and if there are any more (which is implied) they're doing their own fucking thing, presumably something to do with AI cores. Imagine each horcrux is fighting the others and one of them has goals that loosely align with the main gang's.

** Okay, this story would definitely need to incorporate the copy machine effect, where copies of copies get progressively poorer quality as details get lost.

/+(This used to be a common term, but a google search only turns up photoshop tutorials and health risks if your desk is next to the office photocopier.)+/

Apparently now it's called "generation loss" and is applied mostly to digital images because that's all anybody knows anymore.

ETA: The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss][wikipedia entry]] for generation loss is very verbose, but had a reference link to this [[https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/generation_loss.html][simple definition]].
