I'm planning asci-fi harry potter fic, taking place in a mish mash of star wars and canon. Voldemort resembles Vader, Dumbledore is basically Yoda, and so on. Anyways, I'm thinking if Hogwarts being this place to train "force sensitive" jedi(?), but it's hard coming up with a name. So far, I've got Hogwarts Academy of Jedi. Any suggestions?
