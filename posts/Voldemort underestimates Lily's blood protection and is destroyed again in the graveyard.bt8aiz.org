Voldemort couldn't touch Harry and would be burnt if he did thanks to Lily's sacrifice. What if using Harry's blood goes differently? When Pettigrew drops Harry's blood into that cauldron, the potion and Voldemort's temporary body are both destroyed.

Edit: Existing stories would be most welcome!


** You know, I never got that. If the mere touch of Harry's skin through a possessed body caused him excruciating pain and burns, then how the hell could he use Harry's /blood/ to rebirth himself...?

You'd think a splash of Lily-blessed Potter blood would fry everything "Tom Riddle" within....

Not sure this makes for the best standalone prompt - he gets in cauldron, he dies - but would definitely be a good element in a larger fic

**** Nah, it worked because JKR needed it for convenience. It falls under the same umbrella as Dumbledore keeping Harry at the Dursley's even after Voldemort took his blood, and was able to bypass the protections. She just didn't put much thought into it.

***** Thanks! Now you have me wanting to start a prompt where: 1) after fourth year, Dumbledore tries to make Harry go back to Durzkaban, "due to the blood protections"; 2) Harry responds, pointing out that since Voldemort has Harry's blood, that there will be no protection from whom they need it the most; 3) (the most important part) Harry MUST sometime in the conversation, call Dumbledore a "daft bimbo."

**** Aha, but this makes even less sense, because the reason it even had that initial effect is because of magic!

I just really hate inconsistent rules for magic, unless that's the way magic works in that book/fic and it's very clear that it does so.

Like for example, whenever I hear about "fairy magic" from the Dresden crossovers I read, it's always abundantly clear that /this/ type of magic isn't /supposed/ to make sense, that it's powerful but also wild and temperamental. Or something.

But that's not the case in Harry Potter at all, where magic is presented as a something structured, something /kids/ learn in school, are assigned homework and given written tests on, where a specific Latin word and a specific wand motion produces the same replicable effect, *every time*.

All I'm saying is, Rowling's shit's whack, yo.

*** I always kind of assumed that Harry's blood wasn't a part of the â€˜bringing him to life' thing and more an extra thing he tacked on to ensure he'd be able to touch Harry from then on.

**** Ok, I'm confused, when the ritual has three main components, one of which is:

#+begin_quote
  "Blood of the enemy, *you will resurrect your foe*",
#+end_quote

How is it not important in bringing him to life? It quite literally says that's what it does :P

*** The thing with the blood of the enemy is that it must be forcibly taken. In other words, the ritual works by subjugating a hostile element to the user's own purposes. Harry blood just happens to be more hostile than usual.

**** But blood - of enemy or not - isn't inherently hostile. I mean, figuratively, sure, but otherwise?

It seems like some really big post-hoc apologetics to say that the person who created the ritual accounted for /literally/ hostile blood as a result of what is (in canon) a freak accident of magic.

But I suppose it's as best a rationalization of this as can be gotten...

****** Lily's protection is unprecedented and Voldemort never had any opportunity to test how the blood would work in that ritual. It's utterly moronic and a great example of plot railroading.

And in any case, if you /do/ say that Voldemort was able to overcome that, then why couldn't he overcome the so called wards around the Dursleys home when it was based on this protection?

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.
