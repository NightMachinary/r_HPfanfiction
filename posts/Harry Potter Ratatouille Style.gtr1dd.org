In Sixth-year, instead of finding the Half-Blood Prince's note-filled book, Harry finds a tiny Bowtruckle.

The Bowtruckle, who goes by the name of Bowie, has been observing for most of life time, wizards and witches making strange concotions. He learned the art of portion-making by observing for years and it became his dream to be an artist in potion-making. However, the previous bat-wizard always frighten him, so he never follow through his dream.

But now there is an opportunity for him. Bowie has observed how the four-eye wizard has struggled with the art of potion-making for years. So he makes a deal with him, Bowie helps him with potion-making and doing so, Bowie will become the artist he always wanted. It is a good thing his hair is a comfortable nest to stay.


** Yes.

** In a way, all the fics where Harry's scar starts speaking to him and giving him advice/knowledge is a variation of the Ratatouille trope.

*** I know a lot of stories take this trope somewhat seriously, but all I can think of is /Oh God Not Again/ and Harry talking about his psychic scar telling him stuff.

**** The thing is OGNA isn't even a variation of this trope, since the scar isn't sentient, which makes it doubly funny

** Now I'm contemplating a variation of this where Bowie is instead brave enough to deal with making potions in the bat-wizard's presence... so long as he's not noticed.

Cue meeting the shy, reclusive young Herbology prodigy you really /gets plants/ and can easily make friends with the timid Bowtruckle... and also happens to have problems with confidence in the Potions classroom.

Neville and Bowie, working together to make potions without mean Professor Snape catching on!
