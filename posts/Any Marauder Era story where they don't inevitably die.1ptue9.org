I'm looking to expand upon the kind of stories that I read, and thought that some of the marauder era would be a good place to start.

I don't really like reading stories where I know what is going to happen, so I would like to find something non-canon, AU, where you see them maybe doing something similar to the DA and working from there or something.

What is important, is that the author isn't restricting themselves to following a set of events. Some take a great deal of freedom in their writing, but inevitably Peter live etc. How about some where he dies, or James and Lily fight instead Voldemort full-time instead of settling down.

I'm not usually a Mauraders fan at all (loyal Snapeist right here), but this series is simply amazing. This is the first one of the trilogy, though I think she wrote a prequel to it, which I suppose makes it a four-part series.

*** Not really Marauder era as far as I know. It follows Harry and the rest of the kids.

** How about a Marauder era AU fic that doesn't focus on the Marauders?

This one is a firmly AU Snape/Lily fic where Snape turns against Mulciber and his other Slytherin friends when they play a 'prank' on Lily (in canon they do this to Mary Macdonald and Snape laughs it off). The first half is a gradual, believable Snape/Lily romance and Snape making friends outside his house and turning away from Death Eaterdom. The second half is a great depiction of the first wizarding war against Voldemort. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4026081/1/The-Wrath-of-the-Half-Blood-Prince]]
