What if there are other factors that prohibit a type of plant from growing anywhere else. I've never seen this explored as a reasoning for the delay in Mandrakes during book two.

We in the real world take for granted that a plant can grow in any place that is conducive to its mundane needs, but that doesn't necessarily hold true for the magical world.

What if Mandrakes can only grow in the English Isles?

Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Wales, The Isle of Man and Cornwall would like a word with you.

Well, I'm going to stop you right there and - ignoring the way you called the British Isles - tell you that the mandrake is actually a Mediterranean plant and it's also canon in the books. You'll also have to remember that Lucius Malfoy was on the Board of Governors and would have done anything to stop the board from giving permission to buy mandrakes from the Southern Hemisphere with school funds.

*** Plus it's almost certainly a bunch of pure bloods on the board - “it is just some muggleborns after all, let's save the money, we'll have some mandrake grown at the end of the year anyway!”
