** I'd say a year and a half to two years. She's already comfortable with being handled and already trained as a post bird when he gets her; we don't know how long that takes, but most owls are notoriously dumb. They don't live up to the whole wisdom thing at all!

So still a young bird, but old enough to be adult or close to it and to have had some serious work put into her education before being left with an eleven year old who's never looked after a pet. If someone had given Harry an untrained bird, he wouldn't even know where to start on teaching her how to be touched.

Most owls aren't Post Owls. It always seemed clear to me (seeing how Hedwig seems fully capable of understanding human speech even not directly related letters, and all HP owls' ability to track down their targets even if they're not at their usual address) that Post Owls are not mundane owls, but a special magical strain; either enchanted at birth, or, more probably, inherent magical owls who are to regular owls what wizards are to Muggles (with their magic partially manifesting as increased I.Q.).

**** Oh, you could train an owl to do things, given enough time. Even an ordinary owl can be trained. They're just not as bright as many of the other trainable birds - raptors aren't as bright compared to corvids or parrots. Magical owls probably /are/ cleverer than most, but they can't be THAT much better.

I mean something more like...what a jackdaw learns in one week might take an owl two or three.

Hedwig is well trained when Harry gets her. She's not frightened of his hand in the cage, she stands still to have things done to her (like attaching letters) instead of moving away or nipping, even though Harry doesn't really know how to touch her yet. That takes a while with a parrot - it took me a few weeks with mine - so she must have had someone doing work with her before she was offered for sale.

***** Re: Hedwig understanding English. I think of HP owls as being very much sentient, bordering on sapient --- about on par with the cleverest of nonhuman apes (Koko, Kanzi, etc.).

****** A clever parrot is roughly on par with an ape. They think on about the same level as a four or five year old human. Tool use, understanding English, problem solving...the works. Having a pet parrot is like having a kindergarten kid that can fly.

Hedwig is demonstrably not /quite/ that bright. She understands English, and does problem solving (bringing Harry food) but no tools that we ever see.

So if we boost magical owls up to be on par with parrots, and give them a homing instinct to magic that's been bred into them...

******** I just tossed a few kindergartners off of a building. They CAN fly but kind of... downwards. Their landings are pretty poor, though, making craters. Lazy brats.

******** Having a bird is fun, but a lot of work.

You have to put time aside to talk and play with them every day. Doubly so if you only have one, since having just one means *you* are their best friend. If I'm going to be out, I put music on for her so she doesn't get bored - bit by bit, I'm slowly building up a playlist of songs she likes, since she will insist on having Opinions. Occasionally she gets bored anyway and starts trying to break out of her (latched) cage.

See what I mean?
