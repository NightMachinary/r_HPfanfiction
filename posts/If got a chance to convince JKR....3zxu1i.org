*What if*: /JKR is going to write a new HP novel. She puts out a 'Fanon-to-Canon' contest for fanfiction writers: choose one element of fanon and in 200 words try to convince JKR to incorporate it into HP canon. Persuade her, and she'll add your idea to the new book./

 

What would you write to convince JKR? Don't just say which fanon you'd like, make a case for it as if JKR is sitting across from you. Similar to the show [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank][Shark Tank]] but for fanon ideas

*EDIT 1.7.16*: There are plenty of posts on this subreddit full of this debate: /"My fanon idea is makes sense, yours is stupid"/. I was hoping to move away from that.


** I'd probably try to sort out the wizarding population numbers and fix it to ~10,000 and have everything JKR wrote work with that number.

The most obvious way this would show is probably through the Aurors (assuming a post-Hogwarts HP fic would focus on Harry as an Auror). With a small wizarding population there shouldn't be many Aurors at all - like, maybe 10 of them.

Alternatively:

Arthur Weasley has an old wizarding spaceship mixed in with all the junk in his shed. In the 1500s it was fashionable for wizards to holiday on the moon, but soon enough wizards got bored of the idea. Why go into space when the Earth is so much more interesting? And if you want to study space, you can do that just as well from Earth as from the Moon. The idea of space travel is thus considered rather old-fashioned and archaic by wizards.

** I'm going to point to my favourite part of [[/u/SilverCookieDust]]'s post in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3qutjw/unusual_bits_of_fanon_you_like/][similar thread]].

#+begin_quote
  The Marauder era was the last generation of children allowed to do magic at home before turning seventeen. This is in very large part due to Voldemort recruiting underage wizards (Regulus was taken when he was only 16) so the Ministry banned underage magic to make youngsters less desirable. (As for canon-compatibility: Petunia mentions Lily coming home and turning tea cups into rats, and Sirius used Permanent Sticking Charms in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, which he left at the age of sixteen.)

*** Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it stated in the books that the ministry can't detect who did magic, just where it was done. So underage wizards living in a magical home can do magic and no one will know it was them? Just like Harry got blamed for Dobby's magic... it would explain why Sirius could use magic at home and at the same time make the rule useless when it came to Voldemort recruiting underage wizards.

I do realize it still doesn't explain how Lily could do magic at home, since she was muggle-born.

  Aunt Petunia is exaggerating a little; you have to allow for her state of mind when she started shrieking these things. However, just like her son, Lily was not averse to testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy, so you can safely assume she will have had a few warning letters -- nothing too serious, though.

** That the reason the Marauder's Map did not detect Peter Pettigrew before the events of Prisoner of Azkaban was because Peter lost himself to being a rat and thus the map did not detect him as a human, and after Sirius's escape he was too self-conscious to be able to do that anymore.

Also, that the discrepancy between the value of the Galleon and what we'd think it should be worth is because the Galleon itself is worth its value in gold but the wizards are still behind the times and using the old Pound for the exchange, one that has the value of a pound of silver. And the coins themselves are charmed or whatever the goblin equivalent of it is so that muggles do not see the coin as anything more than a metal cap or a standard none-to-low--value coin that is merely gold-like in colour, stopping anyone who had ever considered selling it for its worth in gold to the muggles.

  Alright JK, goblins love money, hate wizards and *especially* hate thieves, right? Right. So what ultimate punishment would goblins inflict on one of their own who steals from Gringotts? Answer: They get turned into a 'House Elf' and sold to a wizard. They and their descendants are doomed to a life of poverty and humiliation in servitude to wizards.

*** Except the opposite is the case. The wizards already had a war with the Muggles and they won. The British wizarding government displays an ability to completely control the Muggle government with casual ease. In HBP we saw the British Ministry of Magic rearrange a phone call between the Muggle Prime Minister and a foreign President (implied to be the US President) on a whim, without the PM's consent or knowledge.

**** The point of the thread was to name something we'd like to see in canon that is (in my case sometimes) fanon. Its a lot like vampires in HP, for example. We know close to nothing beyond the surface since the worldbuilding just stops there. Everything we dig up are merely indications to a point. In my case, or the case of many, the names, actions and demeanor of wizarding institutions, positions and culture indicate a defeated, or at least inferior position.

Its well within the realm of possibilities that this rearranged phone call got some heads rolling, if, lets say, MI5 got wind of it later on.

Also, I'm pretty sure Rowling never mentioned a war between muggles and wizards. If so, then please tell me in which book. There are some mentions of conflicts in Pottermore, mostly the Witch Hunts, but that site is already non-canon for some (me included). However, even if there was, and I think thats a rather heavy weight argument, if wizards truly won, why are /they/ hiding? If there was a war, then the muggles were enemies. Why are there still muggles if the wizards survived? Why not get rid of the thread or enslave them? Why is the Vatican still standing? The tools are there in your grasp. Winning a war and then giving up on your territory, privileges and control does not sound like something a winner would do. It sounds more like North Korean "Communism won"-propaganda.

What if Bagshot didn't really write "A history of magic" but a propaganda piece supporting wizard superiority? What if Ralston Potter was an allie of the muggles and pushed the Statute to cripple wizarding culture once and for all with the shackles of secrecy?

Or, lets turn this thing completely around. What if the ICW is the true power behind the world? What if the Loge 322, the Rothschilds and the Freemasons are but tools to control the muggles and keep them in check? What if religion and culture are just there to keep the eyes of muggles away from wizard kind?

Anyway, as I said, we could debate and argue all we want, in the end you could take whatever you like and explain away the stuff that contradicts it with minutes worth of worldbuilding. Canon just lacks the hard facts and the necessary depth in these things..

***** The "there was a war" thing wasn't literal, it was a reversal of your assertion that there was a war and the wizards lost.

The point is that there wasn't a war because there didn't need to be. Wizards don't work in that way. Wizards don't /need/ a war to gain control of Muggles - they can be in control of Muggles without any Muggle ever realising.

Except we know it didn't. Recall that the HBP chapter in question was from the Muggle Prime Minister's point of view, and we know that said PM mentally agreed with Fudge when Fudge said he wouldn't ever mention the existence of wizards to anyone.

With regards to your other points, you're thinking too much like a Muggle. What do wizards actually want? Territory and natural resources mean nothing to wizards. Those are Muggle concerns. It seems to me that what wizards want more than anything else is to be left alone by Muggles and to be free to practice magic as they like. The Statute of Secrecy achieves that perfectly, especially when combined by the clear level of influence magical governments have over Muggle ones.

I think we know a lot more about canon than you think we do. Especially with Pottermore etc (canon is not subjective - it's a pretty well defined concept referring to authoritative published works. Pottermore is published, therefore it is canon).

#+end_quote

As much as I agree with the point that there doesn't need to be a history of war, this is just not true. The Statute of Secrecy is extremely limiting to wizards and a breach of it takes herculean efforts to right again. As a matter of fact, the wizarding world, or better, its secrecy builds on two psychological phenomenons. Muggles who witness magic will go to all kinds of lengths to include the seen into their known facts of the world, since I do not believe that Obliviators can catch every single witness, every time. On the other hand people like the PM keep silent out of fear to lose face.

I agree on much you say, but I will stand to the point that in theory, you could destroy any and all assumptions of both of us by simply furthering the depth of worldbuilding in these matters. I've read amazing explanations for both cases in fanfiction.

To the point of canon, while there are definitions, its not well defined by any means the moment you disregard Urban Dictionary. Questions like what happens if you publish using a new medium, hang over the concept. Medium having rather complex topics like accessibility, status and importance of information within it. Many, and I count myself among them, feel that canon is defined by the original work and everything within the same line of medium. In the case of Harry Potter, that means the books and only those. Then you have the question of the authority of the author. When does something cease to be within the authors authority and when does it begin to be subject of many influences? The rest delves deep into media-theory, but the point stands that canon is, while not completely subjective, definitely a flexible definition. I myself stand to the opinion that canon is the line of work within the same medium from first to last part because after it, knowledge begins to become fragmented and less accessible. I would take the bet that given a simple poll of "who were James Potters parents" a majority of average fanfiction readers would write "Charlus and Dorea Potter", which is false, as Pottermore (and the wikia, finally) tells us (to emphasize the point of authority over information).

Anyway, thanks for the discussion up until the point. Works better than coffee in the morning to wake the grey matter up.
