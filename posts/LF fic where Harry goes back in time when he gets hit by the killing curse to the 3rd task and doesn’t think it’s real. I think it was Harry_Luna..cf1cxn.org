#+begin_quote
  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.

***** I didn't say it was any good, I haven't read it before. And yeah, it really looks like your run-of-the-mill Harry-is-superguy-doing-everything-perfect (and a bit of jackass). And poor Ginny gets pretty short straw, the author forces S.S. Loonies and Lions (Huna) pretty strongly.
