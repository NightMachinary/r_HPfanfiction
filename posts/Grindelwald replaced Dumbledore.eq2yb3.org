A while ago I remember reading a story where on one of Dumbledore's trips to see Grindelwald in Nurmengard, Grindelwald managed to overpower Dumbledore and take his place, thus explaining “evil” Dumbledore.

Does anyone know any other fics like this?


** There was a story were Grindlewald made a horcrux of the Elder Wand and it possessed Dumbledore. I can't remember much about the fic tbh, I know there was a 3 way fight between Harry, Grindlewald and Voldemort.

*** If I remember correctly, core threads didn't have that. Dumbledore was a bit crazy from having too much magic basically and being exposed to a Deathly hollow for years (his wand) but nothing about grindelwald replacing him.

******* I can't remember either to be honest, so could be! I vaguely remember another fanfic where grindelwald either lost in 1945 and immediately escaped and put Dumbledore in chains or beat him originally and took his place. Either way, he took the place of albus and gloated it over him. But I still don't think it was Core Threads.
