** Sage Ra has renamed his account 'Cya', and stripped it of all content. Whether this is for going pro or succumbing to bitterness, we may never know.

** Its times like this when I become aware how little I'm actually involved in this community. There obviously had to be something going on that rubbed Sage Ra the wrong way, but I have absolutely no clue what it could've been.

Maybe just sick of imbecilic reviews, who knows?

*** "Worthy of Magic" is quite controversial and I expect Sage Ra to be bombarded with nasty PMs.

The author of "Harry Potter and the Iron Lady" made some sympathetic references to Margaret Thatcher and received death threats as a result.

**** I got nasty one's as well. Death threats among them. Its nothing but empty bla bla with a bit of bullshit and mental diarrhea. Anonymity and no control tends to open the floodgates of people's inner gutters. Add to that the rather immature community in fanfiction and you can kinda expect whats gonna happen.

But if thats the case, I can understand Sage Ra loosing the motivation to write for such a community. At least that is what happened to me. You sit down, open up your software and then you ask yourself why you're not already writing your own book instead of writing for a crowd that wants to rip your face off because you don't follow the same fanon as them.

** Hey everyone. Sage Ra is back. He's currently reuploading his stories. Apparently he got locked out of his account and it got deleted or something...check ffn and you'll be able to find him again

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9922227/Sage-Ra][This is his new one]], the new chapters on /Worthy of Magic/ are pretty high quality for a fake.

****** It's probably Sage Ra.

However, there's a chance it's an impostor, and the only good way to check since he claims he lost access to his account, is to look at the quality of their new work, which is outstanding and consistent with the older work. So the chance it isn't Sage Ra is astronomically low, but there is a possibility it isn't him.

******* Considering I still have the original story downloaded to my phone I can tell you it's either a very good fake or the original author. A lot of the content is the same but some errors have been fixed so it seems like whoever it is has gone through and fixed past spelling and grammatical errors
