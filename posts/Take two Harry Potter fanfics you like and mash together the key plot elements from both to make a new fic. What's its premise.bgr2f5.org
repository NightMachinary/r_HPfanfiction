"Abandoned by the Dursleys at a care facility for children, Harry Potter grows up under the care of muggle doctors who try to help him control his strange supernatural power. Things go well enough for Harry, until during a day excursion to Stonehenge, an ill-timed shove from the childish bully Moffat causes Harry to bonk his wizardly head on one of the ritual stones at exactly the wrong time. Now instead of doctors Greene and Aymler trying to help a human Harry Potter control his accidental magic, they're trying to help a dragon Harry Potter do the same thing AND handle his prodigious appetite. The poor Statute of Secrecy..."


** Like a Red Headed Stepchild & Seventh Horcrux

Harry Potter was born with red hair, and grew up with the presence of a foreign soul that caused unexpected effects to his psyche. He enters the wizarding world where everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To his surprise and delight, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. "My own set of minions," Harry cackled. What horrors await the Wizarding World with this unholy combination?

Hermione spends over a year trying to prove that nuclear material cannot be transfigured, only filtered from the ground. When the government goes corrupt and discriminates against muggleborns, she starts a IRA style terrorist organization and uses mini nukes to wipe out all the death eater manors.

*** I love that. In an omake from [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Sword and Sorcery]] (It's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/page-907#post-56967436][this]] one btw, part 4 of an ongoing omake series.) Hermione writes up plans for how to conquer the magical world, and probably the muggle one while they're at it. They can't allow Voldie to win (because the result would inevitably lead to human extinction), so the best way to make sure it never happens is to make plans upon plans, even for the worst case scenario where they have have to go to war with Britain itself. Golem armies and magically manufactured nukes are indeed considered, and preparations are made.

The entity known as Harry Potter, who has the memories and biases of an insane Dark Lord, finds himself oddly intrigued when a member of the historically boring and pathetic Weasley family is sorted into his alma doma. He does the unthinkable and takes time out of his day to actually investigate. While he tries to maintain a friendly alliance with the Weasley girl (mostly to avoid being preemptively assassinated in the inevitable war between Dark Ladies once Hermione gets her act together), he makes it a personal mission to somehow gain acceptance to The Parlor.

He initially tries to set Ginny up with Hermione, something that Hermione and Ron both disagree with, but his mere presence soothes Ginny to a huge degree. When he realizes that she's under the diary's spell, he subtly disposes of it so that she doesn't learn his secrets. Ginny grows into something halfway between her thoughtful, deceptive, introverted Changeling self and her devoted, fixated SH self, with Harry as one of the fundamental pillars of her life. Since she's more interesting, Harry actually takes an interest, as he did in other girls during the later SH years. They have a terrible romance that works via comedic happenstance, and have a double wedding with Hermione and Ron 5 years after graduation.

** “Realizations”

“To Reach Without”

/Abandoned by the Dursleys after returning from Hogwarts, and with a change to his body that he cannot afford to deal with at his own pace, Harry tries to survive the summer on his lonesome by hiding from anyone who would wish him harm and ends up being taken in by kindly people to whom he becomes like a child of their own, learning some things about himself in the process./

Because I really like stories with a female Harry, and dislike the fact in the stories where he is a girl from birth he's often not recognisable as himself really, but the power shows and politics of “To Reach Without” weren't exactly my cup of tea and the tone of “Realizations” and its fluff were much more to my liking.

** I've got several. Combining "Harry Potter and the Granger's Take on the world" and "Harry Potter and the Children of change" seems natural. They both begin similarly and feature very similar plots initially. Also using the ending of Faery Heroes to fill the plot holes in the last part of Death's pride created by paladeus's untimely death is a good idea. Using Lord BladeDSF's "Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic" as a mixer with "partially kissed hero" is logical, given the fact that the authors both inject the same biases into the writing, not to mention the fact that both authors have similar bios and also tend to give out power the same way and are both homophobic. I will read PKH because ornstead does not openly express hate in his work, unlike Lord BladeDSF's work. broomstick flyer and fairywm were very similar in style, and they liked the ships. Fairywm herself liked genkaifan and was inspired by it in some of her works. Seel'vor and MSgt Silver dollar+SFC Copperhead shared similar notation styles, while Sinyk and paladeus both shared harem themes in their reaper challenge fics. Notice how I mentioned only h/hg shippers. Chem prof is probably similar to elizer yudowsky and clell, while robst is similar to bobmin. Starfox5 reminds me of a mix of multiple. Now, cloneserpents reminds me of stargatesg1fan out of sheer egregiousness, the blot reminds me of yanagi-wa, etc. Now, it would be nice to see a mix of the fanfic "Reverse" and dodging prison+stealing witches/any Stargatesg1fan work/any massive crossover with at least an m rating. "A Marauders plan" would go well with "An island in the sun". Heir of magic also goes well with "He's Not Dead Yet." By Redbayly (for the same reasons), and out of personal bias a crackfic crossover of the resulting 3way fic should be done with "Hogwarts School of Prayer and miracles", and 30 Hs should be crossed over with My immortal. "Harry Potter reads the multiverse" should be crossed over with the Stargatesg1fan crossover series. (If you dare.) I have so many more ideas.
