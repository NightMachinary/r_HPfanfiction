*** Ah sorry, I'm new to the reddit game :) Should've been clearer - this is a webseries based off the infamous Harry Potter fanfic "My Immortal", I thought it would be something this subreddit would like to see.

***** I did not! It was written many moons ago by a figure that called herself "Tara" (if I'm remembering my mythology correctly) You can find it at [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/1/My-Immortal]] And if you mean the web series itself - that was written/directed by the talented Brian McLellan. (I am but a humble actor.) The web series is a loose adaptation. You can get more information by visting our tumblr at [[http://www.myimmortalseries.com][www.myimmortalseries.com]]
