:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Searching for the name of a fic I read years ago. It was a super-long next generation era series. It mostly centered on Harry's kids. I remember it involving a lot of quidditch, new wizarding technology (instant messengers/radios stuff like that) and I remember Harry's daughter Lily was like a child prodigy or something along those lines when it came to academics. The only other specific plotline I remember was all of Harry's kids being kicked off the quidditch team at one point. It was something like 100+ chapters and I've been trying to find it for a while to no avail. I originally read it on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]].
