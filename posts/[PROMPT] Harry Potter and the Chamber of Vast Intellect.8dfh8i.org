Write something in which it is the Heir of Ravenclaw that is terrorizing everyone, rather than Slytherin

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- anywhere from a short bit of dialogue to a full-blown story, so from 50 - 1000+ words long
- instead of the Heir of Slytherin, the Heir of Ravenclaw is terrorizing the Hogwarts student body

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- Harry is in Hufflepuff
- the Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry is changed to Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff (Hard Work vs Using Smarts To Avoid The Aforementioned)
- Luna Lovegood being Harry's frienmesis (Draco but friendly and with more sass than actual anger)
- Harry making a point of defeating the Monster with Hard Work and Friendship rather than Being Smart About It
- The Smackin' Stick of Hufflepuff being a thing

** Harry determinedly stepped into the Chamber of Knowledge, clutching the fabled Smackin' Stick of Hufflepuff (his worthiness proven by his 3.5 GPA and 100% extra credit completion rate) in his hands. He saw Ginny lying on the floor and ran over to her. "C'mon Ginny, get up, we'll get you some hot coco once you're out of this place."

"She won't wake."

Harry grabbed the stick and turned to the new voice. It was a relatively young man, looked to be a sixth year, in a Ravenclaw tie. "You're the Heir of Ravenclaw, aren't you!"

"Oh, Bravo. I was worried I was going to have to spell it out for you..." Tom glanced at the Stick and Harry's tie. "given your Hufflepuffiness, you know?"

"Oi! I've got a stick and I'm not afraid to use it!"

Tom laughed. "Oh, you'll need much more than a stick to defeat me, foolish child! I am Tom Marvolo Riddle, AKA Lord Voldemort! It's an anagram, see?"

Harry thought for a moment, before nodding. "Yeah, that works. Put 'em up!"

Tom laughed and began making bird cawing sounds that Harry could still understand?

"/Speak to me, Ravenclaw, Smartest of the Hogwarts Four!/"

The massive ravenclaw statue's head slowly split in half, revealing a massive nest that held a large, black bird, it caw'd viciously and swooped down.

"/Kill him!/"

The bird swooped at Harry, who rolled out of the way. Lightning seared the floor where he had just been standing.

"What the hell? That's a Thunderbird!"

"You stand no chance, Potter! You may as well let it be quick!"

"I would tell you to eat a dick, but Professor Sprout said not to curse."

"But - you just-"

Harry took the opportunity the Ravenclaw's spluttering gave him to smash the diary with the Stick. Tom screamed as pages began flying out from the bindings all over the floor.

Harry turned to the intricately decorated column and began climbing. "It might be smart to try attacking the thing from above," he muttered as he ducked another lightning bolt, "but getting up there satisfies the 'hard work' requirement."

Finally at the top, Harry waited until the Thunderbird is almost under him before he jumps. '/I had to work hard for those quidditch skills,/' he thought as he landed lightly on its back, '/I'm not letting them go to waste./'

He sandwiched the bird's neck between the Stick and his chest, and pulled. The bird gave a loud squawking sound before resorting to advanced aerobatics. Harry still clung on.

"THAT'S RIGHT YOU OVERSIZED CHICKEN! JUST DIE ALREADY!"

The bird managed to throw him off the back, but Harry got a grip on one of the wings. As the bird, now unbalanced, began falling to the side, he pulled himself back up and hit it in the head. hard. The bird lost conciousness.

"Ha." said Harry victoriously. "I have defeated the ancient beast of Raven-"

and then he hit the ground.
