As the title states I've done some surface level searching and couldn't find any above 10 chapters which annoys me.

Before someone says that i should right one i don't have the time (and because I'm no good at writing)

If you know any long ones (15 chapters or more) it would be most appreciated if you could share a link to it

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.
