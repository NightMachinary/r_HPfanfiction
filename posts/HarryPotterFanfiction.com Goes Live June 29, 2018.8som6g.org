Hi everyone!

This is Ronnie from Fanfiction Recommendations! I wanted to let you all know that we're officially bringing the site back online June 29, 2018 :)

Thanks so much for your many years of support for this site and we can't wait to continue building on that legacy!

*** We envision a future where Fanfiction can be accessed by all without the need for spammy ads ruining the experience. Don't worry, we took this on knowing full well the expenses we're incurring and are very capable of keeping the lights on for the foreseeable future :).

If you want to help support the site, we'd super appreciate you joining our email list, participating as writer or simply using the site to read! Thank you so much! -Ronnie

*** I think someone already made an archive (they're on reddit, it was another post like this) - right now we're cleaning up a lot of the old code/software and are building new features - I'll see what I can do but it probably won't be until August - Ronnie

I would recommend looking at our [[/r/hpfanfiction/wiki/index][wiki]] for a *lot* of good fic recommendations.

***** Will do! We're just now getting started on our HP rec list. All of this was sort of unexpected at first! We just didn't want to let the stories go away so we jumped on it and now we are playing catch up. Thanks for the support! -Ronnie

** Thank you for saving the site. It has some of my personal favourite stories on there. Definitely has some of the best next-gen stories in the fandom, which might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I love them.

*** We'd love to have you! While it will be live June 29, it won't be quite 100% functional, there's a ton of updates to do so we'll only have the view story + account management functionalities available at first. -Ronnie

** Thank you. This was the place I discovered HP fanfiction on. I hadn't visited the site in quite a while and was surprised at the face lift when I logged on today.

You should run ads on the site if it helps. And bring back the donations page too.

*** Thank you for the kind words! We're still working on improving the site and getting every functionality back online but we're making steady progress :).

We're super passionate about NEVER monetizing via ads on the site, we don't believe this gives people the best possible user experience, which is critically important to making fanfiction accessible to new people. Don't worry, we can keep the site online for the forseeable future :) We're committed to keeping these stories online! Its why we got involved in the first place! - Ronnie
