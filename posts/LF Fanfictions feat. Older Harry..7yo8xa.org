** Linkffn(3155057) is great. It has an incomplete sequel but the ending of the first can one make sense as a standalone.

I don't know what tone you like in fan fiction, but linkffn(circular reasoning) is well-written about a late-20s Harry who has been in open war fighting voldemort for like 10 years. He is at the least completely amoral and at worst insane, and it the most gruesome fanfic I have ever read.

Linkffn(11115934) is about master of death-Harry who is transported to middle-earth by Sauron. Not much overt magic in it, because Harry doesn't have a wand, but it's really freaking good. Starts off depressing but gets much lighter.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
