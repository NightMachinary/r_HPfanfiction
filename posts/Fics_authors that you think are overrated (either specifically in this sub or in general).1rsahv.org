Pretty much everytime someone mentions L/J, Life and Times by Jewels5 is touted as the end all and be all. Frankly, I think it's good, but it's certainly not the most well-written L/J fic and it falls into a lot of the common tropes. Again, I don't dislike it, but I don't understand why people think it's the best ever.

Methods of Rationality is another one, but I think a fair number of people on here don't really like it anyway.

I have no idea why Harry Crow is so popular, it's fucking awful. And it's far from being his worst fic.

*** Got to second this one. I have (guiltily) enjoyed some /robst/ fics before, but /Harry Crow/ is just... after the first 30 (!!) chapters or so, it just seemed to consist of nothing but an endlessly repetitious, stream-of-consciousness style mix of character bashing, crudely employed power fantasy tropes, and half-legible plot notes being read from a Denny's napkin, all typed up as fast as possible then uploaded.

After reading another 30 (!!) chapters, I couldn't take it any more and quit. It is now up to 80 (!?!) chapters and 553,332 words, and shows no signs of slowing down. I almost want to know what the hell is happening in it now, but not enough to start reading it again.

It's... it's like it is being written by a computer AI designed to make fanfics, but the computer doesn't /really/ understand dramatic tension, subtle humor, deep characterization, genuine human emotions, or plot pacing and design. It just knows to give some things glowing swords of power, have other things shit their pants, and that parents hate boyfriends and other such sitcom pablum.

If you want a Gringotts-raises-Harry fic, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] instead. Has its issues, but is much, much better.

If you quit early, you missed Ron being turned into a girl as punishment and against his will (!) to stop him from being a crazy rapist (?!), and the always oddly out of place weddings-ever-after ending. Dumbledore is also insane, and not in a fun or deep and interesting way.

My favorite part, I think, was how all the female characters were transported from scene to scene Hannibal-Lecter-style, unable to act or speak unless a man (Harry) asked them a question or told them to do something. It wasn't...good.

**** It's a little bit hard to pinpoint. But I'll use Grave Days as an example.

That one centers around funerals, but most of the characters seem to be almost back to normal. Harry wakes up on the first day after the battle, speaks to Kreacher, takes a bath, and speaks with McGonagall and Kingsley in very rational tones about the future of Hogwarts. We're told that Harry and the others are grieving, but this grief doesn't seem to affect their behavior or reactions to situations. Lines like “Can we talk [about the horcruxes] on the way to the tomb?” on the morning after the final battle strike me as very odd. People grieve in different ways, but most people show signs.

Rita Skeeter infiltrating a private party is very IC for her, but she recklessly insults everyone present, doesn't bother to even /fake/ remorse, and is apparently buddy-buddy with Umbridge. Wheras in the books, she's calculating and information-hungry, but rarely outright rude to anyone's face and certainly not evil or in league with the likes of Umbridge. Not to mention the astounding presence of mind that everyone (including Harry) displays throughout Rita situation and the confrontation at the grave that follows. Harry orders people into positions like an old pro, rather than an auror trainee who hasn't worked with the DA since fifth year.

It's really a matter of personal taste, I suppose. Harry's interactions with Ginny often don't "feel" right to me, especially in Hunters.

Strangers I do like, as a kind of guilty pleasure, but the premise of the story involves Harry/Ginny confiding in a random muggle neighbor and letting her be privy to private details of their life. Despite the fact that they have every reason to be private people, wouldn't want to go through the hassle of muggleproofing themselves and their home, and have a solid social circle already. They threw a housewarming party and invited all of their close friends and a bunch of muggle acquaintances, which forces their friends to put on a performance and fake their way through conversations. And it's apparently impossible for them to lie and pretend that Harry has some very boring job. Contrived premises are generally okay if everything from that point on makes sense. But Harry and Ginny (and other characters) continue to make decisions regarding Jacqui that don't really make sense.

Jeconais - for an author so influential early in the early fandom, his later work is strikingly mediocre.

Rorschach's Blot - some of his ideas are genius, but much of the time his writing comes off as sparse, more like a plot outline than actual prose writing.

To put this into perspective, the fic's author finished the fic-version of year 6 shortly before Order of the Phoenix (canon year 5) came out. This was one of the pioneer big-fics of the Harry Potter fandom.

So in terms of quality, it doesn't compare too well with some other fics that have come out in the past 10 years. But it was very early. Some of the things which are now tropes of the fandom were new and innovative when Psychic Serpent introduced them.

** The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville and Rannaro's Snape Chronicles.

It's like some fanfic authors don't understand that you /don't/ need to villify the other characters just to make your favourite characters look better. The chapter where Arsinoe's little self-insert has a little get together with Snape and the Malfoys to wax lyrical about how /terrible/ Harry and his friends are was just embarassing.

And the whitewashing. Ye gods, poor misunderstood Snape the Potions Master who never did anything but make potions for the Dark Lord. Vicious, malicious Marauders, shallow Lily Evans and well-intentioned Malfoys who "really just made a terrible mistake, oh dear us, we wouldn't have done it if we had /known/".

It's like they spent too much time looking at Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs and forgot that Snape and the Malfoys were both petty, vindictive bullies who /earned/ their Dark Marks and moved in social circles that thought it was funny to torture Muggles. God only knows what they thought Snape used Sectumsempra for, they probably believe he used it to dice vegetables or something. It wouldn't bother me if they thought they were writing AU fics or alternate character interpretations, but they seem to be under the impression that their fics are fully compatible with the books.

  First of all, wow people in this sub are anti-slash huh? Let the downvotes rain! So much for to each their own right?
#+end_quote

I think the problem is (or one problem is) that most people here like HP canon. Really, really like it. Like, /serious business/ like it.

Another could be, a lot of people who read fanfic nowadays really hate shitty slash fanfic. Really, really hate it. Like, /jihad/ hate it.

Main character slash is not even /vaguely/ canon supported (no love for you, Dumbles, sorry) and most experienced readers have seen *mountains* of /eye scarringly bad/ slash fanfic (because there is so much of it). Compare that to the amount of, say, canon-sexuality (if tortuously plotted) Soul Bond drek and you start to see the issue with the sheer quantity of bad experiences to be had. Gut reactions come into play.

More context. HP slash is, essentially, kink pandering. I've got nothing against it myself, and it is one a *huge* number of readers share, but it isn't main stream (though it might be the most numerous).

It is also a black sheep in a lot of circles. A lot of people are embarrassed to talk about reading fanfic because people /assume/ they are drooling over poorly written Harry/Draco slash done by horny 13 year old girls. They don't like that assumption, especially when they consider their interests more literary in nature. Bringing up slash means bringing up porn fics. No way around it.

So people react negatively to even the suggestion that someone thinks /not/ reading slash is unusual, unless it is handled carefully. When people start throwing around slash-specific or centric terminology, it gets worse. That's strike two.

Finally, that original post started, middled, and ended with what could easily be seen as a "/HA, HET FICS, AM I RIGHT?/" type of comment. Which isn't going to get the good 'ole boys/girls (of HP) on your side, know what I mean? Strike three.

I know, fuck you for not reading fics you don't like, in a totally different genre, with the regularity of a banker with the Financial Times, then expressing your casual opinion in a public forum, right?

Still, that is the context as I see it. Doesn't mean you have to bow and scrape. Maybe if you'd said instead something like:

#+begin_quote
  "So, I like penises in my HP fanfic. But I keep it classy and high-brow, little fingers raised, wot? So I've never read these before as mostly I read X het pairing fics. Also, some newer fics being mentioned here, so TIL, I guess. /Also/, fuck MOR and the horse it rode in on. Etc."

It's less important to me that a character wind up with someone, and more important that things are internally consistent and fairly logical, so that I can maintain suspension of disbelief. That said, anything is preferable that doesn't just throw out background. For example, in any Snape/Harry pairing, there's a ton of misplaced animosity towards Harry on Snape's part, and Harry's certainly not a fan of the older man either. Any fic that ignores that, or uses the fine line between love and hate to shelve that anger without dealing with it isn't something I'm interested in reading.
