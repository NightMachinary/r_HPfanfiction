It was a one shot. The fate sisters trick harry into becoming death or master of death. Harry agrees to be death but only for a certain time. So he gets extremely pissed when fate tries to trick him again. I don't remember what she tries but I think there is something about another prophecy. So in short harry becomes extremely angry and fate becomes scared and starts crying.
