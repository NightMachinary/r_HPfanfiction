The Master hear no Word.

The Master see no Flesh.

The Master speak no Tongue.

For the Master ferries the Dead, the Fallen and the Lost

The Master came from the living, to the Great River, to grant his Fallen Friends their Safe Passage. And so He lost his Ears, His sight and his Tongue so that those who are now Dead may See the Path, Speak the Tongue and Hear the Song.

The Master is the Ferryman. He is the Guide and the Guardian. And now he Ferries his last descendant to the other side. Now he Guides a Warrior, honored and remembered, to his rest. Now he Guards Harry James Potter.


** Had this idea stuck in my head and it just kept mutating - started out as your usual MOD prompt and then just... evolved into this little piece and I kinda sorta love it. The idea for the ferryman is stolen from Greek and Roman mythology (almost the same thing, minor differences aside from names) but the eyes/ears/tongue thing? No idea where that part came from but it's there for better or for worse. Possibly partly from Norse mythology with Odin sacrificing his eye and Tyr (unwillingly) sacrificing his hand.
