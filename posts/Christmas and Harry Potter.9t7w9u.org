** Why would they not?

They had centuries of living openly among Muggle society before the statute of secrecy come into effect, so it's not as though they have no history with the various faiths Muggles practice. The Fat Friar took religious vows!

***** Because there was a systematic persecution against anyone perceived to practice magic. In the early middle ages, magic was dismissed as folklore. There was even an Imperial Bull dismissing any charges of magic. But at around 1400, the witch hunts began and claimed over 50000 lifes. And that's just Christianity. Islam did its share of persecuting and [[https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3152/what-s-up-with-penis-stealing-sorcerers-in-africa/][witchcraft is still a crime in modern day Africa]].

Funnily enough, given the remote nature of magical settlements outside of London, it would be pretty feasible that many magicals still were pagan by the time Christianity turned on them. Paganism, on a local level, was around until the 19th century, even when people publicly paid lip service to Christian beliefs.

****** Proof on your last point?

Britain was majority Christian before even the founders. By the 1400 it was catholic, period. There may have been old pagan traditions mixed in, but it was still catholic.

Wizards didn't split off until the late 1600s, so they would have been Christian when mingling with muggles... And it's seriously rare for a group of people to 'pay lipservice' to a religion for more than a thousand years. Kids would be brought up in the Christian culture.

The middle east would be way more religiously diverse if this was the case. The only areas not Muslim tend to be in far distant communities with limited contact. A lot less than wizards had before the SOS

************ Ok, I can't exactly talk about the C. of E. since I was raised Catholic, though I'm no longer a part of it, but it feels to me as if you're missing a few important things about christian doctrine.

The acts of the Apostles are letters written to the other nascent christian communities, and while they are in the New Testament, they aren't exactly related to Jesus himself.

Luke 10:25-28

#+begin_quote
  25 And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"

  26 What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?" 27 He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.' And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.' " 28 "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".
#+end_quote

That's it. That's all you need to know/practice. Everything else. /Everything else/, is historical context.

The bible is *not* to be taken literally. Doing so, is missing the whole point of it.

*Back to the original topic*, while there's probably a part of Wizardkind that wouldn't be too happy about christianity, saying that /all/ of them would be against it is ignoring human nature itself.

Remember what the Catholic church did in South America. They conquered most of it, and yet, South America has the highest amount of Catholics in the world.

You'd think that they would reject it, or that they would cling to their ancestral rites, and the truth is that there is a lot of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqetCK3ra2U][Ancestral faith mixed up with Catholic faith.]] (They are supposed to be demons surrendering themselves to God)

But the difference is that Spain conquered these areas and there was no way a muggle nation could subjugate wizards since the Imperious curse (or similar spells), instantaneous translocation and offensive magic exist.

Also, the Holy Sea had way more power over Europe than it had over the Spanish Main. The pope, at some point, banned slavery and yet no one there cared. In comparison, the pope had a say over every monarchy in Europe (until the Hussites) and was a kingmaker. The whole point of the CoE was that Henry could get a divorce. Lithuania only became Catholic to avoid another Northern Crusade. That's how powerful the Pope was. As the investiture dispute showed, he had the power to push whole kingdoms around.

**** That, I have to point out, is 'everyone knows' history and complete balls.

The first thing you're getting wrong is the dates: the witch panics don't start until 1450 or thereabouts: there isn't any serious preaching against even peasant superstitions until the 1430s.

The next thing you're getting wrong is in treating late medieval and early modern christianity as monolithic, when it massively, gigantically, fighting-actual-major-wars-over-it /wasn't/. Unreformed Roman Catholic christianity came to witch-hunting much, much later than their Protestant counterparts, and with nothing like the same enthusiasm. The Inquisition could and did defrock priests for witch-hunting - the author of the /Malleus Maleficarum/ being the most famous example from the late 15th century - and regarded most accusations of sorcery as fraudulent and not worth their time. They only proceeded against such sorcerers as they /did/ investigate if there was an accusation of heresy or devil-worship into the bargain.

Which leads to the next error: that the organised, religious persecutions were of witches. They weren't. The clergy were after heretics and devil-worshippers, not sorcerors, and it wasn't until the late 15th century and the /Malleus Maleficarum/ that you start to see the practise of magic equated with heresy and devil-worship. The Catholic church thought that that was bollocks and defrocked the author, the protestant churches took the idea - and the book - and ran with it, especially in Scotland, where King James VI was a huge fan of the /Malleus Maleficarum/ (and a complete lunatic who shouldn't have been in charge of a whelk stall, never mind a nation). It's why they started burning witches, since burning was the punishment for heresy. Heresy, in protestant areas, included "still being catholic," which could and did get you also accused of devil-worship, since Pope=Antichrist was a popular meme at the time.

The final point is the killer, though: the idea that witch-hunting was official and constant. It wasn't: it was nearly all kangaroo courts, lynchmobs, and during wartime. The Salem and Pendle cases stand out precisely because they were peacetime affairs with properly constituted trials (and in the case of the Pendle trials, only went ahead with /massive/ procedural irregularities, the prosecution's chief witness being nine years old, and this /was/ very much criticised at the time). Much of the witch-hunting in England - nearly a third of the killings from 1450-1750 were done in the space of three years - was done by one man, who had no official sanction and charged swingeing fees for his services, and got away with it because there was a civil war going on at the time. And the actual official authorities - apart from the few who were lending colour of law to the improperly-constituted Manningtree trial - publicly condemned him as a fraud.

Bluntly, so long as you were publicly orthodox, stayed within areas controlled by the Catholic Church or the Church of England (which never strayed a long way from its Catholic roots) and war didn't break out, you could be a witch and a christian without suffering in the least for it. Over the period we're talking about, Germany would have been the riskiest place to be magical, since the local 'default religion' could change overnight with a change of ruler and the longest and worst wars were fought there. France and England would have been dangerous only during their civil wars (in the case of England, only for three years in two counties, and France was the first nation in Europe to outlaw witch-trials altogether, in the 1680s). Italy and Spain, it was /way/ more dangerous to be Jewish in those parts than to be magical

***** The first execution of a witch was in the late 14th century, before that it was considered folklore. Also Jean de Arc was before 1450 and she was burned as a witch.

And obviously they were never dangerous towards anyone with a wand, but the mere fact that they did not stamp down on witch hunts would be reason enough to take offence. I mean, if someone started executing Frenchmen for being British, that won't go over well in the UK despite the fact that no Subject of the Queen dies. Lastly, which is my main point, Christian beliefs have no appeal to people who go through Hogwarts. Water to wine? Probably part of the transfiguration OWL. Heal the sick? Pomfrey isn't God's daughter either? Raise the dead? DADA sixth year. Burning Bush? Flitwick can do that.

Heretic and cross-dresser, not a witch - and they didn't manage to prove the heresy charges (for all she was illiterate she could apparently bandy theology with the best of them), but executed her anyway after giving her a choice of cross-dressing or public nudity.

And that was a kangaroo court into the bargain: the english were basically setting up the execution of a prisoner of war so as to cause maximum embarrassment to their enemies. It was the Inquisition that called them out on it, declaring Joan a martyr and the judge a heretic.

(The myth that she was tried for witchcraft comes from the fact that she was burned at the stake, and Everyone Knows they burned witches. They didn't: burning was the penalty for heresy, not witchcraft, in Joan's time. They didn't even /start/ conflating magic with diabolism and heresy until much later.)

As for your miracles point, it's completely irrelevant. The only miracle that's actually relevant to christian doctrine - regardless of sect, it's in the Nicene Creed - is the resurrection. And /that/ is the one that magic can't do at all. Blasphemous mockeries, like inferi and horcruxes, but not the real deal.

** No reason for them not to be christian, the witch-persecutions weren't anywhere near universal among european christianity. They peaked during wartime, and were always skewed /heavily/ to protestant communities. The Roman and Celtic churches both had extensive folklore of bishops and saints performing feats of magic and the Inquisition came to witch-hunting centuries later than their protestant counterparts - the author of /Malleus Maleficarum/ actually got kicked out of the catholic church for witch-hunting. So it's entirely plausible that a large proportion of magicals are catholic or, in England, C of E and Christmas comes with that.

  Christmas is also considered a very romantic holiday, and lovers are supposed to spend the evening together doing suitably romantic things. It is seen as really crucial for single women in Japan to have someone to spend Christmas Eve with; it is also really important where they spend Christmas Eve and what present they receive. The whole evening must be very special, gorgeous and romantic.

  Japanese women who have a boyfriend tend to show off, so women who don't are not happy to talk about the topic. In this respect, Christmas Eve in Japan is very much like Valentine's Day in the west (right down to the miserable singles who don't want to celebrate). Perhaps for this reason, staple Christmas songs in Japan include "Christmas Eve" by Tatsurō Yamashita and "Last Christmas" by WHAM!, which both speak to heartbreak and loneliness on Christmas.
