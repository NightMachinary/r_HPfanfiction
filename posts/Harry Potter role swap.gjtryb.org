None of the main cast can have the same roles So Dumbledore can't be the headmaster. Voldemort can't be the dark lord. Harry can't be the boy who lived Ron and Hermione can't be the best friends to the chosen one. The personalities don't have to be the same. So the potions master doesn't have to still be bitter about the chosen ones father but he/she does still have to be have a complicated past with said father. Same role but not same person which can change what they do in the story.

so main cast to change

golden trio all rival characters all hogwarts staff all members of order all marauders all death eaters + their leader all love intererests all members of protags best friend's fam ( cant be the weaselys) anyone else you can think of to swap roles of

the chosen one/boy/girl who lived cant be Neville or Hermione just because ive seen alot of that.

So who would you make the new cast?


** Headmaster Tom Riddle, power hungry and cruel but unwilling to ever leave Hogwarts. Head of the resistance.

Dark Lord Myrtle Warren, finally getting revenge on a world that tormented her, using a front of absolute justice and cleansing from crime. Kira style.

Chosen One Luna Lovegood, whose mother experimented with protective magic that untimely saved her life when a prophecy predicted the Dark Lord's downfall at Luna's hands.

Reluctant prophet and divination teacher Severus Snape.

The Marauders as followers of Dark Lord Myrtle, with Sirius dying for the cause, James taking a Malfoy like role, and Peter getting imprisoned. Harry get's Draco's role and Lily Narcissa's.

Remus Lupin as the ex-dark lord following potion master who's trying to make up for his past deeds but has a cold relationship with Luna due to her role in Sirius's death and Peter's incarceration.

Trelawney the falsely imprisoned godmother.

Fudge the gryffindor head of house and astronomy teacher, Hagrid the Slytherin head and herbology teacher, Lockhart head of Ravenclaw and charms teacher, Hufflepuff head and transfiguration teacher Amelia Bones.

*** Reluctant prophet Severus Snape had me gasping for breath üòÇ I imagine Snape being his usual dour and moody self after a vision. Going on rants at the first class of the year for 3rd years about ‚Äúthe true art of divination‚Äù and how ‚Äúcomplete dunderheads can't possibly understand the complicated balance of a real Prophecy and a self fulfilling one, and why would they even try when luckily only one or two would prove to have the capacity to OPEN THIR THIRD EYE!‚Äù He also predict not one but all of his students deaths, several times, often he is the one doing the deed. Luna just thinks he is frustrated with the fact that Hermione Granger is a natural at divination while barely applying herself at all.
