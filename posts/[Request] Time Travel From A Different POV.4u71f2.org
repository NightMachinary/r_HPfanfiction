I was wondering if any time travel fics, that are any good, are written entirely from the perspective of a person or people in the time being travelled to. Like Tom Riddle is going about his business when some random chick shows up out of nowhere and is dressed weird and knows to much, so he tries to investigate.


** The only one that really comes to mind is linkffn(4180686) but that's more dimension traveling than time traveling...

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

** Oh, a comment here reminded me. linkao3(A Good Teacher by Nia_River) is a great fic, great writing. Goes from when Harry's eight years old to when Harry's about to enter Hogwarts, he's taught and influenced by his older self. This is a standalone fic, but could also be viewed as the beginning of a longer story that isn't written yet, so only proceed if you're okay with that. I personally feel it's pretty great as is, the length is pretty satisfying, but I certainly wouldn't object to a continuation if the author does want to do one.

  The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop.Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!
