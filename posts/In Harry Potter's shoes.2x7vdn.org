I am writing my first fanfiction with the following plot: "A Harry Potter fan finds himself sent in Harry Potter's world, more precisely in Harry Potter's 10 years old body. It's always easy to criticize choices made by characters but what will/can he do with his knowledge?"

I have written three (short) chapters so far and I'd be interested in some constructive criticism of it while it's fresh, before I continue further.

You can read it here: [[http://ihps.glrd.fr]] Or here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11026524/2/In-Harry-Potter-s-shoes]]


** Just looking at the premise, I have a few thoughts. SIs are fine, and replacing an existing character is fine. The major cliche you need to watch for is turning you/Harry into a Gary Stu - that is, a perfect character who does everything right. Gary Stu stories are boring, because there is no real conflict. Make sure you don't have your character "fix" everything in Harry's life with only minimal trouble. Have him fail at things, both minor and major, or forget about important points, or have others react in ways he wasn't expecting and can't handle. Keep it interesting.

Powerful!Harry is another cliche you may want to watch out for. Is your character going to be able to easily do any spell you've read about in the books? Or is he going to use magic in ways no wizard has thought of using ever and revolutionise wizarding society? (For example, many authors use oaths and secrecy spells excessively, or make veritaserum infallible.) That's not to say it's always a bad thing, especially since your SI is Harry Potter - he has the "power he knows not" after all. /A Black Comedy/ did this very well, making the power he knows not a ridiculously awesome combo of summoning and banishing charms that were so precise they were basically extra magical arms.

And you may want to watch out for other cliches that involve young Harry, like suddenly helpful goblins (because Harry had /manners/!) or children not acting like children (specifically Hermione in this case - Harry is you now, so he isn't a child).

It's nearly impossible to cover all the cliches, but there is a Harry Potter fan fiction page on TVTropes you may want to check out.

On to your actual fic:

You have a poor grasp of grammar which, paired with your habit of complex sentences, makes for an almost unreadable story. Your main problem is run on sentences, both in your dialogue and in your prose. There are also instances of subject-verb agreement, incorrect pronoun usage, and sometimes just...weed sentences that don't make any sense as written.

When I have to stop and reread a sentence two or three times, it breaks immersion. When almost every sentence is that bad, there is no immersion to break. It is frustrating to read. (EDIT: The second and third chapters weren't as bad, but the dialogue was still just a bunch of run on sentences.)

Plot wise, you nicely evaded cliches about goblins, and so far have given yourself plenty of trouble, so that's very good.

My only plot related complaint is this: as a reader, I have a very hard time swallowing that Mrs. Figg and Dumbledore bought Harry's story about Diagon Alley. Unless you intend for Dumbledore to be suspicious of Harry because of his story, I think he needs a better lie.

*** About the clichés, I have already thought about the ones you described and I'm planning on not falling for them.

About the story, I didn't have beta work for the two first chapters. Some people gave me advices but there was no complains even if I asked for it. That's pretty much why I posted here, to have people I don't know tell me what is wrong without restraint. I'll go over the first chapters and try to cut some sentences, I always made too long sentences and I don't think about it enough.

Writing this fic in English is a challenge for me because I'm French and I've never lived in an English-speaking country or practised a lot outside of school. Therefore there must have some grammar mistakes I don't catch. If you want to, don't hesitate to tell me what sentences shocked you so I'll be able to change them.

Thanks for your comment anyway. :)

Edit: I've reread and fixed some things in the Prelude and first chapter, those changes are only on the website and not on fanfiction.net

**** Ah, it makes sense if English is your second language. An English native speaker would be a perfect bet for you :)

***** Yeah, I have an English native speaker as a beta now but that will be for the future chapters. If you can tell me the sentences who are wrong in the first two it would be nice. :)

** You write like a French person.

... With elegance, grace and subtle degrees which grip the reader by the shackles of their very being!

*** I have read tutorials like this one, I guess I should go over my dialogues again to fix them anew. Do you know if there's a list of J. K. Rowling style attributions?

** SI are definitely a good way to get writing practice and get a lot of bad cliches and poor editing skills out of your system before moving on to better plots. Stick it out, finish it the way you want it finished, and then see if you can write some truly original work. Look at the Teachers Lounge community for plot bunnies and also the HPFFChallenges community threads. Make sure your outlining your plot so you don't write yourself into a corner or forget what's happening.

*** Yeah sure, but I think I need some people to point me what is wrong or cliché so I can correct it in the future.
