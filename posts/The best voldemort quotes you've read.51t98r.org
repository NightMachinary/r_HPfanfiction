From /Lord of the Marauders/, my favorite crackfic. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6813897/1/Lord-of-the-Marauders]])

"/Welcome to Hell. CRUCIO! I am Lord Voldemort, King of this world, and Master of Death. This is your worst fucking nightmare./"


** "Free elves just lie down and die. They don´t eat or sleep... I´d seen it happen once, and, let me tell you, it was hilarious"

From the Seventh Horcrux, amazing quote xD

** "Evaporate!"

I mean, English was pretty clearly not the author's first language, even if the fic was well written with good grammar. There was a lot of "almost but not quite right" words in the fic. This one stood out because it took me a good couple minutes of ????? before I realized that the author probably wanted "elaborate" rather than "evaporate."

It still makes me laugh to think of Voldemort commanding someone to turn into vapor. (Sadly, I do not remember which fic this was.)

**** No, I don't, sorry. I still periodically think about this quote, and I laugh, but I can't even remember what the story was about. It was on FFN, probably tagged with Harry Potter and Voldemort. Which doesn't narrow it down at all, I know. I thiiiiiink it was slash.

It's probably not that good anyway. I mostly remember being glad to read something whose writer knew how grammar and punctuation worked, which means that I was probably way, way deep into the tags at that point and I will likely never come across it again.

** I must say *Seventh Hocrux* has by far the most memorable quotes, not just from Voldemort/Harrymort.

/I have a great distaste for most forms of torture. My only exception to this is Crucio, which is much cleaner and does not have as many long-lasting side effects. Well, unless the victims are driven insane. I rarely kept prisoners long enough to reach that point, however, and opted to kill as often as possible. Further, I sought to never leave a child orphaned for more than a few minutes./

  Book 2. As the Second War begins, Voldemort becomes obsessed with harnessing the realm of Old Magic to his own ends. Meanwhile, Harry has to contend with the Ministry, ancient foes and the machinations of a world he barely understands.

** "I am the alpha, the omega, the darkness the light creates. Without me, your world would be the poorer for it. But you, like so many others, create light and too much light, well that kills that which need grow in the dark. Avada Kedavra." Dumbledore fell as the children screamed save a terrified Harry.

"Fear not," he said, turning to Harry. "You will be with me for a very long time. Place him in the guest suite, send him anything he wants, desires, needs, or just muses about. Those who harm him will die only after all they love die first."

From my own stuff but Voldemort in A Black Comedy was amusing when complaining about That Fucker.

******** Heh. Yeah, while mine wouldn't be a harem story, it would have had elements of that. Harry decides that if riddle says don't fuck with what my horcrux wants, then he'll try to protect muggleborns, half-bloods, and blood-traitors by 'claiming' them though he wouldn't 'follow through' on that. Wouldn't stop some of the girls from sttempting to do the same though. That's the main reason i took it down after posting the original chapter, i realized it was going to be more harem than character study and that made me want to slit my wrists.
