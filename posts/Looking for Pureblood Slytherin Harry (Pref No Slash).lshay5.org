Hey i'm looking Fanfics where Harry is a Pureblood and are A Slytherin/ Sorted into Slytherin preferably some length atleast 20+ Chapters, And i prefer no Slash, He must also use Dark Arts and not support the Order Of The Flaming Chicken or the other fools that are on the light side, He must also hate muggles atleast but if he hates muggles, Mudbloods and believe in Pureblood Superiority it's a plus.

  The Order of the Flaming Chicken

I believe it's /fried/ chicken.

Sorry, can't actually help you find such a story, though. I find canon's "Slytherin=Evil" depiction to be disappointing and unsatisfying, so I haven't looked for fics like that.
