Admittedly i haven't reread this one in a long, long time but i'm hopeful it stands up still.


** I'm enjoying the Red Knight so far linkffn(12141684). It's still relatively early but it's been updating pretty regularly. The first couple chapters are weird but it's got some interesting ideas I'm looking forward to seeing how they go.

Hoping to do better this time around, he slowly realizes this new world was not the one he lived before. Things were different. And more dangerous. AU

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

#+begin_quote
  Discussion regarding fanfiction tropes produced the observation that in one subset of Harry Potter fanfiction, "Harry/Draco slash" [HDS], Harry has a short, thick dick, while Draco's penis is long and thin. We tested the hypothesis that there was a consistent difference in how these two characters' genitalia were described. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that slash fiction authors in this subset of fandom did not place equal emphasis on the description of testicles as compared with penii. We surveyed 100 HDS stories in online fanfiction archives and collected data on sexual description and content. Here we present the first quantitative test of fanon stereotypes and show that these explicitly sexual stories contain low levels of visual/sensory genital descriptions. Qualitative comparisons demonstrate trends in support of both hypotheses, although sample sizes prevent statistical significance. We use these findings to discuss how fanon may develop despite the incorrect assumption of perceived ubiquity.

** This one was sadly unfinished, and I believe abandoned, but this was one of my favorite Next Generation fics.

Albus, Rose and a few of the other kids use an advanced Pensieve to show Harry, Ron and Hermione that despite his many faults, Scorpius Malfoy is not his father and is trying to change for the better.

Which is a femHarry who goes back in time to fix things. It does at least have a VERY original point of departure for changing the timeline. And a romance with essentially an OC with a canon name - but probably not one anyone would think of.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

*** It could be. It's just occasionally I want to see what people love that never come up since they don't match what others are looking for. Maybe when I upload chapters(the sixth of the month), I'll also do this(starting in november).

** I'm halfway through this Stargate/HP crossover and I've spent the majority of the time trying not to cry. It's so good(admittedly, still first read, on reread it could be terrible).

*** I'm not a fan of SG1 and find that even in a crossover I can't tolarate it much, but I can vouch for esama's writing. I haven't read this particular fic because of personal preference, but the author is really good.

**** NO sg1 in this story(so far) just harry and friends "trapped" on a world that SG1 would later visit in SG canon, they've arrived years before. I'd class it more as a Tok'Ra/HP crossover.

***** I love [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849954][Undone Wars]] and think [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3479477][Legal Alien]] is pretty good too. Both have Harry/Male romance, but nothing even slightly explicit. Undone wars was what started my love affair with survival Harry fics.

  Going to high school maybe wasn't a good idea, but at least the Air Force got him an apartment from a good neighbourhood and with interesting neighbours.
