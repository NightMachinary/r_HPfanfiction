A thought popped into my head about a fem Harry latching onto Percy after his continued advice , due to him being a prefect, and in turn her starts treating her how he would treat Ginny, looking out for her and making sure they are ok and just being supportive .

But unlike Ginny , the fem Harry likes his help and starts to see him as a big brother and she as a little sister . So there would be a lot more interaction with Percy and it would change how the next 5-6 years went for Harry /fem Harry .

I can imagine a emotional scene at the end of year one with Percy apologizing for not believing Harry earlier about the stone and she crys while wrapping him in a hug, year 2 him apologizing to both Harry and Ginny for not being there for them when they needed him, year 3 him staying back so she wouldn't be alone on the hogsmead weekend and her trying to ditch him to sneak into the village. Year 4 he dances with her at the ball after her date is awful , years five secretly supporting her while publicly denouncing her.

I don't want a romantic thing between them, just some wholesome older brother younger sister dynamics


** I think Percy would like that. Something different then his family. I'd be more interested in cannon Harry bevause a female version seems to close to ginny for my tastes. I could imagine it being very sweet though.

*** Thanks , I think my thought was more of the fact that I see Percy as the black sheep, idk about his older brothers but the twins and ron don't look up to him , the twins even make fun of him, and Ginny always felt very independent and not wanting help from her brothers, but I imagine a scared fem Harry latching onto an older brother figure and him enjoys the responsibility and trust that comes with it. Male Harry would also be more inclined to be friends with Ron because they live together for most of the year , but fem Harry would still be friends with him just not as close , which I think would make a closer bond with Percy , but that's just my opinion

**** I think you've got some great points, esp in the way Percy would respond to a young girl, rather than the boy which he'd 100% think of differently. it's something I'll definitely try to remember in the fem Harry stories I'm working on

** Not 100% exactly what you're looking for, but “Percy Weasley and the Prefect Job Isn't a Vanity Role” is an absolute gem that has Percy as supportive, mentor figure to Harry and his year.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** Not fem!Harry, but linkao3(Project Management for Beginners) has Percy acting as an older brother to Harry, to the point where Percy tells him he can explicitly think of Percy as his brother.

** He's a bit of a momma bear in my fic linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18335585/chapters/43406147]]) though it's really minor because I have too many plates spinning to fully cover it on top of everything else

I feel like I've read one recently that has him being this role like you're describing, but maybe that wishful thinking...I'll think on it

  Albus Dumbledore's hiring habits leave a lot to be desired. Even if the choice of teachers weren't questionable, the methods are. Who would expect a headmaster to use blackmail quite so masterfully to keep his staff quiet about his regular bouts of negligence and ideas that put his students at risk?Thankfully there is one professor who has the heart and the means to help.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should. (This story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.)
