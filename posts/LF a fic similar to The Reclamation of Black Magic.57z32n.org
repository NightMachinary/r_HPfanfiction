** linkffn(6518287) Growing Up Black is similar, if I recall correctly, though unfinished.

linkffn(8895954) HP and the Deus Ex Machina has a strong Black family presence towards the end.

linkffn(11488906) Potter vs Paradox has a female Harry travelling back in time and becoming the heir to the Black family.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.

** linkao3(4393256) /Harry's Cousins/ has the Malfoys adopting Harry; it's a WIP but the first arc is finished so it's relatively satisfying for still being incomplete. They don't turn over a new leaf right away, but Lucius & Narcissa's inner struggles are well written. And it's one of the best depictions of a chatterbox child (OMG Draco, just be quiet, love!) I've ever seen.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry who was adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse.

It's not very long yet, but it upadates weekly and it's supposed to be at least 700k words long.
