i am looking for fanfics in the Harry potter world but all the characters are pokemon, I have not found any because my luck is trash so i hope that people of the internet help me pls ( i would also like to find some fanfiction were the main charater has nothing to do with the main cast of hp and just sets of own their own adventure and expirences )


** On the pokemon part, not sure about written fics but I made this footprint if someone wants to give it a go.

** I recall reading one where Harry was a Pickachu and Voldemort was Mewton and his Death Eaters were Team Rocket.
