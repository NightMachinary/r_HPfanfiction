:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I previously posted a What's that Fic? post 2mo ago, and have yet to find the fic in question. I figured I'll try again in finding the fic.

The main key points where this: (note number 4 is what I mention in the title, since that a main point I recall that I am sure about)

~~~~~~

1. Most likely a time travel fic. Or maybe dimension travel fic. Though maybe I am mis remembering...

2. One scene includes Harry talking to Sirius and/or Remus in what I believe was the room of requirement, and likely about how Harry was dealing with things. Pretty sure it was partly a ploy on Sirius and/or Remus part to stop and/or slow down Harry from doing something dangerous and/or stupid.

3. During final battle on hogwarts grounds, the various creatures were on different side. Ex. the trolls on Voldies, and I'm assuming the spiders/centaurs on Team Hogwarts.

4. Dudley was in the hospital wing for some reason during the final battle. He and co. (those stuck in the hospital for whatever reason) decide to help in the battle efforts by throwing objects out the tower to bombard the enemy. I'm pretty sure a sentence or two includes throwing a bed at a troll...

5. When Harry defeats Voldie, he disappears, making everyone think he died. (Im pretty sure whatever Harry did was why Sirius and/or Remus confronted him in the room of requirement). However he actually gets, I'm guessed, portkeyed/teleported to the vampires where he remains to heal. Sirius and Remus didn't know about this part. When Harry isnfully healed, Harry meets Sirius and Remus in the Leaky Couldron in disguise to inform them he's alive. EDIT: pretty sure Harry adopts a new name so that "Harry Potter" stays dead.

6. Was on fanfiction.net, along with an unfinished sequel (likely only had a handful of chapters, maybe not even 2 chapters). The sequel, based on what I recall, was support to be slash between Harry and a vampire.
