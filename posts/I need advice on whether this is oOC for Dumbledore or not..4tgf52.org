So, I want to do a Ghostbusters/Harry Potter crossover, wherein the Ghostbusters are wizards trying to understand how ghosts work, what they're made of, etc. The proton packs would mainly be made for the of stopping Dementors and severing the power from Inferi. The original team would be former students, now adults, with Ray as a professor at Hogwarts, and I'd also have the Extreme team as students (haven't decided if or how to work in the 2016 team yet)

Now, the question for you guys is, would it be OOC for Dumbledore to limit and restrict Ray and the others' research, not because he doesn't want to know about these things, but because the more conservative forces don't like people thinking too hard about ghosts (not because of conspiracy, just an attitude of who cares, leave well enough alone) and they /really/ don't like the idea something that can hurt Dementors, and Dumbledore doesn't want to unnecessarily alienate the Ministry when he has to work towards getting them on his side for Voldemort.


** I doubt Dumbledore would interfere with their research as long as the Hogwarts ghosts weren't affected. He has no love for Dementors and couldn't give a care what the Ministry wants. He'll disavow any sense of responsibility for their plans as it has nothing to do with breaking Hogwarts rules, and would probably stand right next to them, chuckling as the Minister whinged about losing the cheap labour of having Dementors as prison guards.

If Dumbledore was the restrictive sort for the sake of political leverage, he would have shut down the twins' prank research well before they started product testing. He is not, and gets great delight in seeing his students invent, develop or create something he hadn't considered before.

So yeah- completely out of character.

*** Well, it'd be less restrictng so much as not aiding, and not letting Ray teach a class solely on ghosts. He'd come around after an incident with the Dementors in book 3. But I see what you're saying, I'm dumb, sorry.

**** I wouldn't call it dumb. So much of the confusion over Dumbledore's character is that he's been twisted beyond recognition the most by fanfiction (films included). Asking for another perspective was really the smart play.

** Death's relationship to magic is one of the things I think Dumbledore understands extremely well, he'd probably be very supportive of their research so long as the ghosts souls/spirits were not destroyed.

And I definitely think he'd be supportive of anything that would stop Dementors 'cause he hates those things. Not sure if your fic is set during the war, but I don't think he cares about alienating the Ministry in peacetime, but possibly in wartime he'd prefer not to risk losing the Ministry's cooperation.

If you need Dumbledore as a foe, I think an in-character way to get him to disapprove of the research is if they inadvertenly find a way to destroy souls, something akin to Horcruxes, and I think Dumbledore would be justifiably wary of that sort of thing.

** I think Dumbledore is oOC the moment he discourages research. He is a researcher himself and a teacher to boot. He comments on interesting magic throughout the books and delights in seeing his students invent and further their knowledge.

A scene with him dancing a jig in celebration of the dementors demise is also completely within character. On several occasions he comments on the sheer wrongness of their existence.

I can see some ministry dudes being miffed about something that could cause Azkaban to fail them. If these wizards are close to Harry, I could even see them be persecuted by Umbridge and painted as scapegoats after the breakout from Azkaban.

As to what Ray could get away with in his Defense class... don't worry too much. It can't be worse than Lockhart.

*** Okay, thank you for the advice. The intention was never for Dumbledore to oppose them so much as to not aid, wanting Ray to focus on teaching rather than research, but I see what you're saying and I thank you for the advice.
