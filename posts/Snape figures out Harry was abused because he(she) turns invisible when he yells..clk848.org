I think this was a female Harry story. But basically in potions, Snape starts yelling at Harry during the brewing and she goes completely invisible due to accidental magic. This form of accidental magic is common in abused kids as a way to get their guardians to leave them alone.


** Yeah i have read that before I don't think it was female Harry though. And in it said it was because they almost became a obsurical????

  It was only later, in the privacy of the room she had rented at the Leaky Cauldron, that Harri was finally alone. She removed the ribbon Mr. Ollivander had wrapped around her wrist to see the words that should have appeared once her wand bonded. The words 'Avada Kedavra' glared at her in emerald green. Harri's heart dropped. Fem!Harry SoulmateAU
