Any fanfics with the Potter family as a main focus.... As in the potters are actually a very old family or something (I've read a fanfic where they are 3000 years old and changed their name every 500 years) so basically anything with an interesting potter family... Please no friendly goblins, lords of 20 houses and evil Dumbledore


** Real world history time! I got super weird and decided to dig up the history of the Potter name. Like where did it come from and the history behind it.

So the Potter family that the name originally came from was royalty. See in-between 400BC and 100AD mother fucking desert pottery ninja traders made the single richest country of the old world.

Legit, their capital Petra, was/is hidden in a cliff face just wide enough for a two lane road. 20,000 desert ninjas lived in a hidden city like Aladin and the 40 theives. It is a kilometer long city hidden in the desert.

Well the thing was Petra, now Jordan, is seriously prime real estate. As in holy dear God is this place key real estate. At least in the ancient world it was.

[[https://images.app.goo.gl/i6hKr2quVbGuZY1G9][Their trade routes were perfect to get India trade, Africa trade, and Mediterranean trade.]] This meant they had hella cash flow real fucking quick.

So they knew two things. One: they needed to either raise the largest fucking army of all time to keep themselves safe, or make sure no one could find them to attack them.

So they did a whole bunch of column B and a decent amount of column A.

They instituted trade route secrecy so heavily no one even knew where the fuck Petra actually was for a few hundred years. While have a population of around 20,000 people, baller as fuck.

They also knew due to the shit ass geography they lived in a traditional army would do them absolutely no good. So they trained an entire army of archers. Ninja archers who attacked from hidden locations at night and poisoned the fuck out of the enemies water and food.

The first Roman General who tried to conquer Petra lost a huge chunk of his army, killed a handful of Petra archers occasionally, and never fucking found the city of Petra!

So they ultra rich ninja traders realized they had a spoilage issue. Their pots sucked balls. In fact all the pots in the ancient world at the time sucked balls.

So Petra spent a fucking fortune researching and advancing pottery nearly a millennia along the tech tree. Seroously, they didn't come up with better pottery techniques for around a thousand years. Fucking badass.

In fact their pottery was so fucking amazing Rome was like, ah I want those fucking pots, conquer that bitch or else.

So Rome threw an obscene amount of soldiers at Petra. So many in fact they literally stood side by side and walked from one end of the desert to the other just to find the fucking city.

Oh and Petra was such baller desert ninja that to this day we are still finding places where they hid their water wells in the desert. Seriously they just found another one entirely on accident last year.

So Rome is finally like haha! Found ya bitches! We gonna take over now.

Petra was like "Fuck you!"

Rome said, if you surrender we will make ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE CITIZENS OF ROME!

BTW, huge deal, like holy dear God that is like winning the lottery now. And Rome wanted those pottery skills so bad they were willing to give that to the entire fucking country.

Petra was like, damn bruh you serious? Alright!

So anyways a bunch of complicated linguistically strange bullshit lead to petra (stone) to some language fuckery into peh (drink) to potus (i drink) to a bunch of growth to pote ((i poke) weird I know but it is what it is) to some more language fuckery that became potter (someone who wanders / a maker of pots) which rounds it magically somehow back to Petra sounding like Potter and both meaning wanderers and pottery people. Some real weird linguistic fuckery happened that I still scratch my head at.

Either way what is even more interesting is when Rome invaded the fuck out of England they brought some of their peoples that we know have genetics linked back to fucking Jordan!

Yeah, what the fuck eh? So Potter family name took over a thousand years linguistically to travel from Petra to create the word Potter, while the descendants of those same people made the transition from Petra to England where the word Potter was brought into being.

Just some weird fuckery that the world and history is absolutely fucking cluttered with. I also freely admit it is all a bit of a stretch, but man is it cool as hell.

Either way, enjoy the rant of a Nabataean fan boy (the people of Petra) who made a tenous connection between Potters and Petra.

***** Dude, you ever think of writing articles and stuff like that? With the mixture of history and the lingo? Because, while I didn't really like history all too much in school, I love reading little bits of history like Petra and the lingo you used made your long comment fun to read. I'd love to read more of your work if you do write articles like that.

****** Hey there! I regularly delete my comments if there are not about interesting things, like the Petra one, or in response to a writing prompt. Makes keeping my history easy to sort through lol.

Anyways, I remembered you asked if I would ever consider writing more and I did wind up doing so. Thought of this comment and here we go.

Went on a bit of a rant on Nero last night lol. Hope you find it interesting!

[[https://i.redd.it/lu65gm55kam61.jpggqj7usj]]

Edit: lol the .jpg in the reddit link is making it think it is a pic link. Sorry, here is a copy of the text!

Nero was one of if not the single greatest target of character assassination ever.

Nero hated a vast majority of useless parasites that made up the rich and powerful of Rome at the time.

He fucked them up as hard and often as he could. Stripped power from corrupt assholes on the reg.

So after 13 years of just straight hammer stomping them they got tired of his shit. Declared him an enemy of the state and waited for him to die shortly afterwards.

So a good amount of power scrambling immediately took place. Since corruption was fairly set in place already those left were still pretty much pieces of shit.

Once they went through three more emperors in less than a year, lmao, they got their Fuckboi Vespasian.

He was all about playing games with money and boy did he do it. He was also real quick to keep himself from being seen anything like Nero.

He was so successful at that the corrupt shitfuckers started using Nero as their whipping boy. He was dead so what the fuck was he going to do about it?

What followed has been so successful that to this day almost 2,000 years later most people only know the absolute fuck crazy rumors about him.

Dude was really just trying to restore the empire to something that was good and strong. Instead Fuckboi Flavius was so afraid of being seen as doing anything that would pass off the rulers he had Titus his great military commander and shit finicial ruler. Dude threw a fuck ton of money into the coliseum and was lucky he died after less than two years (iirc) into his rule. Otherwise he would have had a ton of bullshit to deal with.

Bullshit his brother Domitian the Dom (big dick energy) saw the cause of right quick.

So he started fucking the senate unlike his bitch ass family members who took it like cheap whores.

Still the Senators and rich held this real weird grudge against Nero. So since they couldn't talk shit about Domitian the Big Dick Emperor, they criticized Nero for and made him out to be a total fucktard.

Then they compared some of the things Nero did that Domitian was doing.

Domitian however had big dick energy and the people fucking loved him. So the senate was foaming at the mouth nearly in hate while the people were nearly the same in awe.

What do you do when your plan to discredit your current opponent, by comparing him to a leader of the past you keep painting as crazy, fails compelelty?

DOUBLE DOWN BITCHES!

Oh, and kill the emperor.

Fucking Nero got smashed with revisionist and rumor mongering to an incredible ordeal.

So the senate makes sure the next boi is someone they can deal with. Except he fucking dies soon. Before he does though they make sure he adopts their next choice of emperor.

This fuckboi was even worse, hella cronyism, except he hit gold. Fucking literally.

So he throws tons of money at the fucks in charge to clean up and improve Rome. Considered a great ruler who sent many military successful campaigns.

All way the fuck away from Rome.

All while stories still were getting spun about Nero.

Dude got fucked.

*** I'm not sure this is applicable for everyone named Potter though. It was pretty common for lower class citizens (of many countries) to be eventually named after their professions, since they didn't have a family name. That's why names like Potter, Smith, Shoemaker etc. are so widespread acoss multiple countries (in the local language of course).

***** Oh, don't get me wrong, I like the magical desert ninja heritage idea. It would fit very well in fics where the Potters are and "ancient and noble" house and all that. I've always had trouble taking a noble family named Potter seriously before, given its connection to lower class people.

*** Great stuff. I love that kind of language and history information.

I was able to visit Petra in 2010. For those who want an image, the end of the ravine that opens up into the ancient city was where the outdoor shots for the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade were filmed. The whole city was carved out of the cliffs, and extends over an area of more than a hundred square miles. Steps have been carved all the way up to the top of the rocks in places.

It's in the desert, and water was a huge problem for them, so they built extensive and amazing waterworks to keep the city supplied. There are shows on PBS about the waterworks, and about how the buildings are believed to have been carved into the rock face (from the top down).

Absolutely fascinating and incredible.

*** I love you. I'm a major history fan and this was very hot 🔥

But seriously, I can't remember the fanfic, definitely on ffn, most likely a Harmony, but Harry finds a family grimoire that goes way back to the first family spell, that any member of the family had to expertly be able to cast in order to call themselves a Potter. It was a simple spell, to dry clay.

I'm going to search for it, but there's no guarantee it's still up or easy to find.

***** I just rediscovered that one, but, and this is could be entirely wrong because it's my own memory. There was a Harmony fanfic where Hermione helps save Harry, he finds the grimoire in his family vault, I remember it because it was a really touching scene that made my teenage heart cry, where it's literally like, "with shaking hands Harry reverently opens up the book. Handwritten, on the earliest pages. 'If ever a member should be a Potter they must master this spell.'" And it was a spell to dry clay.

I don't have perfect recall, but I'm pretty darn close. I think if I ask my bestie, who hoards every Harmony she comes across, she'll remember it.

To be fair, finding a family grimoire was a really popular theme for a period. I think ffnlink(Potter Grimoire) is the easiest found, because it's part of the title, but this was an early, Hermione x Harry, maybe Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing fic that I had to have read prior to 2006. At one point, I read so many that the themes ran together, so I can't perfectly say.

** What do you consider friendly goblins? I have a fic, but the goblins are just doing their job. they aren't overtly helpful and actually sidewall Dumbledore for awhile, before a change of management happens. Then the newer one is on friendly terms with Dumbledore, but hes still just doing his job of letting someone access their vault.
