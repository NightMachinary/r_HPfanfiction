Any stories from the Pov of a Muggle-born who starts school the year after the war? Learning about what he narrowly avoided, hearing stories about the war and past years at the school. Maybe Harry, and some of the other survivors come to speak to the students.


** I wonder what happened to the muggle born students during the war year. Did they just get invited the next year?

*** I think a lot of them were round up and thrown into Azkaban. So once they were released and healed up, they might not have wanted to go.

**** I guess I meant the new students. The ones that McGonnagall probably protected by not sending them their letters.

**** Some were, but I doubt many children were, even by Umbridge. They had appearances to keep up, after all. Later in the book, we saw that many "wandless" muggle-borns were still free, but living on the streets, so it may have required additional crimes like faking your ancestry to be sent to Azkaban.

For the would-be first-years, I suspect the policy was just to tell them there was a mistake, take their wand, and send them home. (Of course, policy wouldn't stop Death Eaters from hunting them down for a bit of fun later.)

***** Weren't Muggleborns required by law to come to the Ministry and prove they had wizard ancestry?

****** They were, but the consequences if they failed varied. We saw people who only had their wands confiscated rather than being sent to Azkaban.

** I'm working on a story sort of like this, but it's set eleven years after the war ended. In fact, the main character was born on the day of the Battle of Hogwarts.

It will reference the ongoing rebuilding and the changes in the British Wizarding World after the war. Some for the better, some....not so much.
