:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Dear all,

I can't find a really good fanfic where Sirius raises Harry from a young-ish age. I remember that it started with Arthur coming across Newt and telling hem about Scanners, then Newt comes to visit and finds out he's really animagus Peter, which results in Sirius being freed.

Please please does anyone have the name/link of this work?

Thanks so much in advance and if you have any good recommendations where Harry is adopted / takes away from the Dursleys I'd love to hear about them (but no Weasley or Dumbledore bashing please).

Kudos to being such a fantastic sub!

Sirius and Remus raise Harry with Sirius on the run from Azkaban. The story doesn't treat Dumbledore kindly all the time, but that's because they are temporarily on a different side of a conflicted situation. He's reasonable, so I don't think it bashes. I love how it's told from Harry's point of view.

**** Not that I know, at least. I was disappointed by the lack of it too.

You've probably seen this one too, but to me, it was quite a recent read. Harry is adopted by muggles from a young age and Sirius also takes his part in raising him.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

  It's been six years since Harry was left on the Dursleys' doorstep. Sirius is in prison, Remus is friendless, and Pettigrew is secretly in hiding. But some things are meant to be, and Arthur Weasley bumping into a famous Magizoologist is one of those things. Just what events will this meeting set in motion?This story won second place in the Shrieking Shack Society's Marauder Medals 2018 for Best Pairing (Wolfstar)! Thank you all for the continuous support!
