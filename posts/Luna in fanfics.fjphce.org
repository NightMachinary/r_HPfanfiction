What is your opinion on Luna‘s depiction in fanfictions? Do you like her as a seer, traumatised girl that needs help, or simply as someone who is a bit misunderstood?

Personally I like her more as an observant but clearly traumatized girl and it triggers me so much when people turn Luna‘s weirdness into a godly source of information that she should never know about. Harry is a Death Eater in disguise? Luna feels his "bad" aura. Harry is quarreling with his love interest? Luna gives random wise council to him even though she never talked to him. Dark!independant!Harry sees an insane girl walking around with no shoes? Instantly treat her like a princess and give her everything. (fuck for the love of magic xD) I quit a story instantly when I see it...

sorry for the rant :D

I know there are a lot of people who really love Luna, so what is your favorite interpretation of Luna?


** ANY interpretation is okay in my books, as long as it is consistent.

Seriously, she has slightly less screentime than Ginny. Let's not let that cut off any avenues.

Between her actions and what's shown in canon, it supports all sorts of theories.

** I always liked the idea that she's basically an instinctive (and magical) version of The Mentalist. She reads people, sometimes probabilities, does some targeted guessing and cold readings, and then wraps up her eerily accurate observations in cutesy, misdirectiony bullshit about magical creatures to keep people from paying attention. That kind of 'Nargles are metaphors for bullies' sort of feel to things.

Also the ones in Crazy Little Things by Dreiser and Quidditch World Cup by TE7 are interesting.

*** I like this explanation, with one small change: She doesn't quite realise/understand it. It's not, to use your phrase, "to keep people from paying attention", it's because she's a bit traumatised and has developed a bit of a weird coping mechanism.

Same general idea, but even /she's/ not totally aware of it all.

***** Not sure about that, I just like giving a bit of weight to the death of Luna's mother. Having it actually effect Luna, contribute to her natural talents in the manner you suggest, would be an interesting turn of events.

Maybe the creatures she talks about do exist, or at least are debated by magi-zoologists, but she uses them as part of a defence against emotions she just doesn't want to deal with. It wasn't /bullies/ that stole her shoes, it was /nargles/.

Point is: this version of Luna probably needs a bit of therapy. But then, so do most of the cast.

****** Heh. That'd be an interesting cross-over series - the Frasier Crane therapy sessions of the Harry Potter ensemble. :D

Fair point though. I do like the idea. It kind of gives me an 'elves broke into my house and made all my toys and bigfoot keeps stealing from my logpile' sort of a vibe. It's good to keep that Folklore Crypto-zoology vibe for the Lovegoods, most definitely. :)

******* The idea, to a degree, is inspired by Lilo and Stitch. Lilo and Stitch offers probably my favorite bit of "Bad Coping".

So, early in the film we're told by Lilo that Pudge (a fish that lives near the island) controls the weather. A random, if odd, statement. Until you hear about how Lilo's parents died: "It was raining."

Take the same sort of thing with Luna. Instead of dealing her emotions, and I can't imagine her father was exactly in the right state to help her with that at the time, she built up a wall made of random creatures and strange words.

New problems she encounters are dealt with in much the same fashion, by re-imagining the situation as something else. Luna /can't/ deal with bullies, it's not in her (in her first year at least). She /can/ deal with nargles though, because she's read all about those.

To take this to an actual /story/, the idea would be simple. I'll use Harry, because I'd probably write him as having a few coping mechanisms of his own.

Harry takes notice of Luna, spotting similar actions to his own, works out the problem, and talks to her about it. Luna, in this hypothetical story at least, is the first person Harry can really talk to about this stuff. Ron and Hermione are good friends, but I could see Harry having put in an extra effort to be "normal" around them, because Hogwarts was the first place he could try and fit in.

Bottom line of the story: Harry and Luna work together to find their way to a healthier frame of mind.

******** That's a very interesting comparison. I can totally see it. I'm also now (moderately tangentially) wondering what Luna's version of Stitch would be like. :)

It's quite theoretically sound, as well, if the opinion of a random person on the internet is in any way meaningful to you in that regard. :D

Well, if you write that (or anyone reading does), I'd certainly love to read it. I'm a big advocate for the buddy system in mental health situations - cardinal rule of Dark Places and all that - and Harry and Luna working shit out together could be that kind of delicious melancholy fun.

********* I'm chatting with a friend at the moment about this, so maybe I'll be posting it here in a few weeks/months. I wouldn't hold your breath, takes me ages to get anything done.

From our discussions it's leaning towards "everyone is traumatised/needs help"

Harry for obvious reasons.

Luna for obvious reasons.

Ron has an inferiority complex and his mother doesn't help (sending Howlers to yell at her kids in the middle of the hall)

Hermione actually has consequences for her intelligence, such as some social issues.

Draco's dad is literally a Nazi, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn of some kind of emotional abuse going on there (the brainwashing against anyone not a pureblood for a start).

Basically: these kids needs therapy.

********** Heh. Yeah, I know that feeling. I've finished one fic in the four years I've been writing. Life so often gets in the way of actually doing what we want with it. :)

That all sounds good. Even Draco's issues. As even some fics have established, over-positivity and ego-boosting can be just as damaging as that which plummets one's self-esteem. Dudley is probably struggling massively these days.

Not even that (although this is true). Lucius doesn't strike me as the most... caring of fathers. It wouldn't be that hard to write Draco as starved for affection, /genuine/ affection.

A good male role model is also lacking. I mean, who's he got? Lucius the Blood Purist and Snape the bully. Not the best options.

If you set up the fic correctly you can actually save Draco in first or second year. It's not that hard.

Replace Hermione with Draco in the bathroom scene, Harry and co save him, he's indebted to them. He hangs around, trying to pay off his debt, and over the school year they become real friends.

Or for second year, just toss him into the Chamber of Secrets with Harry. Harry saves him, debt is owed, he hangs around, they become friends.

If you catch him early, and give him a /reason/ to be around the group often enough, you can make a good case for him changing his ways.

Some liberties would have to be taken of course, to help ease the way. But this is fanfiction, so that's pretty normal.

************ Ah, okay. Yeah, you have a point. I remember a fic where Draco claimed Harry was his most valued friend because he was the only one he'd made himself that his father couldn't interfere with - could also be a helicopter parent in addition to the absentee, cold and uncaring side. The old "Elbows in, shine your shoes, never tell anyone how you feel about anything" style of parenting.

You're right, though. A good storyteller can make even the worst of tropes work. It's all about how you use it, right? :)

************* Yeah, that all makes sense. Once you get Draco around normal people, and maybe a few tropes to make him open up a bit, I think he'd make friends early on.

And yeah, all tropes can be used if you're good enough at it.

The "needs help" list has expanded a little during my talk with my friend.

Harry: for obvious reasons.

Hermione: her increased intelligence could easily lead to social issues beyond just "kinda awkward" if you wanted it to.

Ron: has an inferiority complex due to being the youngest of six brothers.

Draco: abusive/emotionally distant father.

Neville: inferiority complex born from being put down as "nearly a squib", being forced to use his dad's wand didn't help as it would have just help cement in his mind that he's not very good.

Ginny: spent several months slowly being possessed by Tom Riddle.

Luna: obvious reasons.

What I've found interesting over the last few days is the way you could go about the /results/ of their issues.

Harry's closet might have been terrible, lonely, and dark, but it was also /safe./ Suddenly you have Harry with Agoraphobia: the fear of open spaces. Agoraphobia is a bit more complex than that, but that's the simple version.

Give Ron tunnel vision on the few things he is good at that his brother's aren't. He focuses, a little too much, on what he's good at because he doesn't feel like he's good at a lot.

Neville's a small ball of self doubt and confidence issues.

And /Draco/... yeesh. There's so many ways you can run Draco, I wouldn't know where to begin.

Safe and simple. There's not much unexpected inside the day-to-day routine Harry seemed to have taken, so going out into the big bad world full of people and chaos and opinions is definitely an interesting idea to explore.

It would be interesting - that perception of inferiority being a cause for somewhat perfectionist-narcissist tendencies. If you're a fan of Community, Jeff is practically textbook for this. "Why try at something you might fail at? Better to stick to what you know and bullshit the rest."

#+begin_quote
  And Draco... yeesh
#+end_quote

Yep. Draco is one fucked up puppy. I think that's the clinical term. :)

To be honest, mulling it over, I don't think there's a character (one that's more than a name or a one-dimensional singular adjective) at Hogwarts that isn't traumatised in one way or another - Dumbledore and Snape are obvious, McG lost her husband after struggling with childhood love and guilt over Dougal, Flitwick probably got a lot of shit for being half-Goblin, Hagrid was apparently abandoned by his mother for being weak, etc. The entire ensemble could do with therapy, really. Gives me a great idea for a HP-Frasier crossover where the two Crane brothers get to therapise the Castle. :D

*************** You know, more and more I want to do a whole post about this and get more than just our opinion on this.

And yeah, most of them need help. But maybe it's my own inability to do a fic with a main focus on /that/ many characters, but I'd keep it to the ones I listed: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Ginny, and Luna.

A tighter focus on a "support group" as it were lets you explore the effects of their issues more in depth. For example I said Harry could have Agoraphobia, which would probably mean "no Quidditch".

Harry's issues and how he copes could be, and probably /is/, a fic unto itself. Not to mention the inevitable backslide every Summer when he goes "home" to the Dursleys.

Oh, I wasn't suggesting you do a fic with that many. Wheel of Time, as great as the books were, fell into that trap of over-extending the ensemble and it slowed them down to a crawl. At most, I'd suggest a series of individual fics to cover the different groups.

Could also use that as his 'improvised therapy'. Sort of a cross between Stress Inoculation Therapy and that one where they expose Phobics to their Phobia in building quantities.

You'd have to work up to a full /game/ of it though. Flying is one thing, and you could make him flying about a real accomplishment near the end of the first year, but a real high speed game of Quidditch, with metal balls flying at him from every direction, people bumping into him, and so on? Doubt it.

Of course, this all comes down to "how serious are his issues?". Maybe they're mild, and he could get to playing by second year. Maybe they're intense, and he can only really fly more than a few feet off the ground towards the end of fifth. There's a whole spectrum to choose from.

** I prefer socially observant Luna to canon Luna honestly. Its obviously better when it's not too over the top, but I think that astute social observations couched in magi-crypto-zoology reads really well.

That being said I don't think the damage to her person as a result of losing her mother, living with her unhinged father, and being bullied for five years should be discarded. I think that those two aspects of this version of Luna's personality are inherently tied together.

She is so observant of the social interactions and feelings of others because she is so excluded from such things herself. She couches the hurt of such things with the absurdity of her creatures.

I imagine that she sometimes doesn't remember which of the creatures are ones she actually thinks are real (like the crumple horned snorkack) or which ones are stand ins for things like bullies, or repressed emotions (nargles, wrackspurts, etc). And I imagine that she doesn't particularly care.

** Oh boy. I have some major opinions on this. Luna is my girl and I dislike how a lot of fanfic authors characterwize.

Luna is by far and away my favorite character in HP, and the one I relate to the most by a large margin. I genuinely dislike seer Luna, nympho luna, and especially 'normal" Luna where they make her quirkiness some of sort of mask.

I see Luna as a lonely, traumatized, and isolated girl who's gone through a great deal of shit in her short life, and it's obviously impacted her greatly. I tend to see her as very intelligent and incredibly perceptive of people and the world around her, but never quite knowing how to express it. She's very socially observant and insightful, but isolated and awkward enough that she doesn't quite know how to express them. From experience? Being bullied, intense social isolation, a dysfunctional parent, and the death of someone close to you can leave you deeply disconnected from 'mainstream society." I have a headcanon her interest in strange animals comes from hours alone reading and trips she and father took int he summers.

It's my headcanon that the magical creatures she sees and talks about aren't actually fictional, but incredibly rare species she's read about in books and found on expeditions with her father. They're species that only scholars magical creatures and hardcore amatuer magi-zoooligsts tend to be aware of, and not something your average wizard or witch would encounter.

Essentially she's a quirky, brilliant, and intuitive young woman who's gone through a great deal of shit and has adapted in the best way she knows how. She's observant and clever, but never knows quite how to relate it. She's passionate about rare animals that other students don't think exists, but actually do.

I see Luna growing into someone who still quirky, an outsider, and still incredibly insightful and intelligent, but has learned to relate to people and couch her insights in more tactul terms. I see her as someone who becomes a magi-zooligist and winds up stunning her old classmates by finding the Crumpled Horn Snorkack and Nargles. She's the bullied nerdy kid who everyone thought was weird who goes on to say 'fuck you' to everyone who hurt her.

I'm a huge Harry/Lunna shipper to boot.

At this point, I approach fics that have Luna listed in the characters in [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] with extreme caution and usually don't even open them, unless it's a crack story or has well written and very intriguing summary.

** > a seer, traumatised girl that needs help, or simply as someone who is a bit misunderstood?

I think I like her as a bit of those three aspects, she doesn't have to be only one, she definitely doesn't fit the bill of a one dimensional character. .

Luna is an interesting character that's rarely explored, people normally make her a plot device to reveal something to the MC or make the plot go along out of nowhere with little to no explanation(she's a Seer, and that's it).

Someone who sees more than people that /already/ have magic and thus believe they are already more aware than the rest while having to cope with trauma and not having the social tools to be understood in a world of magic sounds like an interesting character.

As it has been said, consistency is paramount though,

** Luna, in my opinion, is a somewhat quiet girl who is really observant. Her very advanced sense of perception would probably make her a great Legilimens on par with the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort if she was given the time. I like to think that all the creatures in the Quibbler aren't all invented by the Lovegoods but that some are talked all around the wizarding world by some magizoologists and other wizarding conspiracy theorists.

Nice. I'd pair this with the death of her mother creating some unhealthy coping mechanisms. Do Nargles exist? Maybe, but Luna's using them as a stand in for the bullies that stole her shoes. Not sure if i'd have her aware that she's doing this or not.
