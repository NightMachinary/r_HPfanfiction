Ive read it more than a year ago.

It'a H/hr fanfic.

This Is The Plot: Harry and hermione are married and its their first year anniversary but hermione suddenly met harry in a bar or club with different apperance due to polyjuice with the hair of her beautiful co-worker and end up having sex.

I suddenly remember it but I cant seem to find it again so I will appreciate if you could tell me the title or maybe link of this fanfiction.

Thank !
