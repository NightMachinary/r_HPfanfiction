Cave Johnson is actually Sirius Black post falling through the Veil, and trying to find his way back using SCIENCE!


** Harry IS Death, who set up the circumstances to manifest in the human world by giving his Cloak, Wand and Stone to three humans and waiting for the bloodline to be infused enough with his essence to permit his being born in the form of Harry Potter. He sent his Herald, the Grim, ahead of him to prepare the way - the Grim was born as Sirius Black. By gaining a mortal form, Death now knows Himself from every angle and has overcome his last weakness - that Death itself cannot die. Having died, Death is now perfected.

*** I remember someone mentioning Dobby/Harry Potter's sock, and I replied, "Pretty sure that's canon."

** One of the best I've ever read is still How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Lord V or something like that on fanfiction.net, basically voldemort is super neurotic and has a bunch of phobias (one of them being nuclear bombs) and he had set a global stasis spell to go off in case nuclear war ever broke out. The world is frozen (gkme doesn't pass, water doesn't run etc) with the exception of Harry (being a horcrux) and a handful of powerful wizards from other countries.

Fucking hilarious, has voldemort shitting, pissing, and vomiting all over himself almost every chapter. Surprisingly Harry and voldemort both seem in character (as much as they can be considering the premise). Really fun OC supporting characters.

Another one is Seventh Horcrux on fanfiction.net, voldemort Horcrux basically was dominant in Harry's consciousness, just overall hilarity as he tries to relive his life and become a dark Lord again. Continuously thinks Hermione is evil (she's not, he's just intimidated by her) and unironically thinks Lockhart is a genius (he's not, harry/voldemort is just kind of dumb and over thinks too much)
