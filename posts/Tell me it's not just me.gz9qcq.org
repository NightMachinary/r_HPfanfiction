Do any of you guys find yourself reading a fic and then about a quarter to halfway in you get bored of it? I'm not even entirely sure why this happens. Maybe I just hey bored with the plot. It can't just be me that this happens to.


** All the time. Can't always put my finger on exactly why I'm bored of a fic, but if I find myself not really wanting to read more, I just close the tab and read a different fic.

** This is how I ended up with 50+ open tabs on my mobile browser. I legit couldn't remember even starting the fics in the first few tabs.

So I simply started a new category in my fanfiction documentation - 'To Finish' - because I'm a paranoid FOMO and can't just close a tab.

Thank god I'm just a hoarder of virtual information about too-boring-to-finish-fanfictions and not a more materialistic one.

** All the time. Usually this happens when I'm 15 chapters and 100k words into the story, and yet we still haven't reached Halloween, or any other moment of great story significance.

Fanfiction readership skews heavily towards 'more words = more good', which often means there's a selective pressure on writers where pacing and tight narratives are thrown out the window. It's not necessarily something you consciously notice, until you get to the end of a chapter and just think, 'I just can't be bothered to read the next one.'

There are so many 300k word long stories that could have been told in 70-100k words, and would have been so much better off for it.

** This happens to me now and again with longfics where multiple chapters back to back are "setup chapters" where things happen...but also don't happen, if you get my meaning.

Most recently, this happened to me with Prince of Slytherin. The last few chapters have been...dragging the plot to say the least. So I sort of skimmed through it.

** It isn't just you, at all, but I suspect you and I have different reasons. For me, this usually happens because of pacing, or even just because of how the author writes. I know that I should open myself up more, but I really, really despise passive writing. I also don't like it when something happens every two seconds. I think my favourite thing to read is probably fics that are layered. I like it because though it takes me a couple chapters to get into it, layered fics let me explore the authors writing style

EDIT: by "layered" I mean that the author introduces different elements of the story chapter by chapter. Each chapter explores a different concept on closer examination. When you look at the entire story zoomed out, it is cohesive, but each chapter uses the part of the story we are currently at to explore the world we are in. The climax is when this all comes together.

** Yes, all the time. For me I think it usually comes down to a pacing or characterization inconsistency; the plot is moving too fast/too slow or going in circles, the characterization is at odds with timeline (those pesky political 11 year olds) but I suppose there are also pet peeve tropes that can crop up at any time and just ruin my enthusiasm to read.

** Yeah, it's all about the pacing. A lot of the stories I drop are stories where multiple chapters could be skipped without missing anything. Some filler chapters are okay, because just seeing the characters interact can be a fun break from the plot. But it's a problem when nothing happens in a lot of them.

*** I think part of the problem in this particular fandom is that everyone thinks they need to write 150k+ words about every idea. More isn't always better, not every plot can support that much story, and pacing out a novel-length work is something that takes extra skill. If the heart of your story can fit into a couple thousand words, there's no need to drag it out.

** Yes. Happened with Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay. I think what happened with that fic was that it sort of lost its bite and just became about a Harry who was a dragon. Or something. But the early chapters were brilliant.

I also stopped reading The Granger Principle since I couldn't figure out what it was about any more. If I'm being honest, the author probably should have concluded it and posted the rest of the material they've got planned out as a sequel. Hard to say how far through it was when I stopped since it's a regularly updated WIP last time I checked.

I can't recall any other examples right now.
