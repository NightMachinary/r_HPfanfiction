Sorry if the title was confusing. What I mean is;; a Harry Potter fanfiction where Harry starts off like he is in the book;; a bit naive and such, but, through actual hardwork and not some cheating bullpoopie, he grows in power, spell-strength, physical ability, etc etc, while becoming less naive. I don't want to make it too specific, but that's basically what I mean. A character-developing fanfiction where Harry grows stronger through hard-work, and not through some stupid shortcut. I'd prefer Harry/Hermione, but it doesn't matter.

Not Harry/Hermione (at least as far as I can tell), sorry.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

***** That's because it updates soooo slowly. 15 chapters in 7 years. Actually, we're overdue for another. :/
