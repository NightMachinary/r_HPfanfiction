does anyone know any fics where someone is reborn in pre 1900's?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11737044/chapters/26448165]] Here Harry “takes over” a character that has been born pre 1900. He becomes Tom's guardian and a Hogwarts professor. It's overall quite a wholesome alternative “could have been” story.

Tbh, most of the reincarnation fics are set in Marauders' Era or later (I could link those, too). Hope this helps!
