This can be like fics or fandom in general made you think of the canon actions of a character in a different way.

Or it can be a AU set up where it used characters in different ways than they were in canon. Such as Chosen one Neville, Evil Dumbledore, MC Hermione, Good Draco etc. Or had different depictions than in canon.

You are aware this is not what the character necessarily was in canon but you appreciate the potential.

Either way this makes you feel more positive about a character you might have felt indifferent about or disliked.

Or made you feel more negative about a character you felt positive or indifferent about initially.

You do the same for relationships if you like. Both friendships and romance whether its canon or not.


** When I read the books, Hermione was my favorite character. Now, after seeing so many Hermione Sue stories everywhere, I despise her.

*** I went from being pretty neutral about her to full hate after spending so much time trying to defend poor Ron against the Harmony shippers. At this point, any mention of this ship is a deal breaker for me, and I'm weary of any fics where she is treated too well.

*** I kinda agree with this. I still like her character and I enjoy meta and art with her. But in fic? When I see her especially as mc i just kinda expect her to get all the useful qualities which makes alot of the other characters kinda useless or boring. And it kinda ruins the tension of the plot. I know there are Hermione fics that don't do it. But there are so many I've seen that do that I have started sorta avoiding fics with her as a central focus. Which is a shame cuz I used to love fics with Hermione.

** I felt indifferent about Voldemort while reading books, now I'm obsessed with this character. There are some incredible stories about him, both Voldemort and Tom Riddle. It was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player]] that started this, and then the rest of The Fictionist's stories.

** I can't look at Dumbledore the same after so many bashing fics. At worst, he was manipulative and a chess master, at best he was negligent and let shit happen in a school full of children.

*** Fanfiction ruined Dumbledore for me. He is not nearly as manipulative in the books as fanfiction makes him out to be. But even though I know this I can't read stories where he is a a positive character with a large role.

** I always had a dislike of Snape in canon and fanon. Pretty much, he is either an incompetent bully or a soft-hearted father figure who shits rainbows. My dislike is probably from how flat the character is.

He is a complex character, but his motives are always simplified.

I changed after reading this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857][one]]. I realized that he actually can be written as a complex person.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Oh for sure, I read enough weasleybashing fic early on in my time in fandom and now I have an irrational hatred for ron and Ginny even though I know they didn't do anything?? I'm sure I have the same thing going on for other characters too. It's wild how much fanfic influences your view of canon.

*** I do have a better view of Ron and Ginny now but its cuz I read fics showing them in a more positive light. I did have a period i didnt like them and it was mostly due to weasely bashing fics
