From thinking of puberty to leg hair, I started to ask myself how witches and wizards groom themselves. For example, do they use potions instead of toothpaste when brushing their teeth, are their shampoos and soaps normal ones, extracts of particular magical plants or potions in a less liquid form? What about shaving/epilation? Do they do it the regular way, is there some specific spells or such for it or do they it all by Severing Charms (if it is the latter then ouch). For a fandom whose main character's fortune comes from hair cosmetic, we don't seem to touch much upon them except for Sleekeazy and Bubotuber Pus.


** Harry receives an enchanted razor for his birthday in DH, and there are numerous mentions of toorthbrushes throughout canon. Which suggests that wizards use enchanted objects rather than spells for personal care.

This makes sense when you think about it. Magic can be pretty difficult, so not everyone would be able to get the hang of the necessary spells if it was all done with a wand. On top of that, magic can go wrong, and people will be particularly wary of wayward magic when their wand is pointed at their own face. And thirdly, the restriction on underage magic during holidays means that underage wizards could not use spells to take care of themselves.

I like to imagine that Harry's enchanted razor works like Ollivander's tape measure in PS, just flying into the air and shaving Harry without any input from him.

** I like to imagine an enchanted toothbrush that beats you over the head if you don't brush correctly.

*** Which the ancient Romans had a thousand years before Hogwarts. (Plumbing in general, not flushing toilets.) And since the European style of magic is largely built on the Roman casting system it's quite likely that experts on magic would also be experts on other things that the Romans had.

Fun fact: The material they used for plumbing, plumbus, is nowadays called lead and we know that it's toxic. Whether the founders knew about it we don't know. But considering the negative impact of lead poisoning on mental development it explains perfectly well why most wizards are idiots with not a single ounce of logic.

Of course a simple bezoar would probably cancel the effect completely, but people usually don't get poisoned that often and it's quite likely that most of the population never had to use one.

** I always imagined that for personal care that would be required in their prepubescence (brushing teeth, washing hair, etc.) they would mostly use enchanted objects or potions. For example, a hairbrush that can braid your hair for you, a comb that dries and detangles your hair, a toothbrush that brushes your teeth by itself, or a breath freshening potion.

For personal care that comes more specifically with puberty and as they enter Hogwarts and can use spells, I imagine that there's probably a popular book for each gender that details simple spells and potions and is typically gifted to them at this time. This would contain depilatory spells combined with skin numbing potions, anti-perspiration spells, etc. There would also be more advanced versions of these books for older students focused more on makeup, hair styling, and other such things that matter more as they mature.

** I remember in linkffn(The Arithmancer), chapter 53, where Hermione tries some prank which fails, because only her and Harry use Muggle fluoride-based toothpaste, and her prank is based around fluoride.
