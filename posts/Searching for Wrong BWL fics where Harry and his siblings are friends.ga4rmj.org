I've only ever read one fic before where Harry was raised normally and he and his sibling got along really well. I don't want the typical absurd "James and Lily" abuse or critically neglect Harry. Some mild ignoring is ok but nothing overdone. Most importantly, I want his sibling to not be a total brat.


** There is this fic called the three black birds. Its really well written. Though Lily and James ignore harry but it rather a mild neglect. They do not completely forget about him. Also his brother though a little haughty is not a complete bastard. Overall it shows what would realistically happen if parents show favoritism between siblings. Though it is not completely written the author does gives the whole plot.

*** I can't remember the name of it. Lily paid attention to him most and told him that his job is to take care of his brother and not stand out. I think he was sorted into Slytherin.

****** Yeah, but Harry wasn't raised normally there either. Lily raised him to put Connor over everything and everyone else, and pretty much taught him his life meant nothing next to him. The difference was, this Harry believed it.

******* Yeah but I'm fine with that. I don't want the fics where Lilly and James starve him, or beat him, or deliberately put him in danger because they resent his existence.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
