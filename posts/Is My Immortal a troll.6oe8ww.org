** I believe so. The preface for it is just so unbelievably crass and every word is badly spelt.

The goblins were as out of touch with wizard fashion as wizards are with muggle fashion. They /thought/ that attire was the height of fashion.

**** I mean, all those spellings are ones that totally would have been used by teens and pre-teens during the time it was written. The introduction of QWERTY keyboards and autocorrect on phones resulted in TXT speech going out of vogue, but before it did there were large numbers of people that would purposely use this kind of bad spelling. It was considered cool, so while the spelling might be intentional that doesn't guarantee it's a troll fic.

**** Well yes we do have a large amount of clich√©d stories that are written by adults, but my immortal is quite different from those. It has such a blatant Mary Sue and that is not actually that common in hp fandom. It just looks very juvenile to me, so I assumed it was a typical dumb school girl's desire to be hotpopularsmartemo.

Anyway, I guess we'll never know.

** I think that it was meant to be a trollfic of the fics that were around at that time, so it took everything that was bad about the latter and cranked it Up-To-Eleven. In other words, it is that cringe-y writing that you find in your notebooks from middle and high school, and ask yourself "Did I really write that!?"

** Spoilers below, if you care.

The last chapter has the church group or whatever confront Tom Riddle about his comments under the online name of Voldemort. He calls them all crazy and says he was just trolling. Take from that what you will.
