Ten years of being in the cupboard, as well as having to be 'less smart' than Dudley... at least in his grades. Well, it doesn't make much sense that he would be able to read all that well. Could that be why his writing is 'chicken scratch'?

Are there fics out there that have Hermione basically teaching Harry how to read, while she helps him in understanding magic theory? I just have this scene in my head where she discovers that his reading comprehension is close to nil, and she asks him /"Harry... can you read?"/ Which makes him discover that his shoes are most fascinating.

Of course, this would /normally/ set things off against the Dursleys. It doesn't have to be about that, or even have a major focus on it. Would be interesting for Pomphrey to discover that Bargain Bin Glasses are horrendous for developing vision, and they either get him proper ones, or a potions regimen that corrects the eyes themselves - as he would be considered legally blind otherwise. Fuzzy shapes do not make for good vision.

Anyway, anything out there like that?


** Harry attended a local public school in a fairly affluent suburb of London. Even in the early 80s a house there would have been quite expensive. Dudley goes to Smeltings, the expensive private boarding school which Vernon attended himself. The Dursleys are middleclass to upper middleclass.

There is just no freaking way he would have gone through normal public school in the UK without being able to read by 11. They would not have send him to the local comprehensive if this was the case. Instead he would have been held back.

Glasses are paid for by the NHS, they are free. I cannot see Petunia grabbing glasses from the bargain bin if she can get them for free. The only issue with Harry's glasses I can think of would be if they never got updated. Like he got them at 5 and then another set at 8 or 9 and if they broke it was his problem.

*** I see what you're saying, but also literacy is genuinely something they're trying to put a spotlight on in Britain. There was a documentary that came out about it not that long ago that was called 'H is for Harry' (has absolutely nothing to do with Harry Potter, that was the name of the kid in the documentary). One of the things that the documentary said was that 1 in 5 kids leaves primary school unable to properly read or write :(

**** While I agree that it can happen and especially the non-caring attitude of the Dursleys would be the perfect background for such a problem, Harry is not unintelligent. I am struggling to believe that a relatively smart kid fails to learn how to read and write unless there is an underlying neurological problem such as dyslexia, forgetfullness etc on top of the abuse from home.

Even those who go through the school system and end up functional analphabets usually know at least some letters. The issue with them is not that they cannot do it, it is more that they tried, found it difficult and just gave up and or fell more and more behind as time went on.

***** Right, so Hogwarts would be when Harry finally has a support system and a reason to learn. Prior to that, he lived in a cupboard under the stairs and he had no friends because Dudley's gang hated him and no one wanted to be on the wrong side of that. And even when he finally got away from Dudley, he was only going to go to Stonewall and all he knows about that is that he's going to have a uniform that Petunia dyed herself (making him a target yet again for bullies) and that on the first day the older kids stuff your head in a toilet. He had no family to help him, no friends to care, and no future to look forward to prior to getting his letter from Hogwarts.

In the books Harry /did/ get decent grades, but I don't even think you have to change canon to justify a fanfic with him struggling to learn in school.

** Except that both ideas of Harry holding back his grades to not be punished and having his glasses from a bargain bin are pure Fanon and never once even implied in the books. It's even more ridiculous when you realise glasses are virtually free in Great Britain with the NHS, but I expect that's what happens when the largest part of the fandom comes from a country where the healthcare system... I can't even describe so much it's bad. It's sad to think that the idea of children - or any person, really - who don't have glasses when they need them could very well represent someone's reality.

I'm also pretty sure the Dursleys would just not care about Harry's grade at primary school like they didn't care at all for his grades at Hogwarts. Dudley would think that if Harry were to have better grades than him it would make Harry a nerd so he would have a reason more to beat him up, so if he's not upset, Vernon and Petunia don't care about Harry.

*** So fucking true.

I never understood how people came to believe that fanon Dursleys were canon... Sure, they weren't nice people, but they weren't abusive. From the point of view of a child it may seem so, but reality says otherwise. I have reread the books many times and have yet to find existence of abuse, just punishments that from the adults point of view were completely justified, as they didn't understand accidental magic wasn't Harry making fun of them.

People cry about the cupboard but the name misrepresents what it was, since there was space for a normal bed, shelves, a lamp... It was a decent size for a child, and nothing the government in the 80s would have cared about. Even today it wouldn't be an issue /if/ that were the only available room.

The most obvious evidence is Harry's personality. An abused child doesn't make fun of his cousin like that. Certainly doesn't get mouthy with his abusive family. He would have learned to keep his mouth shut and his temper in check, unlike Harry. Harry not only talks back to them all the time, he isn't afraid to get snarky with the teachers or other students. Abused? What a joke.

**** While I agree that fanon!abuse is exaggerated and often on completely ridiculous levels, Harry was definitely abused in canon, especially emotionally. Growing up without a loving home is definitely difficult and traumatising.

Maybe the cupboard fit a bed. But it was dusty, small and full of spiders, not to mention that the house had an extra bedroom. That's what makes it abuse - it's not like the Dursley's didn't have the room or money to take care of Harry, they choose not to because they're plain bad people. The punishments for accidental magic weren't justified. They know he doesn't know what he's doing!

In canon, Harry's background of abuse expresses itself in other ways than it's typically portrayed in fanfics, where he's quiet, insecure, and lacks self confidence. It's about his lack of trust in authority figures, his tendency to keep his worries to himself, and his independent self-reliance. It's also about his sass and dark humour.

Having the protagonist grow up without parents is a classic trope of the genre. It's what makes the books possible, and the reason I generally don't read fanfics where he does have parents. Though of course all children should have happy childhoods in real life, a hero with parental figures lack agency.

But i digress; though Harry wasn't beaten or whipped by the Dursley's in canon, he was definitely abused.

***** /sigh/ No, the Dursleys did not know that, because as a child Lily was capable of doing conscious magic, like Riddle. From Petunia points of view Harry is like her, spiting on her, showing he is special, better. Vernon knows even less, so from his pov Harry is clearly messing with them and making excuses. The fact that he laughs after the fact doesn't help his case either.

Growing without a loving home is fairly common, so I won't comment on that. I agree though that not giving him the second bedroom was spiteful and left an emotional mark on him, but not as bad as people want to believe. I can't in good conscience call any of this abuse.

But the point is that the government at that time wouldn't have cared. Nowadays you cannot discipline a kid without social services appearing, but back then disciplining was a family matter and nobody meddled on it, so good luck calling the police on the Dursleys. All those fanfic writers who have the police raiding their home, or making Dumbledore mind wipe the teachers.. they should come back to reality. That entire plot is exaggerated beyond belief.

It doesn't matter that the government wouldn't have cared. I'm not arguing that they would have. The act of abuse is immoral independent of legislation. Starving a child, keeping them in a cupboard and using violence as punishment is abuse.

******* I'm not blaming Harry for anything, he's but a child. But the fact remains that from their point of view Harry deserved those punishments. They're not delusional, just ignorant, and that's not their fault but Dumbledore's. He should have explained how magic actually worked.

Harry was not starved, he was once punished without dinner which Harry simply ignored by raiding the kitchen later. Sending a child to his room is a normal punishment, whenever it is a 2 square meters or a 10 square meters room. Harry was never hit, the only violence came from his cousin, the very same Harry called a pig in a wig.

The Dursleys weren't nice, but they weren't horrible either. By all rights Harry had an acceptable childhood. Certainly better than being spoiled like today's kids, now that's real abuse, for that cripples the child for life.

******** Well this is just factually incorrect. He's explicitly starved in the summer before Chamber of Secrets. In the beginning of Philosopher's stone he spends weeks confined to the cupboard. Vernon (and Petunia, on at least one occasion) is often physically violent in the early books.

Listen, I'm not trying to say the Dursley's were devil incarnate as they're often portrayed. But they were bad people. Their behaviour was not acceptable.

#+begin_quote
  Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, ‘Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,' before he collapsed into a chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. * Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
#+end_quote

That's after Harry let's the snake loose and traps Dudley inside. While he doesn't do it consciously, it's still his magic.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started
#+end_quote

He wasn't imprisoned, but basically had to stay in his room after school. Sounds worst than it is.

#+begin_quote
  Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.
#+end_quote

Second book, again not starved. Punished to his room after throwing a cake to their guests. Sure it was Dobby, but not only did Vernon see Harry behind them, the letter said he did it!

And I'm not saying they are nice people, I'm just saying they are not as bad as people want them to be. You just need to see things from their point of view instead of Harry's.

  'Where do you come from, anyway?' Harry asked.\\
  The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.
#+end_quote

He couldn't make it out very well, the first two words had unfamiliar shapes. The third word he thought he could make out. 'Brazil, right? Was it nice there?'\\
The snake jabbed its tail at the sign again. Harry looked back at it to discover indecipherable smaller text underneath what he already tried to read. 'Uh, sorry. I can't make out the rest of it.'\\
Harry could have sworn he heard a low hissing voice say, 'I wasss born here,' from behind the glass. He stared at the snake in wide-eyed shock.

  Three things lay on the doormat: A postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was holidaying on he Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill and ... [another] envelope [that] was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
#+end_quote

Harry didn't bother trying to read any of the addresses as he went back to the kitchen, handed Uncle Vernon the post, and went to eat his small breakfast.\\
He was chewing at a piece of toast when Dudley suddenly yelled, 'Dad! Dad, Harry's got something!'\\
Harry completely forgot about his breakfast. 'Wait, what?'

/12am, 31st of July, 1991/\\
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, p.42

#+begin_quote
  'I'm a /what?'/ gasped Harry.\\
  'A wizard, o' course,' said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, 'an' a thumpin' good'un I'd say, once yeh've trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.'\\
  Harry stretched out his hand at last to to take the yellowish envelope.
#+end_quote

Finally, he had the chance to confirm at last that these letters really were addressed to him. He was able to see the familiar shape of '/Mr/' which he only ever saw attached to an adult's name, but there was no mistaking it, next to '/Mr/' was the first initial of his name and his last name, '/Mr H. Potter./' in emerald-green ink.\\
'Well, what ya waitin' for?' said Hagrid kindly. 'Go on.'\\
He pulled out the letter and read, only for the title to leave him stumped. He could make out the words 'SCHOOL' and 'OF' and 'AND,' but the rest was completely unfamiliar to him, though he thought that the first word might have been 'HOGWARTS' based on what Hagrid had been saying. The next lines of text weren't any easier either, in fact, he wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be complete gibberish.\\
Harry felt as if his heart had sunk into his stomach. Was there really a school of magic? Would he be allowed to go if he couldn't even read the acceptance letter? And even if he was allowed, how could he learn magic if he had to read from magical spellbooks? How would the Dursley's react if he dropped out? He'd be stuck in his cupboard for the rest of his life. He had his ticket away from the Dursley's. It was right there, in his hands. If only he could read it. If only he could /read./

​

So that was my little plot hook. Maybe I'll continue it sometime? No idea.
