** He's always been a bit slow on updates. Unless he says he's done, I wouldn't count him out.

** As he's mentioned several times, Jeconais (Tim Joy) is not finished writing, though with other things in his life now, he's slowed down significantly from his prior, torrid pace and he doesn't have the passion he once had for writing fanfiction.

He'll still crank out the occasional story, but the updates will be fewer and farther between and the quality will not be what it was in his prime.

Writing well is something that requires practice and dedication, neither of which he has at the moment (for fanfiction, at any rate).

** I hope not. He has been one of the scenes best romance writers for a while in terms of amount of content published. most of his stories are pretty good as well...
