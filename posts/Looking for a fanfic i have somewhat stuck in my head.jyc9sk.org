:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Imma keep it short... i have a fanfic stuck in my head for about two days now and i don't really remember many details about it. I do have that one thing that i know is of that story, which is near the end (shortly before the last battle) where harry makes in the room of requrirements with the help of draco, hermione and hogwarts a (as the story calls it) light horcrux which is later used with a small blood sacrifice of draco to resurrect harry (not sure if that last one is from another story). That's as far as i remember the details, so please do your thing

  In which Harry discovers there is more to being the Heir of the Four Founders than than just having really cool tattoos. Powerful Harry, Multi-Ship. Post OOTP. No Slash.
