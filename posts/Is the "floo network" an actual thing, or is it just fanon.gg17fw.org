I got wondering when I realised that the Weasleys came to the Dursleys through the fireplace, and I really really /really/ doubt that a closed fireplace would be linked to a network, not to mention the chances of the Dursleys allowing it to be linked..

If there was actually a mention of it in canon then Rowlings world building is even worse than I thought, and if not then this fandom is amazing at making fanon things seem like canon..

Your opinions on this?


** Fairly sure it's canon and the Weasley's connected the Dursley's fireplace for the day to pick Harry up. Considering Arthur made an illegal flying car, I wouldn't consider his skirting the rules to get Harry out of the realm of possibility.

Molly: "All set to get Harry Arthur? You got the muggles permission to Floo today of course, now be good."

Arthur: "Er yes of course, everything is tickety-boo. The twins want to come along too to see a real Muggle house!"

Molly: "Arthur..."

Arthur: "Right, be back before you can spell mimbulus mimbletonia."

****** In a book about magic, magic can't be the explanation? Are you expecting them to send the wizard equivalent of a chimney sweep or something to have to connect magical houses together? For all we know a wizard from the floo network apparates to the chimney outside the house, does a quick spell and leaves in an instant.

******* For fucks sake, I didn't mean it like that and I hope you know it, I meant that it should be explained better than just "magic" yes we know it's because of magic but how the hell does it work, even if someone just apparated in /a muggle neigbourhood and does a spell/ that would already be breaking the statute of secrecy and probably some privacy laws, and at this point it wouldn't even be Arthur not caring, that would be the ministry not caring about it's own laws, which would imply that the whole ministry is completely corrupt and that the laws are jokes..

Sorry for the rant that my brain made up on the ridiculousness known as Rowlings worldbuilding

******** Take a deep breath, okay.

I guess I'm okay with a fantasy book, especially HP not having all the scientific answers. Rowling made a very enjoyable children's/YA book series about magic and yes her world building does leave a lot to be desired. However you are also posting this on HPfanfiction where all the loose ends that JKR leaves in the books can be enjoyably expanded upon by fans in their own work.

If this bothers you so much, write an explanation yourself. Make a one-shot about how Arthur infiltrated the floo network office and forged documents needed for the Dursley's consent. Or perhaps, he was extra bad and confunded Vernon one day pretending to be a post delivery man and got him to sign the documents. In canon we do learn that the ministry is pretty corrupt, use that as an explanation, perhaps funding that normally goes to staff the floo protection agency was reallocated to line Fudge's pockets.

You're looking for an explanation that just isn't there, I'm sorry there's no other way to explain it.

********* Yes I know each of these things, but my frikin brain can't accept something having no explanation, I'm posting this here because fanon uses it a lot, and it was never expanded upon canonically other than "there's floo travel and you can get to places with it" (plus some other things which are briefly mentioned)

Another commenter directed me to HP wiki, which has two articles on floo network/ the floo

I would write, but the fact is that I'm complete trash at writing, I want to write but I'm absolute shite at it.

They DGAF about muggle consent, so they just steam on with linking it up.

No, it does not. For breaking the Statute of Secrecy /muggle witnesses/ are required, not mere activity within an area frequented by muggles.

  ‘Er -- yes -- sorry about that,' said Mr Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. ‘It's all my fault, it just didn't occur to me that we wouldn't be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see -- just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be connected, strictly speaking -- but I've got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don't worry. I'll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.'

JKR wasn't JRR Tolkien and she didn't care for the world building as long as her universe worked for her story. Which is as it should be.
