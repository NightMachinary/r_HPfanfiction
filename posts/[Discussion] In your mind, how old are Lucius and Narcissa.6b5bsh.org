Slightly inspired by reading several fics recently where Narcissa decides to start a second family, 10-15 years after having had Draco.

I'm also aware that the films have influenced a lot of people's mental image of how old certain characters are or should be (Snape and McGonagall being prime examples).

**** And Lucius taking Snape under his wing is why Lucius and Narcissa both entrusted Snape to look after Draco and why Snape showed so much preference to him, even among his own house.

***** Snape and Lucius are friends right?

I got the sense that Lucius and Snape genuinely got along, at least before Voldemort returned.

****** More like allies. Snape's only ever had one friend, and Lucius was brought up on power politics. But they had a fairly good relationship up until the Department of Mysteries.

** Lucius was born in 1954, Narcissa in 1955. Both are canon and taken from the HP Wiki.

** Well, Lucius's age is explicitly stated during a Daily Propeth article in the books (41), so that's what I go with. Narcissa I'd assume to be about the same age.

*** For some reason I always thought Narcissa was a couple years (3?) younger than Lucius. Can't remember if that's canon or fanon though.

**** Fanon but believable since men marrying younger is a common theme for the Aristocrats that the Malfoy's pass themselves off as. I'd accept Narcissa being anywhere from 3-5 years younger than Lucius

** Lucius age is as mentioned previous in cannon, 41 during Harry's 5th year. Also cannon is I believe the order of birth of the black sisters.I believe Andromeda is stated as being the oldest, with Bellatrix and the lestranges all in the same year as Lucius, which despite not being specifically mentioned in cannon would put narcissa a year or two younger

*** Bellatrix is the oldest as mentioned in HBP when Dumbledore discusses Sirius' will with Harry. I think Andromeda is between the two.

** Lucius would have been born between 12 September 1953 and 11 September 1954. (Second Monday in Harry's fifth year is 11 September 1995.)

Narcissa's age isn't stated explicitly in the books, but 1955 sounds realistic enough, considering Lucius' age.

The two characters whose ages are most tricky are Charlie Weasley (who should be at least a few years older) and Bellatrix Lestrange (who should probably be a good few years younger that in 'canon', having gone to school with Sirius and Snape).

I don't recall if it's explicitly stated, but Andromeda at least has to be born before 1955-56, if she graduated before birthing Tonks by 1974 (+11+7(hogwarts)+3(Auror academy)=1995)

EDIT: Just checked OotP. Bellatrix is older than Andromeda though, according to her placement on the family tree, so I suppose that Sirius just messed up something in GoF (or refered to Rabastan and the woman /he/ was about to marry...)
