  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** dirgewithoutmusic has a great series focused on the girls of HP.

Each oneshot in the series focuses on a different girl. Included are Susan Bones, Parvati Patil (made me cry like a little bitch baby), Hannah Abbott, Cho Chang, Ginny Weasley, Pansy Parkinson, Andromeda Tonks, and Luna Lovegood.

linkao3(we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within)

I'd definitely recommend you read them all but Parvati's, Hannah's, and Ginny's were particularly good.

edit: don't know if the bot can link to a series on ao3 so here's [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/136245][the link to the page.]]

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

#+begin_quote
  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't? --- Multi-Pairings, Semi-Canon, Rated M for violence, language and the possibility of sexual content.
