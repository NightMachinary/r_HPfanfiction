Between house elves and magic why bother with stores at all? Why can't they just put a charm on their clothes and make new ones? Same goes for food.

Thoughts?


** Same reason you could renovate your home or even build your own car, but probably leave that to the specialists.

** Food is one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law of Transfiguration, so people can't make it themselves.

There's plenty of stuff I could theoretically do myself: slaughter animals for food, install electric wiring in my house, build my own car, etc, but I leave these things to the specialists. I assume wizards do the same.

** Only wealthy families tend to own house elves, and most people aren't going to be that good at transfiguration in order to make their own things from scratch. Food also can't be created from nothing it's Gamp's law.

I guess it's the same reason we buy furniture and things we could make ourselves, most people aren't going to go through that much effort when you can buy it somewhere.

Now here's a question I have: just how rare is House Elf ownership? If memory serves, the only families canonically stated to own House Elves are Malfoy, Crouch, and Black; and if we go by just how bent out of shape Lucius got when he was tricked into freeing Dobby that was probably his only one, too.

**** I imagine a majority of the pure blood families have them, like the blacks they probably have had them for generations. Families that don't have as much money like the Weasley's aren't going to have them unless, they've had one in the family before. Dobby is an outlier, because he wants to be paid. It's not like house elves cost much to keep, it's just initially buying one I presume.

I think Lucius got really angry because it was Harry that outsmarted him, and the fact Dobby, his punching bag is taken away from him.

Since Hogwarts has so many elves, they can't be that uncommon. Also depends on the type of people that are comfortable with essentially having a slave. People that treat their house elves well also have a much better bond, as seen with Barty/Winky, and Kreacher/Regulas.

*** I expect that's more the difference between being able to hit a target at 15 yards with a pistol vs being able to do anything except scramble /away/ when someone walks into the building with an uzi and starts shooting.

It's not so much that they can't cast a shield charm, but they can't cast a shield charm /effectively/ in a combat situation.

** In addition to the two points being raised by others in this thread (that magic is difficult, and that there are some hard limits on what you can create out of nothing), it's also important to remember that the vast majority of wizarding shops sell magical goods. No one is going around purchasing iron ore when they can transfigure it for themselves. They are buying enchanted items which take magical skill to create.

** Magic is hard, and even without it, most of the shops we see in the Harry Potter provide things that cannot be created from nothing :\\
- Fortescue or Honeydukes provide food, exception of Gamp Law and everything.\\
- Florry & Botts have books, knowledge that can't be created from scrape.\\
-Owl Imperium or Apothicary provide either alive animal or part of magical animal, that can't be created.\\
-Quidditch Supply or shops like Burgin&Burks provide professionnal quality enchanted item. Anybody can enchant or curse an item, but only a master of craft can reach the level of what they do.\\
-Olivander sells wand, and seem to be the only one able to create one in Brittain

Honnestly, the only shop we see that could be passed seem to be Mme Malkins. But even there, we don't know how hard clothes are to create, and there is style the option of style (anyone can make a robe, but only her can do beautifull one).

** I assume transfigurating items and conjuring them are not permanent, so they will eventually turn back or fade away with time. Imagine walking down Diagon Alley with your fancy robes, only for them to fade away because the magic ran out. Whoops!

Magic cannot create permanently. It can speed up the process and take some of the back breaking labor out of it, but if you create a chair out of nothing, or transfigure a log into a chair, over time that chair will either turn back into air or back into a log.

Thats probably why Food is considered an exception to Gamps Law of Transfiguration. You COULD turn sawdust into mashed potatoes, but the mashed potatoes will still have the nutrition value of saw dust, and will probably turn back into sawdust in your stomach or intestines.

** Magic isn't permanent.

It can last for longer or shorter periods of time, depending on the skill with which the spell was cast, and the power involved, however it eventually succumbs to entropy.

​

Runes, an arithmantic expression of a spell, can last for a very long time, but they need to be carved into unforgiving medium, and then have power fed into them. Depending on the mediums material and size, you could have something ~practically~ permanent, in that once charged it lasted for decades or even centuries, however the size required for a runestone that size really only makes it applicable in warding situations.

Most enchanted items will only work for a period of time. Clothing is stitched with unicorn tail hair, forming runes, and can be counted on to last a couple of years. A broomstick, being made of hardwood, can last for decades, as can an expanded trunk. But in the end it all falls apart.
