As for the witch/wizard in question: they believe that it's past time for the Statute to be ended, and for the Magical and non-Magical worlds to be brought together, in the hopes of creating a brighter future for all Terrestrial life.

How Harry responds to this I leave up to the author; but it would be interesting to see him reflect on some of his decisions/actions taken while working for the Ministry, and wonder if perhaps he's become too complacent with the status quo.
