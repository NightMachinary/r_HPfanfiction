** One of the main reasons that I fell in love with the Harry Potter series is because of the abuse, I identified directly with it. I spent several years in a similar environment, I was locked in a closet, I had no bed, I had been handcuffed to a radiator at night, I was denied food for days at a time as punishment. I was force to dig a ditch around our house so my step father could fix the leaking basement, had to sleep in said basement until the job was complete. etc etc, I remained in this situation until I was 8 and the state came and took me from it. I know what abuse is and Harry was definitely abused. In regards to the justification of being denied food only a couple of days, This is a horrible thing for anyone to go through, much less a child. The matters of Harry's abuse is only compounded by the fact that Dudley was treated so well to the point of spoiling. There are signs of physical abuse as well, but they are mostly in the form of Dudley and his crew "Harry Hunting." Vernon and Petunia encouraged the behavior even going so far as to telly Dudley to hit him with the Smelting's Stick.

I can understand why most people shy away from characterizing Harry's treatment as abuse, because it makes people uncomfortable. People who haven't been through it don't understand it and most can't identify anything but extreme abuse as abuse.

I don't think it needs to be said but, I say let everyone enjoy Harry Potter in terms that they enjoy it in and stop criticizing them for not enjoying it the way you do.

I agree with everything else you've said but this, especially in cases where people use excuse of "children's book" and their enjoyment of the story to downplay child abuse. I feel like I have to call people out in these cases.

The stories we tell ourselves, that we read, shape who we are and how we look at the world. I have not faced it personally IRL but I will not excuse child abuse of any sort nor will I ever allow others to do so without challenge. Nor should you.

** A lot of this is because the focus of the series completely changes in the middle of the book. At the start of the series it is an archetypical children's fantasy novel with elements of boarding school stories and mystery stories. You have a lot of the common archetypes of these stories such as the bully, the wise old man, incompetent adults, the idea of the journey etc. Are the Dursley's really that different from, for example, the Wormwoods in Matilda? Just like the Wormwoods the Dursley's are cartoonish villains with highly exaggerated features. We're supposed to be disgusted by them but also laugh at them a little bit.

The series changes somewhere between Cedric's death and 'I must not tell lies'. It becomes less of fun adventures and a payoff at the end. Part of this is also because Rowling is not as subtle (though probably just as effective given Umbridge) with her satire. The tone of the series changes and suddenly you have a more mature perspective of the anxieties of the Dursley's. They want to kick him out not just because they hate him but because they're legitimately terrified for their lives.

So judging by how the series ends it is totally correct to say that Harry was abused. I think it is CoS when Harry pranks Dudley pretending to do magic and 'narrowly dodges a frying pan' and then is given an insane list of chores to do. But with the change in tone in the series the Dursley's change too. They're still horrible but by book five it is nearly always for a reason and not for the sake of it.

It is not wrong to change the focus of your story especially if you had no idea it would blow up and receive the scrutiny it would. Rowling's strength is characters. Personally it is fascinating to see how the characters respond to this change in tone as well (even if this change is in my opinion unrealistic in the clusterfuck that is hbp).

*** Also I am certainly not an authority on abuse and I wouldn't know if what the Dursley's did to Dudley was abuse but I don't think anyone can deny that they fucked his life up too. It would be very difficult for him to be a functioning member of society.

He asks for (and gets) a second TV only because he does not want to make the walk from the kitchen to another room. He has two bedrooms for eleven years. He is taught that it is right for him to hit people with a stick to get what he wants. All his worst habits are enabled and all intervention (such as with his grades and his weight) are denied.

For example, I know exactly what the cupboard under the stairs Rowling would have had in mind would look like, because I'm familiar with British homes - and so would have been her original intended readerbase, so she might not have thought to add exact details at any point.

(For reference it would be about the space of a standing wardrobe, or perhaps a little more, maybe 3-4 feet wide, perhaps 1-2 feet deep, and with a slanted roof that would top out at maybe 5 or 6 feet tall depending on where under the stairs it was located.)

** None of this would be in any way contentious, but many people are very deeply ideologically invested in the idea that Rowling is a wonderful author that can do no wrong. If you can't accept the fact that there's many parts of HP that are terribly written and make no sense, you will be almost incapable of accepting that Harry has been abused, because suddenly a lot of the supposedly good guys don't look so good anymore: Yet this makes no sense, since a good writer wouldn't write things that make no sense and they wouldn't want their paragons of virtue to look like gigantic assholes.

So instead of realizing that JKR fucked up and didn't think many things through at all they have to jump through all kinds of hoops to explain away what's clearly written in the books.

If it weren't for this kind of cognitive dissonance I doubt I'd have to explain to people that Harry was abused and that Dumbledore is a bastard for putting him there (and I'm convinced that 99% of people would agree if I removed these situations from the context of HP, yet somehow when we are talking about HP child abuse and neglect are some kind of grey moral issue and people aren't responsible at all for their charges who they place with abusers).

Wasn't that the entire point?

Like, I think its fanon that the Wizarding World is a wonderful world. A /lot/ of what Rowling puts into the HP books is a scathing critique of elements of her own society, British society, with its different rules for different classes, corrupt and manipulative media, jobs for the boys and money used to open doors, and extending to things like bigotry having a blind eye turned to it when its not politically expedient.

Just because a character is on the side of the angels and is perceived as good by other characters does not mean necessarily we are to read them as a perfect character. That's almost surface level in Deathly Hallows rather than subtext.

No you definitely have a point, but this is part of the "backpedaling" I've been talking about in another comment. JKR acknowledges some of the problems she created in the later books, but only at the barest minimum level, so that people can say "see it all makes sense".

But lets be more concrete, maybe you can explain it to me in a way that makes sense for the first time ever: Lets assume for a second that the favorite bashing theories (Dumbledore left Harry downtrodden and abused so that Harry would look up to him and to better manipulate Harry...) are untrue. How does it make even a lick of sense that Harry is just left to his own devices for 10 years by Dumbledore, with a Dumbledore who knows about the prophecy, knows about Voldemort's likely survival and knows that Harry most likely would have to face Voldemort or his followers in battle? Why would he do this if he isn't evil, incompetent or senile? Who would just dump prophecy boy with Wizard hating muggles and not look after him on a weekly basis (by proxy if necessary)?

Just to pre-empt: Don't give me that "normal childhood" bullcrap. That's both incompetent and senile. Clearly Harry didn't have a normal childhood and obviously having a normal childhood is not preferable over being alive (which Dumbledore seems to acknowledge... blablabla blood protections, it's necessary, but hey, on the other hand you have to remain innocent and pure when it suits my reasoning).

***** Simple, there's a good reason that children can't have a wand and learn magic before they turn 11 (not sure what, doesn't truly matter) so even if he wanted to he couldn't train Harry to fight, not to mention that he doesn't think Harry needs to be trained.\\
The prophecy is fate, noone but Harry can kill Voldemort and noone but Voldemort can kill Harry and they will face each other one day, therefore Harry's safety is all but guaranteed. His mother's protection, which requires that he live with his only relatives, will defend him from Voldemort (and is likely what Dumbledore expects to finally slay him, not superior dueling ability) and his followers as long as he's there. He still moves Mrs. Figg into the area, and unless she says there's a problem he has no reason to pay extra attention.\\
He then comes to school, does admirably when he faces Voldemort, the protection proving its worth, showing that keeping it active is clearly the key to his victory. I personally think the Mirror would have kept the stone safe indefinitely if Harry hadn't been there, and if not then certainly lasted long enough for Dumbledore to face the intruder (something clearly tipped him off so that he returned). So while getting the boy his letter had been a problem, it's clear the current path is the right one and Harry himself is healthy enough (Pomphrey certainly examined him enough times).\\
The protection is perhaps less effective after Voldemort returns, but the house should still be the safest place (the death eaters never do manage to get past it's protection after all, they're forced to wait until it runs out), add in the realisation that Voldemort can likely see through Harry's eyes, perhaps even possess him or read his mind and it seems best to keep him away from the Order and what they know, lest it leak to Voldemort. He's moved when the dementors attack, this might even call into question the safety of Privet Drive, but then at the end of the year we learn that it wasn't Voldemort or his followers, which explains why the protection failed, along with Mundungus being an idiot (but when you're slandered by the government you can't be picky, and at least he can be trusted not to betray them).\\
Then 6th year comes and suddenly we're on a time limit, that cursed ring somehow got Dumbledore, he doesn't know where the other Horcruxes would be, only that the locations matter to Tom, so he teaches Harry everything he knows about the man, in the hopes Harry will be able to do some investigating of his own, the rest of his time is spent searching and investigating in person whenever he's not needed at the ministry or Hogwarts. Then he dies.

I can understand why you'd immediately jump to the "turn Harry into a warrior soldier" (like the other poster) conclusion, but that's truly not what I'm thinking of. Having Harry being a well adjusted kid, who experienced love, knows about the sacrifice of his parents, a kid who has friends and knows about who he is is a universally good thing.

This literal interpretation is nonsense and I doubt very much Dumbledore believes in it. In fact I think Dumbledore makes it very clear that the prophecy is only significant because Voldemort believes in its inevitability.

Outside of what Dumbledore believes the Prophecy giving Harry some kind of invulnerability from anyone besides Voldemort just turns most of the books into a big joke. Dementors? No big deal! Last minute rescue by Fawkes? Completely unnecessary... etc.

Canon is very clear that Harry deliberately has a shitty childhood and adolescence deliberately to isolate him and leave him ripe to be manipulated into becoming a martyr for the wizarding world, for the greater good, to have low self-worth and sacrifice himself willingly for those who showed him kindness. DH and the books up to it lay that out quite plainly not even in the subtext. It's a big plot point.

I agree, but this kind of character catharsis was not wanted by JKR. She wanted the innocent and sacrificial jesus figure and went with that all the way.

In my opinion the least Dumbledore could have done is tell Harry everything, see whether that changes him and if it does just obliviate the crap out of him. At least that would have forced Dumbledore to take some moral responsibilities for his actions. But I guess that would have been "evil"?

Her clumsly attempts to reconcile Dumbledore's actions with his characters (most prominent in Book 5) are evidence of this. She just wanted her benevolent old Grandfather magical mentor and the poor abused boy ripped out of his old world, thrust into the new. She had a similar problem with Severus Snape, where she had this tragic hero archetype in mind and just failed to pull it off.

There's plenty of these situations in the later books where JKR goes out of her way to explain herself through her characters' voices "You see, it all makes sense because..." and I can't imagine any author doing it this way if they had thought of the implications beforehand.

***** Snape is a tragic hero. He's also a bad person. Those two don't contradict each other (though they often go hand in hand in fiction) and Rowling never tried to make him out to have been a paragon of virtue. He was a petty, bitter person who didn't value his life much and so was willing to sacrifice it to defeat the murderer of the woman he loved - not to save the world, and not because of idealism.

Similarly, Dumbledore was never meant to be a paragon of virtue. He's not the manipulative old man bash fics portray him as, he didn't set Harry up to face Voldy in the mirror room at the end of PS. But he did knowingly let Harry suffer, and feels guilty for that even in the early books.

I probably shouldn't have mentioned Snape, because I can certainly see a bit more of a point here as opposed to Dumbledore (Dumbledore as a 'failed' character is more clear cut to me).

The term "tragic hero" is probably very subjective, but I wouldn't call Snape any kind of hero. I'm not saying this crude comparison is exactly the same, but would you call a school shooter who regrets it and starts giving CPR to one of his victims (while leaving all the others to die) a hero? Probably not. And this is somewhat the same way I see Snape. What he does is barely enough to make up for the pain and suffering he and his precious Dark Lord (people tend to forget that he joined Voldemort willingly and only objected when it was his teenage crush that was supposed to be murdered) brought upon the world. Elevating him to a hero is vile (to my moral compass... I acknowledge that some people look at it differently). I'm not even sure that he even balances the scales. "Oh great, you are trying to make up for the other piece of shit that you are, how great. No. Wait. That's literally the least you could do you garbage person!"

A Hero in the Greek sense is a person of special strength, courage, and ability. This is something that Snape definitely was, as he managed to spy on Voldemort for Dumbledore without being caught. However, they don't have to be good people, and often weren't.

Snape is a Tragic Hero in the sense that he got so lost in his bitterness and hate that he became the thing he hated most: a bully.

Part of the beauty of the books is the way they teach that we can't trust “good guys” to do the right thing all the time. Just about all of her characters, even ones who seem mostly good, seriously fuck things up at some point. This makes perfect sense because real people fuck up like that too.

I disagree. We are clearly not meant to think too much about the child abuse. It's not like Rowling with the intent of exploring the subject. It's just a plot device, so that we can have a young hero ripped out of his world, who doesn't have many ties with his old one and happily embraces the new. This is why it's in the book, not because Rowling wanted to show the evils of child abuse. It's even more blatant considering how perfectly normal and well-adjusted Harry acts in almost all instances (you'll have to go to fanfics to see a Harry that's a bit more authentic in regards to his background).

Just imagine if Harry had been a normal kid with a more or less normal upbringing: Rowling would constantly have to address and involve Harry's guardians who are worried about their kid into the stories, wanting to remove him from Hogwarts, Harry would have been homesick and not appreciated Hogwarts as much, etc.

It's like you defending the fantasy cliche about the hometown of the hero being burned down by orcs and his parents murdered and saying "well, it's important to show the evils of parent-murdering-orcs", that's not bad writing. Sure... fine. It's still cheap and dumb writing though and no one would seriously argue that some kind of point about the ethics of warfare is being made by the author (besides the surface level of orcs = bad, poor orphan boy = good)?! It's just a lazy way to get the story going.

What are you talking about? He's completely normal, he immediately makes friends at Hogwarts, is outgoing, not afraid of adults (he even gives them lip and challenges them), comfortable sleeping with a bunch of strangers in a dorm, no panic attacks while locked-in or restrained, literally anything else that Harry says or does. This is not even remotely close how a kid that has been living in a cupboard would act. At all.

******* Not everyone is affected by abuse the same way or to the same degree. Harry is shown to be somewhat affected by his upbringing.

- He is not outgoing, he doesn't have many close friends aside from Ron and Hermione. He is the most popular child in the wizarding world, and yet his social circle only really expands in 4th and 5th year. I imagine a Harry raised by Sirius would be the Cedric Diggory of his year.

- He doesn't trust adults (and authority in general), and prefers to keep things secret from them in ways that often end up badly for him. It doesn't help that the few times he tries to reach out to adults he's often rebuked or ignored.

I'd expect him to be more affected, but to say this has no effect on him is wrong.

Rowling chooses interactions and and events that move her various plots forward.

Adults is a mixed bag. Harry trusts Dumbledore, he listens to Dumbledore. He also trusts Sirius and Lupin, expressing fears and feelings to each in different turns.

I'm pretty sure Harry and Luna shared more 1 on 1 time them Harry and Ginny.

I'll ship Harry with just about any girl, but Ginny honestly stumps me. I can't think of any reason for them to be together except that she's Ron's sister.

My current favorite pairing with Harry is Daphne, because I don't remember them ever interacting in canon and it amuses me, or Tsukino Usagi, which is from this crackfic where Sailor Moon's ghost starts following him around and a drug addicted and senile Dumbledore wanted to get Harry M-preg by Snape to unlock the live powers to defeat Voldemort.

The effectiveness of the so called blood protections is very dubious considering that Harry doesn't sit in the house all day and also considering the events with the Dementors. They also didn't do him any good protecting him from his evil relatives.

Additionally there's plenty of ways to magically hide and protect someone besides these blood protections (which again, aren't even that good... the only indication that they are useful is that Harry is still alive, which is just as well explained by Death Eater stupidity).

Furthermore, even if one were to accept the dubious claim that there's no other way to protect Harry (or that the blood protections are good at all), that doesn't mean that Harry has to remain there helpless and unmentored for 11 years. Usually here the Dumbledore apologia starts to boil down to him being either incompetent (can't do anything against hateful muggles) or senile (forgot about Harry or too busy).

It's clear that many readers and fanfic authors imagine the blood protection as a Death Eater impenetrable force field surrounding 4 Privet Drive when that is never specified in the books. It could also be a reality warping spell similar to the Fidelius that makes it so that Voldemort and all those who support him simply never conceive of a plan to attack Harry Potter in or around his home. Or that whenever they attempt a plan to do so, they experience incredibly bad luck that forces them to stop this plan.

The reality wrapping is out of the question since Voldemort makes a plan to attack Harry while he is still covered by the protection in DH, and that plan calls for an immediate attack upon leaving. But the entire scene is one giant plothole and a "The Fast and the Furious" car chase would probably have worked better, so maybe it's for the best if we don't dig too deep.

****** There's no proof that the wards on the house did anything at all. We never hear of anyone making any attempt to bypass them to know that they even work. At the end of OoTP when Dumbledore is justifying his treatment of Harry he mentions that Harry made it to Hogwarts safe but he doesn't reference any specific threat that ever occurred and that was the moment to do so as he was trying to convince Harry that he had done the right thing. If he could have said, you had to be with the Dursley's because on three occasions the wards there saved you from these people, he absolutely would have, as it would have made his point far better than empty platitudes about doing what he felt was best.

And as for it being not just the wards that kept Harry alive but his personal protection, both disappeared at the start of the 7th book when Harry turned 17 so it certainly wasn't what saved Harry in DH. And there is no guarantee that Harry would have been killed at the end of the first book without it either. Dumbledore was on his way and Quirrell was trying to get the stone off Harry. We don't know how things would have played out but it's likely Harry only needed a little more time before Dumbledore came to the rescue.

Also we know that the protection was tied to the wards and if one failed the other would too. But that is only because Dumbledore used the existing protection to create the wards. Lily's protection was originally on Harry. There's the possibility that had Dumbledore not interfered in the protection in order to use it to power the wards it would have just remained with Harry and he'd still have been protected.

Beyond that, even if we assume Harry absolutely had to be with the Dursley's to be safe, it doesn't mean that Dumbledore is not responsible for Harry's treatment there just because there was ‘no other way'. One letter addressed to the cupboard under the stairs is enough to convince the Dursley's that they are being monitored by Wizards and move Harry to a proper bedroom. All Dumbledore needed to do during those 10 years was make it clear that they were being watched and their treatment of Harry would have improved. They would never have loved him but at least he might have been guaranteed food and an actual room to live in.

However, being locked up for days and not able to contact anyone would be a safety issue, especially in the case of Harry who has a lot of enemies. As well, from the way love is studies in the DoM and how magic is based on emotions, magicals probably had an earlier understanding of the impact of abuse and neglect on social, emotional and mental development and wellfare.

** I don't know.... this guy's reading of the books comes across as a little biased. He infers a lot of things from offhand remarks made by the characters and then calls it "proof." I'm sorry, but Vernon saying that he SHOULD have beaten Harry, or THREATENING to beat Harry, or Vernon just "being the sort of person who WOULD hit Harry," is NOT proof that Vernon beat Harry on a regular basis. There's a lot of "if this character said/did this, then OBVIOUSLY they must also have done THIS, which means they were ALWAYS doing it."

I definitely see how emotionally invested he is in this, which I get... I mean, child abuse is a serious topic, and I think he mentions having been abused as a child himself. So it's not like I don't understand where he's coming from. But I think he's kind of making the common mistake of having drawn the conclusion first and then deliberately reading the text in a way that supports his conclusion while ignoring the parts of the text that don't.

I checked his FFN profile, and the profile is largely dedicated to a long rant about how Ron and Hermione don't work as a couple because doofus comic-relief sidekick Ron isn't WORTHY of the awesomeness that is Hermione... including a mind-boggling misreading of that infamous JKR interview where he somehow draws the conclusion that Ron/Hermione is "NOT really canon (but the author's OWN A.U.)" because... actually I'm a little unclear about that. I think because JKR said in the interview that Harry and Hermione COULD have been a thing, this guy has decided that Harry/Hermione is canon and Ron/Hermione is an AU that she wrote and published instead of the actual canon because... reasons? I have no idea.

This guy's certainly got some creative interpretations of the text, I'll give him that. Wouldn't take his word as gospel though.

For what it's worth: I don't think Harry was ever beaten severely. He might have got a clip around the ears, or picked up and hauled into his cupboard/room... which is bad ENOUGH, mind you, but Vernon just strikes me as the sort of person who's a lot more roar than bite. He'd be far more likely to THREATEN Harry than actually DO anything.

This doesn't mean Harry wasn't abused, but I think most of it was emotional abuse and neglect, not physical. The Dursleys were so obsessed with appearing "normal" that I don't think they'd do anything that would leave visible marks. What would the neighbours think?!

** My biggest issue with this guy's thesis, which I largely agree with, is that he never seems to acknowledge that the books are told from Harry's point of view. We're seeing the world through the eyes of a kid who's seen some shit, but who is still human. Pretty much every kid has, at some point, said "My mom/dad/adult would kill me!" It's not necessarily an indication of habitual abuse or a real fear for their lives, but totally normal hyperbole. Harry's words, those cases, shouldn't necessarily be taken as literal without additional context, however there is plenty of evidence in the text that he suffered severe physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the Dursleys.

If you wanna give a shit about authorial intent, it's clear that when Rowling wrote the first book, she was going for a more fantastical children's story than what she ended up with in the end. Something like Matilda, with adults doing over the top violence to children, and the kids getting one over on them in the end. That level of violence is out of place in the story that Harry Potter became, and the transition between the two was...not smooth.

The story grows with Harry, so it makes sense that the way he perceives the world in the first book is that of a child. Since all but like 2 chapters in the whole book are told from Harry's point of view, everything is filtered by his way of looking at the world.

The OP treats the hyperbolic thoughts and words of a 10 year old as objective truth, even going so far as to ignore the idiomatic use certain threats and treat them as though Harry wouldn't know to interpret them as such, despite him being shown to be a clever child. Many children of abuse tend to be clever, because spotting the difference between bluster and impending violence is a means of survival.

******* It's a common idiom because child abuse is common. If wives commonly said “My husband would kill me” that would mean that wife abuse was common. People talking about their fear of being killed by family members is a sign of abuse.

******** No, it's a common idiom because our society presents violence as an expected retaliation for everything. You're completely ignoring the fact that in real life, this is literally a way that that phrase is used even when nobody is being abused.

From [[https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/I%27m+going+to+kill]] (one) is going to kill (someone)

One will be extremely, belligerently angry with someone (though not with an actual intent to kill them). Mom is going to kill you if she finds out you broke her antique vase!

I never argued that abused didn't happen. I argued that the original poster's argument had some flaws, which it does, regardless of whether I agree with his conclusions or not. I'm coming at this as a mother of 5 healthy happy kiddos who holds a degree in english lit.

************ I disagree that the phrase, since it's common vernacular, is a red flag in individual cases without additional context. The issues that cause these phrases to continue to linger is baked deep into american culture, and it seeps up in things like this all the time. The language we use, the way we view the world, the fact that we still believe in things like possession by right of conquest and that the majority of our funds goes to funding a military that is far beyond any reasonable need. Every one of these things contributes to this culture of violence.

Not every "I'm gonna kick your ass for that" is an actual threat of violence. It's not an indicator that the speaker will enact violence, and nor that they are the target of violence. It's an indication that they were raised in a culture of violence that sees blowing someone's head off as totally fine, but tits are taboo.

This is why context matters. If spoken by a tearful 4 year old, it's an immediate cause for alarm. If spoken by an adult who forgot to water her mom's plants while she was out of town, or a teenager when they backed mom's new car into the mailbox, it's probably hyperbole.

*********** You said that this phrase isn't a sign of abuse. I'm sorry I don't have the link, but I read an article by an American whose family moved to, I think, Sweden when he was a kid. So this American kid is hanging out with Swedish kids, and at some point says some normal American thing like “My parents will kill me if I do x” and the Swedish kids were like “wtf?”

Pretty soon, social workers came to visit his family to talk about the “abuse,” and all of them, even the kid, were like, “Ha, this is just a silly misunderstanding. That's just a phrase. We just discipline our kids the normal way,” and the social workers were like, “The normal way?” and when they got details, said, “That's abuse. That's illegal here.” After some parenting classes, the American parents learned a more Swedish parenting style that doesn't involve violence or death threats.

The adult writing this marveled that he'd been sending up this big red flag without even realizing it. He'd accepted the American culture of violence so blindly, he hadn't even realized how messed up it is.

Your unsourced Swedish example further illustrates why context matters. A swedish social worker is likely not steeped in American culture, and is likely less familiar with American idiom. A decent american social worker is more likely to be familiar with the phrase and the common ways that its used.

** This. This is why, I just can't, can't forgive Albus Dumbledore's character. You can give me all the fucking explanations for why that house was his best shot in '81. It wasn't in '91 when a letter was addressed to a cupboard, or in '92 when there were bars on his window- and you can tell me how adults thought it was just Fred and George being them, trying to avoid punishment from taking the car - he ask to not be sent back. He is taught that only magical danger matters. That his state of mind doesn't. That his health is minimal concern. He may not think this consciously, but unconsciously? This is the 17 yo who spite having finally people who loved him and cared for him, accepted to kill himself. Because magic, the world, everyone was more important than him.

** I always get downvoted on these threads due to the fact that my opinion is the complete opposite of everyone else and it causes issues.

Harry was not abused, per se. I do believe he was neglected, though. He was not ‘starved', but he was not given the right amount of food for a growing boy. There is nothing to indicate that all he got was a piece of stale bread and some soup each day. The only time we see food withheld is when he does something wrong, which is a very common punishment.

There are two points that are used as a case of abuse.

1. Frying pan incident

The frying pan incident where Petunia tries to hit Harry with a frying pan. We are given no indication that she swing this pan with all her might and aimed to uppercut him with the pan. He managed to dodge the pan, which proves that it was going a speed that allowed him to actively react to. For all we know, she swung it at the back of his head with little force in an attempt to bump him with it. You know, much like people do when they slap the back of someone's head.

Also, the book was set in the late 80s and early 90s. I am certain a lot of kids were hit with the belt or other household objects. I mean, my mum was often hit by whatever her mother had in her hand.

1. Dudley.

This one is grasping at straws.

However, the series is seen through the eyes of a child and children exaggerate. He was not beaten to a pulp as he still spoke back to the Durley's, still had fun, and was still mischievous. Sure, maybe he was a little bit, it is nothing like the average fanfic portrays for a cheap gimmick and weak backstory.

As for Dumbledore, this just amuses me because what else could he do? He wanted to give Harry a regular life without having to worry about having a raving murderer after you. Imagine telling him and then watching as the boy grew up scared and afraid. Also, he is not the only person to put a child with their family, even if it is a bad thing to do.

#+end_quote

Yeah, no. The exact quote is

#+begin_quote
  he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.
#+end_quote

What do we learn from this sentence. Petunia 'aims' her blow specifically at Harry's head. The strike is 'heavy' which means she may well have been putting quite some strength behind it. The frying pan in question is soapy, Petunia's hand are likely also soapy, she could have easily lost control of it and it could have slipped out of her hands.

Harry is noted multiple times to have great reflexes, especially given the position he plays in Quidditch which basically requires them. His ability to dodge is therefore likely to be higher than the average person's. Not including the fact that he likely began to react as soon as she turned, rather than mid-swing, because of previous experience. Harry comments in HBP that 'long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible'.

*** Hate to pop the bubble here but neglect is an objective form of abuse. Withholding food is sometimes a harsh punishment dished out but the abuse comes in the fact that they did it so often when we clearly see that harry did not deserve such a punishment.

With the frying pan, you could do a bit of a test here, go to the kitchen and lightly bop yourself on the head with one, should you? No, of course not, getting bopped with any sort of metal object freaking hurts. Frying pans are different than belts obviously, belts ,when used, inflict pain, pans cause physical injury.

With Dudley and the dursleys I think you should just read the linked post from OP they highlight the reality of the situation pretty well. That's pretty much all the explaining needed there.

That being said "x is a child, children exaggerate" is probably the absolute worst thing you can say when confronted with the possibility that a child is being abused. An important thing to ask yourself is "what age would a child need to be before I WOULD believe them when they say they're being beaten to a pulp".

Finally with dumbledore. There's more options out there than tell a baby "a terrorist is after him and he's the only one who can kill said terrorist" and sending him to a home filled with the "worst sort of muggles". I dont blame dumbledore for not knowing what hellhole he put harry in, the guy clearly trusted the woman he put in charge of watching over him so if anything it's her fault Harry's life was absolute shit for over a decade. doesn't change the fact that harry was abused either way.
