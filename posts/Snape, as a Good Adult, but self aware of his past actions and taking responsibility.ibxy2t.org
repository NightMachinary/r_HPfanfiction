Hello Reddit.

Today, I am seeking out new fanfictions with this specific requirement: I'd like a mentor or family relationship between Snape and Harry, but without elements of woobifying or pretending that Snape wasn't a toxic adult as his canon default. You know, those stories that have a clear bias with the Marauder's Era and lean in extremely heavily? Please no.

I want some longfics where Snape develops past childhood grudges and matures or specifically hits a spot where he can stop making excuses for not seeing Harry as anyone besides his father. I want a slow burn positive adult relationship, even if that involves a peggy sue trope, or a "for want of a nail" situation.

As a note, I am a big fan of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]]?

Thank you in advance, Reddit! <3

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed, un-Britpicked, unapologetic.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
