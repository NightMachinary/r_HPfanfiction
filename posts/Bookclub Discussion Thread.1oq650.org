The story of this week was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]], if joining this thread you should have at least read the first 20 chapter, if you have read more and wish to discuss this please pretext your reply with a spoiler tag.

Start off general discussion questions (but feel free to put up your own):

- What do you think of the story so far?
- did you drop? if so why?
- The legacy spell/magic devices: Deus ex machina, plot armor or a valid tool, your opinion?
- Portrayal of characters: good, bad, ugly?
- Readability? (would you suggest it to others, style, grammar, dialog etc)
- What did you like and why?
- What didnt you like and why?
- Did you drop it, and if you did why did you?
- What could have been better?

Please try to give full answers :D

Other orders of business, it has been suggested that we should poll stories I wanna give this a try. However, I would like to do genre in alphabetical order, aka next week is Angst Week. So if you know a story of a readable and do able size and would like to put it in the poll please post it here, rule on this is: No Posting Own Work

Ok guy and gals lets do this :)

EDIT: I have opened a separate thread for compiling Angst fics, post your suggestion for Angst week there and vote with your karma. The fic with the highest karma, that is compete will be selected, if your from the club and think a particular fic should be read please say so in the comments in the "best Angst Stories" thread. And on a personal note, thank you guys and gals this first week has been great.


** Someone in the previous thread told that it gets better later on, so I didn't drop it on the first chapters (which felt like a really long introduction that even the author was not interested in putting there). Later on, however, things got somewhat more interesting. But the “interest level” was still fluctuating through the whole story.

I'll first write *what I did like*, and then what I did not.

- It's nice that this fic starts to differ from the canon so early on. Most other books that involve time travel of any kind usually end up just replaying the original events like the author is replaying the same game with only some cheats or mods enabled.
- *Spoiler* for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/31/][Ch. 31]]: I liked how Lily's defending of Harry was performed and described in this story. [[/spoiler][(“/... It's all I can give/”)]]
- *Spoiler* [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/10/][Ch. 10]]---34: It was nice that Harry was unable to cure the Longbottoms right away and had to really work on his knowledge before even attempting anything. It added some realism to the story, which it really needed in my opinion. The notion of human personality's fragility in the brain was also a nice touch.
- Grammar and language were more or less ok, even though there was no unique excellency to this author's style.
- *Spoiler* [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/30/][Ch. 30]]: [[/spoiler][“/Being centuries old, Nicholas and Perenelle remained silent but by his side, knowing that there were times one could provide no words of comfort or condolence, and that sometimes the best thing to do was be silent./”]] I liked this part.
- Nobody was trying to /stun/ Death Eaters.

Unfortunately, there is much more of *what I didn't* like in this fic. Here's most of it:

- Author's simulation of many characters is out of sync:

  - people constantly roll their eyes (Harry, Snape), punch walls when they are angry (Snape), poorly control their emotional outbursts otherwise (Harry, Snape, Dumbledore) and often can't keep their emotions in check (Snape, Bones, Dumbledore, Mcgonagall etc).
  - Slytherins become Harry's allies way too easily. Especially so the older generation.
  - Dumbledore was rarely proactive and Snape was doing everything for him---at one point Dumbledore even went to Snape to ask for what should they do next.
  - Z. Smith's extreme hostility towards Harry was never properly explained. As Draco became Harry's friend, Smith was just converted into the story's asshole.
  - Voldemort was completely unaware of what was happening under his nose.
  - Bella was made into a lunatic that was completely dis-attached from reality.
  - *Spoiler* for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/23/][Ch. 23]]---34: Two of the most powerful wizards of their century get serious injuries from simple gun bullets. In case of Dumbledore the bullet injury causes a permanent brain damage. In case of Voldemort, none of his death eaters are being capable of properly fixing the damage (again, from only a single bullet). I understand that the author wanted to make a point about how the 2 civilizations can learn from each other and so on, but for that purpose the whole magic was being constantly nerfed.

- Neville's toad [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet][Taking the killing curse]] at one point was completely ridiculous.
- *There* /was/ */too much unnecessary formatting/*.
- Story's overall pacing was unsteady, its ending was haphazard.
- Idiot Balls rolling all over (*spoilers* through the whole story below):

  - [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1oq650/bookclub_discussion_thread/ccugup1][as MeijiHao mentioned]], there was no good reason why Snape wouldn't tell Dumbledore what's really going on. But as original Dumbledore would be a too powerful ally for the story to work, he was awkwardly kept as a NPC.
  - When they assault Quirell, they make a nice small talk with him first so that he can prepare to defend himself and make a way for an Awesome Duel Battle Scene.
  - Snape “forgets” to do something with Peter, Peter escapes to VD and VD comes back as before.
  - Snape “forgets” to do something with Voldermort's father's bones, VD comes back as before.
  - Dumbledore gives away a sample of his blood as a blood donation supply. Seriously.
  - Dumbledore suspects Fudge to be under Imperio, gets a warning from Harry that VD is planning something for the day of his planned visit to Fudge in Ministry and still does nothing to prevent Harry from moving into a TRAP.

*** I really love how detailed your review of the story is.

It makes me realize how useful it can be for any fanfic writer lurking around here.

Also, it makes me wonder if it would be a good idea to invite the author of he chosen fanfic to the bookclub discussion thread. Chances are they won't be available, but on the off chance, it could be interesting.

You are quite thought-provoking OutOfNiceUsernames!

Why not? It's a good idea---constructive criticism can help the writer notice something that was being missed from the original perspective, and platforms like reddit can be good at keeping criticism constructive.

***** This /is/ a discussion thread, I don't think you /can/ make it too long.

We'll have to get our bookclub organizer to try and contact the author then for the next time. The main problem being if the fic is really really old and the author contact info is out of date or if he just doesn't care anymore about his fics.

I know if one of my fics was picked, I'd be delighted (after a sever depression due to much criticism of course), because it would be such a help to improve.

** - I loved the story. It isn't the type of fanfiction I usually go for (mine are normally ships) but this made me realize that it's possible to do a rewrite without it looking too 'off'.
- I read it all on the day it was posted. It was impossible for me to stop, so no, I definitely did not drop this one.
- The new spells/parselmagic were interesting. I didn't really care for the whole taboo legacy spell thing, I think too much weight was put on that. However, I really liked the healing magic. At times it was a bit too 'super!harry' but it was a central part of the plot.
- I liked the different take on the characters, but I didn't like how Sirius was portrayed (I can't remember how far in he shows up, so I don't think I'll get too into it).
- It wasn't a perfect fanfic. It was a long crackfic with humour and adventure. I don't really like to complain about small grammatical/spelling errors because at the end of the day, it's an online fanfiction. You didn't pay to read it, nor is anyone forcing you to read it. There weren't any glaring errors in my opinion, nothing so bad that I'd have to stop reading.
- I liked a fair amount. It was unique enough, and the whole Malfoy family being in debt to Harry was a nice way to move them away from Voldemort and have Draco as a potential friend.
- Though I liked Snape, he didn't seem realistic in this. Same with Harry, I understand that he has the potential to be studious and such but at times I couldn't handle it. Especially when [[/spoiler][he is completely unfazed by getting a broom for his birthday because he isn't bothered with Quidditch.]], it drove me insane. Also at times Harry seemed too perfect. Plus I didn't like how Hermione and Ron were barely mentioned (it made me sad). The whole Sirius thing pissed me off the most though.

I'd only recommend this story as an easy going read. It's simple, there's not a whole lot to it, and it's an easy way to pass the time. I read fics like crazy so I had no problem with it, but someone who doesn't read as much would find that it drags on a bit too much.

*** I have to say I wasnt a great fan of the story, the first few chapters were pretty good but then it seemed to descend into stupid ball tossing and 'and now Harry can do this'. Once it got to werewolf healing i felt that it really took a turn into the super!harry street, and would have liked to see more conflict with a 'big bad' just to knock that back a bit.

Snape was very off for me, I spent the first couple of chapters thinking he might have an ulterior motive aka using Harry's mage status to bring back Lilly, but it turned out his dark streak had been nurtured.

I'm glad you enjoyed it though because this is what this club is all about exposure and development :D

**** I mean, I read fanfiction all the time so it takes a lot for me to turn away from it. It was the equivalent of a Harlequin romance in terms of content but I found that it was a decent way to pass the time.

I love the bookclub idea, I would have never read that type of fanfiction otherwise :)

** I got to about chapter 18 and dropped it. I was torn between trying to read through it for the book club and wanting to drop it since about chapter 7.

It seems to suffer from absolutely random powerups when they could just solve the problems with effort instead. I can take a story with character powerups, but it's very bad form when they're just random bullet points thrown in to make characters awesome. Also, there was no tension in most of the story, probably due to the aforementioned powerups.

A good example is the legacy spell. Originally I had thought that Snape was just bullshitting Harry about casting a Legacy spell. Snape already knew that Harry would become awesome in the future because of timetravel, so he could lie to him to convince him to study hard in certain areas. Later on if the secret got called out, there could be tension about his ruse being a lie, him being asked to cast it on others, etc. But no, he actually just whipped out a hundred year old spell that has a stupidly narrow scope, and he got that power for /no reason/.

Similarly, Harry just overwhelms everything. When he heals a child recently bitten by a werewolf I can sorta buy that if it's fresh. But then a guy comes who's been a werewolf all his life begs for healing. I assume this will be a nice point of conflict where Harry isn't powerful enough, setting up a medium-long term goal and creating tension in the story. LOLNOPE. Instead Harry just kicks in super-saiyan mode and heals it anyways, then for extra measure explodes in healing that permanently vaccinates people.

The spelling and grammar were good. I didn't enjoy how much telling vs showing there was, but that's fairly common. Also I enjoyed the foreshadowing with Coral in class->Scabbers in class->Pettigrew joins Voldie early on. The Quirrelmort scene in chapter 6 was well done as well.

I did enjoy the characterization of everyone. Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, all the supporting cast, etc. They seemed believable and interesting. It's just that the plot/pacing/conflict in the story was so bad to overcome that.

Overall, I'd put thumbs down for it.

*** I, too, was so convinced Snape was bullshitting Harry about the legacy spell. It was a good idea, just not for this story.

And I agree with your views overall. I guess it qualifies as a super!harry fic, thus the lack of tension throughout the story.

**** I disagree that being a super!harry fic is what makes it tensionless; it's the mismatch of conflict to powers. The strongest Harry I can think of is from Wastelands of Time, with perfect foreknowledge throwing out building sized explosions and ancient magics, but the story is still interesting because Voldemort's omnipotent to counter him. Plenty of other fics do well with super!harry as well.

They just follow the rule. "You can't make Frodo a Jedi without giving Sauron the Death Star."

****** Would I recommend it? Erm.../sorta/.

It's well written and action packed, but it's almost not even a Harry Potter book. It's not set in Hogwarts, few canon characters are involved, and Harry is so OOC to be unrecognizable. But it's a good read and feels like the ultimate evolution of the super!timetravel!Harry genre.

Overall, I'd say it's worth a look and expect a high probability that you won't like it. It succeeds at what it sets out to do, but not everyone wants that in their fic.

*** It is so /so/ crucial to get your power scaling right, and just looking though the discussion its been the one of the core issues people are finding with trying to read this fic. For me the legacy spell, although being at the begin and heart of the story, still seem to come out of nowhere...

On healing, I've found that any story in which you can suddenly heal werewolfs begins to untangle pretty fast. As someone who studies disability rights, there's something that feels very off about the idea that if you 'heal' the defect in the body that everything will be ok, like the issue is in the impairment and not in the way that society treats of people with impairments...

** I dropped after chapter 7 or 8. The biggest problem I had with this story is something that a lot of fics get wrong: there is no real conflict. For as far as I read, Harry hasn't had to stuggle, at all. He's powerful, and happy, and well adjusted, and hard workiing and etc...Paragraphs of description about how well someone's life is going is only effective if it proceeds to get fucked up in some way.

The author did try to inject some dramatic tension into the story via the whole 'Snapes secret' plotline, but that didn't work either. The problem was that I as a reader had no reason to believe that it would be a problem if Dumble finds out that Snape traveled in time. Through the first 8 chapters, Dumbledore is depicted as a reasonable man who wants nothing but the best for Harry. That being the case, why would he be anything but happy that Snape came from the future?

In the positves column, the author does seem to have a decent grasp of the basic mechanics of writing. It was grammatically correct with no blatant typos, and the writing was technically solid. I'll also add that the concept of the legacy spell intrigued me, but I would have prefered a more elaborate version used in a better story.

I would not recommend this story to others.
