Fics where Harry is obsessed with money and making large amounts of it. Honestly, it doesn't necessarily have to make him be obsessed, but it would be nice if he at least put a good amount of emphasis on it, like in Business by Esama.

Thanks

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
