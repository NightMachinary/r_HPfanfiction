Where Harry falls through the veil to an alternate dimension where he trains. He then figures out that falling through the veil again will send him back to his old dimension at the same time he went through.

Anybody got a fanfic like that

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

** A large number of crossovers use the Veil for this.

linkffn(Wizard and Grimm) Harry ends up on Remnant, and Dumbledore is eventually able to follow, bringing Ron and Hermione with him. Voldemort also went through, which turned out to be a very bad idea for him, since souls cannot exist in multiple dimensions at the same time.
