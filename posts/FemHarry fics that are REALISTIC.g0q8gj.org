** Realistic in what sense? Like, the fem!Harry actually feels female or like the story is grounded in reality?

*** Fem!Harry is born female, "acts" like it and so on, and by realistic I mean that no one is overpowered and the story is kinds sticking to the canon.

**** Ah, okay. I don't really have any fem!Harry fics that stick to canon - they're mostly more... divergent than different, I suppose. Like, some have her still go through the Triwizard, but she handles it and the people around her totally differently.

And then there's a few which are different, like The Archaeologist by Racke, where male Harry gets punted to an alternate universe where he wakes up in his dead sister's body and becomes an Archaeologist/Curse Breaker type.

Other than Racke though, the only six good ones I know are all in the link Ceplma posted elsewhere in this thread (I posted in that thread too).

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** Not sure if you'd call this realistic, but its one of my favourite fics.

I think its a pretty good version of a female Harry.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I know a couple of one shots, but nothing long. They are “Charlotte the great” and “Harriet is....” they're absolutely fantastic, though Harriet is more similar to canon Harry (power of love and all that). Idk the authors, but they are on ao3 so if you search there they should come up.
