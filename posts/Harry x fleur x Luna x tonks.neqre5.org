It's a harry x tonks at first but they break up and then get back together.

Harry is close to Ginny at first but her attempts to control him pushed him away

He "inherits" an island and lives there.

I think he experiments with runes?

Any help would be great, thanks.


** Don't have a link, but pretty sure you're talking about "For the Love of Magic". It's.... well it's something espeically during the later chapters.
