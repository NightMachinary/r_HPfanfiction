Hi,

I just wanted to ask you if you knew good stories where Harry (or other characters) studies the Dark Arts, specially necromancy, and is very talented in that area. I would like the main character powerful also. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]], by Athey. I don't mind slash

Thanks! :D


** It's All Just Temporary with a Bit of Necromancy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19296382]]

So this is ongoing and if you don't mind, the ship is Tommary. There's nothing happening yet, but if you don't like it, that's fine. I just thought it would be a good one to look at.

*** Hahah thanks for the recommendation. Just yesterday I finished the fic, though I have to say that Harry is quite emotional.

He is so hot blooded, in fact, that I while I was reading I wanted to hang Harry in at least thousands of ways... üòåüòå

  They all thought Lily was Light. She wasn't. She was in love with the Dark Lord, and gave birth to his son. Now Erus Riddle is growing up, showing just how evil the son of Lord Voldemort can be. Of course, the Light doesn't know that fact. Slash later.

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.
