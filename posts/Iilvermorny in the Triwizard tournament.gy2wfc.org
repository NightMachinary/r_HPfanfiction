Any FF where Iilvermorny joins the tournament. I've found one but it was basically Harry as their champion. I want one without Harry being a student there but include a OC from there or something.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!

*** I've actually already read that one. I'm looking for one with a OC Ilvermorny champion where Harry is still a hogwarts student.
