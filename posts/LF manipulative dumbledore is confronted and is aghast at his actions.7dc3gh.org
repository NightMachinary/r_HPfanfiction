I have recently stumbled upon a few fics where Dumbledore is a manipulative old man, but he truly means best, so now im looking for fics where Harry confronts Dumbledore on his manipulations and what his actions have wrought, and Dumbledore only then realizes what he has done and is aghast at his actions. I just think that it could be such a fun premise to have a manipulative bad dumbledore that turns out to be a faulty well meaning old man ^{^}

*** Hmm...I only skimmed the first few paragraphs, the bit about letting the Malfoys go and how muggleborns were treated afterwards.

And now I'm thinking, I wonder if there's a story with the reversed concept? A Harry (or Dumbledore) who comes back in time to pursue the olive-branch, forgive-and-reform strategy, because their 'kill them all, no quarter' plan led to the escalation of the war and embroiling the magical world in violence for centuries.

**** Harry was quite lenient towards dark pureblood families in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855). On the other hand, a far more competent Ministry greatly limited the damages Voldemort and his ilk could cause. The Ministry itself also seemed to take a hardline stance against blood purist ideology so that questionable people like Thickeness didn't even make it into the Ministry.
