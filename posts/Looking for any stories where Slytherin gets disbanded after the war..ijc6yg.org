  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** linkffn(Name Games by i love music) has Slytherin cancelled and replaced with a new house, Columbidae. I didn't find it very good, but you might enjoy it!

linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) I found much better. This fic has a House Slytherin that's basically looked down upon after the Second War, and one of the major plot threads is building up the reputation of the house.
