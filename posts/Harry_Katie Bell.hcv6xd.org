This is somewhere between a request and discussion I guess, but I feel like Katie is the other girl with a crush on Harry in a ton of fics (think of Cadmean Victory for example) but are there any decent Harry/Katie fics?


** Sadly the only decent Harry/Katie fix I've found that wasn't a multi relationship or something was linkffn(hells bells) it was supposed to be book 6 but harry falls for Katie instead of ginny. But sadly it ended just after harry asks her to the slug club party.

** The problem with her is that she is just too similar to Ginny: Quidditch player, friend with Harry, and we don't know much more about her. Against her is that she is a year older, and the tradition still prefers younger women in a pair.

Otherwise, I still wonder whether somebody utilises the fact, that while Harry was waiting for his first Quidditch match, and being green from his nerves, there was next to him a year older girl with the same shade of colour on her face (because it was her first match as well). It had to be a bit of bonding experience.

*** Honestly, I put this down to fan-fic writers either not being capable enough or are just outright lazy in not developing Katie into a unique character.

Unlike Ginny, who is actually (sort of) fleshed out as the series went on as her screen-time increased, Katie is actually a bit of a blank slate.

We know that she was pissy with Harry in his first year for a while, after he, Hermione, and Ron lost a ton of points (calling him "the Seeker" instead of his name), like a lot of Gryffindors were.

We know she's a year older and, duh, on the Team as a chaser.

Her friend, maybe her bestie, is Leanne.

She's considered "kind".

She's susceptible to the Imperius Curse, but that's not exactly unique.

She's a Gryffindor, obviously, and was in the DA (not unique, again).

...That's it. We don't even know if she's muggleborn, a half-blood, or a pureblood, what her eye/hair colours are, et cetera. Hell, although it's highly unlikely, she could even be black or Latino!

Now, extrapolations could be made, like her liking sports/Quidditch or basing her appearance on her actress, the lovely Georgina Leonidas (since JKR had a direct role in choosing actors/actresses per character), but even then they can be subverted in clever ways because she's a blankish slate.

Did she feel guilty about treating Harry like that in First Year? Not guilty? That ties into her personality.

Is she actually friends with the other chasers? Or just 'team-mate friends'? Is she sporty? Girlie? A tomboy? Hell, is she a vegetarian? Vegan? Does she think that sort of lifestyle attitudes dumb? Is she straight, curious/experimental, bi, or a lesbian?

Does she swear? Does she have a hidden nasty streak on seeing her friends threatened? Is she kind yet vain? Brave? A coward? Kind yet manipulative?

Does she have a large family? A small one? Close or not? Does she want to just be a loving spouse and house-wife or does she have ambition, like playing professional quidditch or something more esoteric?

What foods does she like? Her talents?

Does she like dressing like trash outside Hogwarts? a punkette with dyed hair?

***** Oh, you mean Miss Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass? Give me a break.

I love Harry/Daphne, but outside of a precious few stories and a few stories that purposely aim to subvert the Ice Queen trope, she's the same character.

Blonde, blue-eyed, talented at magic to the point of near Mary Sue, et cetera. She's a trope that's become copied over and over instead of authors trying their hands at a unique take on her.

  she is just too similar to Ginny
#+end_quote

This always comes up, and it makes absolutely no sense. Literally comes down to "they both play Quidditch".

Ginny has all the baggage of the childhood hero worship, being Ron's little sister (Best friends little sister thing), and is really quite a passive character romantically (with lots of passive-aggressive relationship signaling).

Katie is a bit of a blank slate, but that hasn't stopped Daphne shippers. But what details we do have would lead to very different story paths: She is older, so more likely to be protective/expect to be the responsible or leading person in the relationship. She has an established friends group with its own mechanics. She also is a half-blood, giving a bit of a different perspective on the blood war.

Further, there is no indication she had any intention to do anything professional with Quidditch. She also shared the hobby with Harry through most of his time at Hogwarts, for a teammates-to-lovers story if you like. (Unlike Ginny, who was clearly set up as a love interest for Harry before she ever joined the team).

​

The fact they both play Quidditch is a piss-poor reason for saying they are basically the same character :|.
