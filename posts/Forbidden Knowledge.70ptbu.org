Is knowledge of Dark magic actually /illegal/ in Wizarding Britain?

Knockturn Alley is, remember, 100% legal. While the shops there might be kind of sketchy and the Ministry of Magic pretty incompetent, it seems unlikely that anything they sell, or the services they provide, are actually explicitly against the law. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Borgin_and_Burkes][Borgin and Burke's]], for instance, is just an antique shop. They might also have connections which let them buy and sell... objects of questionable nature, but most of what they do is just. Sell kind of creepy and/or magical trinkets. This suggests that a certain amount of Dark Magic is considered, if not quite a good thing, then at least 'acceptable'. In particular, it seems likely that simply /knowing/ how to perform dark magic is 100% legal, as is possessing somewhat dark-ish artifacts, provided that you don't actually use them for harm. This is not a given; the equivalent in the US might be owning a gun for instance, which requires a permit and waiting period etc. You might face some pointed questions if you had say, an entire room stuffed full of death-cursed jewelry, but maybe having a display case of 'antiques' with an understated 'do not touch' sign is okay, provided you register them with the Ministry.

Consider: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magick_Moste_Evile][Magick Moste Evile]] is sitting out in the Hogwarts library for anyone with a pass to the Restricted Section to read. The existence of the Restricted Section is entirely sensible; you don't want little kids reading about or practicing dangerous spells. Imagine if Draco had cast an entrails expulsion curse at Harry in second year, instead or a relatively harmless snake conjuring? But that book only /mentions/ Horcruxes, and before Voldemort made Dumbledore worried, [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Secrets_of_the_Darkest_Art][Secrets of the Darkest Art]] was in the Restricted Section too. Knowledge of these things might not even be too uncommon. After all, Slughorn knew exactly what a Horcrux was even though /Magick/ only mentions them; he must have at least skimmed /Secrets/ (or a similar book) as well. Dumbledore removing a book he didn't like from the library is perhaps a little iffy, but he is the headmaster after all, so likely it was okay.

/Secrets/ appears to be a very rare book, but given that it was, for a time, in a library intended for school children, reading it must be legal; knowing how to make a Horcrux must be legal. Making one would of course be illegal, but how available might these sorts of books be? Flourish and Blotts won't carry it, but maybe some of the shops along Knockturn? Is the rarity of Horcruxes a reflection of how vile wizards consider the act, or because the book itself is almost impossible to find?


** every curse, hex and jinx is part of the dark art( rowling said so on her website) that includes the Anti-Disapparition Jinx and the Anti-intruder jinx. we see all the main characters use the dark arts to a certain degree and often quite early , like Hermiones Full Body-Bind Curse she used on Neville in first year, or Rons Slug-vomiting Curse in second year. we also know that some of the darker spells are taught in defense against the dark arts. Honestly I am pretty sure that dark magic and knowledge of it isn't actually illegal but rather crimes that are committed for or because of dark magic. For example learning the killing curse isnt illegal, but rather using it to murder somebody. we know that certain dark objects are illegal, but to be fair its also illegal to enchant a carpet( so we dont really know all the criteria)

I think Dumbledore removing certain books means, that they are legal but that he personally doesn't want his students to read them.

*** That's about in line with my thinking as well; there's dark magic, and then there's *Dark Magic*, and the former is frowned upon, but not illegal, while the latter is much more likely to be persecuted.

Enchanted item laws likely have a bunch of loopholes put in by old pureblood families; you can /own/ a neckalce that will kill anyone who touches it, but you can't /make/ one, for instance. So 'antiques' would be fine, but some jumped up mudblood won't be able to make a hunter-killer missile 'just as an enchanting exercise'.

*** It's things like use; a biting teapot can't really be excused as a harmless eccentricity since it is very clearly designed to try and injure someone, not as a defense mechanism, but as an end goal. Additionally the obvious target would be muggles, who can't defend themselves.

But compare that to the necklace Draco uses in 6th year; it is obviously dangerous, but was on display in BnB's. It's possible the enchantments on it could be categorized as 'anti-theft' (even if they were nothing of the sort) so owning/selling it would be perhaps a little bit of a grey area, or even just flatly legal provided the owner was taking 'reasonable precautions' to ensure it didn't hurt anyone accidentally.

** I think curses, hexes, and jinxes are classified dark because they negatively affect the subject. Anti apparating jinx vs an anti apparating charm would likely differ in the way it went about preventing the act, with the former being harmful in some way.

Imho, the tiers of dark magic would be (from low to high): jinxes, hexes, curses, unforgivable/deadly magic. I changed the highest because I believe that fiendfyre should be labeled as a top tier dark spell, but it is a conjuring and not a curse. There could also be varying levels within the tiers, some which break the guidelines.

Also, note that you could technically use non-dark magic to perform dark things. Transfiguring someone's mouth and nose shut, for example. But that's akin to a muggle killing someone with a pillow, or stabbing with a spoon, ie using something not meant for that job.

*** Transfiguration is horrifically deadly. 0_0

That seems reasonable; likely they have misdemeanor dark magic crimes, escalating all the way to the unforgivables.

**** /Diffendo/, the cutting charm. Usually used for cutting inanimate objects, like paper or fabric, totally capable of killing someone if cast in the right way.

Now, i dont really know if this is canon or fanon, because i cant remember anymore, but i remember reading /somewhere/ that the difference between a non-dark and dark spell that do the, essentially, same thing, is the idea of a "counter spell." for instance, wounds caused by /Diffendo/ can be fixed with a simple healing charm, where as /Sectumsempra/ requires a specific counter-curse healing spell, designed by Snape as a foil to the curse in case it was ever used against him or his allies. A non-specific healing charm wouldnt have any effect. Normal magic is single part, it has an effect. Dark magic is dual part, it has an effect, and actively resists attempts to undo the effect.

***** canon says that damage dealt by dark magic is harder/impossible to heal. thats why they couldn't regrow freds ear or moodys limbs. but needing a specific counter curse seems to be a rare thing. the general counter charm finite incantatem seems to work on simple dark magic
