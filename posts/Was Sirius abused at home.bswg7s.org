I've seen this idea in fics, but it seems to be used just for the sake of more angst. So how bad was it? I know his mum isn't known for being nurturing and gentle, but would the abuse include,say, using crucio or something like that? Where did this idea come from? Were there signs in Sirius's behaviour that lead people to believe he was a victim of abuse? What punishments would his mother use?


** I think the only things in canon are the verbal abuse the portrait of his mother gives his adult self (and everyone else), but we don't know when it was painted and if it's an accurate portrayal for what she was like when he lived at home. Other than this, the running away as was mentioned, is a clear indication that he couldn't stand his family. The things he says in OotP also suggest that his brother was favouritised.

** It's mostly the fact that he ran away from home at a young age. At the very least, he has a toxic relationship with his family from the way we see him talk about them/to his mother's portrait. It seems like him being abused as a child is fair, and in fanfic people have the right/ability to extend that as they want it.

My headcanon is that he ran away from home the first time Crucio was used on him.

** I don't think there is any proof that things like crucio were actually used on him, that's just fanom to make it darker.

But he definitely was treated like a blood-traitor the moment he arrived in hogwarts. And the Blacks seem to be "excentric" of the kind to be violent and cruel. So, possible physical abuse, probably extreme toxicity. Remember that he was burned of the tapestry too, it just wasn't officialised. I would suspect the kind of physical abuse that was still regular around 1900 in schools. I don't think it happened before Hogwarts though.

*** What kind of abuse was still regular back then? I've seen beating used in fics, but it was the sort of beating where Sirius had to move carefully because it hurt, so I started thinking what his mother would and wouldn't do when it came to punishments.

**** Corporal punishments mainly included birching (twigs of birch bundled together to hit students with, banned in 1948 in UK), caning, long wooden rulers or leather straps or belts, mainly on knuckles or hands, knees or back with a student in a forced position. This could lead to breaks in the fingers, for example. Also a lot of humiliation tactics. If you had difficulty with a subject or were the worst on a test, you had to wear the Dunce hat and faced other humiliations. Especially in boarding schools was this very common.

Reasons were varied. 10 lashes/hits on knuckles was for hitting on girls or playing cards, while lying only demanded 7. But we don't even need to look at 1900. In the 80's, using a leather stick with two leather tails as lashes in front of the whole school on someone was a universal punishment in Scottish schools.

With magic healing broken bones in a jiffy, I can easily imagine that broken fingers would be conceived as something minor for the Blacks. They woudn't use canes of course, but magical variants.

Having pain moving after a discipline? Definitely true to history.

** He acted out at school and had clear impulse control problems, was rejecting his family's ideals and ideology at eleven, and ran away from home as soon as he was able. I'd be more suprised if he /wasn't/ from an abusive home. You can see it in Regulus too, although he's more in the 'beaten down' mode: fixated on a caregiver other than his parents, rejecting their authority more sneakily, and at least passively suicidal (he rejects Kreacher's attempt to save him from the Inferi).

As for the nature and methods of the abuse, we're talking about at the very least a Dark Arts inclined witch, even if her husband was not involved. The possibilities are, if not endless, definitely start at wrong and head all the way to horrifying.

** I'm going to have to crack my fingers on this because this will probably get long. So, as far as I'm concerned, Sirius was never outwardly physically abused. I imagine he got yanked about a little, maybe he got a few things thrown at him over the years, but I also imagine he threw quite a few things himself. The man has hell of a temper. Back when I started writing him about ten, fifteen years ago, this was the most common reason he left home. As such, I'm going to talk about his childhood in terms of leading to that.

​

There are a few reasons why (physical or magically based) abuse is likely to commonly used. First and foremost, people downplay emotional abuse and dysfunctional parenting in terms of their long term consequences. It's not as overly obvious, so it tends to require more build up than throwing a cruciatus and picking things apart in detail. Sometimes, people want quick angst. I seem to remember this being a big part of a response to Sirius having a thing for Remus in S/R fics way back in the day, which is a really common trope. Another reason may be that legally speaking, even in the real world, treating your children as your property was not (and sadly sometimes still is not) considered all that strange. Emotional abuse wasn't commonly used as a reason to separate parents and children, or to intervene, up till the 1980's except in very rare circumstances so to some degree, it is still normalised to treat your children like something you stepped in. It doesn't feel like it's enough of a reason for him to want to get out.

​

When I decided to take it on the first time, I did a lot of research and settled on there being an emotionally disconnected and abusive relationship but that it was one that developed slowly as he got older. He was the eldest son in an old magical family obsessed with it's own name and blood, he's charismatic, he's smart, good looking and magically brilliant. This should be everything his parents wanted - except I think what Sirius struggled with was his own agency. We have some things in canon which would play into it. He lives in a muggle area, which likely meant that his ability to leave the house by himself as a child and teen was heavily restricted. His childhood company would have been only what his parents deemed desirable. This suffocating, isolating experience lends a lot of weight to why being stuck in that house again. Then on top of that, he was sorted "wrong" and the next year, his brother was sorted "right" and that likely brought on the implication something was wrong with him.

​

So in terms of how bad it was, I can only go to my own opinions but I think they are backed up by the text. There is a certain power struggle to it. Sirius is a little wild, he's adventurous and while I wouldn't excuse any abusive behaviour, I think that was probably a difficult upbringing on both sides. Walburga and Orion wanting to keep the boys away from the muggle threat, the cultural and physical encroachment of their world by people who would kill their children if they knew what they were (by their belief) and appearances were also clearly important if they thought they were practically royal. I think that a key difference between the boys is that Sirius stands his ground hard and pushes back hard. His mother does the same. It's a recipe for escalation.

​

So, onto the canon. The earliest we see of Sirius is in the princes tale.:

#+begin_quote
  /“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?” James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile./

  /“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said./

  /“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”/

  /Sirius grinned. “Maybe I'll break the tradition.”/
#+end_quote

Already, you can see Sirius at eleven feels like he's different. He doesn't seem happy at the mention of his family. If we go with him already feeling out of place, then my guess would be that his parents had high standards and there was a lot of pressure on him to be someone he felt he wasn't.

​

The biggest clue is that Sirius's character is one of someone who is fiercely loyal, and responds to loyalty and disloyalty intensely. We see this in PoA, where he goes from not caring about breaking Ron's leg to when Ron tries to protect Harry, he tells him to rest his leg and lie down. He shows care in the face of care. He also never really tries to bring Peter to justice, instead seeing his own life being taken (or his soul) as appropriate cost for getting to kill the person responsible for killing James and Lily and who knows who else given how many people died in a short span. So what do these things tell us about him in terms of how he was raised? Skipping over his sense of self worth (I'll get there in a minute), family comes first, always. It's just that Sirius has separated who is family to him and who is simply related to him. There's a passage in OotP that really hammers this home when Harry finds out he's related to Bellatrix.

​

#+begin_quote
  /“Does it matter if she's my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I'm concerned, they're not my family. She's certainly not my family. I haven't seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban. D'you think I'm proud of having relatives like her?”/

  /“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn't mean --- I was just surprised, that's all ---”/

  /“It doesn't matter, don't apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don't like being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I never thought I'd be stuck in this house again."/
#+end_quote

​

So this isn't uncommon for kids in an abusive environment. One of the things I enjoy the contrast of is that Sirius shifts who he's family to and has intense loyalty to them, with Regulus remaining loyal to his family because he still loves them. I do believe Sirius does still love them, but he's hurt and angry and didn't want to be the one who was rejected so he did the rejecting first. He even snaps at Harry at the idea, which could be a little of him writing his own narrative on the experience. He has to see it on his own terms now.

​

If we break down the relationship, I think we can see some of it from the entrance in OotP.

#+begin_quote
  /“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. The old woman's face blanched./

  /“Yoooou!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. “Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!”/

  /“I said --- shut --- UP!” roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again./
#+end_quote

So one of the first things to note is Sirius is embarrassed and playing it off. It's his 'dear old Mum' and she pretty obviously isn't happy to see him. I think this shows how bad it was in the end. It probably started more with high ideals, trying to push him into a mold he didn't fit into, with it gradually getting worse and worse to the point of screaming matches. If we're going for the more abusive elements, this translates to me as someone who more or less said she's ashamed to have had him, he's an embarrassment, he's a traitor to his kind. Remember what I said earlier about Sirius and loyalty? Sirius actually left. It had to have been bad enough for him to throw that loyalty, but I think it was facilitated by them treating him as defective in some way, especially as his brother was trying to fit into that mold laid out and doing a better job.

*** Ultimately, I think it was the lack of choice that did him in and made him leave. He was stuck in that house, listening to them praise the Death Eaters while people he cared about had their families killed, watching everything he did be tainted by the fact he wasn't what they wanted, that he could see other families like Mr & P where they clearly loved James and he didn't have that there. It was a big, old house and I'm willing to bet getting locked in his room was a frequent punishment. The only spell I can think of potentially being used is Silencing, because they likely did not like what he had to say. They don't validate him in any way. If anything, I'd say the opposite so you have someone who will blame themselves even if it's not their fault (such as him admitting he killed James and Lily to Harry), someone who's opinion is not only not valued but seen as completely wrong and told as much, someone who is the shame of their family, someone who was sorted wrong, someone who has the wrong friends, someone who likes the wrong things even if he also likes some of the right things, someone who has grown up knowing that he could be removed from his family if he isn't obedient (no such thing as unconditional love here, folks), who watched his own favourite cousin removed never to be spoken of again and has lived with that for sixteen years.

​

So to sum up this tl;dr as it's had to be split in two! (I hope it makes sense, it's after midnight here and I brain splurged)

​

It was bad in the sense of it was isolating, suffocated, being pushed hard to be something he wasn't (and who he was not being good enough), being told he was wrong and something was wrong with him, knowing that his home and family was based on the condition of living how they wanted or being banished, watching them praise people destroying lives, being told how much better his brother was, told his mother was ashamed to have given birth to a child like that and having his life controlled in who where he went, who he saw and what he experienced (though I bet he used to sneak out a lot later on). In terms of punishments, I would go with things that remove his independence, ability to say what he thinks, his choices and his friends because this is what is important to him.

*** Thanks a lot. I thought I was the only person in this fandom who thought there was emotional abuse and taking away his independence. It was very extensive analysis so it was nice to read. And I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks Sirius wasn't that obedient child. Maybe I wasn't imagining things after all. Physical abuse somehow cheapens those stories for me. It seems like a quick way to show they were horrible and get readers' sympathy. I actually felt sorry for him just after reading your comment and there's no mention of beating there. I wanted to ask what you meant by Sirius writing his own narrative based on his experience when he talks to Harry?

** I started writing a fic set in '79, so the year both his dad and brother die, with a focus on the Order and his family. Got 40k+ words in and tabled it because I couldn't really answer this question for myself. To me, the answer seemed like unquestionably yes, but I wondered if I only felt that way because I do enjoy angst in fics. Some things that had me thinking:

Sirius was defined by his loyalty and his protective nature. To run away from his family, to never speak to them again, would be very out of character unless they really had hurt him significantly, whether only emotionally or otherwise.

It's telling that when he ran away, he went to the Potters and they /didn't send him back/. It's hard to imagine seemingly normal parents keeping a child if that child had a safe and loving situation waiting for him.

He was also "about sixteen." For Sirius, who is older for his class year, that means he was in fifth year. Compare all of the fuss for Harry protection in OOTP with Sirius who was disowned at that same age.

The only argument I've really seen that he was never physically abused hinges on the posters, meaning if it was so bad he would be too scared to put them up. I disagree. Sirius was shown time and again to disregard his own physical safety to make a point, so I'm not sure the posters say much.

I'm not saying he was everyone's favorite crucio target like some fics have it. But at best, his family seems to have not loved him beyond his ability to play a role. Once it became clear he would not, it doesn't seem like much of a stretch from that to dark family plays with curses to get control or dominance over him.

If you haven't read it, linkffn(against the moon) handles this in a compelling way. It weighs on him, it's part of his life, it's really sad...but it's also not overdone and not just there to be angsty, I think.

*** I guess it bothers me because I always believed he didn't feel loved by his mother, at least once he came to school (I'm not sure what his relationship with his mother was before then), and it seemed terrible enough for me. Add to that verbal abuse and I can see why he hated them so much. I don't see the necessity to hit or curse him when it's bad enough. And there's something, I'm not even sure what, but something I would have expected to see in his behaviour if the situation had been the way it is portrayed in fics. I did read that fic, but it was one of those that made me wonder. One person to whom I recommended it said that Sirius is very...well not in a good emotional state in that fic. It seemed like they didn't think it was true for this particular character. There's so little we know about him, though. He says he left is family because he hated their pure blood mania, so it must have been not just what they did to him, but their beliefs as well. I actually find it interesting that he somehow started questioning their ideas. I also never believed Sirius was that obedient child. I'm not sayingit's right to punish him for this, but I think he enjoyed testing his mother's patience so I wonder how she reacted to such behaviour. I remember reading a short ficlet where Sirius reflects that he wanted to please his mother and that they spent a day in the garden or something like that, where she told him about flowers. So there was some attempt at bonding there and his mother wasn't portrayed as that flat character who beats him constantly.I guess I have an issue with this portrayal, at least if we are talking about the time before Hogwarts because later she must have been disappointed in him. I also find myself wondering how Sirius managed to live there even until 16 and didn't try to run away earlier. It's rather odd, because I like angst in Remus-centric stories, for example. Come to think of it, maybe it seems too much like repeating Harry's experience and I just don't want another story like that.Btw, it seems that you already know the answer to your question and most of the fandom would agree with you.

But it's the points you mentioned that have me wondering and why I'm not satisfied: isn't the clear emotional abuse enough, and is anything more just heaping it on? In poorly done fics, it does seem like crucio gets used as a crutch. It lets the author get away with a flatter treatment of the Black family, and it does take some skill to make emotional abuse carry the same weight. When in reality it would be, if anything, more painful.

In my own fic, I only had the emotional abuse and manipulative magic, like Confundus charms, and that's what tied me up. It felt right for the story and how I was writing Sirius, but it goes against how I read canon in a way. Fortunately I have another story I'm working on and when I go back to it, maybe it'll be clearer.

To your other point, I think signs are there it's there just not always overt. He goes for violence when upset: Peter, Snape, hell there's even "he looked like he quite wanted to hit" Fred. That feels learned. He is intensely attached to James, the person who seems to have been his primary (only?) source of acceptance. He rebels against everything and acts out, arguably defensive behaviors.

That's why I like Against the Moon's treatment, because he is rebellious and a difficult kid, so it doesn't come out of /nowhere/, but it doesn't excuse his mother's abusive behavior either. It's funny that someone you discussed it with doesn't like him in that story; it's actually the only baby Sirius that I think is properly in character, and I'm pretty tough on fics. He's very young in it, of course, and I think already by thirteen, he's becoming more openly rebellious with his family.

Have you read tonsberry/kopikuchi (joint authors)? From what I've read, they keep very close to canon on their line with Sirius's family. It's definitely driven by blood politics and a toxic relationship in their universe.

***** Oh I didn't notice Sirius's reaction to Fred and forgot about Peter for a moment! But then again, was strong dark magic necessary to achieve this? Emotional abuse will do the trick, to me personally it's even worse. But people love angst,and you do need certain knowledge to write about abuse. I sometimes feel a bit guilty for questioning such things in fanficsbut I can't help it. Btw, that person didn't like Remus in that story either, so I ended up not knowing what to recommend them:)I haven't read that fic you mentioned, but I might give it a try.

****** The rec are authors, and actually one is the user above in this thread whose analysis you agree with :)

So for ATM, I do very much see Sirius taking Muggle Studies and digging his feet in about it, and his parents being uproarious about it. It's also the year Regulus is sorted, making Sirius even more the outsider in his family. That said, I thought it seemed a bit out of character for Sirius's parents to use non-magical methods of punishment. The author is so talented, though, and she handled it with consistency in her characterization and it gave depth to her story beyond angst, so ultimately I liked it. It's totally within a fan fiction author's right to extend the universe how they see, particularly when it's a supportable read of canon. I'm really curious to see, if she continues the story, what will be the 'last straw' with him and his family. Because emotional or physical, there was something that made him say he'd "had enough," and that's really sad.

** We can tell he was emotionally abused by looking at his mother's portrait. That's canon.

You can ask if there was physical as well as emotional abuse. That seems really likely. They wouldn't have to go all the way to unforgivable curses when there are stinging hexes and stuff. His parents were such collectors of dark artifacts, they could have had the wizarding equivalent of a collection of whips and paddles. I can see them inflicting increasingly worse pain, in a victim-blaming, “I wouldn't have to resort to this if you'd learned your lesson before” sort of way. Real parents do that all the time, so fictional parents would too.

** His mother is definetly verbally abusive to him. That much you see in canon. He also ran away from home. This wasn't a repeated offense it was something that he was driven to after feeling like he had no other options. So that suggests something bad enough to makr him want to leave and not a situation where he'd just constantly run away.

James's parents let him stay. Which if they were considered good people like what the narrative suggests probably wouldn't just keep him if he only had one fight with his parents or something. That and the other time you see a kid run away from home in this series before this point its Harry in book 3. And Harry is definetly abused. And this was another sort of bonding thing for Sirius and Harry not being accepted by their family and favoring their found family.
