** I wonder; Lupin's excuse for disappearing every full moon was that he was going to care for his sick mother. Do you suppose people looked at the dates and went 'Mrs. Lupin is a werewolf'?

But yeah, he probably had a cage at home somewhere, or at James's house. Or, maybe a reinforced playroom because a cage is too small.

*** That might have flown in school, but Lupin was just "sick" during the main series, so I don't think that would fly.

I find it more surprising that everybody didn't immediately figure it out. I mean, you live in a world with werewolves, you know they get strange in the days preceding and succeeding the full moon; if you meet a guy who "gets sick" on those dates like clockwork, you're going to know he's a werewolf.

Every student that was a half-blood or pure-blood should have been certain he was a werewolf before November.

**** Hogwarts has (if we go by the picture that was painted by canon) a few hundred students. (Or ~1000 if we go by one of those numbers JKR pulled out of her arse) Chances are, one or two of those are always gonna be ill at any time, so unless you cared about Lupin, he'd just disappear into the masses.

To me, lycanthropy seems more like one of those hush-hush topics that people simply don't speak about. Most children probably know they are dangerous under the full moon, but how many know how to recognise the pre/post full moon symptoms? Also, noone /expects/ to find a were in Hogwarts.

Snape probably knew, though, since he did "care" about Lupin quite a lot.

Snape didn't know, else Sirius' prank wouldn't have worked. He was curious about Lupin but didn't figure it out, Sirius told him how to get past the Whomping Willow and James rescued him before he actually met Lupin as a Werewolf.

He might have suspected, but if he knew he wouldn't have been stupid enough to try to get to a werewolf on a full moon night.

****** The bloke knew some nasty dark curses though; he might have already invented Sectumsempra by then, and nobody would have faulted him for killing a transformed werewolf in "self-defence."

It's the same guy who begged /Voldemort/ of all people to spare the life of Lily Potter. Reckless isn't really out-of-character for him.

He would be stupid if he /didn't/ connect the dots by then, considering how obsessed he was with those Gryffindors. (I've pegged it at spring 1976, a few months before he called Lily a Mudblood.)

**** Unless someone was actively watching Lupin and noting down the dates, I think it could work way longer. For his dormmates his regular disappearances would be hard to miss, for most others, it wouldn't have been as regular. For example, if the full moon fell on a weekend, there's no need for an excuse for everyone but his friends and dormmates. Maybe not every house had classes together each day, so one month the Ravenclaws don't notice he's missing classes, the next month no Hufflepuff notices etc.

Most children raised in the magical world would know about werewolves only as these ravenous beasts that roam the forests on full moon nights. Nobody would expect a quiet and sickly first year to be a werewolf, especially if there are no new rumours about a werewolf near Hogwarts.

** Basement cage. When they were old enough to apparate, I imagine they'd all come together to keep him from hurting himself too badly, but until that point the barred room theory seems most plausible.

I imagine the Ministry may have holding cells for these purposes as well.

** A friend of mine wrote a fic where Lupin isn't allowed at Hogwarts, and his father attempts to suppress his magic due to his "furry little problem." His father told everyone that he was a squib, and he eventually meets James over a summer break. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12792419/1/The-Burning-Truth][Maybe you'd enjoy it!]]
