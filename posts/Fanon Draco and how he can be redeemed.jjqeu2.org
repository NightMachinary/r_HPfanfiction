Ah, Draco Malfoy. There's millions of fanfics about him, and all of them involve an OC or the reader falling for him. Ngl, I read a lot of these and I've noticed a particular thing in all of these fics and that is the fact that Draco is utterly and completely OOC. He's either a sweet innocent muffin, or he's a complete dickhead bad boy who has snogged every girl in the school, and unfortunately, NONE of these are who he actually he is.

Yes, he's a bully, yes he's popular, but no, that's not who he actually is. I hate that people ruin his character and make him a freaking shell of a human being when he was so interesting! I did a bit of analysis on him and imho, he is such a conflicted and interesting character.

I mean, he desires to be popular and to leave a mark in the school and prove that he is not worthless and useless and that he is capable of achieving things. His dad wasn't that great of a parent and he always wanted Draco to be socially acceptable and popular, and Draco was afraid of disappointing his dad. He wanted to be friends with Harry because of his desire to be popular and not disappoint his dad and when he became a Death Eater, he had the whole new responsibility of killing Dumbledore and the fear of disappointing Voldemort and maybe causing the death of his family and himself. He knew that what he was doing was wrong and was killing someone but didn't want help because he wanted to prove that he was capable and could do stuff on his own. See? We already have such a good internal conflict already!

And if it is a Draco/OC fic, he would probably be slowly falling for the OC but would keep denying it and distance himself from them and bully them to make them stay away because 1) He's afraid his Dad won't approve 2) He's afraid Voldemort (or anyone, in that case) will use the OC against him to blackmail him into doing something and 3) He probably believes that he's a bad person and that he's useless and that the OC deserves someone else (this case is taken if he starts falling for them in the sixth book because that's when he starts to become half a decent person) and 4) He probably thinks he's above love and romance and that its useless.

Draco is a character for whom social status is huge, and he desires to impress the people around him. He hates showing weakness as he feels that it would affect his popularity and his image. He's afraid of ruining that image and feeling incompetent and worthless and disappointing the people around him. All this makes him a well rounded character but instead of this, most fanfics portray him as a shell of a character and it's not even this character- it's a random, cliched bad boy trope and its been overdone way too much.

So, what do you guys think about fanon Draco and how do you guys think he should be portrayed?


** I agree that fanon Draco is a shell of his canon self, but I think this analysis here is a little too on the sympathetic side.

#+end_quote

I don't think this is wholly accurate. Or maybe it's the implication that Draco cared that what he was doing was wrong that bothers me.

It's probably the latter.

Draco's issue wasn't the wrongness of his actions it was that he was failing.

But the big word missing here is coward. The only time I saw him not giving Harry up at Malfoy Manor as a positive was the 1st time I read it. He didn't do it because it right. He did it because he was scared (to pick a side), which is emphasized by his behavior with the Death Eater before Ron punches him in the face.

And that's why my biggest issue, outside of Potter kids' names, is the respectful head nod between Harry and Draco.

I like a redeemed Draco, but I've never seen one where he had to work for it. I also don't like a Draco who is magically stupid/incapable.

*** I like to imagine in the time skip after hogwarts Draco did massively work on improving himself.

as weird as it sounds my head canon is draco ends up as a dark artifacts consultant for the ministry.

**** Now that would've been an Epilogue. Just a full blown 'after the war' montage of Draco learning not to be a wanker, Harry getting up in his career, all the couples hitting milestones, Dennis taking pictures with Colin's camera, Luna dancing about in a field with thestrals and Crumple-Horned Snorkacks like she's the Pyro from Team Fortress, etc.

You know, all that good stuff we really wanted to see. :)

***** nah I like luna actually being wrong about things, she does discover plenty of species but eventually accepts some are not real or maybe died out ages ago.

but you could have several chapters,

ron and harry as aurors. Rons retirement as harry gets promoted to head auror Draco at scorpio's birth where he vows he will never let darkness near his son.

then you skip forward to the train scene

****** Oh, she'd definitely just be seeing things. The Pyro character in team fortress perceives their arson and murder as a magical world of fluffy bunnies and lollipops, so she'd be hallucinating her field of creatures.

My only comment on several chapters would be the risk of it feeling too long. Endings do need to be a little... curtailed. Otherwise you end up with memes about your million endings like Lord of the Rings. :)

*** Thats pretty accurate too, I mean, I may have been a bit too sympathetic but the fact that he's a coward totally went over my head (maybe because I've been reading too much fanfiction lately and its been a while since I've read the books- oh well, any excuse to re read them, ig). Also, I feel like Draco was one of the top students in his year (after Hermione, ofc) and that he was smart. I agree with you in the magically incapable Draco thing because I always thought he was reasonably smart

** I think the author of the Seventh Horcrux said it best:

#+begin_quote
  There's this really cool OC that pops up in a lot of HP fics. He's suave, snarky, handsome, a bit of a git, but super good-looking. For some reason, people keep calling him Draco Malfoy.

  In canon, Draco is none of those things. He's whiny, spoiled, lacks willpower, rushes into dumb plans with a brashness that completely defies Slytherin claims of cunning, and fails at literally everything he tries. Sure, there's some hints of an angsty redemption arc, but he never does all that much. At the end, we get a vague impression that he's okay now for an ill-defined reason...a lot like Snape, actually.

  The way I see it, there are three ways to deal with Draco in fanfics:

  1) Just swap him out for cool-guy OC up there.

  2) Make him a total git. This is probably closer to canon than the previous option, but it strays into bashing way too easily.

  3) My preferred method: Try to keep Draco as close to canon as possible, then give him some vague redemption primarily in the background. Do not take this redemption, or Draco in general, seriously.
#+end_quote

Personally, I prefer either 1 or 3. Either make him someone worth reading about, accusations of OOC aside (or better yet, give a compelling reason why would canon!Draco change his ways and become more sympathetic), or just mostly ignore him.

** There's more than a couple dozen 'TED Talks' type things out there about Neo-Nazis and KKK members and Cultists and such getting out of their various hate-organisations and lifestyles.

It's not unheard of for someone of a Draco-ish level of initiation into hate groups to come back from that, though the methods vary strongly. I'd say just do your research into that, then pick what best balances a fit for your story and Draco's character.

** "So, what do you guys think about fanon Draco and how do you guys think he should be portrayed?" In whatever way the author chooses to portray him seeing as if you wanted to read canon malfoy then pick up the damn books read them again otherwise accept fanfiction stories are not beholden to canon nor is there any way in which characters ought to behave just what the author of the story wants to write.

** Oddly, I think the most accurate fanon depictions are often found in Drarry slash, since it uses their strong chemistry. They were weirdly obsessed with each other in canon, and it's only a small shift to make them gay.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][Loose Cannon]] (my fic, postwar, not slash) has a Draco redemption arc, but it takes a LONG time, and Draco doesn't even appear in the story until chapter 71. But he definitely resembles canon Draco at the start: spoilt, envious of Harry, and bad-tempered.

Both characters are straight in my fic, but they still have very strong chemistry, albeit non-romantic. It's often antagonistic, particularly from Draco's side, but it's a good outlet for both of them, since they were both traumatized by the war. And the story is largely a comedy, so it's fun having them snipe at each other.

** The only way to redeem Draco is with a cutting curse to the neck, (how everyone and their mother got redeemed in the last book is the fucking pits) +followed+ preceded by his father.
