Looking for good stories set during the Grindelwald war. Bonus points if the main character(s) participate in the war. Don't care which side.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** Definitely watch the Fantastic Beasts movie. Also, as a general tip: FanFics for the movie on FFN sometimes are about the war.

** Currently planning a story about a Russian at Koldovstoretz before and during the war. The focus is on international wizarding politics, spies, etc. Still a ways off from putting it out there though.
