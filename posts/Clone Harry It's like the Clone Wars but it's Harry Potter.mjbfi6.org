Harry splits himself in two, then four, then eventually ends with a whole fighting force.

The Harrys fight the Death Eaters, try save as many muggle-borns from the Ministry as they can, struggle with their individuality and their place in the world after the war. Over time their personalities become vastly different, especially after seeing their "brothers" die time and time again.

Also stupid s$&t like Hermione mixing up which Harry is which.


** oh god no.

Even two Harry Potter's would create an infinite dilemma of them both constantly trying to sacrifice themself to protect the other.
