****** Not to be quite as much of a dick as I could be but...I mean...

You don't want to work on improving your bad English because you're....bad at English? I mean...that just screams, "I'm Lazy!" Which great, but your post is literally asking for people to 'help you' write. Methinks your version of 'help you write' is you provide a one sentence terrible idea and expect someone else to turn it into a 200k word fic. And that's just...ugh.

I'm a fanfic author of middling popularity. I'm popular enough that people who aren't me usually post that I have a new fic out or an update when I do update. I'm pretty much the demographic you're looking to for 'help' and I have absolutely no incentive to help you because I do not think you want help. I think you want it done for you.

You've given me no reason to expect that the 'ideas you want to include in a fic' aren't that:

Daphne is a stunningly beautiful blonde with piercing icy blue eyes. She's spent years cultivating an icy personality and only a marriage contract to Harry Potter will be be able to thaw her frosty exterior. And Her best friend Tracey Davis can come too.

But I stand by my first point. If you want to a damn story with certain ideas in it, write it. Everyone's first works suck, practice, practice, practice.

******** Yes. And plenty of people have worked through them their entire life without looking to others to do everything for them. But not a single thing you've said has come off as anything other than an excuse.

It's not life and death or rocket science. If you want to see certain ideas in a fic, write it. It doesn't have to be good. It's a learning experience. You might even find a hobby you enjoy. But guess, what! Writing is hard. If you are unwilling to put forth any effort past a single sentence excuse, why should I help you?

But fuck off with the excuses.

** Write a rough draft or outline, then present it to people, could be here or in a discord server..

I can attest that the only way you get a story to 100% satisfy yourself is to write it yourself, or at least participate heavily in the writing.

Heck, I am up for it, just PM me with it, can't guarantee will write it for you but I can give some tips.
