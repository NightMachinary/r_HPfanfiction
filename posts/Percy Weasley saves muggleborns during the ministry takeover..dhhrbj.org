:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all! I read this fic a few years ago. It was Percy-centric. In it, Percy stayed working for the ministry during what would have been Harry's 7th year. I remember that Percy was tasked with helping round up muggleborns, but he was secretly helping them by being really pedantic and bureaucratic like you would expect him to be. I remember one scene where a muggleborn sends in their family tree, and Percy replies back with a scathing letter that the family tree must be completed in blue or black ink, not green, regardless of how popular the colour was. He did this knowing full well it would give that family time to escape. The whole fic is a series of little defiances like this that show Percy trying his best during that year to help people on the sly. If someone knows the name of it, I'd really appreciate it!


** It's linkffn(The Sleeper Awakes by SnorkackCatcher)

  Alone in his office again, his heart in his mouth, and with a new stack of paperwork in front of him, Percy picked up a quill and began to work through the small pile of official Commission correspondence that Umbridge had presented him with. It was time to implement policy in the manner he expected of his father.

  The first one could be dismissed immediately.

  /"Dear Mr Thorndike,/

  /You have not filled in the enclosed Blood Status form correctly. The regulations quite clearly state that black or blue ink must be used for all forms submitted to the Ministry -- not what is self-evidently Walter Mann's Dragon Green Ink, however popular a brand it may be./

  /Please apply to the Ministry for another form, explaining exactly why you were unable to read simple instructions."/

  Percy made a note on the list -- 'breach of Ministry regulation 1954/qb/39' -- and moved on.

  It's been coming on for a while," said Percy ... "But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time." DH, ch30 . This is Percy's journey to that point.

** It might be /The Scarlet Pimpernel/ by A Marguerite?

If so you have the option of weirdly formatted pdf at [[http://redhen-publications.com/pimpernel.html]]

** It is not linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities), so it could be perhaps linkffn(3784000). Is it?

*** I don't think it is SingularOddities. Mr and Mrs Percy I think is in the same universe as Escape, and Escape has Percy spying for Harry and helping the twins through bureaucracy, but the issue is resolved before the muggleborn commissions as I recall.

​

Escape (and I assume Mr. and Mrs.) DOES have Percy using his approach to help people. Just doesn't get to registration commissions....
