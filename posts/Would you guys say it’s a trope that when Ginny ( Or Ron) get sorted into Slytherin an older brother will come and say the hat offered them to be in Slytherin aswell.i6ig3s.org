** No, I haven't encountered it before. But I'd say Ron or Ginny being shunned from their family (Weasley bashing) for being sorted into Slytherin is becoming a trope

** I think it's more of a gimmick than a trope.

It kinda makes sense that some Weasleys have been offered Slytherin (Percy is the ambition embodied, and the Twins have some big dreams), and I seing the Weasley cheering up their sibling rather than the alternative where they disavow him (which is stupid in my opinion).

It can become an annoying scene depending of how the author treat this scene, but we are still farm from the worst tropes like Harry inheritance of the Shopping trip chapter.

** I wouldn't say trope exactly (I don't think it's overused THAT much yet), but it is a recurring theme in fanfics with that plot point.

** I've seen one where each individual older brother comes to her and assures her that they think there's nothing wrong with them being in Slytherin and she's still their little sister, and her initially finding it hilarious and then getting slightly annoyed by it.
