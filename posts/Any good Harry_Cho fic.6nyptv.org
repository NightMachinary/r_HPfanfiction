Like the title suggested, I'm looking for some good, and lengthy if possible, fics about this pairing. The only one I've read so far is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan), which started out good, but turned rather bland toward the end, maybe because the author lost the motivation to write or something, that he started to recycle lots and lots of canon texts during the latter half. That sadly led to another downside. Over time, Cho Chang's personality turned into that of a flower pot. She didn't really do anything, and was still left out of every of Harry's adventure, except for the D.A.

So, any suggestion?

  Suppose Cho said yes to Harry asking her to the Yule Ball. What kind of relationship could they have developed? HPCC AU Reboot to "Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan."

** Hey, I know this is a bit late, but here's a few I've found that are pretty good.

linkffn(The Seekers) It's probably the best I've read, though it's a bit short. It has a sequel that never got more than a chapter, unfortunately.

linkffn(WIZARDS DUEL) It's a complete trilogy, but I haven't finished them all yet, just book one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/646172/1/]]

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/]] This one is excellent, and has a wonderful second book as well.

linkffn(The Stag and the Swan) It's a good one-shot of a better Hogsmeade date.

linkffn(Thorns To A Rose) It's not the greatest, but it's a decent story for the most part. The last few chapters felt very hasty and didn't make a ton of sense, but it was alright. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1424025/1/]]

linkffn(An Impossible Change:办不到) I haven't gotten far yet, but it seems rather promising.

Unfortunately, Harry and Cho is very rare, so it seems we have to get it where we can. If you have any good ones, regardless of length, I'd certainly appreciate a link, if it's not too much trouble.

  Some things are just never meant to be, impossible to change. Certain events are fixed in time, lost forever. But what if something did change? What if one little thing changed, a seemingly insignificant tweak to history? Something as simple as a young woman choosing the Boy Who Lived over the Boy Who Died? Completed. Continued in The Hidden Army.
