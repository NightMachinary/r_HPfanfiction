Do you have any well-written fics in mind that you think deserve more love and recognition? Please, don't recommend the "usual" or those mentioned a hundred times before (i.e. "Black Comedy," "Like a Red Headed Stepchild," etc.)


** linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland) -- one of the most interesting AUs I've read

linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) -- Harry is rescued from the Dursleys, but by a very different family. Incomplete, but there's enough written that it's worth a read

linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl) -- no way to describe this besides the fact that it's very different from anything else I've ever read

linkffn(A History of Magic by PrinceEdwin) -- adorable story

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) -- oh my goodness, I couldn't stop reading this once I'd started. Fantastic fic.

linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) -- lots of psychological thriller elements.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) -- Harry and Hermione are sorted into Slytherin. There's also other plotting shenanigans going on.

Hope some of these are new to you!

**** You know, I have seen this story before and was turned of for a pretty petty reason.

But the first chapter was pretty entertaining.

Although, Snape saying â€˜dogfather' sounds /wrong/.

I've been writing this as I read the first chapter and although I think it's good, but there's a good chance I'll end up dropping it.

***** Most people stop reading it because of the slash tag. To those people I suggest they give it another shot. There is zero sex in the entire story, and the slash pairing happens in the last chapter.

That being said, the first half of the story is much better than the second half. The story drags on a little too long in my opinion. I still enjoyed it very much.

It still doesn't spoil but reveals something about the story and where it's going. Adding a Genre helps too. I might not want a Romance, but an Adventure sounds good right now. And you can never find enough good HP Horror stories.

I don't want to get too preachy, but it's something I think a lot of people in this sub could use some work on. There are ways to give relevant information without giving any plot spoilers.

** linkffn(Harry Potter in the Garden of Intrigue) --- Harry had a working lightbulb in his cupboard and read a lot of books. The result is an absolutely hilarious (but not at all cracky) fic that I absolutely recommend.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«) --- Not unknown, but doesn't get recommended nearly enough. An accident with the Ford Anglia lands a functionally wandless Harry and the Sorting Hat in the enchanted forests of Albania, the very ones Voldemort is said to have hidden in. Magical creatures both known and unknown abound, most of them are hostile, and it is super-illegal for wizards to even set foot in there, let alone use magic... what can he do?

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) --- A nonevil Salazar Slytherin is reborn into the body of Hermione Granger. He tries to make sense of the modern world and restore his house to its former glory.

linkffn(One World) --- Those who like White Squirrel's /The Accidental Animagus/ ought to like this one. Not perfect, and unfortunately abandoned, but quite enjoyable nonetheless.

linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) and linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild)--- Probably the more favorited fics than most of this list, but they don't get recommended often enough on this sub. The first one is Goblin-raised Harry done /right/ (looking at you, /Harry Crow/), and the second one is a /Fantastic Elves/-like look at a Harry who was adopted by Shakespeare-style fairies.

linkffn(Soft as a Dementor's Kiss) --- A bloody brilliant one-shot about what a Dementor experiences through the /Harry Potter/ books. Simultaneously tragic and chilling.

** I feel like the Albus Potter series needs more attention. It's a 7 book series that follows the middle Potter child's entry into Hogwarts. I got the feeling it was an entirely new series set in a wizarding world that saw a post-war leap in progress and discovery. Like the wizarding world the series feels like it's had an evolution from JK Rowings work, although not necessarily layed out the same with specifically book 1 feeling less climactic and more world building. I personally found it very enjoyable especially considering the length of 7 books to binge through.

My only gripes are that the first book introduces far too many characters --- it feels like we meet every student during the sorting --- and the first book is mostly setting up the world and the characters for the coming books making it feel less similar to the first JK Rowing book HP:SS then the following books.

**** I'm glad you and I agree that it's amazing. Sucks that I don't see it mentioned much at all considering it's an amazing 7 book series that is canon-compliant and it's fully completed. The author even made a couple separate stories that go along with the books --- they have spoilers so if anyone sees this comment, don't read those stories before the series.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** Call Me is, in my opinion, the best "Harry/background character" (Lisa Turpin) story that's out there. The pacing is on the quick side (for 66k words at least) but that is also its strength since the characters feel like teenagers who do things without thinking for weeks and not parts of a Shakespearian Drama. Set after OOtP.

** "A Wee Dram of Tonks and Harry with a splash of Football" is my favorite oneshot that is both funny and cute. It is one scene in a pub after the war where Harry is struggling with his role after defeating Voldemort and things develop from there on. The humour is subtle enough to feel natural and not part of some comedy and the characters seem believable.

** linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi). It is an amazing long Snape character study, spanning between 5th year and his Death Eater and Spy days. It's an incredible portrayal of him, capturing his teetering position in the middle of various extremes (Magic and Muggle, Light and Dark, Good and Evil). It's also got an interesting look at magic, and I love the Patronus chapters the most. It doesn't cast judgement or give any justifications, and Snape is both horrible and heart-breaking. Will forever be annoyed that this has only 36 kudos.

linkao3(Carry That Weight (A Long Time) by PazithiGallifreya) It's a sort of severitus, but subverts most of the common tropes associated with it. First of all it takes place post-DH, when Harry's already an adult. Harry is still working out his complicated feelings towards Snape when he gets the whammy that he's his son. Snape has to deal with both surviving the war, and the fact that the boy he hated for being James Potter's son for so long, is in fact his. It's great, realistic and a mature take on the trope.

Edit: Who is downvoting recommendations now?

** linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is very old, which means it doesn't get recc'd very often, but it's marvelous. The writing and pacing are superb and it actually feels very AU, because it was started before the 5th book came out. Very different take on the world, which is cool, and one of my favorite "Powers he knows not" that I've seen (and I'm fairly sure the author wasn't even aware of the whole prophecy business when they came up with the idea).

It's sadly abandoned, but 100% worth the read

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing. She had no robe or House emblem, nothing Wizardly about her at all. The halfblood beamed at the Poltergeist of Hogwarts and brightly spoke words that had never once been said: "Hi Peeves, it's nice to meet you!" (A Next-Gen fanfic)

** linkffn(11377120) has Malfoy going back in time to Marauders era, he becomes friends with them, but not instantly, I think it has a very compelling friendship development between Draco and the Marauders, it is also slightly more mature than most fics, by which I mean that characters are not whitewashed or bashed, the humor is a bit more sarcastic, etc.

I really hate when characters say "let's be friends" and the reply is "ok" and then they instantly share all their secrets and seem to care a lot for each other. I've seen this in hundreds of fics and get really annoyed with this. This is not how real friendships are formed... Anyway, in this fic it's not the case. And there is no romance (almost? not sure..) which is also something I'm always looking for. I hate that most of the fics focus on pairings.

  "I'm Sirius Black," said the boy. "Who the hell are you?" Draco hesitated. Well how the hell was he supposed to answer this? / / Back in 1976, Draco has a lot on his hands...avoiding questions (both students' and teachers'), playing his part well, & trying himself to understand why on earth he was sorted into Gryffindor this time around. It's going to be one hell of a ride. . .

** "The Ollivanders" linkffn(12723602) is very new and not complete, but what I've read is showing some promise. It's OC-centric story set during the Marauders era. So far, there's been some interesting discussion of wand-making and little details here and there that make it feel as if it's really set in the seventies.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.
