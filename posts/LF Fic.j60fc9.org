:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a while back. I can't remember the name or how long ago it was, but the gist of it was based around James divorcing Lily to obtain sole guardianship of Harry, and Frank divorcing Alice due to Augusta's prejudice. Naturally Hay grows up hating and distrusting James while Neville views Frank as a henpecked mommas boy. It wasn't that long of a fic but it had a nice amount of story and plot within in addition to a unique idea. If anyone has any idea of the fic I'm looking for it would be appreciated.
