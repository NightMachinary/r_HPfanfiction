*** huh - anyone want to explain what actually IS canon for wards?

do tombs (cursebreaking), Hogwarts grounds/walls?, or Malfoys estate have wards? I found that Nurmengard had a anti-disapparatiing jinx so LV had to fly.

/Edit/ I just Ctrl F'ed my way through all the books for "ward" and these are the only uses I found.

PS Quirrell's garlic to 'ward' off vampires CoS George pretended to 'ward' Harry off with... garlic PoA Lupin said he'd train me to 'ward' off the dementors. numerous 'ward's mentioned regarding Hospital Wing. GoF only a couple Hospital type 'ward's used OotP St. Mungo's special 'ward' for brain damage and numerous additonal hospital variety 'ward's HBP Gurdyroot for 'warding' off Gulping Plimpies (Luna) a few hospital type 'ward's DH 'ward off' memories - in terms of Vernon trying to forget magic/wizards

So it is as good a term as any but I am flabbergasted that "Ward" is never used a single time in any context whatsoever! (even in Lily/Harry Blood/Sacrifice I guess it's a charm).

**** It is now, but I don't think it was originally. I think the term 'Maurader' only came up in the books in reference to the map. On the map, the word was singular possessive, not plural possessive (Maurader's Map), so I'm not sure JKR originally meant that the four guys were the Mauraders but the map was for a Maurader type person to use.

However, I believe that the term was so popular in fandom that JKR actually adopted it for canon. There are several other fanon ideas made into canon as well. I think Ron joining George at the joke shop is another.

** I've never heard of the Dan and Emma as Hermione's parents. I always assumed that her mother's name was Jane or Jean due to Hermione's middle name. Was never sure about her father's.

I tend to like the whole proper Draco-redemption as canon. I feel like JK really glossed it over. It's something that could have really been highlighted, emphasized, and allowed for character growth. But it was pushed aside. I felt the movies did better at it than the books, thanks to Tom Felton's acting.

I pretty much pretend the Epilogue never existed. I always assume that Hermione and Ron don't last. Their relationship just feels off.

I'm sure there are other little things, but I'm usually pretty happy with the canon. I will use the term "Golden Trio" sometimes, but generally as a snide comment made by a Slytherin. That's pretty much it.

I have never once heard an explanation for how this happened that wasn't stupid, or flew in the face of established canon. Unless you're one of those people who rip out the last ten pages of your book and deny the epilogue ever happened I fail to see how anyone could believe this.

Also your fourth and fifth points (Kreacher and Bellatrix/Rodolphus) are actual canon, and the sixth (Neville/Luna) JKR has definitively said did not happen.

***** I will put the first point, of whether or not Albus embraced the possibility of Slytherin or not, aside for now as there is no contextual evidence to support either interpretation.  Whether Albus' takeaway from his conversation with his father is "Slytherin wouldn't be that bad" or "oh good, I can ask to be in Gryffindor" or "maybe this is more complicated than I thought (I think this one) is difficult to say, so for now let's move past it.

I'm more concerned with the nature of Albus himself as a person - what we know anyways - and how that gels with Slytherin.  In order to be sorted there one of two things must be true.

A. Cunning/ambition are his DEFINING character traits, the things he most values.

B. He has some quantity of these trait, and then specifically requests Slytherin House.

The second makes entirely no sense to me, and yet it is one of the most common ways that people go about putting Albus into Slytherin. We get very little insight into these characters, but knowing Jo what little we saw of them are important parts of their personality. Albus clearly cares far too much about his brother's and Uncle's opinion to ever /ask/ to be placed in Slytherin, even if we accept that he has embraced it as an equally worthy House - an assumption of which I am also dubious. He's also clearly had this dream of being a Gryffindor like his father for a long time, so it seems unlikely he would do such a 180 as to specifically request placement elsewhere.

So this leaves us with the remaining explanation, that Albus ends up in Slytherin House because the traits he values most, above all else, are ambition and cunning. Doesn't sound very like him does it? Obviously we're dealing from a criminally small data set, but it's difficult to reconcile that assertion with anything we're shown of Albus in the Epilogue. On the contrary, most of his interactions seem directly counter to the professed ideals of Slytherin House. A Slytherin would not go running to mommy when his older brother is mean to him, and indeed the dynamic between the two in the Epilogue suggests that James is quite accustomed to Albus not fighting back. I actually think that Albus has a lot more Hufflepuff in him than Slytherin. We see far more to suggest him as a polite, earnest, shy, soft-spoken, but determined boy who values the interpersonal bonds he has formed. I think a Hufflepuff Albus could be quite interesting (though he is a GryffinClaw in my headcanon).

But of course, Slytherin is the edgy House, so people put him there for the "shock value".

But I do consider Lupin liking Lily canon for some reason. I don't know if it happens enough in Maurader fics but the ones I've read always had an undercurrent of Lupin harboring some sort of feelings for Lily. Makes sense to me but I have no evidence to actually back that up in canon.
