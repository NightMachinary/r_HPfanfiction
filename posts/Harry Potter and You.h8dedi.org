How did you first start with the Harry Potter books and how did you first get involved with fanfiction? Are there particular story lines or relationships you prefer? And how do you find new stories to read?

For myself, I have always been a voracious science fiction/fantasy reader. My little library in my house has well over 2000 titles that I constantly reread. So even though I wasn't the initial target audience for the Harry Potter books. I still picked them up when they first came out.

In terms of fanfiction i really didn't get involved until two years ago. Even though my career was in computers I just couldn't see myself spending anymore time with them at home. So when I wasn't working I was outdoors, biking, hiking, kayaking, fishing, hunting, golfing etc. After I retired while dealing with an illness I got bored, didn't feel like reading one of my books, watching tv or a dvd, so I started surfing on the net and found AO3 followed shortly by hpfanficarchive, ffn, fanficauthors, portkey, and adult fanfiction.

I gravitated to Harry/Hermione stories as I was disappointed that the last couple of books didn't have them together. Because in the first 4 books I saw the romance between Harry and Hermione and never did see the canon pairings nor could I see the canon pairings working out. I think the first story I read was Moments in Love by  Gandalfs_Beard. I then found that I was ok with other pairings for Harry but only could tolerate harry/ginny if there are other women involved.

I have no inclination to read slash (though I don't mind fem!slash). Pairings between Hermione and any deatheaters are also "right out". So overall my pairing preferences are Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, Harry/Hermione/Luna, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, and then Harry/GTBNL (Girl To Be Named Later (includes Multi as well as one or more of the Family Black females)).

Now I know that the books were children stories that migrated to teen/young adult stories. And as such in order for a kid to be the hero the adults have to be either unintentionally incompetent or intentionally negligent for that to happen. So looking back on the stories as an adult I can see a lot of plot holes or actions "that just aren't right". So I gravitate towards fics that "explain' these discrepancies. Which is why I lean towards manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore, and independent and/or powerful Harry stories with or without time travel.

I prefer stories that have a "legitimate" plot though I'm ok if the entire plot is sexual in nature (which if you peruse adult fanfiction the stories are mostly sex with maybe a plot versus a plot that includes some sex).

The way I find new stories is fairly simple. If I like a story I read I check out other stories from that author that sound interesting. If there are none left I then check out the authors or stories that the author I just read likes figuring if I liked his work there's a good chance I might like the authors and stories he likes. I start out checking whichever grouping (eg favorite authors/favorite stories) that is smaller and read any stories that the summaries sparked my interest. (I go through both groupings I just start with the smaller one first).

Then I "rinse and repeat" for those stories and authors I just checked out.

So how about you?


** I started reading Harry Potter when I was 8 yeas old, and I started with Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was a gift from my favourite aunt. I think I read that book 10 times while waiting for the fourth one and then I went back and checked out the first two from my local library. Because it was the first one I read, Prisoner of Azkaban was my favourite for a very long time, and it's the one that brings back all those warm and fuzzy nostalgic feelings when I reread it. I always loved reading, but Harry Potter is what made me obsessed with books in general, and with fantasy literature in particular.

I started reading fanfic when I was around 12 or 13 years old, because I happened upon a dramione fic that intrigued me. For a couple of months I read all the dramione fics I could get my hands on, at least all of the Italian ones, as that's my native language. Afterwards I had a brief period in which I fell down the Snarry rabbit hole, followed by an intense obsession for the "Hogwarts/the marauders/ the professors etc. read the books" kind of fics. What's funny is that there were only a handful of the latter written in Italian, so I started reading them in English, even if at the time my English was horrible. But seeing as a major part of those fics were taken directly from the books, and I had practically memorized the books in Italian, I ended up practically teaching myself English while having lots of fun. I can credit my level of English entirely to the fact that I had read all the Italian fanfic I was interested in and went looking for more on the English side of FF.net

Generally speaking, my pairing preferences are very very broad, I read Het, Slash and Femslash, with a leaning towards slash couples. My favourite character is Harry, so I most often end up reading about Harry-centric relationships, but if it's well written I also read other pairings that have nothing to do with Harry.

I like stories that delve into the workings of magic, fics that expand upon/rewrite the magic system, fics that flesh out the culture/politics/society of the Wizarding World etc. I prefer stories where Harry is smarter and more powerful that in canon and I absolutely adore stories where Harry is a badass while not being overpowered. I love time travel fics/Harry is summoned to another universe fics/Harry is the Master of Death fics etc.

Just like you I found all the plot holes in the books and got interested in finding fics that would explain them, but I overcompensated and ended up reading a lot of heavy bashing stories of practically every character but Harry. I think that, as a rebellious teen, reading fics where a teenager like me blows up at every adult around them, is always right and is able to get back at the people that wronged them was very cathartic for me.

Nowadays I tend to stay away from heavy bashing fics, for example those where Dumbledore is an evil, mustache twirling cartoonish villain that murders puppies for kicks, or those where Ron is a greedy, backstabbing arsehole that hates Harry and is being paid by Dumbledore to spy on him etc. I tend to gravitate towards manipulative but not consciously evil Dumbledore (greater good Dumbledore), fics that portray Ron and Hermione as flawed characters (where their flaws are brought up and addressed but not bashed)etc.

I find fics by going to the author's profile of stories I loved and seeing what else they have written, scrolling through the bookmarks/favourite fanfic of authors I like and browsing the ao3 tag system.
