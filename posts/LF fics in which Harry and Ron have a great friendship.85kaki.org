  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** Despite not being Harry/Ron centric, Jenorama has always written a great Ron, and he and Harry are great partners and friends. Check out her Potterverse
