Write a short scene in which it is Dobby's name that comes out of the Goblet of Fire.

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Short scene, so 200+ words
- Dobby's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- Not killing off Dobby
- Dobby having been trying to keep Harry safe since he was freed, and his entry into the tournament having been the result of that.
- After the First Task, demand for Dobby-themed merchandise really picks up. His 'jersey' is a pillowcase, people still buy it.
- Dobby's existence derailing the entire plot.
- Dobby basically becoming House Elf Jesus
- The Great Wizard Harry Potter Sir being worshipped by House Elves everywhere.


** Dumbledore read the scrap of paper again, and closed his eyes. He sighed deeply.

The other school heads looked on as Dumbledore pulled a bottle of Firewhiskey out from under his podium, pulled the cork with his teeth, and took a deep drink.

"Mister Potter?"

Harry's head snapped upwards. "Yes, Headmaster?"

"I've heard you've got an excellent disarming charm, could you cast it on me, please?"

"Erm, okay... /Expelliarmus!/"

Dumbledore's wand soared across the room into Harry's other hand.

"That was necessary for reasons I don't quite feel like explaining. But now," Dumbledore threw the scrap of paper on the podium, "I quit. I can't deal with year after /Merlin-be-damned/ year going FUBAR. Make Harry do this, I'm going to go to the Bahamas. I hope I never see any of you ever again. Fawkes?"

Dumbledore's phoenix appeared in the air above him, and landed on his arm. It trilled enthusiastically, winked at Harry, and whisked the old Headmaster away in a flash of flame

Harry, almost in a trance, walked over to the podium and picked up the scrap of paper. He looked at it, blinked, and then sighed.

"Dobby, what the actual fuck."

*=====[HOURS LATER]=====*

"So you mean to tell me," said Harry slowly, "not only does Dobby have to participate in the Triwizard Tournament, but I am legally the Headmaster of Hogwarts just because Dumbledore said to make me do this?"

Crouch shrugged defeatedly. "I do not write the laws, Headmaster Potter. I only follow and, on occasion, enforce them."

"I haven't even passed my OWLS! I'm not even of age!"

"As Headmaster, you are automatically considered of age."

"Wonderful. At least Professor McGonagall already does most of the paperwork."

  After Slytherin made his Chamber of Secrets, all the other founders made their own secret rooms. Ravenclaw made her own super-secret Librarium, Hufflepuff made the Room of Requirement, and Gryffindor? He decided to outdo them all. [Oneshot, crackfic, vaguely AU]

** The Hogwarts kitchens were frozen. Metaphorically, not literally. Every house-elf in there had stopped and was deep in thought.

Hermione Granger had been by, and unlike the vast majority of other stories, she had made a /really/ convincing argument against house-elf slavery.

First she had started with listening to them, hearing why they thought slavery was appropriate for them, poking and prodding and asking for the 'whys' and 'hows', until the elves weren't quite sure of the whys and hows themselves.

Then she had asked questions of her own, about more complex jobs the elves could be doing, from rescue work to medical care to environmental conservation and perhaps even law enforcement. She had explained about economics, of buying labour, the flow of money, how not being paid for their work meant that they couldn't pay anyone else for anything...

She had topped it off with a silly comment about how Muggle children knew all about Santa Claus and his workforce of toy-making elves, how they would give gifts to all the good little boys and girls all over the world...after she had left, that particular tale had stuck with them.

"We is best be serving witches and wizards...by paying them for their work?" one whispered.

"Muggles receive gifts from elves for Chrissymas?" another whispered.

"We would be's the best elves ever if we gave every witch and wizard in Hoggywarts gifts for Christmas..."

"But we are not being paid, how will we pay for gifts?"

"I is being paid, but only one Galleon a week, it is not enough for gifties for everyone..."

There was a pause, then one of the elves whispered, "There is a one thousand galleon prize for winning the Triwizard Tournament."

--------------

"Hang on, the Goblet still hasn't gone out!"

The Great Hall quieted; everyone turned to look at the Goblet, which was indeed still burning merrily after spitting out Harry Potter's name.

There was a pause, then a /very long/ piece of parchment was spat out of the Goblet, before it finally shuddered and went out.

Dumbledore picked up the roll of parchment, "Abby, Beaker, Binky, Cuccoo, Dobby, Dumble, Ellie, Fluffer...this is the names of every house-elf in Hogwarts...?"

The aged headmaster read down the long list with an incredulous look, his eyes slowly widening as his imagination conjured up thoughts of just what would happen with over a hundred determined house-elves vs each of the tasks, before he suddenly noticed a postscript at the end of the scroll.

"What's this? P.S. Master Harry didn't put his name in; we saw Maddy Moody do it."

"And that is my cue to run away." Mad-Eye Moody muttered dryly as everyone turned to stare at him.

**** The real question is, what's the thing they'd miss the most for the second task?

...The students? Dumbledore himself? Dobby's thing he'd miss the most would probably be Harry Potter, but since he's a champion himself...
