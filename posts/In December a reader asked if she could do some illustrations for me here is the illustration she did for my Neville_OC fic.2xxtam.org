** Is the Vos mos est mihi mortem supposed to be You'll Be The Death of Me? That's not proper latin. :| Better would be : "Mihi mortem eris."

Maybe "Tu mihi mortem eris." if you really wanna emphasize the You.

Nice art though, and I can't even imagine how amazing it would be if some put that much effort into something I made.

*** I believe it is supposed to be French and thank you. It was really sweet of her to do this, she wants to do scene illustrations for me too and I'm insanely excited for those, but she teaches at a university so her time is pretty limited. Still I love seeing my OC.

Edit: nope it is supposed to be Latin. She must have just google translated.

**** It was definitely intended to be Latin, it's just bad Latin.

****** The weird thing is Google translates 'vos mos est mihi mortem' as 'you will be the death of me', but it does not translate 'you'll be death of me' as 'vos mos est mihi mortem'. No idea where she got it.

Here is the artists' page. She's done some other Harry Potter drawings invade anyone is interested in looking :)

And if anyone is interested here is the link to my fic. It's Neville/OC, the OC is Draco Malfoy's twin sister, and it takes place 6th year after the ministry ordeal.

*** Here is the artist's picture of Luna. In case you were interested. I think she looks more like a girl version of Draco, her eyes aren't big like Luna's and her face has sharper features. I always imagined Luna having very soft features. But I guess they could look similar.
