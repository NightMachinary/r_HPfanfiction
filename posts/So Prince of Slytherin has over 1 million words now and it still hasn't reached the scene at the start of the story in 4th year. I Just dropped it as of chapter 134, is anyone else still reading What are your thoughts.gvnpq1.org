*** A few chapters ago he literally doubled the length of 4 chapters by having the main character go back through everything that happened during those 4 chapters over 6 chapters of time travel, leading to 10 chapters of almost absolute standstill plot.

Edit:

And this new timeline is only slightly different and the the difference is now irrelvant anyways because just 4 chapters later the outcome of the original timeline is equivilant to the outcome of recent events.

**** Did you read the new timeline, because there was some massive differences in the timelines.>! In the first Timeline he learns about the Potter Family Prophecy before being told he is going to be apart of the ultimate sanction for killing Remus. Instead Remus survives, Regulus Black survives, and Marcus Flint isn't killed. I also enjoy the fact that not everyone can use a timeturner, the idea that only some people are chosen to use it and that the unspeakables are the ones to see about giving it to the people the timeturner chooses. Then with the new timeline Harry Leaves the Potter family with a small fortune and joins the Black and Wilkes Families instead of recieving the ultimate sanction. His claiming the Wilkes seat now helps save Amy Wilkes from having marry Lord Nott; while avoiding the santion Sirius calls a blood fued on the Potters causing Harry to hate all the Potters, splitting the twins up once again. It is something I could easily see Sirius impulsively doing without thinking it through. Harry is also now the Prince of Slytherin!<I enjoy reading the story for all its small quirks, its good writing, and the fact its constantly being updated.

***** The differences are negligible since most of the changes are to unimportant characters plotwise.

Of the differences that are important, they're undone by chapter 133 with Harry's leaving the family, and Sirius using magic to force Harry to hate all Potters by accident, and Peter managing to escape custody.

In short, the last 10 chapters are essentially filler and we're right back where we left off in the Original Timeline, only with a few irrelevant characters still alive but everything else essentially identical. Harry was already on his way to joining up with Sirius anyway.

Harry got himself some cash, big whoop.

Also, I preferred the original timelines implications anyways. Having someone actually die for once and having that impact Harry later on is good character development material.

Instead we get yet another deus ex machina in the form of magic curses forcing the characters to behave artificially like they were at the start of the story in the scene in 4th year, rather than having a realistic fallout be the cause of that animosity.

The author doesn't invert tropes even though he said he would.

The author is afraid to take controversial chances with plot developments and character deaths.

The author seems incapable of writing believable tension and drama between characters without resorting to magicdidit.

And to top it all off, the story took 4 times as long as it needed to be to get to where it is.

Then there are the normal stable of minor characters. The only real difference is that quite a few minor characters lose importance, or are introduced and left behind while the main characters move on, so that the story can periodically flash back to show what's happening in the area the main characters left.

There's also literally a glossary in the back of the book that has a brief description of characters or terms.

***** pfft, Wheel of Time character confusion has got nothing on the 1632 series. Wheel of Time was similar to Game of Thrones, except it was finished. It also has a nice habit, like Thrones, of killing off characers so that you don't have to remember them.

Here is a quote of insanity about 1632. "The series also includes fan-written, but professionally edited, collaborative material which are published in bi-monthly magazine titled The Grantville Gazettes and some collaborative short fictions." You'll be reading a book and find out that the character, that everyone acts like is well known, is from one of those fan stories. It was absolutely maddening. Wikipedia says the series is up to 60+ books right now.

** Im still reading and will continue to.

I dont find length to be a problem with WIPs that Im already updated on, I can handle reading one chapter per week and even if it doesnt do much for the plot I dont feel bad about it. I think saying that the "writer isnt having a seizure while writing" is an understatement. The writing is way above average for fanfiction. Plot is slow but I dont really read it just for the plot, todays scene for example doesnt seem to advance the plot much but I still enjoyed reading it. I do care about a lot of the characters and enjoy that they have a backstory.

My favorite parts of the original books were just Hogwarts life that didnt really advance the plot either, aka not that blatant filler. I enjoy reading that kind of stuff.

The fic also has an active discord server so I get a notification when there is a new chunk, and since there is one like every other day Im kept engaged. I really like regular updates.

I (and probably other readers idk) just prioritize the fics strengths (characters, worldbuilding, writing quality) more than you do, and dont mind the slow plot as much.

Its not my favourite fic but its more than good enough for me to subscribe to.

I don't think it's perfect. It could very much do with an editor. But over the years I've adjusted my fanfic tastes to accommodate the fact that I'm reading amateur fiction. It's never going to be the same quality as professionally published works.

I read for interesting characters, which PoS has in abundance, and good world building, which is probably the biggest strength of the fic. As long as there is some level of plot I'm happy, even if it's slow or clunky at times.

*** If you're after any recommendations, then "interesting characters and world building, slow plot" definitely fits the linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) series. It's probably my favorite Sirius characterisation, and I love seeing Harry get a flawed-but-caring home and (at least a few years of) childhood. Lots of other characters get fleshed out, too; Remus, Tonks, Snape, Draco, Ginny.

And linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has justifiable Severus/Lily that really gets inside their heads and explores how their relationship develops. Justifiable because Severus is sent back in time after his death, so he is very aware of his own faults and mistakes. He wins her over fairly through his care and devotion and intelligence, and she helps him to (slowly) become a better person.

Both of the above could use more proofreading, but the storytelling makes that very forgivable.

If he really wanted to write about so many different characters in the same universe he would've been better off having them only be on the periphery, and have their own stories fleshed out in their own books separate from the main book.

Essentially, there's lots of good Slytherin Harry stories, but most of them are abandoned or old/completed so people have already read them.

Plus it's very long which always attracts people. Sadly the length is mostly padding and the world building has substituted the plot.

It's a really great story that hits all the things I want in a fic, and I have no issue reading long works (just finished Worm and Ward, the second of which I read chapter by chapter as it released, same as PoS).

I get being annoyed at how long it's taking and how long it likely will take, but it's a very ambitious story that is written really well, and the author doesn't just do fanfic so it doesn't really bother me.

Being in the Discord, TSM posts chunks of each chapter as he finishes them, so usually at least one or two a week and that means it's easy to keep up with the story and not get lost.

** Prince of Slytherin is simply the best Slytherin Harry fic that is ongoing as of now. Although the plot is slow to continue and it may seem boring and at times confusing as to what the endpoint is, the world-building and regular updates make up for it. The author's even got a discord where he posts parts of the upcoming chapter beforehand. Also, I think having so many grey, fully developed characters is going to be a boon as it progresses further. It's also kind of cool that the author has also actually published their own books as well. I would say stick with it, I feel like its going to blow up even more in the future.

*** It's not a normal fic tbh. The author has been been consistently updating it for 5 years. The plot of the story started in a AU world that was inherently interesting and morally flawed and is slowly moving to the apocalypse. I wouldn't be surprised if the story ends by Harry's 6th year. Every chapter I feel like the stakes are getting higher. Whenever a conflict is about to be resolved, another one comes seemingly out of nowhere and permanently alters the story. The author is dedicated to the story. The update schedule only got slowed down when he was writing his own book for god's sake. This argument that the fic is too long and goes onto detail too much is kind of hacky for those reasons. The story will likely finish and not be left abondoned like so many great fics to be. Just be patient tbh, you're reading a fanfic epic at this point.

First, though, yes I'm still following. I'm at the bloody minded stage now. I've got this far and I'll damn well see it through. It's not one that ever makes me leap with joy when an update appears though.

Others have identified most of the problems: too many characters, too little editing and so on.

I suspect the editing problem stems from his methods: editing the story on Discord is a recipe for disaster. The latest chapter has 23 named editors. If you're trying to make some broth with that many cooks, you're bound to spoil it. If you ever try to cut something you're bound to get someone saying they liked it so you end up leaving it in.

I dont know if you're trying to be purposely condescending and/or insulting or you don't realize how degrading what you said comes across as. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.

Point is a spell checker is what my predictive text on my phone does or what a basic program on word processing does. To say that's what this poster's dedicated works the same as is saying there no different than a mindless basic computer code can do and they could be rreplaced by the paper clip on Microsoft Word with the same results. That's really harsh.

Also I dont believe its accurate. It seems like they do spelling, grammar and punctuation but also giving ideas and helping rework syntax and phrasing for anything from sentences to larger pieces of prose Sure they have to work with the more limited knowledge of only what they've read so far compared to other editors who have access to the whole story, but working with what they have it seems they still discuss ways to rework scenes, take out information that contradicts something said earlier in the story, point out anachronisms and offer input on the plot and pacing up to what they've read.

Would that be some kind of upgraded betaing or communal editing that's different from professional esiromg of course. Fan fic editing might be a"proper" description because fanfics is obviously not professional. Honestly it seems pedantic to debate the OP about the verbiage they've need to describe what they do. I just wanted to say the only comments people had left were all pretty unnecessarily mean. And as I discussed, incorrect factually.

*** I'm gonna reply here rather than to the thread that's developed. But you're kind of proving my point. It sounds like there are loads of editors at least commenting on the plot before it's published. That 's going to lead to confusion and things being kept around that should be trimmed.

If an author has 20+ people commenting on what's good and what's bad it's going to lead to conflict. And I stand by my belief that this story has kept stuff around that should have been trimmed, because one of those 20+ editors/betas/whatever liked it.

When I'm discussing plot points with [[/u/TE7]] it's with an understanding that it's his story and up to him what he does with it. Usually when I have an objection to something that happens it's because he knows what's going to happen later in the story. Sometimes it's because I've misunderstood something and that may or may not lead to a bit of rewriting to clear things up. Only once or twice have I had major problems with something he's written - and I think we can all agree that Fleur would always be supportive of Pikachu's attempt to evolve even if its stats weren't the best.

Bragging about reaching a million words on one story is missing another point. Shakespeare didn't reach 900,000 words in total and I don't see many critics dismissing his work for being short. As he wrote, "Brevity is the soul of wit", so needing so many words to be a fraction of the way through a story is a failure to be witty if nothing else.

That...is not what I expected, I never read the series because whenever I looked at it as a kid, it just looked, way too long, which is funny because when I was younger I did read one of the "classics" (to kill a mockingbird, I was very bored but also like 11 so that's probably why) and that didn't even seem like /that/ much to me but the entire thing (LoTR) is only like 500k words.

Which is weird, thinking there are fanfics longer. Might have to actually give the series a shot them (uh, LoTR not the prince of slytherin, tried reading that).

***** Not every writer, though. It's a stylistic thing - many can be super verbose.

Eg, some sci fi writers will happily and eagerly go off on page long digressions to explain the technology or background of a technique - David Weber, a military sci-fi writer, is a pretty easy example there of the verbosity/length of some of his series expanding to a huge degree.

Professional writers are often quite good at being concise, but it's not always the case - just like some fanfic writers are very concise in some works, but others aren't.

HP1 doesn't really have all that much packed into it - at least, it's very surface level (which makes sense). Most fanfic authors prefer to delve a little deeper into the characters/world/plot than HP1 did - that's not bad. Besides which there are some great fanfics in the 80-100k word lengths, barely longer than HP1.

There's a fic in the Mob Psycho fandom that is over 1,000,000 words, but there still hasn't been any real romance between the main pairing. There's slow burn, and then there's slow torture.

I got a quarter of the way through that story, and I've just chosen to shelve it until I've got nothing better to do. Hopefully, when I pick it up again the author will have published enough for me to look forward to a development.

I can understand why not everyone would agree, but I enjoy the MOSTLY realistic characters. It never seems as if anyone is doing something terribly out of their established character, or that any character is perfect and without fault. I also enjoy the creative aspect of the characters, in that they're mostly opposites of how their depicted in typical FF while staying true. What I mean is stuff like Lucius still being a manipulative prick, but not being evil. Remus is still a self loathing wreck, but doesn't spend the story moaning and reminiscing.

Chapter 125 should have ended with Harry walking out of Dumbledore's office instead of Hermione showing Harry the time turner. I got tired of every chapter raising more questions than it was answering.

Anyway, so I waited for a few chapters to accumulate and then read them in one go. They were pretty cool and everything went back to normal for a while. But that last chapter has finally put me off completely. The conversation between James and the goblin is cut in the middle and we learn nothing. We've spent the last few chapters reading about just how much brain dead Rookwood is and in the latest chapter he just gets up and starts killing people left, right and center. It's not like Sirius needed months to recover from Azkaban. But Rookwood didn't get worse in Azkaban- he got better! I guess he was just a masochist and liked the dementors.

So yeah, I'm done with this fic. I'll probably wait a few years and then come back to see what happened out of morbid curiosity. But at this point, it seems the author is simply enjoying punishing the good guys for their successes. And that's just not my thing.

Oh, and there are far too many POV changes. While it's incredible how much thought and imagination has been put in the reader can't really care for all of the characters.

And all of the plot development with people like his brother (I've forgotten his name) and james is basically pointless as we already know that by the end of book 4 they hate harry again.

I hate how smart harry and is, the stuff he does is extremely unrealistic for a child, the way all the adults treat him and how he leads everything.

There's just so much extra stuff that they then complete remove. He did all the taking about wandless spells only for short to only be able to use 1, Accio wand. All that backstory with Regulus, Lucius, Snape. The only thing I did like was Bellatrix/Miss Demeanour but that's only because the concept of 2 different people using the same body is just really cool.

*** Taste is subjective.

In the case of PoS and HPMOR, there are some good aspects. The writing quality is fairly high, they have some intricate plots, some world building, etc.

However, they're obviously not for everyone. They also get (or used to get) recommended and praised frequently, which invariably causes a backlash.

This is particularly true when it gets mainstream recognition, like HPMOR, while being... controversial? As in, it's definitely not a fic for everyone, and can be seen to have failed in what it supposedly characterized itself as (eg, I don't see the fic as being a good take on a scientific or rational version of Harry, which is what I'd initially been interested in).

As for PoS, some of the decisions made by the author will obviously not be universally liked. An obvious one is the characterization - having the students, from a young age, engage in politicking and talking like adults isn't going to always be liked. Length of a story can be a detriment - some people prefer a tighter plot that doesn't meander or stagnate. And worldbuilding for a series like HP - which is very vague in canon - can easily cross some lines for some people for which point it's no longer HP.

Basically, PoS is a good story... if someone likes long stories, likes a Slytherin!Harry, and so on - but that doesn't mean everyone does - or should - like it.

Harry is usually ignored by his parents (who survived because reasons). That's if they keep him at all and don't abandon him to hateful/abusive Dursley's because 1) they need to focus on training the twin for his inevitable battle with Voldemort, 2) don't want Harry to be jealous of 1), and/or 3) mistakenly believe that Harry is a squib/had his magic damaged in the Voldemort confrontation.

Eventually Harry turns up at Hogwarts and the 2D caricatures that are James and Lily remember he exists/are spiteful that he has magic or whatever other fuckery is involved.

It eventually comes out that Harry really is the Chosen One because the twin might have the confidence and the training but he doesn't have the prophecy armor to protect him from Voldemort.

** I love it. I drop everything to read the discord updates and it consistently impresses me with its plot and twists, the most recent of which was the revelation by Harry in the court room. I have seen others here say that it does not subvert the WBWL tropes, but I disagree. In first year, Jim was as Mary Sue as all the other twins in other WBWL stories, but he has grown into an actualized character I buy and believe in. Similarly, James and Lily are interesting. Their relationship is deeply flawed, something rarely seen in fics that aren't explicitly about what an asshole James is or something. The background characters do not oversaturate the story to me, and I'm genuinely interested in all of them and (more importantly) genuinely believe those subplots will come to fruition in very intriguing ways. His world building (with just the DOM alone) is phenomenal and intriguing, and his portrayal of the mind arts is the most compelling and interesting I've ever read in fanfiction.

This post seems to have an air of annoyance that, at a million words, the story still hasn't reached the opening scene. I don't feel that way. It just makes me more excited to get there. From the beginning words of this story, it felt as if he had a genuine plan for how this story was to progress and that's incredibly rare in fanfiction. I look very forward to seeing where the story is at when we get to the end of fourth year. And I cannot wait to see the directions the story takes when Voldemort returns.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** I don't really mind extremely long fics per se - Benefits of old laws was one of the better fics I've read despite the staggering length. This fic, however, feels ridiculously drawn out. Imo long fics only work if it's all normal content, just a lot of it, as opposed to most long fics where nothing much happens, but they're long because the stuff that happens is extremely drawn out.

** A typical novel is 70,000 words. 120k is the upper limit. If you're GRRM you might get some extra leeway but even then it's ehh. Bottom line: by a million words, your series should be done, or have covered all of Harry's school life, gone through multiple arcs, and should be wrapping up.

Less is more and more is less.

** I'll look forward to reading a much more succinctly edited version in 10 years once the author's finished writing the series. Many of the plot threads could easily be snipped or moved while still keeping the story interesting; the same goes for many of the character backstories, which could be pruned remarkably and edited for conciseness. My main nitpick with the story is that many of the characters do not have "unique voices" that meaningfully distinguish them, which is extremely important when the cast is so large.

As someone who regularly reads web serials and can read very quickly, I don't have too much trouble with the extreme length of the series, and the author's style is thankfully quite readable. I really like the worldbuilding and characterization, but I think the pacing would be greatly enhanced by shoving some of the sideplots and side character studies into separate works that complemented the main storyline.

** This is one of the reasons why I feel 'Sarcasm and Slytherin ' does a better job with the same concept. PoS has a hell of a lot of works building (it has my favorite depiction of Lockhart, I love the lore building about Azkabam, and GOD DAMN that tease about those two Dementors.....), but yeah I can't believe that it is this long and still in book 3.

Still reading it though.

*** While the high concept plot is similar, those two fics are pretty different in a key aspect.

Sarcasm takes the WBWL tropes and unironically embraces them without being self aware about them at all.

Prince uses the tropes, but at least tries to justify them to some extent and seems self aware about why a lot of people don't like them, at least for some of them.

**** Which is precisely why I hate PoS, and love S&S.

If I'm in the mood to read the tropes, then I want a story that takes itself utterly serious, and does the best with it. And when I'm not in the mood, then I read something else -- but what I'm /never/ in the mood for is reading constant reminders of how what I'm reading is actually bad and a reason for jokes.

Like, what a spectacular waste of time? I never got how people enjoy that, for me it's utterly off-putting. I tried PoS three times by now, never got anywhere. It's just bad.

Honestly, my favourite part of it is shooting the breeze, talking shit about the fic, talking shit about hpfanfic in general, having playful ship-wars etc.

And then occasional updates on how harry "POLITICAL GENIUS"'s some poor sod. 90% of my enjoyment is from the server, 20% from the fic.

But I enjoy the fic, it's only about average though.

I can't believe people make it past the first chapter tbh, nevermind read a million words of that stuff.

Regardless, I don't think the length in necessarily a problem, canon is actually a *really* quick read for fantasy novel standards. 1m words for three books is GRR Martin pace, kinda normal.
