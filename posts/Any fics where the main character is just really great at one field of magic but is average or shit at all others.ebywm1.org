  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic)

He is incredible at Transfiguration and okay at best with everything else.

*** I'm not saying it doesn't fit, but I think it should be noted that Harry here isn't inherently bad at other types of magic, he just refuses to put any effort into them because he doesn't like them.

**** That's fair enough, he really strikes me as someone with mild autism. He can function enough to get by fairly well he just chooses not to care about most things besides his focus. He comes off a bit aspie just missing some of the ego traits they have.

***** Yeah. The author has a note on one of the chapters claiming that he isn't... But they also say that he's based off of two people they know; one who is autistic and another who people often think is autistic.

** I feel obligated to suggest The Art of Self-Fashioning, linkao3(5103614). It's a nice change from the usual skilled-at-absolutely-everything-he-tries-Harry.

Even stories focusing on Neville are usually about his skill in herbology and not much else, just like when he is a side character. I can't think of anything specific at the moment, but many Draco focused stories have him skilled at potions, but not usually bad at the other subjects except CoMC.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
