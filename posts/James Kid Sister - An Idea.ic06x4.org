I posted the following [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i8i7s4/james_having_a_kid_sister/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]] nearly a week a go, and realized I was pretty hooked on the idea and not finding much written to what I was looking for so I wanted to see if there was any interest in the following sort of story;

Dorea Cirilla Potter, was born late in Fleamont's and Euphemia Potter lives, their daughter was born premature, and since they thought she wouldn't make it made a decision that would alter her life forever. Fleamont contacted a very old family friend who saved the girl with his blood.

She was in her sixth year at Hogwarts when her brother and his wife were murdered. A once bright and ambitious student Dorea turned to the seedy underbelly of society, the man who saved her life as an infant, and wanted to forget everything.

Our story begins with Dorea being visited by Dumbledore in a muggle institution known as a "Rehabilitation Facility" ... she is nearly a year "clean" Dumbledore offers her a job as Madame Hooch will be retiring soon, and Dorea (like her brother) had been a talented flyer and Quidditch player.

The story follows Dorea as she grapples with addiction, the guilt she feels in leaving her only living relative alone in the world, her place in magical society as a vampire and how to move forward with her life.

I do always include romance. I haven't figured out with who yet, so I'm hoping it develops naturally. I think its going to be a lot darker than I had posted about a week ago, but I'd love any thoughts on it!

It will be AU, and canon will obviously alter as needed


** With the amount of whisky flowing around Hogwarts it will be difficult to stay sober. Or will she found the first Magical Alcoholic Anonymous (with McGonagall as the other founding member)?

*** It's not alcohol she's addicted to ;) although I love the idea of her and McGonagall starting a magical version of AA XD

She's addicted to human blood, growing up she only ever drank blood repleshiment potions which her father made, but after their deaths and James/Lily's death she dived into the seedy vampire underworld

** Vampires are barely human in Harry Potter, so I feel she'd be rather boring as an OC.

The fact James could have an estranged sibling? That's interesting, a still living Potter that Harry didn't have any interaction with raises all sorts of questions.

*** I could see that ...although it is an AU so I can play with whatever I like, perhaps some sort of potion or like 'highness' that makes her forget about things instead, she was a kid practically when they died, ran away from her problems/responsibilities, and the book begins her journey of sobering up and so forth

** I am definitely interested. The only major plot holes that I would like to see explained is where was she during Harry's whole life and what happened after her brother died? Was she estranged to James up until his death, or did they become close? Also, Madam Hooch is still around during Harry's years, which leads me to believe that something happened to Dorea shortly after her brothers death.

I think those would be the only things that I would love to see in continuity with J.K. Rowlings books. With those in place, that would keep me pretty damn engaged and immersed. I cant wait to see what you do with it!

** But why make her James' sister?

If you want to do something as massive as giving Harry another aunt and James a sister, then you need to work these things into the premise in a way that logically follows what that would change, or it comes across as a cheap attempt to tie it into canon, which it's not and which leaves a foul taste in most readers' mouths.

Not only that, but you're needlessly constraining yourself by making her related to several people who are intricately important to the story, as well as altering one of the core reasons for why anything actually happens by giving the Potters another child and stopping James from growing up as an only child. This, in turn, changes James' character to the point of making things happen very differently, which then changes the story in unknowable ways.

And if you ignore all that, your story will be illogically structured from a narrative standpoint. Ignoring the logical consequences of a divergence is one of the surest ways to ensure that your story drives itself into a corner.

And what would even be the relevance of her being James' sister? This would be better served through an OC rather than attempting to tie it into a defined canon storyline while not having said storyline be relevant in any way.

*** Thank you for the thoughts

Its fanfiction so why not have her be James sister it's just an idea

â€‹

edit: to answer more clearly, in my opinion, there's no reason to have to follow canon precisely, I actually enjoy a lot of canon divergent stories, to answer 'why make her James sister' because that was my idea no other reason than a thought popped into my head. The relevance? There could be a lot, Harry's anger over a living relative that isn't the Dusleys, the feelings of abandonment by his only magical family, ect
