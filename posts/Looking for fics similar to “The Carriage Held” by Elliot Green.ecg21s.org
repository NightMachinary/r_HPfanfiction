AKA psychological horror (if that's the correct genre?), mystery, and mindfuckery. The undercover Umbridge seduction would simply be a bonus. Gen preferred.


** The characterization of Snape in [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] is very similar to The Carriage Held.

The basic premise is that an accident in Potions class causes the entirety of Hogwarts to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating the same day over and over. Snape and Hermione are the only people who realize what is happening, and thus begins a slow spiral down into psychological horror.

Personally I love the understated dark tone of the fic mixed with Snape's dry attitude towards his predicament. It's technically a Hermione/Snape fic, but romance is not a focus of the plot, and in one of the endings the pairing doesn't actually come true. Thus, I'd describe it as Gen.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all? (OotP AU. Go inside the mind of Severus Snape as he tackles several beguiling mysteries, and risks everything he holds dear.) COMPLETE.
