I'd like to read some good fan fiction stories about Draco Malfoy as I think that his character after the war is a compelling story. I do, however, have one condition. There can be ABSOLUTELY no Drarry, Dramione, Draco/Ginny etc. Too much has happened between these people for love to happen. I would also strongly prefer the canon pairings such as Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione but obviously those would be in the background and are less important. Extra bonus points if Astoria Greengrass is actually involved.


** This may be a little dark, (ymmv). And it's still incomplete - the last update was in dec 2015.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** This is actually a prequel to the author's next-gen series, but I'm avoiding those until I finish this one.

  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
