Hello, I'm looking for fics like Untitled Tome by Ihateseatbelts. Fics where there is no Voldemort and Grindelwald is the main villain and where muggleborns are living with purebloods/halfbloods (I prefer by their choice but by force would also work) or muggleborns are taught separately from purebloods could work as well.

If there are only fics that fits one of the criteria then it's fine, would love to read those as well. Thanks.


** Check out linkffn(Skitterleap) by enembee, who is quite the wordsmith. To be honest, the Unititled Tome is quite unique in both premise and execution. If you want some of the similar world building aspects, try linkffn(Old Blood), which still does feature Voldemort as the main antagonist. If you haven't already, I really recommend the absolute epic that is linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) which has a world that Voldemort already won, and isn't quite an antagonist. I'd say more but I don't want to spoil it.

â€‹

Happy reading!

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just started a third year, updstes weekly, no Voldemort in sight (though it is still possible that he existed but was much more secretive in his actions).

*** Because only now I have read the details. Grindelwald is dead here, muggleborns are informed about magic before starting school (Hogwarts starts at 13).
