Unsure if this is allowed but I'll happily take it down and go elsewhere if it isn't. But now let me explain;

So to be more specific, I've just recently got back in my Harry Potter mood and began roleplaying again since it's been a very long while. It's only a one-on-one, where my partner and I have discussed a few introductory things. This starts in a AU in a next generation Hogwarts (nothing to do with the source materials line of events) and takes place in present day. It begins from year 1 for some development between our characters but it'll probably just from one year to another.

Now, I was hoping if fellow HP fans could possibly help jumpstart a few possibilities that we could do for later, like plot ideas we can use in a year; action/adventures s what conflict could happen. But differs enough from the Golden Trio's era! Also I would absolutely appreciate if there's any HP fanfics you can link so I could read, that features OCs as to help me prepare myself to get motivated and ready to write again.


** A few ideas:

Room of requirement has recovered quietly from the fiendfire and finally starts to work again, although a bit wonky. Perhaps it randomly spits out stuff, creates new passages in the castle, swallows up people

A random magical artefact shows up and causes ppl to act strangely (Alters minds maybe/oblivates ppl maybe induces a body switch or turns someone into an animal, has ppl stuck in a time loop etc)

The Forbidden Forest poses enough possibilities.

OC's getting bitten by werewolves, Centaurs probably still reside there, a student going missing/lost in there

Becoming Animagi

Muggle technology being adapted to survive magic

Love potions have been stolen during class and are distributed amongst students

Quidditch (Captains from different houses try to hide their relationship. It explodes when it come out. Or people try to find it out etc)

Someone is Metamorphmagus

An OC turns out to be a seer but doesn't realize it aka like Ron making assumtions that turn out true

The new DaDa teacher is secretly a Vampire

Triwizading Tournament starting up once again.

Hogwarts ghosts mysteriously vanish

A prank war

*** I was actually thinking of bringing a tournament in someway in a later year, possibly between the four houses where you can pick a teammate to help in certain tasks and train with you. But accessible to all years. Still thinking about it though. I just love tournament archetypes

**** Yeah, you could always make an inter Hogwarts one. Like Lupin's final exam - the students had to walk through a swamp, fight off a grindylow and in the end face a boggart. You could make it into some sort of house cup Tournament or so where stundents have to walk through a parkour of some kind

Edit: I'm stupid and overlooked that you already stated that you thought of a Tournament between the houses. Anyway that sounds really cool. You could also force ppl to have to work with other students from different houses if you want some more tension at to "strengthen house unity" or so
