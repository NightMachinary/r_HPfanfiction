Voldemort, after his graduation, went on a sabatical for years, befote he came back and created the death eaters. He led a political and violent rebellion with his followers, most of whom were from the house of the lion.

Inspired, and dedicated to the cause of Beings, beasts, muggleborns and more, he seized the government and eventually Hogwarts under his control to form a new government, after killing many, including (possibly) Dumbledore.

Voldemort is still a sociopath, and still wants power, just led in a different direction.


** There is a fic where Luna Lovegood adopts Tom and raises him believing that his dad is Harry Potter. It is hinted by the end of the story that Tom starts a revolution against the purebloods because he saw the injustices endured by muggleborns. Can't quite remember the title though.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

** There is a Gryffindor Tom Riddle fic that's basically this prompt called There is Nothing to Fear by Callmesalticidae on AO3 and Space battles and I love it. Here's a link.

** Can you imagine? Summer after the Harry's sixth year and Voldemort announces to his Death Eaters: “So, that's it! It is summer, time for vacations. Going with Bella to Rimini. See ya' in September, bye!”. And then we have The Very Dark Lord sitting in his (mid-1920s') swimming trunks on the beach, drinking cocktail from glass with small umbrella on it, with Bellatrix next to him sunbathing.

You didn't know you need this, but you do!
