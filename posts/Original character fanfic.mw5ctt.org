im looking for a good fanfic with characters who weren't in the original books or who at least were minor characters. so no fanfics featuring the golden trio. also no romances please. i would like a good mystery.


** Mine is in progress, but it is heavily OC driven, and is not focused on the trio at all. Also, it is not romance and it is a murder mystery. If it's not your thing, no big deal, but it checks your boxes.

I am always on the hunt for good non romantic mysteries, so I will let you know if i find some, too. I kind of wrote mine because they were so lacking.

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a certain dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** Have you read the Alexandra Quick series? Not just an original character, but the whole thing is set in America and doesn't follow really any of JK's thoughts on the US magical world. It takes a little while to get going but is just full of mystery, adventure and has got to count as one of the best fanfiction series ever written. Anybody who hasn't read it has a LOT of reading to do

**** Yeah you need to give it a bit of time. I have loved and hated Alexandra, the main character, more than any OC I can think of. A lovely, truly human character with flaws and sometimes infuriating - but realistic, for a kid - decision making skills, surrounded by adults who don't understand her. It's a real coming of age story. The world that's been crafted is insane, with entire hidden worlds, strange creatures and genuinely blurred lines between good and bad. You'll get there!

  what if Sirius wasn't the oldest Black brother? That's it, that's the fic. Read for a story where the Black household on Grimmauld Place isn't quite so overtaken by the trainwreck that is the Walburga-Sirius unchecked clash of titanic personalities as it is in canon, and Sirius isn't the Black son with the weight of expectations landing heaviest on his shoulders. Stay for the adorable Regulus and Sirius Black as eccentric small children.
