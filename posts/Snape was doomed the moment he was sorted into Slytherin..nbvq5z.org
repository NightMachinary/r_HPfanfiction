** Lily complained to Snape about him hanging out with Mulciber and Avery, which apparently already a huge creep even before the incident with Snape nearly entering the Shrieking Shack. They were barely teenagers back then. If every single Slytherin is forced to join the cult, Lily would've noted how fucked up the house was, but her complaint implies she understands Snape has a choice. James angrily telling Snape to apologize, his indignation on misunderstanding the insinuation he'd ever use a word so vile he didn't even say it, and Lily's word the night after Snape called her Mudblood also hint that the word isn't used casually by the whole Slytherins, Snape seemed to be one of the few who used it openly.

Both Sirius and Kreacher said Regulus was a true believer in Pureblood supremacy, Sirius speculated Regulus was freaked out about how far the Death Eaters are willing to go, and Kreacher's account hint that it's the Horcrux and Voldemort's cavalier attitude about Kreacher's fate that finally make him snap.

  Anyone who was in Slytherin at the time had basically two choices, join or die.
#+end_quote

No.

Whatever comes our way... whatever battle is raging inside us, we /always/ have a choice...It's the choices that make us what we are... and we can always choose to do what's /right./
