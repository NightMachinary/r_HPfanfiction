It was lighthearted humour fic set at the Burrow during the summer probably with some Ron bashing. I've looked on ffn and portkey but can't find it again. I believe it was about 5-10 chapters and not very long.

 

Plot: Ron has made a list which is his step by step plan to get with Hermione in a somewhat manipulative way but leaves it lying about and the twins find it. The twins then run interference to mess with Ron. Harry much to Ron's chagrin coincidentally (or maybe due to some helping interference from the twins) completes the items on the list and eventual harmony results. Thanks for any help.


** I don't know, but if you do find it I would like to read.

** It's not the story you're looking for, but you might like it anyway since it has a similar theme: "She will be mine"

** Thanks guys, I've just found it on Portkey. For those that were interested it is rated NC17 which I didn't remember; so even though I haven't read it again I'm assuming there's a fair bit of smut.

It's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/14][One Hot Summer]] written by Ryoko Blue.
