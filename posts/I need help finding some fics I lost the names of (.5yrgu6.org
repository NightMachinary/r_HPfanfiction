I had this whole list that i had gathered together of fics from LJ, FFN, AFF, AO3 and other random sites that I had this great plan of eventually posting somewhere but I transferred it to my phone and I thought the cloud would keep it safe but somehow it's gone now ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡ Anyway there are two fics that I've been specifically looking for that i hope some kind souls can direct me to: (Um... spoilers I guess)

1) an AU where the wizarding world is pretty much destroyed by the war, so Dumbledor gives Harry a universe jumping magic necklace. Harry ends up popping around to all kinds of universes and they start off really light and steadily get waay darker. For example, in the beginning he goes to worlds where he ended up in Slytherin, or one where he's a girl (a lot of those classic AU scenarios) and he gets to meet the Harry that lives there. It gets absolutly heart wrenching at some parts... ***/more spoilery part/***I think he ends up with Snape but he has all kinds of relationships along the way... he even gets raped by himself onetime... The whole point of it is that you have to make a place your home, it's not just going to be tailor made and perfect.

2) this one is a lot shorter but also HP/SS. Harry gets invited to a threesome with Bill and Fleur in the attic of the Burrow, and they start getting at it but somehow Harry gets bitten by the Weasley ghoul. The ghoul is a crazy half vampire half ghoul hybrid though and Harry turns into one too. Eventually his ghoulish tendencies lead him to clattering around the dungeons once he goes back to school where the whole pairing starts up.

Anyway if you help, I'll draw you a cute picture of what you request... Not that I'm good at drawing, but I'll do my best. d(^{u^{)}}
