Hi HP fanfiction fans!

I used to write fanfic a lot when I was younger but stopped years ago - I never thought I would get back into fanfic but then I had an idea a few months ago that wouldn't leave me alone and I needed to write it. I wanted to explore themes around love, loss, grief and moving on; and decided to do it through this pairing since I'd always had a soft spot for Colin Creevey as a character (probably because I was a pretty talkative and annoying kid myself) and after reading a fic with Colin/Demelza as a pairing I grew to see them together as a headcanon that I had for the series in general. Demelza was a blank slate and therefore a great character to flesh out for me to make this story work.

The fic is complete, four chapters, around 20k words total. The first two chapters explore their relationship, from their individual perspectives. The third chapter revolves around the Battle and the immediate aftermath and is therefore as angsty as you expect. The fourth is about life after death, i.e., dealing with living once someone you love is dead. I rated it T because of the major character death, there's no sexual content but there is some minor swearing. The story is titled Elsa and I'm on both AO3 and FFNet as PringlesTheWriter, but I've included links here too.

I would really appreciate feedback - thank you so much! If you decide to check it out - I hope you enjoy and that you find it a cathartic read!


** I loved the fic and Colin's death in chapter 3 made me cry.
