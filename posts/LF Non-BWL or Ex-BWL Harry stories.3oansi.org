Anything where Harry isn't forced to fight, but still chooses to help. Or stories like/similar to 0800-Rent-A-Hero, where Harry helps his counterpart.


** - linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived by Kwan Li) is a pretty good one, though I recall it having some issues, and [[/u/KwanLi]] wasn't very happy with how it turned out, though it's been a while.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) has very compelling characters, very rich worldbuilding around Durmstrang, and one of the best models of Occlumency I've seen.

That said, there's this common trope associated with these fics that Harry, freed from BWLness and (usually) neglected by Dumbledore et al. as a result, turns out to be an ubercompetent badass compared to his canon counterpart, and the author reminds you of this fact at every opportunity.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** I just started chapter six and I love the idea of it so far but I wish the author would move forward with the story. It's almost like the author can't make up their mind whether or not they want to write a story about what already happened or what the future holds and just decided to do both. He/she also has a tendency to lose track of what's going on and start over describing or ranting. Nevertheless thank you I have mostly enjoyed it.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

**** It's been a while, but I remember being disappointed as well. There was a sequel and I think the first chapter has been posted, but there hasn't been an update in years, so don't hold your breath.

I think the sequel was going to be a kind of do-over variety of Unsung Hero, but with less hating on the different characters.

*** Thanks I'll take a look at it! I THINK I've read it before and if its the one I'm thinking of I didn't get too far into it. As a parent its hard to read stories that have that whole "my one child is famous so fuck the other one(s)!". It always feels like an excuse for conflict, especially since its almost always the only conflict of the fanfic.
