I recently read Exile by BennyBear and not only was I satisfied in my craving for good redemption fics (IMO : not based on ‚Äúlove trumps it all‚Äù but a real self-questioning, acknowledgments of past faults and mistake), it also gave me a new craving : pure blood discovering and studying muggle science. I loved it. Any fanfic like that you would recommend? (I already read Harry Potter & MOR) Thank in advance.

** You are in the bad situation now: unfortunately, ‚ÄúExile‚Äù is one of the best fanfic out there, so trying to find something as good is a painful quest.

** I've read 'Exile' too it's a shame that there isn't a sequel to it besides that the only fanfic I know of that meets what you're looking for is where Regulus Black after dying in the cave wakes up as the younger brother of Lily & Petunia Evans. He comes to terms with his situation & studies mathematics & engineering later on adopting Harry although it's a bit rough around the edges.

  Regulus had only dreamed of a second chance when he went to the cave to die. He hadn't expected to get it. He had never even imagined for his soul to end up in Lily Evans' muggle younger brother's body. Can he take his second chance to become a better person or will he not be able to cope? And when Harry comes, can he raise him with love? How different will Harry turn out?

** Imagine a pure-blood supremacist learning about genetics and trying study genetics/biology to prove that pure bloods are superior, but they either find no evidence or evidence to the contrary.

*** That's kind of what happened in the aforementioned fic. I loved that so much, how the author carefully crafted the mental breakdown of old prejudices but also the consequences of when one's self foundations crumble, the anger, the hopelessness, the guilt and the culpability of having believed this. Truly incredible, i recommend this fic a lot!

** I would say some apologetics would rise up, at first saying muggle science is fake/inferior to magic/against a moral society and after that does not work out they would be saying muggles got the ideas from them anyway so they are still superior.
