I read a fic just over a year ago where Sirius was alive (i can't remember if he was brought back to life or just didn't die) , but he kind of adopted Fred and George and supported their business. There was a load of molly and fumble sore bashing, but I can't remember what the fic was called. Has anyone read it?
