So I remember reading this fic many years ago therefore I probably remember some things wrong. Bear with me.

The fic was Harry&Luna and I /think/ Dumbledore was also quite evil. The final battle consisted of Harry using a spell which he dubbed the 4th unforgivable (basically it transformed the whole world into literal hell, a dreamscape Dumbledore forced into Luna's mind whenever she thought of Harry). I don't think there were Horcruxes either.

Unfortunately I can't really remember anything else other than some hazy minor details.

I've been trying to find that story for the past couple of days, it's kinda driving me nuts.
