** I wouldn't say HP fanfiction is dead... it's just migrated to the place all other fandoms eventually find themselves in: Post-Canon-land.

This basically means that worthwhile fics are only going to come out of the most talented and dedicated fans.

** I think it's definitely become more crowded with crappy fics, but you can still find the good ones in there! Don't give up hope!
