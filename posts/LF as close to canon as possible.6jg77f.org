Obviously they won't be completely canon because it isn't JKs work.

However I am looking for anything as canon as possible really, preferably longer fics as I don't really enjoy one shots.

Please don't tag A year of darkness as I've already read it, and enjoyed it. Also recently read something about the sandglass empire which I enjoyed for the canon characters but it got very far fetched towards the end. Recently also read one about Ginny dying in and Harry and the gang hunting down the killer and their new plans for world dominance which I enjoyed, even though the characters acted like they were in their 20s but were based in their 70s.

Yeah, please don't tag any of those, but anything else would be appreciated greatly :)


** These are what come to mind for me, mostly Ginny fics im afraid more because I have yet to find any good ones following other canon characters.

Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince (linkffn(5677867) - as the title suggest Ginnys perspective of sixth year, blends seamlessly with canon (literally perfectly), mostly about Harry and Ginny though if that bother you, although tbh i felt their relationship was missing somewhat in HBP, this kind of fills in the gaps.

Not From Others linkffn(11419408) - Ginnys seventh year, basically what happens in Hogwarts during Deathly Hallows (far better than Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness imo), another good suggestion is A Call to Arms linkfnn(8078750)

Ginny Chronicles Part 1: Little Girl Lost linkffn(12312469) - Ginnys first year (chamber of secrets) part of a WiP series that will cover her school years, relatively new fic, the first one is done but the second one (The Lioness Within linkffn(12470990)) is ongoing with updates every Sunday, currently on Weasley holiday in Egypt at the start of Prisoner of Azkaban.

A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles linkffn(7937889) - Snapes entire life literally, begins as a child and runs through his school years, the first war, Hogwarts years before and during the books and his eventual death.

Just a Random Tuesday... linkffn(3124159) - Pretty funny day in the life of Professor McGonagall, during Umbridge rain of terror.

All I can think of right now, at least as far as strict canon compliance goes.

** I second "A Difference in the Family".

Another fic which realistically incorporates canon events while offering a new perspective is:

"Little Differences" by Theta Serpentis. Summary: They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. From a few hours before his birth to the end of his eleventh birthday, this is the life Tom Marvolo Riddle. Link - [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/5761261/1]]

Well-researched and well-written, it incorporates the early Tom Riddle canon events we've seen in the pensieve as well as those mentioned in passing. Length is just under 250k with 60 chapters. It was recently deleted from fanfiction.net for unknown reasons, but is still available on fictionhunt.com as can be found in the link above.

** There was something like telling canon from bones girl POV during ootp (the student one). It is not good however maybe you may dig it. Not on ff.net tho it was called " bones to bones" or something like that.

There is also a writer called "my dear professor mcgonagall " and it has a really long series about mcgonagall. However it is only 2nd year so far.

  Transcribed from back cover of book: Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record. This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.

Look, stories that rehash canon are, in my opinion, quite annoying. Maybe you should ask for canon divergence (aka for-want-of-a-nail) fics, where one detail is changed and the results are explored. Or you could ask for Non-AU fics. But when you ask for a fic that are, and I quote, "as close to canon as possible," it sounds like you're asking for something that doesn't make a meaningful change and hits *all* the stations of canon.

***** I see what you are saying but I have to disagree, iv read plenty of canon rehashes that you are quite right are just annoying, you know whats going to happen and you know all the major revelations.

However fics that tell a story within cannon can be really good, like what the hell was going on with Ginny during Chamber of Secrets?, How did Neville overcome his insecurities and become the leader of the DA?, What was going through Dracos head during the Half Blood Prince?, all great potential for fics that can "add" to the main series if written well.

Just how I look at it, I never really read massively AU or fics that retell the main story (Harry vs Voldomort) though. Definitely disagree that you that OP /Should/ ask for something else, everyone who reads Fanfiction has different tastes and its so expansive that there is something out there for everyone.

He gets the tone of voice, the intonation and the infliction spot-on -- he even managed to imitate Wormtail's voice to such perfection that he fooled the other Death Eaters.

So Ron actually being able to imitate Parseltongue after he's heard it isn't quite as nonsensical as it might seem. Problem is that... yeah, his talent for imitating people isn't given a whole lot of attention in the books and is usually just dismissed as a joke.

****** To be fair, is it known that a right frequency is required? Because for all we know it might be that you just need to hiss out the right syllable ... things, and being a parselmouth simply helps by magically translating from your language to hisses and back. If that is the case then simply remembering more or less what Harry hissed would be enough if he had some time to try, he'd just have to try blind until he succeeded due to not having a magical translator ability.
