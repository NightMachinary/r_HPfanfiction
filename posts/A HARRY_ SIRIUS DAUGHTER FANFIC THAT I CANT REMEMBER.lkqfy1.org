:END:
Hello everyone

I remember that it was about the daughter of Sirius and a random girl that was the daughter of Voldemort. Harry and the daughter of Sirius fell in love very quickly but they cant have any physic contact because that girl had a curse in which she cant kiss a enemy of his family. Im sorry for my english. And by the way can you give me some fics of harry and a unkown girl like Tracey Davis or Lily Moon. Im sorry for my english again and thanks beforehand

Thanks again
