  Harry felt Malfoy's breath on his lips as they came together over the bottle, hands firmly planted on the floor as though they each needed their familiar soil, refusing to cross into enemy territory.

  Except that Malfoy no longer felt like his enemy.

  Malfoy felt inevitable.

  The eighth years decide to play Truth or Dare at a party for Interhouse Unity, after a very revealing game everyone is shocked as to what Harry Potter admitted. Unfortunately, Harry was black out drunk that night and doesn't remember anything from the party, and his friends are hesitant to tell him anything. It's a good thing Draco Malfoy isn't his friend...

  Seeing Sirius Black through Harry's eyes is bound to result in a blind spot or two. Actually, three: Sirius was gay, had feelings for Remus, and had an oddly convoluted---albeit strong---relationship with James. A kaleidoscope of over 70 moments in Sirius' life should set the record straight (pun intended). *A pseudo-sequel to Turning Time*
