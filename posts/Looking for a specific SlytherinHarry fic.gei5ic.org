:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
If anyone could help me find this I'd be very grateful.

Some details of the fic include most of Hogwart hating Harry in his first year, Harry becoming so obsessed with the Mirror of Erised that he begins to waste away, a McGonagall resentful of him being Slytherin, Slytherins hating him because he's the only person Snape takes points from, and in second year Ginny being sorted into Slytherin, with Ron blaming Harry for coercing her into it.

Thats all the details I recall, if anyone finds it that would be much appreciated.


** I remember this fic as well. It was a series, on ffn.net, called something like "The Grey Lady" or "The Grey Madam" or something along that route. I can't find it either and I'm suspecting that it was taken down or something?

*** I think you mean the Grey Maiden, it has been taken down from ffn.net, but can be found on ao3 and here [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=34]]

*** That's the fic. I think it was deleted. I read it as I thought it was a harmony fic and dropped it when I found out it was hinny. It was series of fics.
