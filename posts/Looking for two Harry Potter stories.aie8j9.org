I've been looking for these two stories for years. This is what I can remember of them.

This one I found on Ao3.

Harry is not the BWL, James and Lily are still alive. Harry has a sibling, I believe.\\
In Harry's Second year, he gets ahold of the diary, I think and in the chamber of secrets, Harry offers his life essence for Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle has a flash of indecipherable emotion when Harry offers that then Harry passes out. Harry becomes lonely again. Lily and James fight causing Harry to become uneasy. Tom Riddle comes back to life and convinces Harry to come with him. That's what I remember and the story is incredible long. Longer than 30 chapters, I believe, maybe up to 60 chapters. I think it mentioned in the summary dangerous love but I could be wrong.

This one I found six to eight years ago on Fanfiction and hasn't left my head since.

Harry visits the past in his sleep of Tom Riddle's first or second year arriving in the chamber of secrets with Tom Riddle really sad. Harry uses an alias and helps Tom make a friend, Abraxes Malfoy, I believe. Harry has reacurring visits to the past in his sleep afterwards, still using his alias but the Dumbledore in the past is suspicious of him and banishes him with a spell causing him unable to return to the past. Tom witnesses Dumbledore doing that and hates Dumbledore for that. I also remember Severus helping Harry so it might be Severitus but isn't labeled Severitus. Has about 20 to 30 chapters. That's all I remember of that one.

I love those two stories a lot and they haven't left my head. I've been looking on the side but there's too many stories out there. I hope someone knows them and is able to point me in the right direction or can even give me a link to see if it is the correct one. :)
