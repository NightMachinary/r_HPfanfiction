I've always though that Transfiguration had the best potential for just about anything in the Harry Potter books, regular household uses (need a kitchen utensil that your wand can't be used for? Transfigure a dishrag!), cooking (Turn that rock into a pot belly stove, and that branch into a pan!), fighting especially, Dumbledore battling Voldemort in the Ministry comes to mind, but I've been wondering recently while writing fight scenes, just what kind of things are impossible to transfigure?

I've seen plenty of things in fanfiction when it comes to transfiguration, turning floors into quick sand, turning rubble into ferocious predators, and clothes transfigured into straight jackets, but there are some things I've not thought of that make me curious.

Would it be possible to transfigure someone's wand? I mean, it would be a hard target to hit in a duel, but would it be possible to turn a wand from a stick of wood into say, a boa constrictor?


** Frankly, this idea of things which cannot be transfigured is fairly ridiculous. It makes no sense that some things are special, except in the case that it needs Transfiguration. Nerfing things is a huge part of the canon, simply because the canon is so ill-defined. There is absolutely nothing in canon which suggests that transfigurations are not permanent for example, contrary to the writing of several fanon authors, most notably LessWrong. Similarly, the canon has nothing indicating that magic is taxing on one's energy, it is simply extrapolated because otherwise everyone would be ridiculously overpowered.

Let's look at the canon things of what cannot be transfigured, and then try to apply actual reason to them.

Food is the most obvious one, and is a weak explain again for hardship in the extended camping arc of book seven. The law states that food cannot be conjured, and we can safely extrapolate that it cannot be transfigured. However, canonically, it can be summoned, duplicated or enlarged, which is one of those little plot holes that Rowling had. Just get some bread and keep duplicating it. Now this massive loophole indicates that there is nothing magical about food which makes it so you literally cannot conjure or transfigure it. Rather, it seems like Gamp's Exceptions in general are all rather subjective, and instead act as guidelines to things you shouldn't transfigure. Taking food, and duplicating or enlarging it preserves the same base chemical structure, so you don't have to understand the structure to make it. However, if you were to conjure it without knowing what you are doing, you would likely have something which feels like bread, looks like bread, smells and tastes like bread, but does not chemically react like bread. Thus, wizards(who it is debatable whether they even know what an atom is) would create it, eat it, and subsequently die. Thus, our rule against food.

Money is a pretty obvious one, or else inflation would be terrifying. But we have a problem. Canonically, money can be duplicated as seen with the Geminio Curses on the Lestrange Vault. So we would have inflation anyway. Or would we. If we establish that magic leaves traces, then everything makes sense, from Dumbledore finding wierd chains in caves, to how Transfiguration can be permanent yet reversible. If I were to transfigure my quill into a pen, then using the canonically version, it would not change back. So then if I try to transfigure it back, would it not be a different quill? For that matter, we have the same problem with human transfiguration. What makes better sense is that magic leaves traces, and a sort of diagram of what was done to do it. But Untransfiguration(this is a thing [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Untransfiguration]] ) basically finds those traces and preforms the transfiguration in Arithmantic reverse. So why the tangent. Because goblins. If you go about transfiguring gold all willy nilly then the goblins will come after you for counterfeiting, and we can assume that captial punishment is standerd for any such thing. And anything you have transfigured has your magical fingerprint on it along with proof that it was fabricated. But wait, what about the Sorcerer's(Philosopher's) Stone. The pretty red Rock which makes people rich. Well, since alchemy is apperantly lucrative, we have to assume that it does not produce any magical signature, which makes it the perfect tool to flood the economy. I could get into that but I won't for brevity.

Life/Death- Can't be done. Either you can't make true life, or you can't make true death. Let's address both. Life makes sense. For you to transfigure true life, you would have to first be able to transfigure an anatomically correct body, down to the molecules. Difficult, but by no means impossible. Then you have to somehow spark it to start living, also difficult. Then you have to shove a soul in it. Since we don't have canon information, I have to improvise. Creating souls is a bit like creating strong AI. You can make something appear to think. You can even make it do useful things, but the real souls are so damn complex that it just feels like a pale imitation. As for death, I will confess to being biased. I love necromancy fics, both reading and writing them. I am the manager for one of, if not the only Necromancy community on FFN. Thus, my own head canon is that necromancy is totally possible, just not with pure transfiguration/conjuration. After all, you can't transfigure a soul back into it's body. So my opinion is just that while possible, it is difficult, inadvisable, and blatantly illegal.

Sadly, other transfiguration laws are mostly conjecture. However, I will point out a very interesting facet. Conjuration turns nothing into something, and Vanishment turns something into nothing. Arithmantically inverted concepts, like a black hole and a white hole. However, there are no rules about Vanishment, only that it gets more difficult with complexity, such as the different between a snail and a rat, one invertebrate, the other a vertabrate. We have seen it used on potions, materials, and living things. However, if they are indeed Arithmantic opposites, then you should be able to conjure anything which can be vanished, whether it be potions, living creatures, or whatever.

I mentioned before that magic does not tax one's energy. What I believe happens, is that spells are learned based on one's understanding and comprehension of the spell. Obviously holding the understanding of a shield in the mind is mentally taxing, and getting hit with a stunner might distract from the shield, allowing it to be broken. But I truly believe that this is a thing, and it ties in with my above points. Magic can do anything you imagine, but you must be able to imagine it, be able to comeprehend it. Thus, one cannot conjure potions, since the complex interplay of wierd chemicals and magic has not been studied enough to do so.

*** There actually are hints in canon that magic is taxing:

#+begin_quote
  There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking.
#+end_quote

PoA, Harry learning the patronus. Harry has done nothing but standing and shouting "Expecto Patronum" a few times.

However, it's not quite clear if this is because the boggart-dementor is taxing ), or the patronus-charm is.

I agree with most of the rest of your post though.

**** True. I prefer to think that it is the boggart causing exhaustion, since Dementors are known for sapping strength and happiness and what not. Having spells being powered by understanding makes more sense to me, given all the canon things. Besides, I would rather have consistency with no power limitations, than inconsistent power limitations which don't make sense.

Case in point, the fanon argument for why Muggles should be able to win wars against wizards is that bullets have so much energy that they shatter shields and wards. But when wizards routinely vanish and conjure pounds of matter, physics consistency would require that they could shield against massive antimatter explosions. Having everything as a matter of comprehension keeps consistency and easily allows plot holes to be glossed over.

I get that I just rehashed part of my argument, so sorry. It is interesting though. You wouldn't know of any other parts in the books where it implies this?

***** Not from the top of my head, and I'm actually mostly agreeing with you. I dislike "magical cores" and stuff, it just doesn't make sense.

I just wanted to point out a counter-example.

And the bullets argument is ridiculous - in PS some eleven-year olds lift the club of a huge mountain-troll. They do it fast. If you make a back-of-the envelope calculation you'll find this is enough energy to stop a high-powered rifle bullet. And you don't need to stop the bullet, just deflect. And if you watch the end of fantastic beasts (I take it as canon) than bullets suddenly seem ridiculusly small and easy.

No, wizards would own a war against muggles if they wanted to fight united. Apparate into the weapon-stash and vanish ammunition. Or simply put a simple muggle-repelling charm.

Bombs? Use legilimency from under an invisibility cloak to find out when they are dropped. Or just imperious the general to make the bombs drop over populated London instead of Diagon Alley. They won't dare doing it again.

Besides, considering Newt's case: Probably the entire magical population of Britan could camp in a single house. Apparate straight in / out, so no unusual traffic.

How would you ever find that?

Nah, with canon magic Wizards would kick Muggel-Ass.

Muggels couldn't even keep a prisoner. If they saw any magical person, it would be kill or let them escape.

****** You have some good points there, but I think that what would happen is escalation. Both sides underestimate each other, so we get some wizards teleporting in, kill some soldiers, teleport out. Soldiers annoyed, so they bomb diagon alley, whose wards likely don't protect against bombs. They kill a bunch of wizards, and the wards are fixed. This is getting out of hand so wizards go to imperious to upper levels of the military. This is one of the choke points, where wizards may just flat out win. But, if they figure it out, Muggles can counter with compartmentalization, absolute secrecy, and heavy paranoia. Muggles can't cast the imperious curse, so a wizard must manually spread the curse. If a muggle general holes up in an unknown bunker and sends his orders via internet connection, there should be no way to find him. Of course, Muggles start trying to counter wizards with roundabout techniques, such as thermal cameras attached to automated turrets in complexes and the like. Plainclothes special agents, stationed at likely attack points. Imprisoning wizards wouldn't work the first few times, but keeping them constantly drugged, reduces their ability to concentrate and thus to do magic. Meanwhile, the wizards are getting better, learning more guerilla warfare tactics adapted to urban fighters, taking tips from the IRA and the Taliban. Wizards are the perfect guerilla fighters with their host of abilities, but they don't have any great tacticians to really make full use of teleporting invisible assassin's. Both sides continually adapt and kill each other off and it becomes a long protracted war where everyone loses.

******* Sure, the Wizards would lose a lot in the beginning, but in the end I don't see them anything but victorious.

- Any public figure of moral can be assassinated or turned.
- Veritasium is totally overpowered against Muggles. Imagine one or two mid-to-high ranking generals being asked "What could we do that would hurt your cause the most", or "Which point of your infrastructure could we take out that would the most", or "What do you think is the best action to take for us to win" - If you are creative with the questions, even an uniformed wizard will know how to hurt really fast. Ignorance of Muggle capabilities doesn't matter when the Muggles know it.
- "but they don't have any great tacticians to really make full use of teleporting invisible assassin's" - I think the longer the war went on, the more they could learn this. Also, again: Veritasium. If you capture a great strategist, can you force him to make strategies for you using Veritasium and great questions?
- Diagon Alley is probably warded against bombs. They /were/ popular in WW2, and London was a target during the Blitz. If the wizards didn't come up with a way to protect themselves after a few years, I don't know anymore.
- Also, Diagon Alley is in the center of a highly populated area. You don't bomb that shit before evacuating it. And that would tip even the most obvious Wizards off.
- Also, the MoM is literally underground, below London. And so is Gringotts. How do you attack that without risking the city horribly collapsing?
- Wizards already know guerilla warfare tactics - that's what the Death Eaters used.

Hagrid says in the beginning of PS that it's the MoM's main job to keep Magic a secret, but from the looks their setup could also be pretty effective against a muggle-attack of an enemy country or even their own muggle government.

Edit: By the way, it's fun discussing with you :)

** If you can Transfigure a wizard - robes and all - during a duel, then it seems plausible that the wand would have been Transfigured as well.

I'm not sure if the wand specifically being a target would change this, though it's my headfanon that magical artifacts of exceptional craftsmanship are generally imbued with protective enchantments to prevent that sort of thing.

With all being said and done, though, isn't that the point of the Exceptions to Gamp's Laws? Only one was ever confirmed in canon, so taking all that seems implausible, I'm inclined to say:

- 1) Conjuring nutritive matter

- 2) Transfiguring death (life can be Conjured, but death is irreversible. Possibly extended to hereditary imperfections such as poor eyesight, stature, etc. which, like immortality, fall under the purview of Alchemy's goals)

- 3) Conjuring *authentic* precious metals/gems (their worth seemingly isn't compromised in the Wizarding World, possibly due to inherent magical properties. Again, an Alchemical pursuit)

- 4) Anything exceeding a certain surface area (which appears to be an adult-sized dragon... more or less)

- 5) (i) Magic itself (you probably can't Conjure a magical artifact in one go; apothecaries and wandmakers still require magical ingredients from creatures/plants; goblins, house-elves, centaurs etc. still make unique contributions to magical society)

  (ii) Probably the effects of Dark Magic (injuries, scar tissue, amputations, damage caused by exposure to basilisk venom, Fiendfyre, unicorn blood, etc.)

Aside from what's impossible, I just assume that a lot of the rest is just insanely complicated. Transfiguring clothing/furniture/architecture, etc. is probably highly specialised, and I think that might be linked to human ingenuity (maybe that's one of the Exceptions instead?).

EDIT: Made some additions for a more inclusive list. Human Transfiguration (as opposed to Self-Transfiguration) might be likewise tricky, though accomplished wizards such as Barty Crouch Jr. and Percy Weasley (both top N.E.W.T students) display a knack for it. For many of the upper-tier wizards, it just seems like more of a stylistic choice. I honestly can't see Bellatrix doing it. For all we know, she might have fizzled an attempt from Sirius during their duel.

*** Your head canon is what I was thinking, powerful magical artefacts such as the Mirror of Erised, or the Philosipher's stone seem like it would be impossible to transfigure, along with more magically resistant things, like dragons, basilisks, trolls, etc., while items like wands, I can't decide if it should be possible to transfigure them into something else specifically, or if Ollivander, Gregorovitch, and other great wand makers somehow make it impossible for such a thing to happen.

*** I detect a flaw in 2 and 5 in your version of Gamp's exception, which is that they don't relate to transfiguration in the first place. Death and magic are not physical things and transfiguration is about the manipulation of physical things. You don't need an exception to say that transfiguration cannot create magic, it flows from the definition of the discipline. It seems likely to me that all 5 exceptions are clear physical classes of objects, like "food" was.

Furthermore, I don't think your #4 is a good contender as it is not defined by its quality but rather quantity. It's not so much a limitation of the magic as it is of the wizard. When Hermione says "I doubt even McGonagall..." with respect to transfiguring a dragon, she's implying that McGonagall has a better chance of it than someone else i.e. that the size capable of being transfigured varies with the wizard. That's not really a hard limit/exception kind of rule.

Also we've seen Voldemort conjure silver so it can't exclude all precious metals.

The five I would go for are:

1. Food

2. Gold

3. Gems

4. Money

5. Sentient creatures

**** Fair points. I've personally written death and magic off before because of the dubious physicality of both, but I think a case can still be argued for each one.

Death as a physical process still holds weight in HP magic since the extraction of the soul isn't enough to kill something outright.

In regards to magic, I should have specified that I had magical creatures and the like in mind. I suppose that could fit in the category of not Conjuring sentient creatures, but would that stop a skilled wizard from magicking physically identical phoenix-tail feathers? I generally view magic and matter as entirely separate, but at what point do you separate the magic from certain ngredients? Would transformed plants work just as well in a potion, for example?

Either they didn't think of it or there's some kind of requirement like not being weaker than the target. Probably the former one, but I can see people assuming the latter.

#+begin_quote
  And what about transfiguring radioactive items?
#+end_quote

I presume it's doable, but only if you know what you are doing and would most likely harm you to a degree too. Not to mention that to do this with any sort of efficiency in combat you'd probably have to practice a bit with it, which is not the most user-friendly way to get stronger, so to say.

Well, unless wizards are somehow more resistant or even immune to radiation, which would make it less hazardous to do this but also less of a useful thing.

That said, transfiguring the moisture in the air into some acid or a chemical substance with a debilitating effect seems like a decent alternative, especially since that stuff is less likely to backfire and making your enemies breathe acid seems poison-esque enough (they won't have time for healing such stuff during a battle, and afterwards it might be too late). Transfuguring a layer of earth beneath them into something like sodium and then drenching it water might work too, even if it happens to be more disorienting than damaging.

The question is, can you actually transfigure into something if you've never even seen it? Because that seems like something that could very well be a thing, and that could limit one's options a fair bit.

***** Maybe. I wouldn't know, but it does sound like a fairly reasonable guess, and at the same time it is something at least some wizards wouldn't really think about, especially if you transfigured air into some gas that can't be seen either which might or might not actually be a noticeable action (other than the general “this person is doing /something/” thing).

Honestly, I think it might or might not be related to the fact that using transfiguration on the fly, in combat, requires a lot of creativity and focus both in comparison to just choosing a random debilitating charm or curse or hex or jinx and doing those; as such, while using it for defence might not be too hard (just make /something/ move and make it intercept the attack), using it for offence just might be above your average witch or wizard. This might be why it's easy to defend against it, too, as attacks via transfiguration that aren't creative quite likely are guaranteed to be easy to neutralise.
