Harry and Ginny get together with I think a soul bond. Then Ron and Hermione fight and break up. Hermione realizes she loves and Harry and Ginny says she is willing to share and she also forms a soul bond with Harry. The fic is M and I think over 50k words.


** Sounds like linkffn(Searching For the Power) but it doesn't have soul bonds.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many
