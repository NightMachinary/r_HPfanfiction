I know all about HP and the natural 20. However, it is not my cup of tea. Just had an idea on what would happen if canon/indi/MoD/or whatever Harry met Strahd, or went through Parnast, or even met a Beholder!

This post has been brought to you by Xanthar's Guide to Everything. If you're collectable you may be kept in his collection.

I wrote this a little while ago. It features Keldorn Firecam, a character from the Baldur's Gate series of games which take place in the Forgotten Realms, being magically transported into Harry's world during the battle at the DoM. He goes on to act as a mentor figure to Harry.

Voldemort also gains some D&D style flair, but talking about that would lead to spoilers!

Speaking of Xanthar's Guide to Everything, is that out now? And is it any good?

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
