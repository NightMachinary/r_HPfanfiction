I am feared by the Light and hated by the Dark. I do not have anyone I can call upon to watch my back, yet I will fight on. I will not back down. I will not falter. If I am to die, let it be upon ground sodden by the blood of my foes. Let my sacrifice stem the tides against us and give my allies the opportunity to be victorious, even if none shall morn my passing.


** Damn that's edgy.

But I see what you could do with this.

Like, maybe Necromancy. Too dark for the Dark, and too Dark and rather scary for the Light.

*** Yeah, I know it's edgy, I was also going for depressing/heartwreching. But I was trying to leave the theme open as much as possible. So while it might be something like Necromancy or other dark magic, it could also be many other options, like differing morals or ethics.

**** No, sorry. I read it when I was starting out so it's been a couple of years. I'll try searching for it and see

It's been a while so I don't exactly remember all the details. I do remember it was Harry running away because of the Wrong Boy who Lived themes, becoming sort of a mercenary, and Fleur's dad hires him as Fleur's bodyguard while she's at Hogwarts so he takes on a new alias and goes and no one suspects him to be HP. He's also overpowered and has this sort of a dark eldritch shadow type thing behind him. I'm not sure of the quality of the fic but the me from 3 or 4 years ago found it absolutely amazing. And I believe some parts were written in first person POV so yeah
