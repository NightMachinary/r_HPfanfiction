Hi! I'm looking for a fic set in Prisoner of Azkaban but from an alternative POV. Preferably Ron's, but any POV will do. Thanks!


** I would love to read a Ron centric one-shot when he finds out that his beloved Scabbers is a Death-Eater.

** /The King's Chronicles/ by WeasleyIsMyKing540 shows Ron's POV of the series but has been discontinued up until the beginning of Deathly Hallows.

Chapters 42 to 73 show Prisoner of Akzaban.
