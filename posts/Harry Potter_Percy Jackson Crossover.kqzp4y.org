Specifically, ones where Harry is a Child of Zeus. I mean, c'mon! The lightning symbolism fits perfectly!


** Hades seems like it could also work? Since the Hallows are a thing.

*** Since (not including the Cloak), the Hallows are something Harry finds along his journey instead of some type of birthright given to him, it'd be more likely that Hades gives him some type of artifact or Harry finds one. Like, Harry doesn't act how Zeus wants and Hades likes that so he gives Harry a gift to cause more chaos and headache for Zeus, or Harry finds something that's Hades' out on a quest.

*** Harry, having Peverell blood, would likely be a legacy of Hades, like Octavian was of Apollo. Could still be a child of Zeus, though. :)

#+begin_quote
  In a desperate cry for help during the Graveyard scene, Harry receives help from his father. Only it isn't James Potter who answers! What if Harry not only had a Norse deity for a father, but was also a descendant of a Greek god as well? AU

***** That's totally fine. I'm just curious (and truly not trying to be rude, though I'm worried it might come off that way) - why comment about it at all, but especially vaguely? Typically when something doesn't interest me, I just click off and keep moving. But two people taking the time to say they wouldn't read the fic because of the pairings without mentioning which one(s) bother them surprises me.

****** I guess if I read a comment of someone talking about their own fic on Reddit and I end up reading it, I'll comment or pm and let them know what I thought. And I love that there's so many fics to choose from, even though I don't read them all and they aren't all to my taste and I would hate for that to change. I was being genuine when I said all the best, if it didn't come across that way, and wanted to express encouragement even if it's not my cup of tea.

*** This looks really good. The pairings are middling for me but the selling point is the writing, not too much and not too little and you managed to hop quickly through the set up while still being believable. Good luck on balancing all the characters, just the 10 from HP look to be a handful.

Whether there is a big plot or it's just camp life I think this'll be interesting.
