Looking for a fanfic where harry is as powerful as dumbledore. Harry and dumbledore work together. No dark harry or manipulative dumbledore. Harry/Ginny. Post ootp


** It's very AU and 'original setting-ed up' HP and the writing could use a bit of tightening up and polishing, but The Arcanist is a pretty interestingly unique example of Harry being as powerful as Dumbledore and the two working together. No pairing, as I recall, but he's a standard WBWL type who's friends with Daphne, so I'd expect the pairing to be with her rather than Ginny or anyone like that.
