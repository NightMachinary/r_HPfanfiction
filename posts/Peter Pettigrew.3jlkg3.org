do you have any fics. that deal with him in an interesting way?

and

what do you think, in general, about him and his relationship with the marauders? he suffers wildly from fandom's vacillation and incapability/unwillingness to write nuance, i think. people usually start from 'he wasn't a real marauder, the others found him annoying' to 'but they trusted him with their lives/would have died for him, so that obviously means x' instead of trying to parse out the the specifics of his character and the dynamic within the marauders. i definitely think they would have died for him, but i also think that says more about their sense of honour than any traits wormtail possesses, necessarily; they likely would have risked death for anyone not evil. fic. where he isn't non existent or a caricature have him lose all of his character traits in an attempt to be contrary; he's no longer hero-worshippy, sniggering/slack jawed, bumbling and skittish, his lack of talent isn't that emphasized even though he's 'rather slow', james and sirius are never mean to him, even though they were, and definitely didn't respect him. he becomes a good natured, insecure fat kid whose role in the marauders is being a people person/amiable. even though more than one outside source perceived him as a tag along and publicly ridiculed him (minerva). what do you think?


** Not any actual stories, no, I don't know any. But [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/112332424299/have-you-ever-thought-about-writing-a-fic-in-which][this]] may interest you.

** linkffn(End of the Line) is a very moving series of short stories, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673824/4/End-Of-the-Line][this chapter]] is about Peter Pettigrew. You don't need to read any of the other chapters, especially if you're aware of Terry Pratchett's Death (the character from the Diskworld series), to understand this one, but I'd recommend doing so anyway, as it is /very/ well-written.

** The very last chapters currently up in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind]]) deal with him beautifully. It's a bit maddening, because it stops before it really gets that far into his character though.

** Honestly? I hate the "canon" version of the Marauders. In the sense where James and Sirius were bullies, Remus was the good student/quiet one who just sighed whenever James and/or Sirius did something and Peter just tagged along. Because they were these things as well as extremely loyal to one another. But also, apparently not so loyal to one another. In my mind, it doesn't make sense in a realistic way. Of course, it doesn't have to because their backstory isn't really backstory but just pieces to help the plot move along. Keep in mind that all three of James, Sirius, and Peter became anamagi at an extremely young age just so they can make Remus' transformations more bearable. That takes an incredible amount of commitment to one another, but then they graduate and they just seem to stop trusting one another? They start suspecting Remus of being a traitor and peter actually does betray them? In my mind, their story should have been vastly different. But of course, the actual story wouldn't quite work the same way if their story had been different. Hence why I decided to write my own fanfiction. But if you are looking for one to read that portrays their relationship well, I'd recommend Brothers by Choice by Ravyn. Ravyn is one of the few fanfic authors out there that I have found to have similar few to the four boys as I do.

** In "The Dark Prince" triology he kidnaps Harry instead of what he did canon to save James and Lily's lives, but he is not a main character.
