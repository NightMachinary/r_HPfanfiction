If you look, there's not been a new post on that thread in over a week. Clearly, having one fanfiction up there every month isn't the best idea. Maybe there should be a new one every two weeks, at the very least.

Another good idea would be to put up a thread in competition mode to let subscribers choose the next book club fic. Post two or three ideas on a thread, and let the users upvote their favorite!


** Well, I like to give people plenty of time to read the fic, especially if it's something that's 100k+ words. I can easily finish that in a couple days but I don't like to make that assumption for everyone.

*** I understand that, but again, considering the lack of participation on the book club thread after a week or two, I believe two weeks would be a far more reasonable timeframe. Thanks for responding btw.

** It is more of a reddit issue. Old threads don't get attention. People get accused of necroing old topics. Most people don't know how to monitor posts.

So it is something people only talk about for a week, once a month. That's still fine.

*** Well, in this case the thread is pinned at the top -- so you wouldn't be raising it from the dead if you added a top level post.

The purpose of the book club is to create discussion about fanfics -- if everyone ignores it after the first two weeks, than after that period of time, why not replace it? If you don't, it's rather pointless.

That doesn't logically follow at all, unless the purpose is to maximize books reviewed over time at the cost of allowing for busier readers to join the discussion. In fact, it would guarantee that people with less time would have less involvement.

Perhaps a better solution is to start each book club post with a review of the last one's topic, asking for comments on both fics (previous and current choice) every month. This would give people two chances to join in the conversation, once when everyone else starts and then a month later when the next one is first proposed.

Does that make sense?

***** I'm not suggesting that we do a new fic every day, or even every week. I'm suggesting one every two weeks, which is more than enough time for the vast majority of people to read all but the longest fics.

Your solution doesn't make much sense to me (Sorry, it's 5 am here, I'll read it again after I sleep), but from what I do understand (the two topics in one thread part), it sounds like it would end up confusing to have two different discussions going on at once.
