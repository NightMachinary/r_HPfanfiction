Harry/Other Protag is 100% certain that Dumbledore is a manipulative person influencing everything and plans accordingly. Spoiler alert; he isn't, and is just very confused by what's going on and trying to understand why Harry/protag doesn't like him.


** Year 1

Harry: Why would you give me this cloak? And in secrecy too? So you seem humble and mysterious? Could it be to ingratiate myself to you? To give me a way to bend the rules in an ultimate plan for me to face off with Voldemort?

Dumbles: I didn't sign the card? Oh drats, I thought my magical quill would do it for me. Well, that's what I get for buying it from the discount bin.

Year 2

Harry: How about Lockhart huh? A ploy to teach me a lesson in fame so I don't try using it to my advantage? All so you can keep me carefully sheltered under your thumb?

Dumbles: Oh dear... You see, I had misplaced my reading glasses that day. So when I had read Lockhart's resume I'd been certain he had experience in the dark arts. Turns out I misread it... The paperwork says /lark/ arts... I'm afraid I mistook a bird enthusiast for a magical defense teacher. Please pardon me... It really is quite a daft mistake.

Year 3

Harry: Now this must be manipulative! You refuse to allow me to leave Hogwarts at all! I mean, Hogsmeade is perfectly safe in bright day light, I'd be surrounded by fully capable wizards, and I could even go in my cloak! This is a boderline hostage situation!

Dumbles: Young Harry, you'll understand when you're older. Paperwork is an evil thing that tends to suck more joy out of life than dementors do. I just don't want to risk Hogwarts getting sued... Again.

Year 4

Harry: THERE IS NO WAY YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR THIS ONE, HEADMASTER! DRAGONS? KIDNAPPING MERPEOPLE? A BLOODY MAZE OF DEATH? THE DARKEST WIZARD OF OUR TIME RISING FROM THE DEAD WITH ME AS A SACRIFICIAL INGREDIENT!?

Dumbles: I'm beginning to think my age line should have stopped anyone /older/ than 17 from entering too. And here I was thinking I'd been so smart stopping the Weasley twins. Now I've gone and allowed another war to start. Bugger.

Year 5

Harry: Headmaster... Why have you left me isolated and without any contact for months on end at the Dursley's...?

Dumbles: What now? I told your friends over floo call to "stay in touch"... Now that I think about it though, my fireplace had been acting strangely that day. Oh dear, maybe they thought I said "don't say much". I knew I shouldn't have bought floo powder from the discount bin. But it was 75% off! I've never been able to resist a good deal.

Year 6

Harry: Oh, so /now/ you tell me about Voldemort and horcruxes! How convenient and nice of you considering we're ALREADY ON THE BRINK OF WAR!

Dumbledore:

Harry: Oh, right. Forgot for a second. At least you'll be dead now, so there's no possible way you could manipulate me now.

Year 7

Harry: Oh bloody hell! It's you again!

Dumbles: I've always pride of myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion... An almost inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of inflicting injury and remedies. I'll be going now, Harry.

Harry: ... Goodbye Proffessor.

** The amount of stuff you have to pull out of nowhere to explain the canon manipulations could be hilariously daunting.

Like Dumbledore would have pulled him out of the Dursleys or stopped their abuse /if/ he knew how bad it was. Turns out the owl-redirection wards were shunting Figg's letters off too. And any he sent to Figg.

Money/items missing from the Potter vaults? Turns out Fletcher/Snape/??? stole the key and made some withdrawals from the front tellers. Paranoid Harry jumped to conclusions and skipped reading the rest of the statement (that identified the holder of the key). OR~ Dumbledore withdrew excess money every year (before the deposit from the family vault) from his trust vault and started an investment portfolio. With his guidance (read: insider trading), he managed to turn half the money of Harry's trust vault into a fortune that equals a quarter of the Potter fortune.

The Potter Lordship/Heirship/??? ? Hagrid's fault. He forgot. In fact, the package containing the ring and books are to this day still in his jacket.

TL;DR: Dumbledore made a mistake and everything fails in a spectacular fashion that nobody but Harry notices. And he jumps to conclusions.

*** I like this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but iirc money being taken from the vaults and the Potter lordship are fanon things and never happened in canon.

**** You are correct. Though given the amount of times they are a part of manipulative Dumbledore stories is it a good idea to add it to the list of explenations.

**** I think the only one who calls himself Lord in canon is Voldemort, and that's more a Dark Lord stuff than any claim of peerage/nobility. So it's more in tune with Lord Vader than with Lord Croft.

*** Bonus: The reason the goblins freak out over Harry remembering one of their names is that /Dumbledore/ can't tell them apart... because he can remember their fathers and grandfathers, and they look just like them at that age.

The goblins assume that all wizards are like this, because they're racist and can't tell wizards apart.

Another bonus: Harry actually /was/ meant to go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, but the balance was tipped in favor of Gryffindor because the Hat could tell that Molly already considered Harry family, and all Weasleys have to go to Gryffindor.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
