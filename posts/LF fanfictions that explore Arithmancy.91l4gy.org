Other than the Arithmancer and its sequel. No crossovers.


** The depiction of Arithmancy in linkffn(Pet Project by caeria) is quite enjoyable, especially the way in which Professor Vector visualises the different strands of possibilities. It is only used in terms of divination and calculation of possibilities, not for spell creation or anything along those lines.

It's a Snape/Hermione story but starts out with Hermione just wanting to help out. Definite slow burn, only mature scenes are at the very end so even if you're only interested in the Arithmancy side, you might find it interesting to read or skim for that.

Side note: I think this is the story where Arithmancy is constantly misspelled as Arthimancy... Don't understand how that never got corrected but apart from this, the spelling, grammar and writing is perfectly fine.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

** Normally whenever a fanfic 'explores' Arithmancy or Runes it ends up being the most overpowered branch of magic. Naturally the protagonist manages to obtain a mastery within less than a year and proceed to innovate incredibly useful things with this knowledge.

The only fic that fits your criteria that doesn't do the aforementioned has its own flaws but is a decent read and has a unique view of Arithmancy. linkffn(4347702) is not the best written fic in the world but it is certainly something I've never seen done before. If I remember correctly Albus Potter is a Dark Lord and Harry is a master Arithmancer that goes back in time to prevent him from walking that path. Arithmancy is a branch of magic that is the number of different possibilities.

*** I've been trying to craft them for my own AU in such a way that they aren't OP, because I totally get where you're coming from :p sometimes it's fun to read but I think that they simply can't be both powerful and versatile, or wanded magic would never have taken off.

Runes: I think of them as being ancient, possibly powerful, rather long lasting, but vague. Trying to craft usable magic from runes is kinda like writing a poem but wanting only a single interpretation to shine over the rest.

Arithmancy: I'm not really sure what to do with this, yet. I'm very curious to see what direction [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] is taking things in linkffn(Victoria Potter), but I'm not especially a fan of The Arithmancer-type OP arithmancy (although it's fun in small doses). I think it has a few different branches that are all lumped together because they involve numbers, but otherwise have little in common. One branch (the oldest) is related to divination, which is where the -mancy suffix comes from. Another is related to geometry and the magic associated with shapes. Another would be related to numerical symbolism, and why particular numbers (like primes) crop up in different areas of magic. There might be some links between more obscure mathematics and magic, but they are relatively unexplored because of the disinterest in muggle mathematics. I haven't thought things through enough to work out other areas as yet.

**** When we get to third year, Victoria will indeed be taking arithmancy. I think I have a moderately novel take on the subject which positions it as interesting and useful but still niche subject (it's my view that any subject offered as an elective should not be so useful that it ought to be a core subject, a principle that a lot of "arithmancy fics" and "runes fics" break).

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.
