I am interested in reading some good HP fan fics where Magic is more natural and instinctual. Guided by intentions, dreams, thoughts, movement, desire, and the like. No wand usage or staff usage or "created" guiding principles (like most of what they would teach at Hogwarts). I realize its a bit of a loose description but the idea is a fan fiction where magic is outside the bounds of the magical "controlling" aspects we see in the HP series, or taught at Hogwarts.


** linkffn(12026631)

The very best is a crossover only because the Pokemon show exists in it. It's mostly about a more whimsical take on the premise behind linkffn(the art of becoming) in that Harry uses transfiguration to create combat allies.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

  Before Izaya was an omniscient informant, he was an omniscient informant in training. Naturally, he sharpens his technique by stabbing the rest of the population with it. Over and over. Collection of oneshots, wide timeline. Shizaya if you squint. Part 9: Shizu-chan was supposed to kill him. That was the plan. To be perfectly honest, that was always the plan.

*** I have had "The Very Best" on my list to read for some time but kept putting it off because I was scared of the idea of it being overwhelmingly full of Pokemon stuff. But you are saying its mainly just about the fact that the Pokemon show is a thing in it and Harry knows about it? Plus it was short....

**** To be fair, that's the only hard au aspect. You still have most of the narrative focused on Harry's desire for Pokemon. It doesn't use anything outside of the most well known original 151, but if fighting Voldemort with a Pikachu seems stupid to you you might not like it.

****** Do not go in expecting serious plot or really any challenge to Harry. I just finished rereading it and a few times he acts really bratty, basically just telling everybody that they're wrong and stupid and hers right and smart and good. Flat out sasses Dumbledore and yells at him like a 3 year old and he just takes it and does what Harry said to do.

** Hmm, I think linkffn(Pureblood pretense) plays a bit with that. Harry has to almost ask her magic to do stuff, and it's directly tied to her emotions making it hard to manage. But most of it happens much later, in the 3rd part of the fic.
