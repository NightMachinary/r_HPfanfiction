Whether He's pushed through the Veil, sent by Rocket into the Sun so the Horcruxes are out of range, or Shiki Ryougi suddenly appears and slashes Voldemort's lines of Death, Give him a way of being dead that he can't revive from. Voldemort ACTUALLY dead, the original, main soul dead, but one of the Horcruxes (Not Harry's. either have it not there or die for some reason) becomes Neo Voldemort/Voldemort 2.0.

The Diary could win and kill Ginny either sooner, or Harry doesn't discover it. The Locket could have taken over Kreacher or Regulus. the Cup could take over someone that drinks from it (Bellatrix possibly as a failsafe) Diadem if Malfoy doesn't know Voldemort is dead and stumbles across it in 6th year and he thinks the plan is still on (He was in the same room, him finding it was possible) something like that. Voldemort dies, Neo Voldemort is a bigger threat (For some Fanfiction based reason. Maybe if it's the Diadem, he's just Voldemort but with Rowena Ravenclaw's intelligence, and actively uses strategy instead of being a useless jobber)

Bonus points if Harry wins due to a real reason and not a Deus Ex Machina like "Oh the wand was owned by Harry, even though Malfoy wasn't holding it when Harry disarmed him, because that makes sense" you could have him pull out the Dragon Slave and it'd still be less ridiculous than the canon ending.

Pairing.... Gen, Canon Pairings, Slash, whatever, as long as it's not Creepy Slash (School student x 30+ year old. Voldemort was 71 in book 7, that's just creepy) or Death Eater redemption slash (Malfoy etc)

No Death Eaters are actually all good guys and Dumbledore is the Dark lord Dumblemort. Keep Bashing reasonable if you add it.

Voldemort's homunculus is captured by Harry before he can complete the resurrection ritual and the Ministry has him executed by Dementor's Kiss. So Crouch Jr uses the Ring horcrux to resurrect a younger Voldemort.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] the scarcrux defeats Voldemort permanently and intends to take over wizarding Britain in a different way, capitalizing on the "savior" reputation.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all? (OotP AU. Go inside the mind of Severus Snape as he tackles several beguiling mysteries, and risks everything he holds dear.) COMPLETE.

** Horcruxes can't become a new Voldemort. They're anchors for his soul to keep it from passing on, not backups.

*** What about the Diary. It was actively going to bring Teen Voldemort back, whilst Souldemort was still roaming around Albania. Unless we'd get a "By your Powers combined. I AM STRONGER VOLDEMORT" Thing, there'd have been an independant manifestation of Teen Voldemort, without Voldemort's 40 or so extra years of experience, but basically an Evil Fanfiction Hermione in terms of knowledge

**** JK Rowling herself said the Diary consuming Ginny "would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably."

NOT that Voldemort would have returned.

***** But how the hell would that have even worked. Would it have been like a Global ACCIO VOLDEMORT'S SOUL and pulled the big Voldemort into the Ginny's body/Diary Piece or what. Logistically, having another Tom Riddle makes sense... Voldemort would be significantly strengthened by having a mini-voldemort lacky running around. That's the angle i was going for. Basically either Young Voldemort who is basically like a Male Emily Riddle (Best Voldemort EVER) and was more threatening because of Ultracharm Politics and becomes more threatening by making Harry and co the Badguys by Law/Public eye so it becomes Guerilla. Also, Fanfiction... People have Voldemort x Harry fics, I'd say this is less of a ridiculous stretch.
