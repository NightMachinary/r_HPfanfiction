I've been reading Relentless, We Survive by Araceil and have loved the way they portray Harry's growth as a leader and mentor for the DA. Especially how they go beyond just learning new spells, but learn self-defense, including physical exercises, and it really ends up as Harry's army. Are there any fics that are similar?

I'm not necessarily looking for Assassin's Creed crossovers like Relentless, but ones where Harry takes the DA beyond just a study group.

Any ships are fine (het or slash) but I prefer if romance is not the main focus.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

** I've never written a fanfic and I don't plan to start now, but for a while I've thought a great premise would be that "the power the dark lord knows not," is The Power of Teamwork, but /reconstructed/. The core idea is that 90% of magical warfare is intelligence, 9% is preparation, and only 1% is mechanical skill. All but the last can be done in parallel, with lots of compartmentalization. In order to defeat 50 years of experience with 5, Harry needs to get a great many irons in the fire at once, some of which may not pan out.

You could have spies, of course. People researching scrying. People experimenting with small team tactics and combat spells. People experimenting with broomstick flight in enclosed spaces. People researching the Fidelius charm and reflexive/circular application of it, and whether it can be worked around. People researching invisibility, means of detecting invisible wizards, means of masking non-visual signature, means of detecting signatures the other guy didn't think to mask. People researching muggle weapons. People researching transfigured/imperiused animals.

And at some point, you have to train at least a small squad in what has been found to work, hopefully /before/ making contact with the enemy.

Call it /make -j/.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL

Alpha series. Despite the name has nothing to do with werewolves. Is about Harry becoming the leader of the school and the DA equivalent becomes a fully trained fighting force.

A goddess finds herself agreeing to send some dragons to another world thanks to a bargain she agrees to. Harry wakes up in his 5th year from a really weird dream with a purpose in not long after. Worldbuilding, magical creatures, two magical traditions merging together and a version of Albus Dumbledore that's been using a cursed wand for a long time. I made the Elder Wand worse, think the One Ring or Frostmourne for scale.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.
