Fabulous Dance Team


** Hogwarts famously doubles as an arts college.

Flitwick's Frog Choir.

Trelawney's watercolor class, where students get high on tea fumes before being let anywhere near a canvas.

Hooch's coordinated broom riders, the Flying Foxes (all-female swimsuit flier squad).

The Fabulous Dance Team, led by their coach Warton Hoggins.

Hagrid's woodworking class. The most promising students move on to sculpting in rock cake. Rock cake sculptures are highly valued for the unique chocolate-chip grain of the material.

And of course, Sprout's Buquet Arrangements course, where Venomous Tentacula is always, /always/, the centerpiece.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** /Footloose/, starring Kevin Bacon as Dumbledore.

He's an old man in a giant castle. They said he couldn't dance. He knew he could

** Questionable policies of student safety.

Yeah, lets send four eleven/twelve year olds into the woods to find whatever is draining the blood from symbols of purity in a place called "the Forbidden Forest."

*** As an aside, this is probably /more/ convincing to a bunch of pre-Hogwarts students that this is the greatest school ever (it definitely would have worked on me).
