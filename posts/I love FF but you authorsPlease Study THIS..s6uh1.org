** Every time I see someone switch /lose/ with /loose/, I imagine they're trying to /let loose/ something upon the world.

** I also wish redditors would read this. Loose is the biggest pet peeve of mine because I read it in my head as it sounds. It always trips me up. Lose rhymes with shoes, but loose rhymes with goose. So it's always more of a snag than the their/there/they're conundrum.

*** Speaking of which, I remembered this post from DLP a while back (one poster making fun of another's spelling mistake):

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    /Dumbledore is very weary of him because of his name./
  #+end_quote

  /Dumbledore sighed and sank back in his chair, discarding the year's enrollment list. From the corner his Phoenix, Fawkes, trilled softly. "Another fucking Black, Fawkes. It's always the Blacks."/
#+end_quote

** I always mix up Affect and Effect. It doesn't matter what the situation is, I can never remember which is which. Typically, I just try to refrain from using it.

** I appreciate this, but it bothers me when people say "affect" is a verb and "effect" is a noun. I know this one says "most of the time," and people who mix them up probably aren't throwing around the noun form of "affect" or the verb form of "effect," but still, they're useful words, and it makes them sad when people don't acknowledge them!

** ... If you see any writers consistently making these elementary mistakes, you're probably reading shit and they don't deserve to be called authors. Silly spelling mistakes always come with shitty stories.
