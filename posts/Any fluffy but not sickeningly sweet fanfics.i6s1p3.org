2020 obviously isn't the happiest year, and I really need something sweet and mostly lighthearted to distract me. Are there any fics that have a reasonable amount of plot but have a happy ending and, you know, aren't dark? I'm thinking things along the line of Paranoia and Puns. Thanks :)

** Northumbrian does a lot of post-Hogwarts slice-of-life fics that might suit you. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is about Harry and Ginny and their young children moving into a new neighbourhood in the countryside, written mostly from the point of view of one of their Muggle neighbours. There's a background plot about Harry's work as an Auror, but most of it is just fleshing out how a wizarding family would live, with the interesting twist of seeing how it looks from the outside.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Keeps Ron and Ginny as the great people they are too.

Harmony fic where Harry and Hermione grow closer while working on an extremely dangerous case for Department of Magical Enforcement. Epilogue-compliant. Trust me, this is one the GREATEST Harmony fics written. You'll regret it if you don't read.
