  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Linkffn(stay standing by windschild8178)

A lot of focus on Ron as a character and his relationship with family. An amazingly written post-war fic.

*** I tried to read Stay Standing before and I thought it was a bit rough. Harry and Hermione act weirdly possessive of Ron. I think if he wanted to go off on his own for a year for a training program they'd both miss him but be very supportive that Ron was taking the initative. It rather ignores some of Ron's flaws too. Magic cancer gets kind of melodramatic too.

Reading it I kind of wish it was just about him going off on his own for an auror thing minus the illness. I feel like some time on his own proving to himself he can stand on his own without Ron and Hermione or his family would do him a world of good.

It's at least pro-Ron though. I also actually remember it and got pretty far into it so its engaging in its own way.

**** Well, i actually thought that "possessiveness" was attributed to a certain amount of PTSD that they all have. And harry did support Ron, doesn't mean he wasn't sad about him leaving. But I can see your point about the fic being melodramatic, it kind of takes all the best and worst things that cancer literature has to offer. I found it hard to finish it because it gets a bit too much.

  A magical infection has Ron critically ill, but after the devastation of the war he decides his family and friends don't need to know. How long can he hide it though? And how will the consequences of his actions change the course of the future?

  COMPLETE. Ron Weasley makes up his schoolwork, and actually thinks for a change. Snape gets some Christmas presents he doesn't expect. The old game is over, but a new one is just beginning. Please read and review. And thanks to you all!
