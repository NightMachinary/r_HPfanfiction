I've read "Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin" and "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches", and I loved both of them, and I recommend them to everybody. So now I'm looking for other similar ffs. Preferably (but not necessarily), stories were the politics of Wizarding Britain play some part to the plot.


** DPSW resumes updates July 16th :) Those 2 you have read are excellent in my in my opinion. "Too Young To Die" isn't exactly what you mentioned but it is worth a read nonetheless.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(7402590) is one of the better Wrong Boy-Who-Lived fanfictions. It has some interesting ideas concerning magic, and some very unique characters, but it also falls prey to a multitude of tropes. It is not complete, and if I recall correctly, the author has indicated he has no intention of finishing it.

Still. It's worth a read. The grammar is passable, and it is rather interesting.

** Sacrifices Arc is (in my opinion) the best and most in-depth WBWL ever and I recommend it all the time. In it, Harry has been brainwashed by his parents and Dumbledore into believing that he needs to sacrifice himself for his twin brother Connor, the supposed BWL. If you like bashing, this series does it extremely well. First book in the series is Saving Connor. Politics plays a pretty big part in Year 4+.

Then there is Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. Actually, I'm not sure if this is a WBWL fic, because Harry in this fic is NOT the real BWL, but it's a really great story nonetheless about a Harry who is jealous of his brother and leaves Hogwarts to go to Durmstrang. Unfortunately it's abandoned.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
