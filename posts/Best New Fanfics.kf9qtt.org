Hello!

I have joined the HP fanfiction community this year and have read a lot of the classics when it comes to the best fanfictions out there. However, since I began writing my own story, Serpentine Advice - linkffn(13653786) - I haven't really read anything new. Can anyone give me any recommendation as to what are the best new HP fanfictions of 2020?

I'll go ahead and recommend one lesser-known story that I have enjoyed a lot:

Harry Potter and the Auror Academy: Transitions - linkffn(13634337) - is a fun take on the classic 'Potter Family is historically significant' trope, with a tremendously powerful HP that still behaves somewhat like I would imagine canon HP would if he found himself in this scenario.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011][Ouroburus]] has become an instant favourite. It's definitely darker than what I presume most people's taste would be but considering the main characters are Voldemort, it wouldn't be realistic otherwise. The writing is great but the characterisation is the real treat. I don't think I've come across a better characterisation of Voldemort in all my (many) years of reading fanfiction. It's almost a shame I know quite a few people will be put off by the main pairing because it's just such a fantastic story. Also, Walburga ‚ù§Ô∏è Never did I think I would develop such a soft spot for Walburga Black.

(If you haven't read Six Pomegranate Seeds I would also highly encourage you to read that one! Have read it through a number of times because I enjoy it so much)

** Linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) technically started at the end of last year, but it's close enough. It's one of the best fics I've read in a long time, and might be the best SI/fix-it fic. It's basically the story of one responsible adult who takes the uselessness of all the other adults personally, and injects a healthy dose of competence into everyone around him. The author is also British and loves to inject real British culture into the story, which makes it feel more authentic.

His other fic, linkffn(No Fate by AndrewWolfe) is also shaping up to be very good, but it's also still in the first act, so the meat of the story hasn't really hit yet. It has a very consistent update schedule, which is always nice with incomplete fics.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

** I agree. People here recommend the same old fics, over and over and over again. I almost never find anything new on this sub.

I really liked linkffn(If not for Umbridge) - a well written Daphne and a cool/unique Tracey.

linkffn(A different kind of war) is a more serious fic, sometimes a bit tense, but has really amazing and snappy dialogue.

linkffn(Dance of Death) and linkffn(Casting Shadows) are a two-part series that has the best take on the 'scar!crux' I've ever seen in HP fics.

I'm also partial to my own (big surprise there lol) story, linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

PS: I've heard great things about your fic on discord, but haven't started it myself. Is yours finished? How close are you?

Voldemort is similarly not the cartoonishly evil character in my story that he is in canon. But Dumbledore is an /antagonist/.

** I would recommend my own fics but they're kind of half-finished drabbles, some of which I haven't updated in months. The good thing, though, is that I'm currently writing a fic based off on linkffn(The Founders Four) and linkffn(Founders' Heirs) that I plan to get halfway done before posting. I'm about ten thousand chapters in currently, which is about two and a half chapters worth.

  Harry is in danger. And this time, not even Dumbledore can save him. Four people rise to help, four people with tremendous power. But such power always comes with a cost. Can they sort out their differences before it's too late for both Harry and the world? [CURRENTLY BEING HEAVILY EDITED.]
