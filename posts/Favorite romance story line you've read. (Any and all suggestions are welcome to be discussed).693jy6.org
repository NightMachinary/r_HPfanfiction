What is your favorite romance plot you've read? Doesn't have to be the best, just one that you personally loved. One shot, 300k, het, slash, dark and dreary, happy and sappy, whatever you feel like. Something that attached you to the characters and made you root for them through all their troubles.

For me I quite like linkffn(10855282) Its kind of cheesy in some spots but I just love it!


** I don't read many romance fics but one of the best that I've read and my favorite would have to be linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19)

** Vox Corporis: linkffn(3186836)

It has its problems; the way the events of chapter 2 are left unexplored for most of the story, for instance, and the way the ending drags on. But this story contains some really lovely moments and I keep going back to it.

  What makes this one so much better than the others?
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm kind of curious about that, too. Because, as a Snarry fan, I'm inevitably going to disagree. I skimmed the first couple of chapters, and the fic is fine but probably not a desert-island keeper for me. It's first-person POV, and the voice doesn't strike me as Snape's. That's always an issue when writing in first person, I think. Harry doesn't seem very Harryish, either, although YMMV.

It does seem fairly plotty. Maybe that's why? Romance fics as a genre seldom pack a lot of plot, so it can be especially satisfying when a good romance has more than just the love story going for it.

My answer to your question would be linkao3(3836032) (which I don't claim to be the only good Snarry). Like "A History of Magic," it has a time-travel aspect, but except for the Epilogue, it doesn't actually change canon events.

People always say that humor is subjective, and I think romance is, too; what one reader swoons over will often leave another reader cold.

And on the question of what I see in Snarry - well, it's not always romance. This is a ship with very interesting dynamics (understatement), and it's inspired some wonderful stories, but it takes an extremely talented author to write a convincing romance around them.
