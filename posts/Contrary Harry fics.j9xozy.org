** 1)Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance Watermelonsmellinfellon

Summary: Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

2) Allure Immune Harry Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]]

3) Escapologist Harry Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry]]

4) Harry the Hufflepuff » Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story Harry refuses to lift his finger to do shit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

5) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Harry the mod becomes Bella and then starts beating the everloving shit out of edward anytime he sees him refusing to go with the “script”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10207646/1/Script-Bleep-the-Script]]

6) Triwizard Tales » - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best. In which Harry basically pulls the middle fingers and does fuck all to for the tournament

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]]

7) Poison Pen » by GenkaiFan Harry has had enough of seeing his reputation shredded in the Daily Prophet and decides to do something about it. Only he decides to embrace his Slytherin side to rectify matters

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]]

8) Vocare Prabia by Amber Evans Potter Harry Potter u:10-14-2008 - AU. When Harry gets transported to another universe where his life is turned upside down. Is there any way that he can go home? And does he want to when he finds out his parents are still alive there? Chapter 46. Harry is sick of everything and doesn't take shit from anyone

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1542080/1/]]

9) no voyage by aheartcalledhome Harry/ginny story dealing with ptsd Harry refuses to bend hir morals to join the aurors and the reasoning is heartbreaking

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23968243/chapters/57648346]]

10) Made of Common Clay Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

Harry breaks the system everyone gets fucked no shits were given

** Since you mentioned also contracted marriages, here are some:

​

*Marriage in Mind* (HP/LL) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201691/1/Marriage-in-Mind]]has Harry refusing to keep the spirit of agreement, even if he can be forced to the letter.

*Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law* (HP/GW) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law]]Has the interested parties vacate the premises with Harry in the lead.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]] , Harry can't really fight back, so he vacates the premises. HP/HG.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]] , the situation is resolved with proxy violence.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]] the prospective brides tend to suffer fatal accidents. Harry has alibi.

There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/1/][this snippet]]. A discreet escape notable for lack of TRUE LOVE (tm).

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

  ABANDONED. Owls, cauldrons, and pointed hats? Harry Potter was not amused. And he still wasn't entirely sure that his human trafficking theory had been wrong. Warning! Features a very cynical Harry. [AU, no pairings.]

** ‘Oh You Didn't Know? Yeah, He's Awesome' by RuRuLaLa

Summary: Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8525320/1/Oh-You-Didn-t-Know-Yeah-He-s-Awesome]]

‘The Chamber of Secrets, Indeed' by Pseudo Delete Button

Tom expects Harry to be the Golden Boy hero, and to come swooping to Ginny's rescue. So when Harry does indeed come swooping in, but with no intention whatsoever of saving Ginny, Tom doesn't know what to think. OOC. Possible Slash

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10769236/1/The-Chamber-of-Secrets-Indeed]]

‘Swing Music is Shit' by Hibernation_Reader_Ree

When Harry notices a familiar looking boy in Slytherin, Harry decides that he has definitely fucked up. He hasn't may of fucked up. He hasn't even definitely fucked up. Harry has Fucked Up, capital F and U. He has Fucked Up Bad.

(Pretty cracky fic tbh, try and stop me. There still is a plot tho.)

The trio accidentally go back in time to the 1940s, where Tom Riddle is a hot bastard that must be stopped.

(How noticeable is it that I'm shit at summaries? :) xx)

And Oh My God, he has a nose.

‘Flirting With Guard Number Three' by Marginal Benefits

During a summer vacation to London with Ron and Hermione, Harry finds himself entranced by one of the guards at Buckingham Palace. Is there anything he can do to get the handsome man's attention? And phone number? AU Snarry OOCness slash *COMPLETE*

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7687956/1/Flirting-With-Guard-Number-Three]]

‘Almost A Squib' by BajaB

Vernon and Petunia were obviously quite successful at suppressing Harry's magic, but what if they had been even more so? (This one is hilarious, not nearly as angsty as the summary makes it sound)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib]]

(Sorry that most of these are slash I don't read much het/gen, hopefully the stories are good enough for you to brave through it..)

**** The chamber of secrets indeed is pretty funny you should give it a chance it's only a oneshot and Harry just sits on his ass and does nothing to save Ginny because he just can't be bothered to fill the role of the warrior.
