**** It's a cute little mammal rodent! They live in packs and are extremely social so they have to be with you for most of the day or they stress out and die much faster than their lifespan permits. In the wild they're packs of like 30?? Don't quote me. But think tiny flying squirrel with dark stripes and big eyes that's needy and loves to eat fruit and bugs.

** Well, it is in the name of linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel), and it is well written (although [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][slightly too long]]) and very famous story.
