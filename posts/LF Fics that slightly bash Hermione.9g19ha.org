I'm not against all out bashing. But I want to read a good fic, where people don't bend over backwards for Hermione. Harry doesn't train her, or Harry inherits a library and he doesn't let her use it. Basically I'm looking for a fic where characters are annoyed by her need to know everything and she things she's always right, or forcing Harry to train her in magic, it gets cringey. Even stories that she's not a huge part in are welcome. It just gets annoying when Harry and others bend over backwards for her.


** I'd like to read something like this as well. I think people downvote because they think you're hating on the character, but really it's fanon Hermione who is treated like royalty by readers and authors alike. It gets really repetitive after awhile.

I'd love to read a story where she isn't given special treatment or catered to. I'm itching for something where Ron replaces Hermione as the side character and Hermione is disregarded for a change, just for variety's sake. I'm sick of reading the same 'goddess Hermione' shit over and over. Again, I love canon Hermione from the books, but hate her in most fanon stories mainly because she's so perfect and dull in them.

*** Yeah exactly. It just gets so boring reading fics that don't deviate from the 'Goddess Hermione' trope. Unless you want to read a Harry is the son of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix fic, and the dark Prince of Evil. Hermione, in my opinion, in fanon can be worse then Ron. Ron is just a kid who deals with self confidence and jealousy issues, he can grow up and change. But Hermione is some super genius who can't do wrong.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Man, I used to like Hermione, but now I've grown to really hate her. She's arrogant, nagging, and can't mind her own business, and to an extent, she thinks she is smarter than the professors because she read books about a world she recently joined. That combination of traits should've gotten her killed just in the first three books multiple times, but nope, she has plot armor because she's on the good guys' A team.

Similarly for Dumbledore. The dude is supposed to be like the wisest, most powerful wizard in basically all of magical Europe, but his magic school is arguably shit. Every year shit goes down, and many of the teachers are shit too. Malfoy's dad is right. Dumbledore is a crackpot. He doesn't teach a single class anymore either. What does he even do all day??? (Is he really just pacing all the time in his chamber like the Marauder's Map shows?)

Sigh. I used to love HP as a kid.

*** One of the tropes I used to read a lot of is what I call the "Harry Fucks Off and Does His Own Thing". For whatever reason, Ron lets his insecurities about jealousy, money, and whatever else get the better of him and it turns into a Ron !Bash fest. Whereas Hermione is absolutely 100% supportive and suddenly gets over her "Adults are Always Right" and "Books are EVERYTHING!!1!" /real/ fast.\\
It got to the point where I started to intentionally seek out fic where Ron was a Good Character and the odd Mione!Bash.

**** She got over her "adults are always right" thing a month into her friendship with Harry. She set a teacher on fire then. By year 5, Hermione was a vindictive bitch who wasn't bothered that she led Umbridge in a Centaur gang rape or permanently disfigured another girl. Then she got the idiot ball in book 6.

** Hermione gets dissed quite a bit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

--------------

Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.

--------------

Upon closer observation, I had cast aside my early assumption that Hermione was this generation's Bellatrix. Her obsession with rules, goody-two-shoes personality, intelligence, and hidden cruelty were far more reminiscent of my younger self.

--------------

My jaw dropped in a very Weasley fashion. "You returned the time turner? But Hermione, we had the power to bend time to our will. We could have done so many things."

"That's why I returned it," Hermione said primly.

Traitorous, selfish, and unrepentantly evil...Yes, she was exactly like me at that age.

--------------

"Obviously," she huffed. "I'm just threatening to report that she's an illegal animagus. I also kept her in a bottle for a while."

I frowned. "For how long?"

"A couple of days," Hermione said.

"Did you feed her?" I asked.

Hermione paled. "It didn't really occur to me."

"You gave her water at least..." I said.

"Um..."

***** Harrymort is verbalizing all of these evil intentions, but it's obvious in his actions (and this is even called out inside the story by Luna) that clearly Harry has had a huge influence over their merged subconscious and morals, even if it's not stated at all by the narrator.

Much of Harrymort's admiration of Hermione seems to be twisting things that Hermione does as incredibly evil, when they're usually just moderately mean.

** I feel like I'm overhyping this because I've basically suggested these series to a lot of people recently, but on AO3 mad_fairy has two series (Mischief's Heir and Ninja Wizard) that pretty much pummel Hermione and force her to change or be marginalized. They're both complete series with novel length stories, one is slash (Tomarry) and crosses over with Avatar the last Airbender, while the other has Marvel Loki adopting Harry.
