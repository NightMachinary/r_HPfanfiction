** Depends what you're looking for tbh. Are there any specific ships you already have in mind? Or do you want it not to focus on relationships? Would you be okay with explicit sex or not? Do you want a continuation of the story or an alternate universe? Tons of things to keep in mind!

*** I don't really care what the ships are, but I would prefer if the main focus wasn't romance. I don't mind explicit sex. I don't care if it's a continuation or an AU, just that it's good in quality.

** As you didn't have any specific requirements, here is a long, completed, well written, you could say canon compliant story: All the young dudes by MsKingBean89.

** I really like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13330853/1/][The Venom Peddler]]. I find it entertaining and romance isn't the main focus. Basically Harry finds out a lot about magic living in Diagon Alley summer before 3rd year and the story is AU from there. No bashing.
