  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

      Warnings: Discussion of child neglect/abuse; violence towards children in the later chapters\. This is a newly\-edited version of a story written the early 2000s\. It has been edited primarily for grammar; having been written around the time OOTP came out, it does not incorporate canon from Half\-Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows\. Earlier versions of the fic are available in ebook formats from Chandri \(containing all the files of the Stealing Harryverse\) and from Deinera \(containing only Stealing Harry\)\. There is also a mobi version of it available from Mickawber\-fics\.

** Try the Dangerverse! I read many of these many years ago and remember them being good. Located here: [[http://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

First story is Living With Danger

#+begin_quote
  First in the Danger series. What if Harry Potter had not just father figures, but mother figures as well? What if he had siblings? And what about Hermione Granger, or Draco Malfoy? Would they have been different with a different family? What if Sirius Black had a girlfriend named Aletha, his fellow Beater and constant verbal sparring partner? And what if Remus Lupin, one gray March day about five months after his world fell apart, met a woman named Danger who knew things that would change his life forever? Features Weasleys and Luna Lovegood in later chapters.
