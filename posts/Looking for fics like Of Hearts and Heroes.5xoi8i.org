Basically, I'm looking for long, complete romances with lots of magic and a focus on the war. Thank you :3


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: An excellent combination of action and R/Hr romance, 660k words long.

*** It looks like it's a crossover to something I haven't read/seen. Thank you, though, hopefully someone else will like it!

**** Nah, the crossover is in the sequel. Technically HG&BWL is a prequel as it was written after the crossover sequel, but there are no crossover elements in the fic- it's straight up a non-magic AU.

***** Non-magic? That's not really my cup of tea. Thank you though, for the reply :)

****** I thought so as well, disliking magic-less AUs, but it really is a very good story.

******* I'll add it to my library, I think then, but it might be awhile before I get to it.

  In the days following the Department of Mysteries there is no respite for Harry, Ginny learns she is not the plain outsider she thinks she is. Grief and fear lead to late night connections for Ron and Hermione. Sixth year pre HBP AU.This is the story I wrote and posted way back in 2005. I'm posting it here by request since the other sites it was posted on are down. It is incomplete, but I do have a 50th chapter that has been sitting on a flash drive for a decade. My plan is to tweak it so that there is some closure and have the whole story transferred here by Labor Day.

*** I will say, even though it has been abandoned, this fic is so amazing it doesn't matter. I highly recommend!
