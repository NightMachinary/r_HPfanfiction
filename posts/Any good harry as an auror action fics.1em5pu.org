Does anyone know any good harry as an auror action fics? Preferably when hes still going through training and preferably cannon compliant.


** In [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Winters after the war]] Harry works as an auror. It was one of the first fanfic I read. I found it quite good at the time, but I can't compare it to what I've read since then as I have pretty much forgotten most of it.

It is a sequel to [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Summer after the war]]

** 'After the War' is exceptionally long and has a LOT of detailed info on them training, catching people after bk7, their lives.

and 'Harry's Future' follows in the same vein, but Harry quickly becomes head of the MLD and turns it around, its clever and knowledgeable, and involves a year at the start where he returns to Hogwarts for his education.

I honestly would reccomend Harry's Future, as it has more plot in it and different arcs, like a proper book, as does it's sequel 'Professor Potter', and the sequel to that. Currently 3 books in the saga and they are incredibly long, they'll do you for awhile. But don't discount After The War either!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8015874/1/Reflections-in-the-Silver-Mist][Reflections in the Silver Mist]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3824385/Rannaro][Rannaro]].

In [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][another fic]] the author took the character of Snape and wrote his entire story from birth until death. You mightn't like Snape, I didn't before reading it, but your opinion of him will gradually change as the story goes on. It's a bit long though. Luckily, if 648,043 words are too much you can just skip it and go straight to Reflections in the Silver Mist. That's told from Harry's perspective, a year after the war.

I'm not entirely sure where the author is going with it, as I'm only 4 chapters in, but Harry is an auror in training. Snape is dead. But in his memories, the ones he gave to Harry, there's something else, and it's alive. Or at least sentient. The author's summery is actually better than anything I can write, so yeah.

/"When Hermione conjured her flask in the Shrieking Shack to hold Snape's memory strands, what exactly did she capture? Harry is not certain at first, but he is determined to preserve it."/

Oh and both stories go seamlessly with canon, and are some of the best written fics I've read so far. Definitely worth your time.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to live again]] is awesome, as well. He plays Quidditch for a while before becoming an Auror, in case you're not looking for that. Has a great sequel.
