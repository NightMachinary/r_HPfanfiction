:END:
Looking for a fic I've read. Harry/Daphne, Peverell, either Demelza Robbins och Nathalie McDonald (can't remember which one) is their "adopted" little sister. In the end they have a galactical empire, a temple called the temple of peverell (or some such) and when they finally die after millenia they are actually cosmic beings (death and fate I think). Thank you for your cooperation!

#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
