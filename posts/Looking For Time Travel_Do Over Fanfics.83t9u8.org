Tomarry and Dark! or Grey!Harry preferably, and Dumbledore/Weasley bashing would be even better. I've read a ton on Ao3, so I'm looking for any good ones I may have missed or are on ff.net

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** I have my fic [Strive] which is a Time and Dimension Travel fic with Dubious-Dumbles. Harry is a Professor of DADA in said fic and Tom is obsessed with him. No Weasley bashing so I'm not sure it'd fit your requirements.
