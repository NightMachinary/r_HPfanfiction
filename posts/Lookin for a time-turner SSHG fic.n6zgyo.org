:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry and Ron were roughhousing in the common room and accidentally hit Hermione which resulted in a time turner accident. The war already ended and Snape's dead. Hermione has nightmares and Remus helps her by sleeping with her at night so when she crashes back to the marauder's era she looks for Remus while delirious. She had a relationship with snape and was prevented by dumbledore from staying and saying anything but she ended spilling the beans to mcgonagall. I think teen snape was already a deatheater. She comes back in the future and find Snape alive in a house provided by dumbledore with an alive sirius and fred. I think there was a little red riding hood figure that was used as a portkey and it was her past self's gift to Lily.

It's just making my brain itch that I can't remember the title or find the link. Anyone who wants to help me ðŸ˜… thanks!


** I knew I had it somewhere, trawled through my bookmarks for it. Edit: it doesn't sound the same so probably not the one, but it's good anyway linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10734054/chapters/23789763]])

  Time-Turners are dangerous devices, and awful things happen to wizards and witches who meddle with time.Or do they?For Hermione Granger, an accident that leads her back in time changes the course of nearly a dozen lives, her own included: love where there was none before, hope where it was lost, trust where it had always been suspect.A young Gryffindor girl that hadn't existed before.For Aurora Snape, starting school when the threat against Muggle-borns and the Chamber of Secrets makes it more difficult to be the Potions master's daughter. Or making Draco see that his perception of Muggle-borns is wrong. And it certainly doesn't help when one of the few Gryffindors who is nice to her is the one person who really shouldn't know her too well: her mother.
