:END:
I read it a long time ago but basically everyone's told some huge secret thing is wrong with Harry and Ron and Hermione abandon him. I remember like the first chapter they are in diagon alley and he sees Ron and Hermione and he basically gets ignore and Draco notices. Than they get to hogwarts and gryfindor basically shun him and start preventing him from leaving his dorm and he has to fly out a window at some point. Gryfindor basically kicks him out and demands a resort. Gets sorted into slytherin and he has seer like visions or something that he inherited from Lily. There's a lot more. I think it had a sequel. I think it had fate in the title but again unsure. Help would be appreciated. It was on fanfiction.net
