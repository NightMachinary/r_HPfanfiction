I absolutely love the Marauders, but I also absolutely love Snape. The thing is, people often tend to either;

A: Praise the Marauders and bash Snape.

or B: Praise Snape and bash the Marauders.

The Marauders were pranksters who often took it too far, Snape came from an abusive childhood, and was a Death Eater in training, but eventually went to the light side, once he realized that the woman he loved was in trouble.

Sirius' stupid Shrieking Shack prank, was just poorly thought out. He does seem rather short sited on things, even though I love Sirius. Canon Sirius is something I absolutely love for how complex he is. And while some might not think it, Canon Snape is likewise very complex.

I'd like to see interesting stories involving either some of the Marauders, like Remus and Sirius in their adulthood, or while they were in School, or after school joining Dumbledore or all of the Marauders (Yes, including Pettigrew too).

I don't want stories that praise the Marauders and bash Snape, or praise Snape and bash the Marauders,

They were ALL stupid, acted stupid, and all never really grew up, I want to see that in the stories.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

It can be on any site, not just fanfiction.net

As I said NO Character Bashing, now characters hating each other is fine, but the author going out of their way to bash characters is a no no.

It can be in the Marauder ERA or in the Golden Trio ERA.

I particularly like Snape here, and I think the Marauders were portrayed pretty well too.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][leave no stone unturned (a series of standalones)]] series is my favorite take on the Marauders. More specifically, "They're Hiding Inside Me" linkao3(12540852) gets heavily into the kind of situation Sirius was in that put him into the headspace that led to setting the wolf on Snape and "The Age of Lies" linkao3(13281801) is one on Marauders's relationship during the war.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

I love Marauders era stories, I think I've read just about all the good ones I can find, and this is my favorite. It doesn't really go into the relationship between the Marauders and Snape too much, as it has more of a focus on James and Lily, but Snape and Lily's friendship does get fleshed out a decent amount. As far as I remember, there is no Snape bashing, and there is certainly no over the top Maruader praising. Its long, finished, and all around excellent.

  A hasty decision and a bet they never should have agreed to result in James and Lily spending a lot more time together in October of their 7th year than they ever anticipated. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

** 188 chapter long Remus-centric fic, where Remus grew up in a muggle orphanage. While Snape isn't portrayed as a saint, neither are Sirius & James, and it talks about the classist behaviour of the marauders & how they'll never fully understand why Remus is different.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

There is no bashing in it, even if Snape's side of things is shown less than that of other characters, mostly because he is not part of any of the groups the story focus on.
