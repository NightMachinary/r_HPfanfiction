Just got done with what is currently written up for linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides) and it was fun having the Queen come in and set the magical world on its ear for all the stupid things it has going on.

Involvement doesn't have to be the same or as depthy as it is in that one, but having Harry interact with royals ( either British or another royal family ) would be something I'd like to explore more. Could be the King of Atlantis for all I care, though the British royals are preferred if only because they'd probably be the least conoluted to get involved, so weird cliches might not be /quite/ as prevelant.

So, any suggestions on what to read for more royal smackdowns, yeah?

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

There's a consolidated version on fanficauthors.net. I don't think it's completely finished (it's been awhile since I read it), but some royal fun is definitely involved.
