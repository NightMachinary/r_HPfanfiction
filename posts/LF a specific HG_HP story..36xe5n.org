I think its set after OOTP, they end up being together but then something happens to Hermione to set her memory back to before they do and harry tries to distance himself to "save" her.

They feed each other cake too, i'm a sucker for cheesy stuff like that. :)

EDIT: Some more things i think i remember about it, She loses her memory around Christmas time, they were able to speak telepathically, they are still at Hogwarts whilst all this happens.


** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/809/1][This]] is the only story I know featuring H/Hr and cake (Chapter 5). Unfortunately it doesn't match the rest of your description.
