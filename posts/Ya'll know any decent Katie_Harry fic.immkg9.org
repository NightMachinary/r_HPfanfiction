** There's ongoing one at Ao3, where Katie's a cultist and Harry's an inductee.

It's early days, and was started from a prompt on this very sub, but it's fascinating.

It says it's a Dresdenverse cross, but really all the author is using is the idea of the "Gates" and horrors from beyond said Gates. :)

The bot has a problem where it can't search for fics by name right now. I like the fanfic you recommended so this should give us a link.

  Harry Potter is not the Wizard people expected him to be. He has traversed the dark, and it is down to those around him to bring him into the light. He has suffered, but because of it, he will become strong.

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.
