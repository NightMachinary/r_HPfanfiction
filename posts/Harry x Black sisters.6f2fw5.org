*** I've tried reading several fics by that author, and I just can't take it. The grammar makes it unenjoyable and the author never improves at it.

**** From his last authors note he said he's ending that fic in another chapter or two and starting a sequel because s/he has improved their grammar and all that.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** The only thing I don't like about this fic is how the author managed to completely ignore the opportunity to make the title a massive pun. I mean come on, we all read it as Stepping Black anyway.
