I seem to recall it was only Susan/Harry for pairings. The premise as I remember it was that Harry comes in from another timeline/reality and helps in a grim reality where the war with Voldemort is still going on.

I think Luna was the leader of the resistance in this fic and she and everyone else is very jaded from all the fighting.

  Harry's world ends as everyone he loves is killed when the Death Eaters attack Bill and Fleur's wedding. Is there such a thing as a Second Chance? Various Ships. Dark world, Sexual situations, Slavery, Extremely AU. Very damaged people.

** Do you remember if there was an AU Lavender as well who wore a wolf-skin or some other distinctive piece of wardrobe? I think I may vaguely recall this one... It was something like Harry was brought to the AU, he's older, and his team from the AU figures out how to create portal and they bring in all sorts of badass ideas/allies/spells.
