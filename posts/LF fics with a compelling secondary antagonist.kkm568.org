Hello everyone!

I'm looking for any fics that have another enemy for Harry beyond Voldemort (or Dumbledore if you're going in a Dark!Harry direction) that's actually a challenge. Lesser Evils did a great job in having Harry face Death Eaters that were gripping, difficult to deal with, and engaging to read about.

Bonus points if there is a worthy adversary within Hogwarts. I'm open to it being just about anyone, but I'd prefer it's not as simple as: Step one: be chosen one!! step two: yell and flex your Lordly muscles?? Step three: profit. I want Harry to struggle or even fail.


** Ginny Weasley is a reasonable secondary antagonist in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] who gives Harry a hard time for a long time.

The final battle in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]] is 35k words long and excessively bloody, and deals with a pesky new enemy.

One dimension's Lucius Malfoy is quite a nasty opponent in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/][Shadow Walks]] and its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127/1][Shadow Walker]]

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

*** Ashes and PoS both do have wonderful secondary antagonists! Great rec for any readers that haven't chosen to take the plunge.

Thanks for the other two! I'll check them out
