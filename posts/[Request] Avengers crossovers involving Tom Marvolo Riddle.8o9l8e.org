I specifically want Tom (whether it be during his school years or on the path to becoming a dark lord) to have some interaction with the Avengers which at that point is basically just Steve. I know it's a pretty small area but I'm hoping this community will find something.

  There was a bruise on his cheekbone and one decorating his left eye, and his nose had traces of dried blood running down to his chin, and he had a split lip. But his hands, his knuckles, were red and raw, and that's what made Steve approach the boy standing on the street corner. You didn't get bloodied knuckles if you didn't fight back.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
