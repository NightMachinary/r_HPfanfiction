I always found it sorta odd that characters are always (or at least ALMOST always) depicted as being glad that Hogsmeade is a purely magical town. And from a certain point of view I can see it. A place just for people like you right? But think about that a moment. No muggles. Period. That's what a purely magical town means. It means that there's no muggle spouses or relatives around. It almost certainly MEANS that muggle people are actively kept from settling there even when they're related to a witch or wizard. Is that something to be proud of. I mean, I get wanting a safe place for people like you, I do. But to actively prevent those unlike yourself from inhabiting an area? That smells a little of segregation and bigotry. It's one thing when it's private property of course. Almost anywhere private property means you have the right to determine who may or may not come on the property short of the government generally. But a whole town and its surrounding environs?

I guess I'm just surprised that no one (as far as I've ever seen), not even Hermione on a crusade or something, haven't commented negatively on this policy. It'd sorta be like a town somewhere stating that only white, anglo-saxon protestants, or perhaps english speaking people are allowed to settle in a town or something, or some other group doing similar. Admittedly it's somewhat complicated by the issue of the need for secrecy and such but, that it's not even discussed or commented on in fan fiction is a touch odd.

Anyone have thoughts on all this? Maybe I'm overthinking things?


** I don't think a purely magical town means no muggle is allowed to set their foot in Hogsmead, it just means that there are no muggles who are unaware of magic. So muggle spouses can settle there. Whereas in Godric's Hollow or Ottery St. Catchpole, part of the population is just muggles living their life.

**** I'm pretty sure that squibs and muggle relatives who know about magic are considered part of magical society and have access to areas blocked to normal muggles. I think Hogsmeade falls into the same category as Diagon Alley, a place muggle society doesn't know exists.

****** Parents of muggleborns who grew up without magic would probably prefer living in places with electricity, so they might visit it for shopping but not live there. Muggles married to magicals would probably live there if their spouses do. Squibs who grew up magical might be more likely to live in magical areas even if they can't use a lot of things there. Diagon is primarily commercial area with a few flats of storeowners, Hogsmeade has more residential, but most wizards live in homes that are somewhat hidden or disguised but in areas known to muggles.

** How is this negative at all? Hogsmeade is one of the few places in the entire country where magicals can live free without worrying about the Statute of Secrecy. There should be more purely magical towns, honestly.

And you compare magicals having their own town to other groups wanting towns for themselves for racial or linguistic reasons, when I think it's more analogous to a bar banning people under a certain age from entering their establishment. Muggles aren't supposed to know about magic, so they can't live in Hogsmeade. Children aren't allowed to drink alcohol, so they aren't allowed in bars.

** Hogsmeade is one of the few places in the books where there's nothing stopping you from practicing magic at any time and any place without concern of muggles seeing you.

If you are in a muggle village, or a village with a shared population, you still have to hide magic from the muggles or swear them to secrecy in some manner.

***** It's doubtful that modern muggles would try to kill them (as they had when the statute went up) since most modern societies are secular but wizards wouldn't know that since most of them are so far removed from muggles that many don't know what a TV is.

I personally believe that modern muggles would simply try to reintegrate wizards and maybe work with them to make it so technology and magic can co-exist.

But we'll never know.

******* It's unlikely that the initial reveal of magic to muggles would reveal ALL MAGICALS. They would probably send a few Ministry workers and start working with muggles.

If the muggles do anything to the ministry workers, back into hiding they go, but I don't think they would be stupid to just be like 'HEY, Here is all magical stuff and here is how we find magical kids and whatnot.'

I doubt the muggle government would even allow the public to know until they came to some sort of agreement.

If the muggles just found out about some muggleborn magicals, then yes probably. But if the entire magical world was going public, the same government agencies that would love to experiment on helpless muggleborn would be scared shitless of the magical world. Yes, there might be some incidents, but they really wouldn't be much worse than a second-rate dark lord.

Tell that to Ron who assaults his driving instructor to commit fraud and then brags about it to an Auror. Or the widespread use of memory charms to ensure secrecy. Or the fact that Muggle baiting and misuse of muggle stuff is common enough to warrant their own offices in the magical government.

That does not sound like an oppressed minority, that sounds like an elite maintaining their position with an iron fist.

Do muggles even know it exists? Can they even get there? Are there any roads or paths leading to it? Can muggles even get on board of the Hogwarts express? But most of all- why? Muggles living in Hogsmeade is a security risk- sooner or later they will break the Statue of secrecy and people would start witch-hunting.

** The wizarding world is unfortunately full of this kinda stuff, to such a degree that it is like a fundamental part of the books writing. We have 3 main characters. Harry, who we know a bit about his (wizarding) parents. Ron we know the most about his (pureblood) family, but Hermione? Her parents got like 5 mentions thought all the books, they were on "Screen" but we have no physical description nor any names, and when they where there they were treated as almost a curiosity by the other characters. We only know that they have jobs because it explains why Hermione hadn't had magic done to the teeth she hated.

Muggles are seen like the "savages" from the "new world" were a few centuries ago. Arthur wants to protect them, but doesn't know much about their culture. Part of it is I am are looking too far into what were originally jokes, but muggles are dismissed as savages throughout the whole series.

*** I get where you're coming from but I think the fact that wizards have been heavily persecuted by muggles throughout history is where a lot of those attitudes come from. I've always been disappointed with the Magic world's unwillingness to learn about the muggle world and to try and make diplomatic relations. I think the magic world is far too comfortable staying the same and not evolving. I've come to think of Mr Weasley's ignorance about muggles is mostly an act to make 12 yrs old harry feel more comfortable. I think he knows more than he puts on.

  Mr. Weasley ... was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them. "But you're Muggles!" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. "We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand.

  They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.

  They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley's face.
