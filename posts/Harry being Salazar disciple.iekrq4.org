Any fanfics where Harry becomes a direct or indirect disciple of Salazar. It may be with a portrait, a library based on parseltong, diaries, or even a snake that belonged to Salazar.

Preferably post-CoS

It doesn't matter if he is a descendant of Slytherin or not. Although I always think the idea of Lily coming from a line of squibs from Gaunt or Slytherin is cool, that's another discussion.

About the ships, whatever, as long as its NOT HarryxGinny or HarryxHermione, because this is too common and I'm not interested. Or not slash for Harry too.

thanks for the attention


** By far the best two I have read are linkffn(Harry Potter and the international Triwizard tournament) and (a Cadmean victory) The second one seems to be a bit controversial on here, but it's well-written if nothing else.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

*** This is one of the best fanfics I've read.

The worldbuilding and the expansion of the wizarding world far beyond Magical Britain is incredible.

It is really a shame that it is abandoned.
