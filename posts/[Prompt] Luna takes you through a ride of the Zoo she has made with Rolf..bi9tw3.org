Use all the imagination you want. Think up the interesting, exciting, and/or disturbing creatures Luna finds out. Have fun.


** The group of first years shivered in the light November chill. Excitement ran through the air for today was a very special day : The school tour to the Scadamer Zoo,one of the most treasured places in Wizarding Britain.

Professors Finch Fletchely,Davies and Corner were finishing up their headcounts with small smiles on their faces at the sheer anticipation on the faces of their students.

Professor Corner cleared her throat and addressed the students :

" I want pristine behaviour from every last one of you,this is a fine institution run by a brilliant woman and I want you all to fully respect that " she gave a pointed glance to Elias Parkinson who huffed in response.

As if on cue,the brilliant woman ( dressed in sunshine yellow safari gear and a bright blue zookeeper's cap ) made her appearance. She gave a dreamy smile and turned to the trio of professors : " Hello Justin. Hello Marietta.Hello Padma " before turning to the sea of children " Hello Albus. Hello Rose. Hello Colin. Hello Ingrid. Hello Ashton. " It took her a few more minutes to finish greeting every student individually.

She clapped her hands together suddenly " OK,now I want you all to have fun but also be careful. I wouldn't want to have to tell your parents of your unfortunate demises. " She began handing out maps and timetables.

" First we'll visit the aquatic species : Selkies,Underwater Goats and Darkish McKnowklys . Careful not to fall in with the Selkies; they're a bad influence ! "

" Then we'll go to the aviary and see if the Grand Binggger will come out of it's nest and say hello "

"Before we break for lunch,I want you to help me find the Orgunatlans,they got out this morning "

Suddenly a large purple creature with a large resemblance to an ape jumped over the zoo wall and snatched up one of the Portkeys the school group had arrived by and disappeared.

" Oh,bother " said Luna.
