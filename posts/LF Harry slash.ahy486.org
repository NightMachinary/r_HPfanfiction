I only read two story with slash and it was about Harry. First it was Harry/Tom, second was Harry/Sirius (both time travel and both amazing!)

I want something like that. 100k, time travel, happy end. Is there fic like that? :D let me know, please! :)

Harry/Tom time travel. I'm not usually a fan of this pairing, but this is an amazing story of redemption

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox]] linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][2060]])

Snarry, Harry ends up in Marauders' time and becomes a DADA Professor

​

Edit: I'm not sure why the bot added the first link, but not the second

** I really like the Time Twister series, currently on volume 3 rewrite, it's a Harry/Draco fic (I know many people here dislike the pairing, but if you're not one of them, here you go :) ) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]]

Turn is also a Harry/Draco story, not everyone likes it as the author has a really unique mood-setting style, but I really enjoyed it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695]]

The Dead Master is a Harry/Snape story, not a pairing I usually like, but it's been an incredible read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9061720/chapters/20610082]]

Face death in the hope - a Harry/Regulus story that's currently at almost 170k words and it seems to only be getting started omg [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]

You might also like stories by Athy(Athey), the updates are rare, but it's one of the few authors I toss everything down to read when I get an update notification [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Athy/pseuds/Athy/works]] - Again and Again is a time travel story and widely liked, but my absolute favorites are Rebirth and Mirror of Paths!

Strange_Soulmates is another author whose works I really love, though they specialize in heavy AU, so it might not be your thing - [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Strange_Soulmates/pseuds/Strange_Soulmates/works]]

** Again and Again by Athey linkffn(8149841) is spectacular, it is HP/TMR is definitely worth a look, as are most things by Athey.

The Love of a Good Wizard linkao3(266699) by SweetSorcery is also HP/TMR

Xerosis linkffn(6985795) which is (amazingly) HP/TMR and Gelosaþ in Écnesse linkffn(10712904) an awesome HP/Salazar Slytherin story both of which are written by Batsutousai who has many great slash works.

Incidentally, all of these contain elements of time travel, though not always in the way you might expect

Any other slash pairings you're interested in? I've usually got a rec for most

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
