Recently i had this great idea of a fic, that i hope someone has written!

So if anyone has seen/written a fic with these elements please link!

Someone (male or female) from our universe is transported into the hp world, and proceeds to tell Harry about all the crap thats going to happen, and helps change the timeline for the better.

As an example: During the Goblet of fire chosing the champions, a rift opens up and spits out your average hp fan/hp fanfiction fan, who upon entering, recognises the great hall and the goblet, stops harry from going with the other champions, and points out moody as the culprit. Proceeds to tell HP of his past+present and asks if he wants help to change the future, to avoid needless deaths.

(No slash if possible!)

If any writer wants to take this up as a challenge:

Fanfic fan is summoned during GOF on Halloween, (Can be a failsafe of the Goblet to summon a defender of the falsely picked)

Has to defend Harry from entering. (From Goblet picking magical signatures from the one entering, you cant enter a contract unvillingly, to changing the tasks to 3 easy events, then redrawing the 3 real champions, or anything in between)

Has to inform Harry and at least hermione&sirius about the future, and change it for the better.

Can be cannon events and characters, or fanfiction world (ie manipulative dumbledore, bad weasleys etc)

Bashing of chars Ok. Cliches (lord potter, rich, etc) is OK. Bur keep it realistic.

Can have fanfic fan persuade Harry to study/train more and take his future seriously.

Preferred but not a requirement of Harry taking DE's seriously, and taking them out permanently instead of stunning them.

Bonus for killing/maiming/humiliating snape.


** That isn't dimension travel, its called self insert and they're all bad.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** linkffn(A Curse Of Truth) Not too bad, all things considered. Probably the one of the best fics in this category, but with OC;SI fics that isn't really saying much, is it? Decent writing, not bad prose, and decent plot. I read this as a guilty pleasure fic (I like Daphne Greengrass), because it was one of the few I was not disgusted by. Would recommend to anyone who actively seeks out OC;SI fics, because this is a legitimately decent fic (unlike most other OC;SIs) (not saying they're all bad, just more than in other AU subcategories).
