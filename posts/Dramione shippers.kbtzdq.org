** My review as a fan of Harry Potter and not a fan of Dramione specifically:

I read/skimmed it a while ago, and TBH, it's a lot like the Handmaid's Tale AUs that every fandom has.

Here's the basic plot of every fanfic derived from HT (you're welcome): The heroine is forced into sexual servitude/forced impregnation to the “hero”. She initially thinks the hero is an evil monster. However, events transpire and the woman realizes that the hero is not /so/ bad, he was a victim of circumstances, tragically misunderstood, etc. In fact, he actually tries to “protect” the heroine, insofar as his position will allow (which usually isn't very far, thus giving the author plenty of scope for rape scenes that are “ok” because the hero secretly wishes he didn't have to do it.)

Further events transpire, and the hero and heroine (sometimes with a baby, sometimes not) escape to live their lives in “freedom”. Yet it's not truly freedom since the hero will never be accepted by society because of his crimes so the heroine must once again sacrifice her independence to hide out/go on the run with the hero.

Somehow, they live bittersweetly ever after.

The end.

The extent to which you like each individual fic in this genre will depend largely on your affection for the fandom and ship, and how well the author can tell you a story that's been done to death.

I'd rate this story a 5/10 if you have no particular feeling for Dramione either way. It's readable, but definitely drags in places. I'd give it a look if you want a story to while away a long afternoon and you don't have anything else to read.

TLDR: This story is brain candy. It goes down easily, you'll enjoy it while it lasts, but ultimately it isn't very filling or memorable. You might also feel a little queasy and ashamed when you're done.

*** Don't disagree with your assessment. I do recall losing interest towards the end of the story, I kind of felt like there was not enough consequence. Just because it was a “sticky situation” I guess you could say, does not absolve Draco of...well you know if you've read it. But, all in all, I did find the story consuming and felt like I “couldn't put it down”.

**** I re-read what I wrote again, and I hope I didn't come off too harsh, especially as I see you deleted your original comment. I think that's a shame as there may have been some Dramione shippers interested in the fic who hadn't heard about it.

I had just happened to read that fic and figured I'd put in a review for non-Dramione shippers since it is one of the most popular fics in the ship, and sometimes well-written fics can have universal appeal. I know I've read fics about pairings I wasn't a fan of, and I've enjoyed them because the fic was so well-written.

I just didn't think this fic was one of those, although I didn't hate it (as is reflected by my average overall rating.)

Again, I hope my words didn't lead you to delete your post! I'm sure there were some people out there who hadn't heard about it and were interested because of your post.

***** Hey! No not at all! Please don't worry about it, I just deleted my post as I felt like you brought up some really valid points and after giving it more thought, decided to delete.

But if anyone does come across this I had posted recommending Manacled on Ao3 by SenLinYu.

****** Hey, sometimes our favorite fics can have extremely problematic parts. One of my favorite fics has a problematic Snape/Hermione pairing and a randomly petulant/slutty Tonks. On that basis alone, I should hate it, but dammit, the rest of the fic is so engaging and unusual and well-written I can't! I love it, in spite of those major flaws.

I mean, fanfic is free stories, by amateurs, about our favorite characters. Almost none of it is going to be perfect. If the only fics we recommended were the perfect ones, there would hardly be any fic recs at all. ;)

******** Here ya go:

Linkffn(12915315)

It's called The Dark Lord's Daughter, and it's a fic where Hermione is actually Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. I love the fic in spite of the problematic parts (which I mentioned) because of the relationships between the Black sisters (as well as their relationships with Hermione) run the gamut from poignant to loving, tragic to hilarious, and ring absolutely true to life.

It also has one of the best portrayals of an abusive relationship I've ever seen in a fic (LV/Bellatrix.) Now usually any fic containing a well-realized abusive relationship would be an angst-filled, depressing slog but somehow this is /not/. It's serious in places, sure, but Bella's and Hermione's relationship and it's hopefulness and the way it slowly changes Bella sort of balances out the angst.

The author also includes details/small moments about the characters I absolutely treasure. Like, Bella is portrayed as exceptionally talented and smart as a whip, but it's a running joke through the fic that her recreational reading tends toward low-brow smutty romance/erotica.

I wouldn't say it's the sort of fic everyone would like, but if the idea of a fic exploring loving (yet completely dysfunctional) family relationships sounds like your jam, you'll love it.

#+begin_quote
  In 1979 Bellatrix gave birth to a baby girl on the floor of her Azkaban cell. She was told the baby died. 17yrs later, Hermione is abducted during a skirmish in the Dept. of Mysteries. She is taken to Malfoy Manor to be questioned and killed, but Bella, spotting a unique birth mark she will never forget, sobs to the Dark Lord: "Please, Master, you cannot kill your own daughter!"

********** Sure! I hope you enjoy.

Whenever I rec fics like this I always kinda feel like a drug dealer.

I'm lurking in the shadows and I'm like, “Psst! Over here! Want to try a free fic? Problematic? No no no. Just try it, you'll like it.”

** I am hugely in love with story and reread it a lot, yet I'm not a dramione shipper and I don't read the Handmaid's Tale parts anymore ( start at chapter 27 instead, the first of the flashbacks). So what's in this story for a person like me, aside from the quality of the writing?

IMHO It has the best and only believable second wizarding war depiction ( but if any of you know a better one, please recommend). Dumbledore, Remus and Sirius are still dead, the Ministry is still fallen, and Kingsley is leading the OOTP in a guerrilla war. Snape is still a spy, and no longer the only one. The characters are believable, grieving and altered by their experiences of fighting a war. They are hardened fighters. They've had to let some of their principles go, and they argue and angst about this. Hermione, Ron and Harry still have a close bond but it's getting fractured. I find it mesmerising. It's like the Battlestar Galactica tv series before it jumped the shark.
