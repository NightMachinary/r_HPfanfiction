I cross-posted this on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] as well. Just wanted to say I created a blog to connect (fic)writers and betareaders. I'm not a fan of Tumblr and frankly, I have never used it before, but I thought this platform would be best for this type of thing. You can submit a post anonymously, meaning you don't have to have a Tumblr to post. Here's the link
