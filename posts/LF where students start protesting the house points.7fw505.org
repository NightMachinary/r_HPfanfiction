Its obvious that the house points are unfair. Snapes hands them out and takes them in a very biased way. Dumbledore hands out a bunch at the end of the year one for what seams to the rest of the school as random reasons. I'd like a fic where the students start protesting or trying to keep their points at zero. The protesting has to be something more than just complaining to a teacher.


** linkao3(9821300) In this Harry destroys the points hourglasses partway into the fic. This fanfiction is really enjoyable and a favorite of mine, if you don't read slash don't worry as it is basically the tiniest plot point at the end of the fic.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)'s Harry is aghast at Dumbledore's blatant favoritism of Gryffindor, rules that Snape is only fighting back fairly with his own favoritism, and does his best to win Slytherin the House Cup in protest.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Amidst misconceptions and reconciliation, the lines that separate the Wizarding World will be destroyed. Enemies will serve one another as friendships are tested and forged. But first, the Sorting Hat has a message for Hogwarts... 1st in Kindred Powers
