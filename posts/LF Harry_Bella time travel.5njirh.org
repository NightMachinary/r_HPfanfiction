Have been reading only Harry/Bellatrix lately especially enjoying 1976 Harry/Bella. Any recommendations like Delenda Est/Passageways?


** There is a new one that came out ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back]]) it's by The Black'sResurgence. Same author that wrote "Honour Thy Blood"

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun by Lord Umbrex) is probably my favorite of these, unless you pretend that Delenda Est was abandoned right before the second time jump.

It's almost done, but the author only really updates around Christmas/New Years, so it'll take time to finish.

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?
