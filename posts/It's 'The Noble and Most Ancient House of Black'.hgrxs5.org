** I agree. At first it really annoyed me, but I have this weird habit where if I'm being lazy I will read what I subconsciously expect to be there. So usually my brain sees the group of words “Noble, Ancient, House, Black” and I read it as “Noble and Most Ancient”. Unfortunately this sometimes is not what is supposed to be read, and I have to go back and figure out why the sentence doesn't make any sense.

*** Same! I do this with a few similar things as well. Another pet peeve is ‘oOooH Harry is a parseltongue'.

Like, no. Harry is a parselmouth who speaks parseltongue.

**** I don't see that as often. (Though I may be auto correcting on that too). Also, in the noble tongue he is a /§Speaker§/ and he is speaking /§Snek~Speak§/

** (Shameless self advert) In case you want some fanfiction centered on the Blacks where they are referred to in the correct manner, I'm writing an OOTP AU where most of Sirius's family is still alive when he tries to claim Grimmauld place for the order ;)

** Doesnt really bother me but I've seen many variations on it and explanation for the differences. Also calling the house of potter most noble and most ancient to make them seem more important
