All in the title. I read *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3780720/1/Voldemort-Rocks][Voldemort Rocks!]]* by /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1111119/Inky-Pirate][Inky Pirate]]/, and it became of my favorite crack fics. Any type of story, and a bunch of crack fics would be nice, or should it be a reversal? Because, I have a feeling where would be much more crack on this type.

  If you miss the Earth, 89,999 times out of 90,000, your beam will pass right out of the galaxy without hitting anything. When it does hit something, it will almost always be the Sun or the Moon.

hit sun or moon ~ 1/180k for one specifically so 1/90k to hit one of the two

#+begin_quote
  If you kept shooting long enough, eventually you'd hit a planet. Neptune would be the hardest to hit, followed by Uranus and Mercury. Pluto would be the hardest, but it might be worth it. An impossibly powerful laser would at least settle that debate.

  Stars are even worse. Your odds of hitting any star at all on your way out of the galaxy are almost zero, even if you aim for the core.

and given the much higher density of stars in the universe than black holes that means that hitting a black hole would be all but impossible

**************** "Fairly boring" would be the understatement of the century. :)

This is one reason why I think it's a stupid idea. There are too many other ways that don't involve the stupid and impractical Pioneer plaque OR involve the bother of creating a hundred Horcruxes (which REALLY can't be good for your soul or sanity no matter what the munchkin thinks). The entire thing just smacks of "isn't it cool that he did this?" but it doesn't seem to have much practical thought behind it.

What'd I do, if I were Voldemort and not Voldemort at the same time? Okay, say I'm Dina M. Riddle, Dark Lady who does not want to die but has no problems making other people die. And I have the means of making Horcruxes.

In that case, I'd make three. That's two more than anyone else has ever done, and three is an even stronger magical number than seven. No risk of the Horcruxes becoming diluted or anything like that.

I'll take one Horcrux and sink it down to the bottom of the deepest sea, where not even the sun shines. I'll add some magical protections to keep the sea monsters from destroying it. Nobody would know the location, not even me, and good luck trying to scour the entire ocean for it.

The second Horcrux, I'd place in a random location, use the Fidelius charm to hide the location and make myself the Secret-Keeper. This Horcrux would be one I could get to if I needed, but nobody else would be able to find it unless I told them. And I wouldn't tell them.

The third and final Horcrux, I'd keep on my person at all times. I'd make it a bellybutton ring or something and just never take it off.

There, I'm pretty set. The first two Horcruxes can't be found. The third one I can bring with me. If the Earth SHOULD blow up, as long as I got off-planet beforehand I'd be okay because I'd have one Horcrux on me to keep me alive. If my body blew up along with the Earth, then at least I wouldn't remain as a spirit in space, going insane in the empty vaccum.

Perhaps this isn't as superficially impressive as "oh, I made hundreds of Horcruxes and sent one into space." There might be ways of getting around my defences. But you can't tell me it wouldn't be simpler, or more practical, than MORdemort's ridiculous scheme.

even if that did work do you relly think that your body would be such a more entertaining place to be in space

but barring that

the horcruxes dont prevent the body from dying, they just keep it bound to the universe so it can inhabit future bodies so in the case that you make your bellybutton ring a horcrix and escape the earth with it your body dies in 2 or 3 minutes between not breathing, cooking, and freezing but not before your eyeballs explode from the pressure differential and then your a dismebodied sould bound a bellybutton ring stuck to your old now dead body

but even if you could avoid that

the eventual heat death of the universe means that eventually every particle will be floating in space far enough away from evvery other particle that they all may as well not exist relative to each other so in 10000^{10000^{100000^{1000000}}} years until the end of time itself you will still be a disemodied soul floating in space even if you only use earthbound horcruxes

#+end_quote

I may have confused HP lore with something else, but I could have sworn that three, seven, and twelve were the most magical numbers, and that three was the most powerful one because it pops up the most in magic -- three brothers, three wishes, three Hallows. I might be wrong, but in that case, making MORE than seven is equally a nonstarter. If seven is the most powerful number, and the number of Horcruxes are over a hundred, then Voldemort is not using the most powerful number.

#+begin_quote
  that would be well and good if making horcruxes was what tore the soul but isnt murder is, the horcrux spell simply magically encases and protects the torn fragment That wasn't what I said. But I may have been a little unclear about what I meant, so:
#+end_quote

We don't know how big a soul piece a Horcrux contains. One theory was that they take half the soul, which would explain why the diary, being the fist Horcrux, was the only one ever seen to be able to possess and take over someone -- while the locket, being the third Horcrux, only put you in a bad mood, and the cup, as the fourth one, never seems to have any negative effect on Hermione despite being in her possession for some time.

That was the theory I was referring to. However, if this theory is wrong, and every Horcrux just takes a tiny fraction of your soul and are all equally powerful... well, if the soul can be split and damaged there means there's a finite amount of it, and a finite amount of times you actually CAN make a Horcrux.

It was directly stated that Voldemort had already "pushed his soul to the limit" in creating seven Horcruxes, implying a finite number of Horcruxes any one person may create before the process became too dangerous to attempt again.

Main point: Hundreds of Horcruxes would be STUPID to attempt, and the only reason why MROdemort managed to do it was because Eliezer Yudkowsky didn't actually bother to read the HP books very closely before writing his fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  the fidelius must have a secret keeper who is not the one being hidden and horcrux status may preclude that
#+end_quote

False. Bill and Arthur were their own Secret-Keepers in DH. It's quite possible to do it; it just means the secret is marginally easier to break the more people who know it.

You think not? I'll admit I wasn't alive in 1972 when Pioneer 10 was sent up into space, but it would be a HUGE endeavour to even get to the plaque. We're not talking "murder, spell, Horcrux, bam" here.

Now, there are actually two Pioneer plaques, but from the story, it does seem like Voldemort meant the first one, which was launched into space in 1972 with Pioneer 10 -- not the second one who went up with Pioneer 11 the year after.

The plaque wasn't originally going to be there at all; the initiative was made by Carl Sagan, who got the idea from Eric Burgess, and who famously didn't even tell NASA about the plaque beforehand, because he was trying to avoid the bureaucracy and paperwork. He did ally himself with Dr. Hans Mark, who was instrumental in getting the plaque made and bolted to the Pioneer probes -- he employed the engraving shop Precision Engravers (San Carlos, California) to make a dozen plaques, from the designs of Sagan's wife. Of the twelve plaques, two were chosen at random, and then, still with actually telling anyone at NASA what they were up to, Hans Mark personally bolted these two plaques onto the two Pioneers. (You can hear him tell the story [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogPIvzhHaTE][here]], it's a pretty entertaining story!)

Hence, until the newspaper picked up the story, very few people actually KNEW about the Pioneer plaque at the time. NASA didn't know about it, the public didn't know about it, and in 1972 Voldemort was two years in to the first wizarding war and really had no way of knowing about it.

I suppose it's possible that Voldemort decided to take a break from the war, go on a short holiday to the States, and happen to meet Eric Burgess, whom he Confounded or Imperiused or otherwise gave the idea for a message to extra-terrestial intelligences, and then followed the process of getting the plaque made, steering Carl Sagan and Hans Mark through the processing of making the plaque, turning it into a Horcrux before Imperiusing Hans Mark to bolt it onto... Nahhhh. That's just incredibly convoluted.

Okay, so he somehow found out before the public about the Pioneer plaque, and then he journeyed to Florida (can't Apparate between continents) and sneaked onto Kennedy Space Center, Imperiusing, Memory Charming and otherwise taking out all the employees and guards. Okay, and while he's there he doesn't just decide to turn the entire space craft into a Horcrux, or both of them -- no, he decides that the tiny gold plaque is the best vessel. All right, fine.

Now, I'm not sure just how close to a murder a Horcrux has to be made, but I'm imagining that you can't just kill someone, wait days or months and THEN make a Horcrux, the murder probably has to be very fresh. So he kills someone right there at the space center, and somehow he manages to cover up all the evidence. At a SPACE CENTER. In 1972. Or, wait, maybe he brings someone with him to murder and takes the body with him afterwards... THIS IS TOO CONVOLUTED AS WELL! Why the hell would anyone go through all this nonsense?! If he was so fucking set on sending a Horcrux into space, there HAS to be easier ways of doing it!

No. The only reason it's the Pioneer plaque is because the Pioneer plaque is one of the most well-known things about the space program, and Eliezer Yudkowsky thought it was cool to make that into a Horcrux. Except the story doesn't WORK if you actually try to think up how he did it. It makes Voldemort come across as an absolute lunatic, choosing that particular plaque.

#+begin_quote

I'm sorry, but you were the one who demanded a solution to how I'd make a Horcrux survive the destruction of Earth. /I/ was perfectly happy to blow up along with the Earth, but that wasn't good enough for you. So I thought up a different way.

And please, READ what I wrote. I did say "as long as I got off-planet beforehand." Maybe I should have specifically said "in a spaceship or something" but I thought that went without saying, because how else would I have got off-planet beforehand?

If I'm on the Earth, or close to the Earth, when it blows up, then both I and the Horcrux blow up along with it. So that's that. If I'm off-planet, in a spaceship, I can put myself in a magical coma where I don't need to breathe, and just wait for the ship to find an alien civilization. If that never happens, at least I'm not a disembodied spirit in space.

Granted, this would be a pretty hellish existence, but again, I wasn't the one who WANTED to survive the destruction of Earth.

Now you're making my argument FOR me: The Pioneer Plaque Horcrux was a stupid idea, and surviving the destruction of Earth is totally pointless.

And if the Earthbound Horxcuxes would survive the destruction of Earth, as you imply here, then the Pioneer Plaque Horcrux is DOUBLY pointless.

There's absolutely nothing about MORdemort's plan that follows any kind of common sense. It's one of these ideas that sounds cool at first glance but doesn't hold up to ten seconds of actual thought.

Though, this is an interesting concept. However, would Harry need to study muggle science in depth to have that kind of advantage? It's somewhat unbelievable that he would have enough time to study magic to the point where he can actually apply what he has studied.

** I try not to repeat myself, so I've had several different takes on the Horcruxes in my fics. In one, Voldemort - after the Journal "trial run" - created the Dark Mark as a Horcrux, and ordered some of the marked to stay safe and the heck away from Britain, so they would not risk discovery/death. In another, Horcruxes were hidden in areas with strong wards around the world, feeding on them and hiding among them - and he made more once he realised one was found. And in one story, Voldemort turned an ordinary rock into a Horcrux, and dumped it into the ocean.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240514/6/The-Son-of-Lord-Voldemort]]

Voldemort put his horcruxes in manors under the Fidelius and shit like that in this story. Do note that this story is one where Voldemort raises Harry as his own son. It also has a plentiful amount of drama and Weasley bashing. Still a good story though. I've re-read it 11 times, more than any other story. This isn't a crackfic.

** Try: Linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/19/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes]])

It has Voldemort stashing one of his horcruxes in a silent hills type enchanted town.

Beautifully written, with most of the characters on point. (very slight molly bash, played more for laughs then anything)

It is also a Hp/Disgaea crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the Disgaea series to read and enjoy it. I certainly didn't.
