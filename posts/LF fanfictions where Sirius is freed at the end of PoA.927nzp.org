Preferably with Harry living with him but it isn't necessary. Also, please, /PLEASE/ no spazmoid-unaffected-by-Azkaban Sirius. I'd like to see him slowly start to recover instead of pouting and whining to Lupin and Dumbledore and he's actually shown as an above average wizard, as he is in canon. No Sirius/Remus.


** Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB)

It happens in parts 3 and 4

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all.OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry&Sirius family fic. Semi-canon compliant. RL/NT

** I don't understand why you'd be so against an apparently unaffected by Azkaban Sirius. I've no idea what you've been reading, granted, but for example there's A Black Comedy, and that Sirius is pure fucking awesomeness without any apparent PTSD.

But he didn't seem all that affected by Azkaban not even in canon, so I have no idea what you're on about.

Now, as long as being freed, I hope you don't mind if he gets freed at the beginning of Harry's fourth year instead. I really recommend this one, I'm currently in the process of reading it myself.

As you can probably tell by reading the pairings for the story>! all the Marauders are back in this one!<.
