DISCLAIMER: FOUND THIS ON FACEBOOK, IM NOT TAKING ANY CREDIT FOR IT, IM SIMPLY USING IT AS AN EXAMPLE!!

James: Professor Dumbledore! Please, come in!

Dumbledore: Thank you, James, but I'm not your headmaster anymore. You don't have to call me “Professor.”

James: Sure, um, (clears throat) Wulfric.

Lily: James! (shakes head) Please, have a seat, Albus. I'll make you some tea, right after I put Harry to bed.

Dumbledore: You'll have to catch him, first. Harry: (flies through the room on a tiny broom, chasing a kitten) Crookshanks!!!

Lily: Accio broom! (Harry's broom flies backward through the air into her arms, Harry still on it) OK, Harry, say good night to your future headmaster! (she leans over toward Dumbledore)

Harry: (yanks Dumbledore's beard) Night night night!!

Dumbledore: That's cute now, Harry, but when you're at Hogwarts, that'll get you a month of detention with Hagrid, shoveling thestral dung! (Lily takes Harry upstairs) James, what did young Harry call that cat?

James: Well, Sirius gave us the thing, and its name is Marchbanks. It's supposed to be some kind of insult to the Black family line, naming an ugly cat-kneazle halfbreed after one of his ancestors. His mum was furious. Of course, Harry's only one and can't say “Marchbanks,” so it comes out “Crookshanks.”

Lily: (comes back downstairs, invisible) Albus, here's James' cloak that you wanted to see. Well, it's actually kind of hard to “see,” but you know what I mean.

Dumbledore: When you're done making rude gestures at James under there, may I borrow it for a few days to study?

Lily: How did you-

Dumbledore: Being me has its advantages, my dear. For example, I saw James and his friends sneaking around after hours under that cloak more than once. What was that young lady's name, James?

James: Who, Victoria Umbridge?

Lily: You never told me- I'm going to kill you, James!

James: Thanks for bringing THAT up, Wulfric. Bloody hell.

This can double as a prompt but basically any sorta crack/ cool Dumbledore fanfics (especially with Lily and James but not a must) please link them! Thanks in advance!


** Crookshanks is an unregistered animagus hiding as a pet in wizarding families because of her role in betraying Gellert to Dumbledore?
