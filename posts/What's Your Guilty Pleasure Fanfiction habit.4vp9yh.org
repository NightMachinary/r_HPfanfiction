What's the fic or pairing that you don't care is outside of your normal tastes, you can't help but love. For me, it's HG/SS marriage law cliche, which is what I read as an angsty 16 year old.


** Romance fics that are so extremely fluffy and sappy that it's almost disgusting. If I'm in the right mood, I can shut my brain off and read loads of them without thinking about how unrealistic they are. The problem with this is by the next day, I'll wonder what the hell I was thinking.

Another bad trope I enjoy is 'Harry was abused, Snape saves him and becomes amazing dad' type things :P They are literally so OOC but I just can't help myself.

coffeeonthepatio writes some beautiful fics: Semantics and Dismantle the Sun are excellent.

The Gilded Cage is wonderful and very in character e.g. Snape doesn't suddenly turn into some wonderful romantic figure.

Post Tenebres, Lux is also a beautiful post-DH fic.

I mean I dunno what sort of thing are you looking for? In school, post-DH, canon-compliant, smut, BDSM?? I have tons I could recommend lol I've read a lot :P

I'm not picky about the trope except I'm not a huge fan of too much smut. I don't really read one shot that is smut exclusive. BDSM is fine as long as it is considered safe (I don't know how to explain it...)\\
I don't care if it's canon compliant or not.

I liked it too! Though I couldn't help but roll my eyes a bit at the kids' names... Do they all have to be named after dead people, seriously? At least Hermione and Ron were more original than that.

But yeah, sugary happy endings, I dig that. Though I also like tragic endings, or bittersweet ones... I guess I'm not hard to please as long as it makes sense in the context of the story.

If everything is going great and suddenly the author kills every major characters in the last chapter, I will probably be /a bit/ annoyed.

It's always written terribly. Nearly always. But I don't care. A good example where it's not too terrible just very contrived is These Cuts We Have, by Melindaleo. I'd link but I'm on mobile, but it's on SIYE if you're interested.

******* Well since I have you here I might as well tell you:

I'm glad you chose to write about Harry being an auror because I feel like there aren't that many stories about what happens after the Battle of Hogwart (at least ones that follow canon) and it's something that I really like reading about. There's so much to do with Harry being basically a detective. Why doesn't it inspire more authors, I'll never know.

I loved Theia the moment she was introduced. [[/spoiler][Her initial admiration for Harry and her disappointment when she realizes he's not joyful at the idea of having to train her was very realistic, especially the fact that she talked about it to her parents, so many authors neglect their characters' relationships with their parents! (By the way I'm really hoping her mother is okay considering how things where left off last chapter!). Also her muggle background is a great addition to the story, that scene in the morgue with the mobile phone had me on the edge of my seat hoping she would recognize the voice! Agh!]]

[[/spoiler][And I love Snarky!Harry, can't stress that enough, I loved the interrogation scene with Fischer, the fact that Harry kept pushing and Fischer kept alluding to things but still wouldn't say enough to compromise his accomplice. And Harry and Theia being suspicious about Dennis but unable to prove anything is so frustrating! (which means it's great, ahah).]]

[[/spoiler][Also I like your characterization of Ginny, the fact that she has jealous tendencies but without being completely irrational, her understanding of Harry but without letting him get away with his own faults either. Their relationship feels really realistic, it's not perfect but you can feel they love each other.]]

I hope you update soon! (I know you posted the last chapter like, 2 days ago, but still!) :)

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW) - A long one, at 81 chapters and nearing the end.

linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) - Complete. Super quippy, EWE fic. Lots of back and forth, very entertaining.

linkffn(Big Brother is Listening to You by Holz9364) - The HP version of the Big Brother reality show. Amusing.

linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomniac) - an incomplete, 1 chapter take on a marriage contract thing. Super amusing, hilarious Daphne. As Ron says "I need her in my life"

linkffn(The Grass is Always Greener by kb0) - A complete, classic of the Harry/Daphne genre. A very lighthearted, fluffy, popcorn type of fic.

linkffn(The Lies that Bind by Zephros) - Super dark, but super enjoyable.

Hope one of these seems to tickle your interest.

****** Some other H/D stories:

linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) - post-DH, in progress.

linkffn(Dancing in the Green by Pheonix Dawn) - One-shot just 4th year, more of a friendship than romance.

linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII) - Totally based on Quidditch.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Rise From Dust by Bluezz-17) - This one somewhat guilty pleasure. Harry isn't BWL, his younger brother is. Have some cliches - Harry Quidditch genius & a few. But not a God-like Harry fic. Story probably abandoned.

linkffn(The Trial by reviewgirl911) - Loved the story. Harry's younger brother is BWL, Harry is top death eater. After the end of war, Harry is captured.

linkffn(Moving On by Xavras) - Post-DH. I somewhat like the story. But dislike several things in the story - Ron & Ginny bashing. But the writer's all other story has same problem.

linkffn(Betrayal by butalearner) - This one is interesting. I'd love to read more this type of story.

linkffn(White Nights by PotterforPresident1997) - This one is touching, tragedy. But I liked it due to the fact it's tragedy.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** Givee me any story where Harry acts like most kids would given the abuse he suffered. (I identify with a kid abused by his relatives for reasons we won't discuss). One of my favorites was Cadmean Victory which combines a fleur/harry pairing with Harry being messed up in the head from his abuse to create a really nice though inevitably tragic story.
