  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

Basically Harry meets a tonks that's the same age as him when he's 10 before hogwarts then does 7 books. It starts to be BIG au in the 6th book

It think you'll like it the beginning is really fluffy but the later few books are quite dark

**** The reveal (to Harry) is in the final chapter.

I understand your feeling, but I don't really feel this fic suffers from a 'obnoxious secret keeping' problem. Partially because [[/spoiler][everyone figures it out early, even if it isn't discussed. (Luna learns everything early, Hermione figures out Tonks is reliving events, Harry figures she is a time traveler, Tonks figures out she is a disguised adult, and the Narwals tell Luna everything) And partially because of the length/ time frame of the story, it fits]].

'course if you want a 'read too many stupid secrets fic', go read "And a little child shall lead them", which is about as non 'kerp unnecessary secrets as possible.
