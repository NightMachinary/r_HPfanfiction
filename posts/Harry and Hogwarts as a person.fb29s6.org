:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The Fic I'm searching for had Harry training in the Room of Requirement with Hogwarts materialized as a Person helping him defeat Voldemort. Also Narcissa Malfoy was in hiding from Voldemort and in a sort of mother son relationship with Harry. Harry discovers a portrait of Slytherin in his Chamber and Portraits of the other Founders too as well as Merlin at the "core" of Hogwarts (not sure about that particular detail). The Author was yet to post the last one or two chapters of the story. I am also not sure that I remember this correctly, but I think there was a post that the Author posted the second to last chapter, on this subreddit so I'm assuming it is a reasonably popular fic. Any help finding it would be greatly appreciated.


** Does it involve a dementor attack in the beginning? If so I think you're talking about The Merging by Shaydrall.
