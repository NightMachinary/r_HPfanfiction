:END:
I'm looking for this one Sirius/Hermione fic, where she ends up going back in time, then disappearing from her seventh year with the marauders. They end up finding her in the present, and she's been stuck inside of like a time dimension room inside of Malfoy Manor. Lucius kidnapped her and trapped her in this room for like 10 years. Draco ends up remembering something as a child, and brings it up when she disappears and that's how they find her. I've read it twice, but I can't find it in any of my lists anywhere!
