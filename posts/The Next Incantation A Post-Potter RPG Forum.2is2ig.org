Come hither, to [[http://nextincantation.com][The Next Incantation]]!

The wizarding world has enjoyed an extended period of peace, an entire fifty years without threat, and the days of the Dark Lord are all but forgotten. Only a few memories remain in history books, or in the minds of those who lived through it. For the majority, though, Dark Wizards are a thing of the past and they live happily ignorant of such atrocities and so the wizarding world grows and flourishes.

Hogwarts is as magnificent as ever, with a whole new set of staff members and a brand new Headmistress, one of the youngest the school has ever seen with her own dark secrets. Many students have passed through these hallowed halls and gone on to great and wonderful things, including jobs as teachers, healers, or working in the ever busy Ministry of Magic, under the new Minister.

And so, the students and teachers of Hogwarts work on, heedless of the fact that darkness is once again brewing...and it's much closer to them than they had ever imagined.

Enter the Brotherhood of Shadows, a group of wizards who have discovered an ancient branch of magic, a magic that gives them a power so intoxicating that they're consumed by it. A magic so dark that it can barely be contained...

Where are you in all of this? Are you a student at Hogwarts, studying hard to gain a good job in the future? Working at the Ministry, oblivious to the dark changes to come? Or perhaps you are part of the new darkness, watching and waiting...

This is our story. Choose your side carefully.

*What we offer:*

*Active!*

- You won't get swept away in rapid fire posts (usually) but we have lots of members on every day with many threads being posted to. And if you DO happen to find yourself facing a quiet moment, we have IC chat to keep you occupied.

*Self Hosted*

- Being self hosted means we're not slaves to the dreaded downtime and we have much more freedom with our ratings, allowing us to be a true 3-3-3 site, although that doesn't mean smut features predominantly, but we don't censor your creative freedom.

*No word count*

- We firmly believe in quality over quantity, but this doesn't mean you'll find one liners here! Most write at least a couple of paragraphs, giving you plenty to respond to.

*Traditional App*

- Not so long and tedious that you want to give up before even starting, but long enough for you to give us plenty of information about your character, helping us to come up with great plots for you!

*Mature members, all 18+*

- Maybe that should read mature at least in age, because we're a crazy, fun bunch, more like a family than anything else and we love to bring new members into our fold as well. No-one is excluded. It's in our rules! /Ohana/

*Literate, advanced roleplay*

- No, this wasn't added to intimidate you in any way. This just means that you will find a quality site with passionate writers who want the same as you, to be part of something wonderful.

*Original Characters only!*

- Yes, we may be set in a fandom, but we're also set 50 years past the books and so our story is focused on our original characters and plot and not on what is already set in stone. Or paper. Or pixels.

*Play a student or adult. Your choice!*

- We love our student characters as much as we love our adult characters and there's a place for all of them, with plots and threads available for all as well. We don't let anyone sit idly by and watch others have all the fun.

*Very realistic and involved lessons*

- Perhaps our most unique twist, one that was started ten long years ago and still remains today. We give real lessons several times a month for those who wish to attend them, but they're not compulsory.

*Easy to get involved*

- I've said it before and I'll say it again. No-one gets left out. We have Open Threads, and if no-one has replied within 48 hours then a staff member is guaranteed to. Plot Pages are never with no replies AND we hold a regular thread roulette just to make sure you have plenty to do!

*Dark characters encouraged!*

- You read that correctly. You want to play a badass? Do it! While we have an established 'dark wizard' group on the site, they are ACTIVELY looking for new members so you would be more than welcome to join in on the plot! Want to challenge them? Bring it on.

*Regular Quidditch matches*

- Ask any member, new or old. These are and have always been a big hit. Regular matches (trivia nights) for all to earn them points for their teams. You have to sign up to the teams fast, though, as they're popular!

*Intricate story with regular site wide plot points*

- One thing that happens when you have a site running for a very long time is that you make mistakes and you learn from them, making our new revamp much better than the original. Our story is seeped in history but new things are always happening so even a brand new character on the site can feel like a part of it.

*LGBT friendly*

- What sort of people would we be if we discriminated? All races/religions and sexualities are welcome on the site and we have a quite large group of them to keep our site spiced up. More are always invited!
