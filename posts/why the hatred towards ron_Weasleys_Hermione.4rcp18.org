Why is it that almost everyone hate the weasley's? I understand precy cause he an evil git, but Rob had more then once proved himself as harry's friend, yes he does get jealous but he usually hides it, the only time he really shown it was in GoF. and in PoA he put his life in line for harry. Yes Hermione is a know it all and is annoying but like Ron has proved that she actually cares about harry. Same with mr/mrs weasley. Ginny does hero wishorship harry but is slowly getting over it..why the hatred?


** I think a lot of it is the movie portrayal of the Weasley's- most of Ron's lines are given to Hermione, and he's used more as a comic relief than an actual character. Movie Ginny is horrible, and while Molly and Arthur obviously mean well their impact on Harry isn't fully explained in the movies.

As far as Hermione, some people just want to watch the world burn, what can I say.

Possibly involves Sirius' will, friendly!Goblins and a couple of lordships. Probably involves everyone betraying Harry, or evil!manipulative!Dumbledore, or at least "weasley bashing, minus the twins", because who doesn't like those cunts? Definitely involves */super secret training/*, generally during the summer, making Harry "the Dark Lord's equal" just in time for school.

** The Weasley's were a drag. They prevented (strong independent) Harry from becoming Wizardking. Ron was "holding" him back. Ginny wasn't "meant" for Harry. Harry needed someone in his league like Fleur or Tonks. Hermione too if she actually look liked Emma Watson and learned to shut up.

Hatred for Hermione is because she didn't choose Harry who was obviously perfect for her, as long as she could be mature enough to be part of his harem. Harry's an Alpha of course and he wouldn't be satisfied with just one woman. Also Hermione was "too" competent and upstaged Harry with her "brains". She should've smiled and stayed quiet and let Harry the Hero do all the heavy lifting. Then after Harry is done saving the day Hermione should be there just eager to give Harry his reward. And by reward I mean sex.

This is not sarcasm. I mean it. All of this is 100% serious.

** I like to think of it as a ripple effect. I didn't feel anything towards Ron in canon, but when I first started reading fanfiction, he became one of my most hated characters because of how much he gets bashed in fanfiction. I've thankfully grown out of it and realized what a good character he is, but I think a lot of people still have that thought process about Ron in the back of their head from all the Indy!Harry fics that run rampant throughout this fandom.

** Well, I am one of those haters (hate that word by the way!), so I will try to explain this from my perspective:

Let's tackle Ron first:

For me Ron Weasley is a friend you can't depend on as he abandons you whenever he's feeling jealous and or inadequat (or when you don't agree with his world view - remember SPEW (not that I like it, but his treatment of Hermione was especially bad almost all the time!)?), he also has a lot of issues (wants to be captain of the Quidditch team, a prefect, head-boy etc. but doesn't put in the work, hell when he gets the badge - that should IMHO have been Harry's - he's still a lazy twit and doesn't take the resposibility seriously, no! As far as I remember he steals from the other students by using confiscated pranking stuff himself!)...in essence IMHO he's the Draco Malfoy of Gryffindor (and I can't but hate him just like I hate Draco who IMHO should be in prison for a long time after the last book!) and lazy, too (look at what subjects he selects as electives and that he lets Hermione basically do his homework!)

=> Note: No, you can't change my mind about him (you might see it different and that's ok, but this is how I view Ron Weasley!)

Ok, the Weasleys next:

I don't like them because firstly I think Molly should work (I have an intense dislike for housewives!), especially in light of the fact that they barely make do, despite Arthur being a senior government official (he's a department head after all!). Also they are irresponsible: Why have so many children in the first place? Haven't they heard of contraceptives? Then there's the favouritism shown in the family: Percy who's a stickler for the rules etc. gets special treatment as does Ginny because she's her mom's little darling! (The Twins, Bill and Charly and even Ron aren't treated all that well, I mean sending a howler to the Great Hall? Come on, shaming your children in public is reprehensible behaviour! Also: Have you ever woundered why Bill and Charly have left home for far away places? Hell, Percy and the twins move out quite quickly, too! IMHO that shows that they don't think the Burrow is the greatest place to be!)...IMHO the Weasleys are just as bad as the Malfoys (they are different, sure but equally as bad!)...also: Molly trying to be Harry's mom (mothering him etc.) always made me dislike her (leave the boy alone, he's more grown up than most of your sons - because he had to be of course - damned! Also it's not up to you what Harry does or doesn't do!). As for Arthur Weasley? We don't know that much about him, but the fact that he is a genius (enchanting that car!) but not intelligent enough to actually talk to an actual muggleborn (except Harry) about his muggle obsession all those years is quite strange. Sadly he seems a whipped kind of guy, too (he has a man-cave: the shed where his muggle stuff is...Molly on the other hand has the whole house!)...so I don't like him much either!

So, finally - HERMIONE:

I dislike her because of her "I know better than you"-Attitude and her bossyness (seriously: Leave Harry alone - is it any wounder he never tried his best with you constantly getting on his case?). Oh and her "You must tell me everything"-Attitude as well (why does she need to know everything, she herself keeps secrets, too so why are other people not allowed the same privilege? Well, they aren't Hermione (in her mind), they are dumb and need help, so they better spill and tell her!). There's also the Fandom's Hermione worship ("smartest witch of her age" - bullshit, she's well read, knowledgeable and intelligent, but she's no genius like Tom Riddle or Dumbledore!) that just makes me dislike her more (she's as flawed - maybe more so - than most other HP-Characters, yet people think she's the best thing since sliced bread!)...

ps: Note: I kind of dislike most of the HP-Characters (strange is it? I don't think so: I like the universe, the characters are just minor annoyances and fanfiction can fix that anyway), especially Harry...damned, success through luck, chance, stupidity and the sacrifice of others (that's how I see Harry, who's a lazy fuck IMHO...I mean I wasn't the best student, but in world of magic? Come on, I would turn into Hermione and learn stuff as fast as I can! Harry though? Well, nope...goofing around and playing quidditch seems more important, even if you have a mass murderer after you, right Harry? Maybe you can outfly him? Challenge him to a game of quidditch? No? What do you mean "No"? - Seems you should be hitting the books then, shouldn't you?)

#+end_quote

He let his jealousy got better of him once throughout the whole 7 books even though Harry was constantly getting praise or gifts he did not work for (e.g. the two broomsticks, the fortune from Sirius, the praise from Slughorn for being brilliant in Potions, etc.). Why should he have to constantly put up with this? I rarely see Harry doing anything at all to make Ron feel better about all this.

#+begin_quote
  (or when you don't agree with his world view - remember SPEW (not that I like it, but his treatment of Hermione was especially bad almost all the time!)?)
#+end_quote

Gross over-exaggeration. True, Ron does have a tendency to speak his mind openly to Hermione, but why is it a bad thing to speak openly to your best friend/girlfriend even though she might not like it especially given Hermione's tendency to be blind to her own faults? When has he ever insulted Hermione on a sensitive topic like her looks or blood status? You might interpret it as bad behaviour, but don't overlook the fact that he deeply cared for her personal life in a way nobody else did.

#+begin_quote
  he also has a lot of issues (wants to be captain of the Quidditch team, a prefect, head-boy etc. but doesn't put in the work, hell when he gets the badge - that should IMHO have been Harry's - he's still a lazy twit and doesn't take the resposibility seriously, no! As far as I remember he steals from the other students by using confiscated pranking stuff himself!)...
#+end_quote

He wants things at the age of 11, true, but why is that bad is beyond me. Doesn't that show he actually values those positive things? No, he actually did work a lot to achieve these things as well. Look at how much effort he put into Quidditch practice even when the Slytherins were singing a song specifically targeting him or the fact he did study a lot to achieve his OWL results. He could do a better job as prefect true and he needed a little reminder from Hermione but that doesn't make him a terrible prefect like Malfoy who actually abuses his position.

No, Harry shouldn't get the badge because he is a much more independent and insubordinate person than Ron is. Look at all those times Harry disobeyed authorial figures or Hermione even though she's right, thus he would care for rules even less than Ron would. Harry in OotP is also too moody and angry all the time to be a good prefect. Really the only advantage he has over Ron is that he was rich and famous.

#+begin_quote
  (look at what subjects he selects as electives and that he lets Hermione basically do his homework!)
#+end_quote

What's so terribly wrong about the subjects he chose? Do we even know that they are easier than the other possible subjects out there? If he really wants an easy subject, he would have chosen Muggle Studies (with help from his best friends who are both raised by Muggles)? I can actually count on my fingers how many times Hermione checked his homework for him and I never remembered a time when Hermione did an entire essay for him so if you remember any examples of it that would be great.

#+begin_quote
  in essence IMHO he's the Draco Malfoy of Gryffindor (and I can't but hate him just like I hate Draco who IMHO should be in prison for a long time after the last book!) and lazy, too (look at what subjects he selects as electives and that he lets Hermione basically do his homework!)
#+end_quote

I know a lot of people try to make Ron as bad as Malfoy but it doesn't make them true and it doesn't make their case more convincing for people who said that. Malfoy is always self-centered and looking at get more glory for himself or to save his own skin while Ron was willing to sacrifice himself to help his friends. If you don't believe, just look at the chess scene in PS or in the shrieking shack in PoA. Remember also that Malfoy is a bigot and who didn't mind people dead as long as he didn't have to be there to see it. He wished that Hermione was dead in CoS and he had no qualms about killing people in HBP as long as it helped to achieve his goals.

=> Note: No, you can't change my mind about him (you might see it different and that's ok, but this is how I view Ron Weasley!)

You're right but it doesn't mean people can't point out why you're wrong.

Ok, the Weasleys next:

#+begin_quote
  I don't like them because firstly I think Molly should work (I have an intense dislike for housewives!), especially in light of the fact that they barely make do, despite Arthur being a senior government official (he's a department head after all!).
#+end_quote

Right. So you hate housewives only because they are housewives even though they did nothing wrong and it's not exactly easy to work while raising 7 children.

#+begin_quote
  Also they are irresponsible: Why have so many children in the first place? Haven't they heard of contraceptives?
#+end_quote

They can have as many children as they want. They did it I believe to try to get a daughter. They loved and cared for all their children even if they are poor and sometime the children doesn't receive all the attention required.

#+begin_quote
  Then there's the favouritism shown in the family: Percy who's a stickler for the rules etc. gets special treatment as does Ginny because she's her mom's little darling! (The Twins, Bill and Charly and even Ron aren't treated all that well, I mean sending a howler to the Great Hall? Come on, shaming your children in public is reprehensible behaviour! Also: Have you ever woundered why Bill and Charly have left home for far away places? Hell, Percy and the twins move out quite quickly, too! IMHO that shows that they don't think the Burrow is the greatest place to be!)...
#+end_quote

OK, Bill and Charlie left the country true to follow their careers because they couldn't do it in the UK. However, you do remember that they came back after to put their lives in danger to fight alongside the family right? It's the same story with Fred and George, even though they weren't living in the Burrow other than around Christmas, they are still deeply loyal to their family. Therefore where is your evidence any of the Weasley brothers other than Percy left because they are sick of their parents? Btw Percy actually stayed at the Burrow for more than a year after he graduated which isn't quickly at all.

#+begin_quote
  IMHO the Weasleys are just as bad as the Malfoys (they are different, sure but equally as bad!)...
#+end_quote

Now I really can't take you seriously anymore. What you are saying is a family who risked their lives to try to rescue the Muggles the Malfoys was torturing is (remember Quidditch World Cup in GoF?) as bad as a bunch of bigoted racists who think everyone who isn't a pureblood scum and Muggle-borns shouldn't be allowed to do magic. The Malfoys are always looking out for their own interest instead of doing what is right. Did you remember how Arthur actually treated Winky the house-elf as a creature with real feelings compared with Diggory and Crouch?

#+begin_quote
  also: Molly trying to be Harry's mom (mothering him etc.) always made me dislike her (leave the boy alone, he's more grown up than most of your sons - because he had to be of course - damned! Also it's not up to you what Harry does or doesn't do!).
#+end_quote

Molly didn't understand that Harry is a really insubordinate and independent person and doesn't want to be told what to do. She could try to understand Harry better sure but it doesn't mean she didn't have good intentions (that boy has suffered a lot to be honest and she wanted to keep him safe) or that she is a horrible person. Lots of parents are like that.

#+begin_quote
  As for Arthur Weasley? We don't know that much about him, but the fact that he is a genius (enchanting that car!) but not intelligent enough to actually talk to an actual muggleborn (except Harry) about his muggle obsession all those years is quite strange.

#+end_quote

Arthur actually did try to talk to Hermione and the Grangers about the Muggle world in CoS and GoF in case you forgot. Arthur could do more to understand the Muggle world and is fascinated with it sure but not understanding a foreign world and has an unusual but harmless hobby doesn't make him a horrible person.

Yes, she's bossy but she generally meant well even though she does think she is the best. I guess how irritating this trait is really varies from person to person. Some people think it's something good, while others think it's terrible. Actually she is really clever for someone at her age. For example, in CoS none of the teachers including Dumbledore figured out what the monster in the chamber was, but she did and she was only 13 years old. Whether she was as clever as Dumbledore or Riddle AT THAT AGE remains an open question and don't have enough evidence one way or the other. I agree with you that people tend to put her on a pedestal while kicking down other characters though.

**** Yes he disobeyed - FOR GOOD REASONS (McGonagall for example is never really helpful and allows bias and bullying (Snape, Draco etc.), same for Dumbledore!)...he saved the stone, saved Ginny's life etc. so he shows a lot of bravery and he's the leader of his year IMHO (so he should get the badge for that reason alone IMHO)

He's moody because Dumbledore hides himself away, because he's tortured by Umbridge (and Snape, I mean those lessons in occlumency were pure mind-rape IMHO), bullied by the Inquisitorial Squad, not suported by many people (a lot of them think he's a lying glory-hog!) and he's got Voldemort in his head (helped along by Snape messing around in his mind and trashing any natural resistance he might have had)

Yeah, Hermione is always right, let's worship Hermione -.- (sorry, but she gets a free pass by the fandom for being quite the awful person a lot of the time (she can't leave well alone, no a griefing person does have to spill their inner most feelings because she's fucking Hermione Granger and always knows best...not to mention that she always follows Dumbledore's orders to a "T"...at first she wants Harry to speak to her and later on she can't even manage a phone-call or a muggle-letter (as if the deatheaters would be able to track those...they don't even know what a postman is probably!), frankly I'd have told her where to stick it and wouldn't have spoken to her other than "pass the salt" for a few weeks (returning the favor of being kept in the dark and cut off!))

Good intentions? - The road to hell my friend, the road to hell -.-

Sure she's not a bad person, but Harry didn't need an overprotective parent - he needed someone who understands him (and nobody really does...sure Sirius tries, but he's really the only one: That's why the loss of Sirius is such a huge blow to Harry - he finally had an adult who he could talk with...and: BAM, Sirius is dead and it's partly his fault (yes, partly: Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Bellatrix are at fault, too!))

Arthur can READ, so why not get a few muggle books (hell, maybe even school textbooks, so he can learn about this strange world!)?

Ginny: Yeah, to get a daughter they could favour above all their sons (she gets new clothes while everybody else wears hand downs!)

The boys came back to fight (probably because their stubborn parents didn't want to pack up and leave - call me a coward but I'd have left ASAP, let Voldemort ruin Britain if he wants to!)

Percy later on left because he was sick of the Dumbledore worship (sure he was wrong in the end, but he was fed up and so he left home!)

Ron isn't self-centered? - Come on, look at his jealousy of Harry ("You asshole have money!" - he might not say it like that, but it's heavily implied...sometimes I think he'd love to trade his family for cash (makes me wounder why there aren't more fanfictions that make him a traitor), while Harry would love to do the reverse (which Ron can't see)) and what he sees in the Mirror of Erised (prefect, headboy, quidditch-captain etc.!)

He did insult Hermione (the "she's a nightmare"-comment (that could have gotten her hurt or killed!), the "Hermione - you're a girl" when he wants to ask her to the ball (it might be his own stupidity, but it's still an insult), hell he goes for Lavender later (who might be an airhead, but she's at least good looking...probably better than Hermione who doesn't much care for her looks and probably doesn't wear much, if any (!), make-up etc.)

ps: Housewives do it wrong IMHO because I've always had working parents and they managed to do the housework while still working (we didn't have a dirty house or anything, nope!)...also housewives are IMHO kind of abusing their husband (he's forced to work, they get to spend his money (often the hubby only gets some "pocket-money"...damned he's not a child and it's his cash!) and often demand that the husband helps around the house, despite them having all the time in the world for domestic chores!)

#+end_quote

Actually his bravery and heroics (which btw Ron has as well possibly even more because he went on those dangerous adventures to support Harry when he did not have to) that came from breaking the rules has mixed results at best. Yes, he did save Ginny with Ron's, Hermione's and Dumbledore's help but he actually endangered the stone in PS because without his interference Quirrell would have been stuck in front of that mirror forever with no ways of getting the stone. He also ignored Hermione's warnings and the fact he could speak with Snape or tried to contact Sirius through the mirror (which is understandable given how upset he was at that time) and went off to the Department of Mysteries -- with disastrous results. I agree with you that he can be a good leader (not always though, see how he endangered the mission in DH at the Ministry when he did something reckless that alerted the Death Eaters) like encouraging Neville to be his best though. However, Ron could be as well -- look at how he was leading the Hocrux quest and encouraging others when Harry was obsessing over the Deathly Hallows for months.

He also broke rules for selfish reasons as well -- sneaking off in PS to duel Malfoy at midnight for example especially considering he already broke one school rule that day or going off to see the Mirror of Erised when Ron already told me to not go. He also sneaked off into Hogesmeade in PoA and sneaked off in the middle of the night to the prefect's bathroom in GoF when he could actually do it during the day. Therefore your claim he broke rules for good reasons is ambiguous at best.

#+end_quote

I agree with you here and I am not criticising him for it. However, there's no denying that he was moody and filled with anger at the beginning of OotP which meant he was <b>not suitable</b> as a prefect which was what we were discussing. Dumbledore also said he didn't want Harry to have any more responsibilities because he already had his hands full that year. His terrible sufferings meant he would have too many personal problems to perform his prefect duties well.

I agree with you here, Hermione has some obvious problems like her lack of tact where emotions are concerned and her belief that she's always right. Her lack of understanding of Harry's feelings has caused quite a bit of friction between them even though Harry is just as much to blame here. I detest that many fans couldn't seem to see her obvious faults and she's shipped with every single character imaginable despite the fact she wouldn't be compatible at all.

She has a blind trust of Dumbledore true but it's not like she's the only person to do it as pretty much all the good guys in the wizarding world worship him which would explain why nobody else thought about giving Harry some information. You can blame her for not questioning the conventional wisdom of the world more, but nothing more.

#+begin_quote
  frankly I'd have told her where to stick it and wouldn't have spoken to her other than "pass the salt" for a few weeks (returning the favor of being kept in the dark and cut off!))
#+end_quote

Harry already told Hedwig to peck her fingers which actually wounded her deeply and as soon as he arrived at Grimmauld Place, he switched into capslock mode and continued to bite her head off even after the Hogwarts term started when she did nothing wrong, isn't that punishment enough already?

  Good intentions? - The road to hell my friend, the road to hell -.-
#+end_quote

Agreed and I agree that Hermione's actions weren't always the best but why is she a terrible person for it? She could correct her actions couldn't she (and she actually did - she was less pushy of the house-elves after OotP)? If you're trying to say she often does bad actions with good intentions then I can understand. You still haven't responded to the fact that Hermione is brilliant and she figured out things like the Basilisk that even Dumbledore couldn't.

#+begin_quote
  Sure she's not a bad person, but Harry didn't need an overprotective parent - he needed someone who understands him (and nobody really does...sure Sirius tries, but he's really the only one: That's why the loss of Sirius is such a huge blow to Harry - he finally had an adult who he could talk with...and: BAM, Sirius is dead and it's partly his fault (yes, partly: Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Bellatrix are at fault, too!))
#+end_quote

I agree that Harry being the independent and insubordinate person he is resented Molly's overprotective attitude even though he really appreciates her in OotP but I'm not sure why does it make Molly a terrible person?

#+begin_quote
  Arthur can READ, so why not get a few muggle books (hell, maybe even school textbooks, so he can learn about this strange world!)?
#+end_quote

Perhaps somethings about the Muggle world cannot be learnt by books and these kinds of books might not be readily available considering how misguided the wizarding world is about the Muggle world but why does his ignorance make him a bad person or make the Weasleys as bad as Malfoys?

#+begin_quote
  Ginny: Yeah, to get a daughter they could favour above all their sons (she gets new clothes while everybody else wears hand downs!)
#+end_quote

OK, so what is the solution? That she should wear boys' clothes to school? Clothes are probably the only new possessions she had though, remember how many second hand books she had to get in her first-year or how she was mending a second-hand textbook at the beginning of GoF? All of her brothers are over-protective of her sure, but isn't that always the case with the youngest sibling?

#+begin_quote
  The boys came back to fight (probably because their stubborn parents didn't want to pack up and leave - call me a coward but I'd have left ASAP, let Voldemort ruin Britain if he wants to!) Percy later on left because he was sick of the Dumbledore worship (sure he was wrong in the end, but he was fed up and so he left home!)
#+end_quote

I raised this point because correct me if I'm wrong you seemed to be implying that Bill, Charlie and the twins left their parents because they couldn't stand them anymore or because their family was too dysfunctional. I'm just pointing out that is not the case because it's normal for grown-up children to move out of their parents' house in any family. Furthermore if the Weasleys were brave enough to fight in a war they didn't have to because they believed that was the right thing to do, doesn't that make them better than the racist and bigoted Malfoys?

Now before I go on I should point out you haven't responded to the point that Ron deeply cared for Hermione's personal life and wellbeing. He also burped up slugs when defending her and defended her against Snape twice even though he got detentions. Why does this make him the same as Malfoy who wished Hermione was killed because of her blood status? You also didn't respond to my observation that Ron did work quite hard in Quidditch and OWL exams btw and achieved quite good results and Hermione wasn't there to do his exams.

#+begin_quote
  Ron isn't self-centered? - Come on, look at his jealousy of Harry ("You asshole have money!" - he might not say it like that, but it's heavily implied...
#+end_quote

Could you provide some evidence from the books to show Ron showed terrible jealousy towards Harry specifically of his wealth?

#+begin_quote
  sometimes I think he'd love to trade his family for cash (makes me wounder why there aren't more fanfictions that make him a traitor)
#+end_quote

Hmm because he actually is a really loyal guy despite being overshadowed by his BFF and you're just imagining things about him? You forgot the fact that Harry would have been willing to share his wealth with the Weasleys but the family would not accept it. Remember Harry was quite willing to share his wealth with the Weasleys and Ron, but they actually declined the offer. Remember how Ron was really eager to pay Harry back for his omnioculars in GoF? If he's as greedy as you implied, why would he go over to the dark side to make money when he could just ask for money from Harry who would be willing to give it to him?

#+end_quote

True neither boy understood the other's problems. It doesn't make either of them scum and you haven't answered why Ron's desires were so terrible.

Finally, I should point out that you claim Ron is self-centred but then ignored that he showed many times he was willing to put himself in mortal danger to protect or help his friends. This includes the chess scene in PS, going into the forest to face his worst fear in CoS, pulling Harry away from the Grim in PoA, standing up to Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, etc. you should get the idea. You didn't respond to this point in your last post either.

#+begin_quote
  He did insult Hermione (the "she's a nightmare"-comment (that could have gotten her hurt or killed!)
#+end_quote

Firstly, what does this has to do with whether Ron is self-centred or not (or you're moving on to another point)? Secondly, to be frank if you look at the context pretty much everyone in their positions would be annoyed at her behaviour at that time. He called Hermione a "nightmare" behind her back when she was being pompous and a stuck-up know-it-all. He actually felt bad about it when he realised Hermione heard him. Did you forget that as soon as he realised she was in danger from the troll, he actually risked his own life to save her even when she wasn't his friend? Who the hell could have predicted there would be a troll roaming the school that afternoon? If you're going to talk about putting people in danger, Harry's, Dumbledore's, Hagrid's and even the twins' actions are far worse. Even Hermione could have got herself and Harry seriously injured in the Forbidden Forest due to her lack of tact at the centaurs.

What he did was stupid no doubt and I agree with you about Hermione usually not wearing any make-up or jewellery other than her watch. However he didn't snog Lavender because she was good looking (if that's what you're saying or are you trying to say he wanted to make Hermione jealous?) but because 1) He thought Hermione believed he's pathetic and couldn't save goals in Quidditch without help and she doesn't really love him, 2) Hermione had a relationship with Krum and hid it from him and 3) He was angered by Ginny's virgin shaming and wanted to show her he could get a girl if he wanted.

#+end_quote

Well, it's not like Molly was lazing around because seeing 7 children growing up and running and maintaining a huge house (for 9 people!) is a huge deal, especially when they were younger and with the twins causing massive mayhem every other day which could be extremely stressful. Arthur was not forced to work, he actually enjoyed his job -- please see Ron's comments in GoF for evidence of this. It's actually not clear who has the harder job here.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Did Molly actually do that? As far as I can remember when Arthur wasn't around work, he was usually in his shed or disciplining the children when they really went too far (like the twins). Could you provide evidence to show where Arthur worked his butt off at home?

Do you have any more evidence for this assertion? We just saw Quirrell staying rooted where he was trying to get the Stone out with no indication of taking the Mirror away. Even if he did he would not get the Stone so nobody could use it which is the point. Dumbledore said only a person who wants to find the Stone but not use it will actually get it. Unless you have evidence Dumbledore is lying we'll have to leave it as it is. You forgot Harry actually endangered the stone because Quirrell could have easily killed him and got the stone off him. The Stone was much more exposed in Harry's pocket than in the mirror.

No, like you said it indirectly caused Sirius' death and it could have easily resulted in a few of his peers getting killed even though it is impressive that nobody else was killed I agree. However the point is he put his friends in mortal danger when he didn't need to and remember it's most likely they would all have been captured if the Order members didn't show up on time. Harry was just about to hand over the Prophecy anyway.

It doesn't matter what you do. It's still a selfish reason for him to go after Malfoy because only he stands to benefit from himself especially as he could have duelled Malfoy during the day.

#+end_quote

Sirius Black, a known killer, was known to have broken into the Gryffindor Tower a short while ago trying to kill him and was likely roaming around Hogsmeade. Remus actually said pretty much the same thing to Harry once he found out about it. It's also true that Harry only broke the rule because he himself wants to have some fun not for a noble reason which is the main point I'm trying to make.

You also ignored the other examples I had where Harry broke the rules to benefit himself. Please respond to or acknowledge them.

In summary the main point I am trying to make is that Harry does break rules for good reasons like you said but he also breaks them for selfish reasons. I don't blame him for it because pretty much all kids could be self-centred at some point or other. If you agree with this point then we can move on.

#+begin_quote
  Harry had his hands full with what? Umbridge? If so: That's Dumbledore's fault (he could have told Harry to retract his statement for example or to stay quiet while Fudge was around (a random dark wizard or the maze could have killed Cedric, it's not as if Harry's wand was used to cast the killing curse, so he'd have been safe!)), that was his battle to fight and he let Harry down here (just like almost every other time...is it any wounder I dislike Dumbledore?)
#+end_quote

I agree with you about Dumbledore should have done a lot more to keep students safe. Hell, the idea that Harry had to compete in the Tournament just because of the Goblet is pretty stupid, why couldn't he have given some other tasks or just made to sit out on purpose? Although I have to say Harry should have been more insistent that he wouldn't compete. My point was that Harry in OotP was suitable as a prefect because his hands were full and because of his dark moods.

OK we can't know for sure whether Dumbledore figured out it was a Basilisk before Hermione because the book isn't from his POV. All we know is that Dumbledore did next to nothing about the Basilisk -- nor did he leave any instructions for other staff members on how they might deal with it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I never said Hermione was on the same level of Voldemort and Dumbledore (she probably isn't despite a lot of her creativities). However we don't know what Hermione was like in her adult life and so we can't reasonably compare their achievements.

#+end_quote

Really? Not allowed? It's reasonable for best friends to consider and worry about each other's problems and offer advice, especially when one of them has a propensity to attract trouble. However I agree with you that Harry don't need to obey Hermione for some moral reason even though I think if he did he would have been better off a lot of times. As for not needed or wanted, remember that without Hermione's advice or help Harry wouldn't actually do that well on his adventures. For example, Harry wouldn't get past that logic potions puzzle in PS, wouldn't know that the monster in the Chamber is a Basilisk, would probably get kissed by the Dementors in PA without her Time-Turner, wouldn't know how to do a Summoning Charm to get past the dragon in GoF, etc. Rowling once said in an interview that “[Hermione] is the most brilliant of the three and they need her. Harry needs her badly.” It's not just myself who thinks this way.\\
She isn't his mother but personally I think it's good for someone to be his voice of reason because he does have a tendency to get himself into trouble either intentionally or unintentionally. Her bossiness and desire to tell others what to do can be annoying even though she does turn out to be right a lot of the times. If you think her bossiness of other people and acting as Harry's mother (even though IMHO he needs someone like this in his life) means she's a terrible person by itself then there's nothing more to say.

Ron might not want her dead and he might not call her a mudblood, but over all he's just as awful to her as Malfoy (Draco is just honest about being an asshole - especially towards muggle born people!) and disregards her opinions etc.

You just agreed that Ron has a good reason to be angry at his family and yet you bash him later on for his jealousy (which you grossly exaggerated) of Harry's wealth? We don't know if adoption is actually possible in the wizarding world and considering how small the community is, there might not be any girls to adopt. There are both pros and cons to having a large family. If you think they should have less kids, then that's your opinion, but it doesn't make the parents terrible people as all of the children are well-fed at least (even Ron who is probably the most neglected) and none of them ended up as losers in life so the parents must be doing a few things right.

Madam Malkin tried to sell Hermione wizards' robes in HBP so robes by gender do exist and don't you think it's rather awkward for a girl to be wearing wizards' robes at Hogwarts? We're going off-topic here my point is Ginny didn't have any more brand new possessions (and we don't even know whether her robes or clothes are second-hand or not!) just because she was a girl. It's most likely Bill and Charlie who had the most new possessions by being the oldest.

OK so you're saying just because Bill and Charlie don't always live in the Burrow even though the family visits them in Egypt and Romania over the holidays mean the family is dysfunctional? Bill and Molly had a disagreement about something inconsequential that mean he can't stand his family, is that what you're saying? So you forgot that Fleur was being snobbish and condescending towards the whole family or do you think that Molly and Ginny are supposed to have no reactions at all to Fleur's rudeness? Ginny called Fleur a nickname behind her back (which Hermione agrees btw) and Molly actually tried to be really civil to her. Remember how touched Molly was when Fleur declared her love for her fiancé and how much effort she devoted to their wedding? Also if you think Molly and Ginny are being terrible hosts, then why are you ignoring the fact that Ron defended Fleur? Why do you remain silent when Ron did something good? Please also respond to what I said in an earlier post given below which you ignored so far. It's normal for grown-up children to move out of their parents' house in any family. However, you do remember that they came back after to put their lives in danger to fight alongside the family right? It's the same story with Fred and George, even though they weren't living in the Burrow other than around Christmas, they are still deeply loyal to their family.

Right, so you're saying someone who doesn't want Hermione dead nor calls her a mudblood is just as bad as someone who does these things. Are you implying that Ron did something just as bad? I would like some examples. What are you trying to say about Malfoy being honest? That Ron secretly hates Muggle-borns? It would be nice to spell out what etc. stands for here because I'm not a mind-reader, otherwise I can only assume you don't actually have anything to add. He disregards her opinions which you provided absolutely no examples? Right then, let's look at some examples where he listened to her: Ron's agreement with Hermione that Harry shouldn't play Quidditch against Hufflepuff in PS when Snape was decided to referee the game, the Stone is safe as long as long as Dumbledore is around, Harry shouldn't go looking for Sirius when they thought Sirius betrayed his parents, to tell Harry to stop lashing out at them in OotP, to implement the DA and help Harry recruit new members, to keep an eye out for Harry when he was having funny dreams with Ron keeping an eye on what Harry is saying and then reporting back to Hermione when necessary, Harry's theory that Malfoy was a Death Eater in HBP, going back to the wedding reception after Voldemort took over the Ministry in DH was not a good idea, going to see Xenophilius Lovegood in DH, continue to look for Horcruxes instead of obsessing over the Deathly Hallows. By the end of DH, Ron even came aboard on Hermione's campaign for more house-elves' rights. A main source of contention between them before HBP was over the house-elves issue. Hermione wanted them free no matter what the elves themselves think. Ron is against it because he saw the elves especially Winky and realised most of them don't want them to be free. Even so, the most he did was to let the elves chose for themselves whether they want to be free or not which actually is a quite liberal position. Finally you haven't responded to anything I said in earlier posts at all. I would like you to respond to my points about Ron sticking up for Hermione against bullies, Ron caring deeply about her personal life, Ron willing to put himself in mortal danger for Hermione including confronting his worst fear in the Forbidden Forest to find a cure for herself and begging a mad woman to torture him instead of her and explain to me why despite everything he did for her Ron is still an awful person to Hermione.

My point is why would Ron become a Death Eater for money when he could take money off Harry if that's what he truly wants? Jealousy unfortunately is quite a normal human reaction. I also should point out he isn't the only person who was jealous over something. Other people include Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Cho, Viktor, Lavender. You also made it sound as though he was jealous and behaved badly all the time when as I said earlier he let his jealousy got better of him once throughout the whole 7 books even though Harry was constantly getting praise or gifts he did not work for (e.g. the two broomsticks, the fortune from Sirius, the praise from Slughorn for being brilliant in Potions, etc.).

  Harry doesn't have as much as the Malfoys (and the other rich purebloods on Voldemort's side!)
#+end_quote

How do you know this? Pottermore said the Potters were pretty damn rich. Sure we don't know exactly how many Galleons each family has but we're pretty certain that Harry had a staggering pile of money considering he inherited two fortunes plus a house.

******** Ron is not a loser? Damned (IMHO he is)

Hey I know why he is jealous, but he knows Harry would give him money if he only ASKS!

Yeah, well fed maybe - but wearing hand downs, using second hand wands (Ron's wand probably held him back just like Neville's wand did!), getting crap for Christmas (sorry, a pullover? How cool...even less if it's in a color his mother should know by now that Ron HATES!)...unless they are no-life swots like Percy (or girls like the favourite: Ginny)

Because I didn't remember (also: I don't like Ron, so I might not have brought it up even then!)

Loyal - YES! Disagreeing with Molly constantly? Yes!

When was that? (them saying they regrett giving Ron dress-robes)

Over all, as I said I only like Bill and Charlie...I don't hate the twins (I think they shouldn't test their products on people and bully people however!) :)

Yes and Draco didn't really want her dead, he just said so (we know he doesn't have the stomach for killing, he can't even kill a weakened Dumbledore and they weren't classmates (he didn't personally know the Headmaster, unlike Hermione))

I didn't say Ron hates muggleborns - but he thinks he's superior to muggles (he confunded his driving-instructor...sorry, but that's not ok, just like deleting your parent's memories isn't, so in a way Hermione also thinks she's a superior being!)

Harry was right to lash out in OoTP :( (they are both bad friends during the summer and even during the year IMHO!)

SPEW! - Enough said (that's one of the main things Ron and Hermione disagree on and it shows a deeper issue in their socialization and upbringing: Ron thinks there's nothing wrong with enslaving houselfs while Hermione hates the very idea!)

I never said Ron didn't defend her (hell: He cheered her on when she hit Malfoy!), but he's still not a great friend (and without Harry there - as a buffer between the two - they would probably drift appart!)

Why is he still awful? Because of the constant fights (come on we have WoG that they wouldn't fit as a couple because Hermione and Ron are both very oppinionated, hell even Ruppert Grint who played Ron in the movies thinks they'd have had a divorce by now!)

Because the brooms are a thing (and he can borrow them from Harry from time to time!) and not actual cash Harry can do what he wants to do with!

I know that jealousy is normal (you don't have to show it or stop talking to people because of it...hell I was jealous of my then best friend (from ages 5 to about 16) because he kind of was Harry (not an orphan but his parents weren't around often and they weren't the most emotionally supportive either) while I kind of was Ron (ok: the difference in wealth wasn't as large, but it was still visible!). Did I constantly show it? No! It might have been obvious sometimes, but I didn't actually cut communications with him etc.)

Still, I think Ron trading wealth for loyalty might not be so much of stretch! (certainly less than some things found in fanfiction - like Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape...damned, makes me barf even writing that :(

Well, did James flaunt his wealth like Draco does? (I don't think so, despite the fact that James was quite spoiled...hell, he was friends with Mr. I-am-poor Remus Lupin!)

#+end_quote

OK, Ron is a loser when he was featured on the Chocolate Frogs cards as a war hero and co-managing the Weasley family joke shop with George and it was making a huge fortune and doesn't require ridiculously high grades in NEWTs? There are evidence in the books that show he does how to do business, which is a kind of intelligence the other 2 doesn't have. Sure he didn't achieve success in the Ministry which is riddled with corruption but doesn't it count for something that he achieved success in another field or you're saying businessmen are automatically losers? Otherwise, could you elaborate on why he is a loser, saying it's your humble opinion doesn't mean it's necessarily right.

#+begin_quote

Then it shows that your opinion on Ron is unreliable because you only see what you wants to see and tries to ignore or downplay everything positive about him. If you disclaim your comments by saying this is your own limited and biased opinion and not make up falsehoods about him (like he could turn evil or he's awful to his friends unless you're claiming being willing to die for them is no big deal) we wouldn't be having this discussion. You're entitled to your opinion but I am entitled to point out why what you said is wrong. Still you haven't responded to my claim that Ron does respect Hermione's opinion.

They can't afford everything brand new with seven children. Sadly speaking a mother who raises seven children will tend to forget things especially when at least one of them is constantly getting into trouble (twins, anyone?). Mothers aren't expected to remember everything about their children perfectly. Percy didn't cause his mother any trouble at that time unlike the twins that was why he was favoured. Why is it so wrong for a mother to favour a son who doesn't cause her so much grief as the others? Do you have some evidence that shows Ginny is favoured above her brothers? I already pointed out Ginny had the same problems with second-hand possessions as Ron so where is your evidence she is favoured? You know Ron has problems in his family and yet that is not enough for you to show him any sympathy? Right. I am STILL waiting to hear you justify your assertion that the Weasleys are as bad as the Malfoys or for you to retract it.

#+begin_quote
  Loyal - YES! Disagreeing with Molly constantly? Yes!
#+end_quote

First you claimed Bill and Charlie are sick of their parents that's why they left and now you're saying they are loyal but disagreeing with Molly constantly? I'm not sure how these two match but OK. By the way you only gave one example of Bill disagreeing with Molly about his earring and that's apparently enough evidence for you to conclude he disagree with her constantly. Right.

The twins weren't pleased with giving Ron dress robes when Molly suggested that she should buy Ron some new dress robes for becoming a prefect in OotP.

#+end_quote

First, if you claim he's like Malfoy you were implying he hates Muggleborns and think they are the same as Muggles because that was one of Malfoy's defining traits. I don't like what Ron did here either but remember he did that because he knows he doesn't have look in the mirrors because of magic not because he thinks he's better than Muggles. How do you know Hermione did what she did without her parents' consent?

#+begin_quote

First, we weren't talking about whether they were bad friends in OotP before so I'm not sure why you bring this up. You made a baseless assertion with no evidence to back it up and then you use IMHO which doesn't make what you said any more correct. I saw Ron and Hermione apologising for not being able to tell Harry what was going after he lashed out the first time in Grimmauld Place (even though almost he had extensive help from his friends to accomplish so his rant was factually wrong) and after he asked Hedwig to peck them out. I also saw how they defended him against people who don't believe in him like Seamus and Lavender and waited for him with Murtlap Essence to try to cure his hands even when he didn't know how to restrain his temper. When Hermione tried to express her own opinion about Hagrid's teaching Harry forbid her from doing it. There are also the times when Hermione tried to clear his name through the interview with Skeeter and both Ron and Hermione worried about him constantly with his Occlumency lessons and Harry repaid their care by insulting Ron about his Quidditch skills.

#+end_quote

Ron was not against house elves being freed as a general idea have you not been reading what I said? He was against the idea of freeing them against their will like what Hermione was doing at that time. There is a difference between the two. He had nothing against Dobby, a free elf, and even gave him a sweater in GoF showing he liked him and this comes from someone who hates free elves? When Hermione hid her clothing amongst rubbish in OotP, he did not remove the clothes from where the elves might pick them up, but merely removed the rubbish so the elves can make a decision for themselves whether they want to be free. You also forgot that Ron was the one who remembered the house elves and was concerned for their safety in the Battle of Hogwarts so even if they had disagreements about the issue it was resolved.

#+begin_quote
  I never said Ron didn't defend her (hell: He cheered her on when she hit Malfoy!), but he's still not a great friend
#+end_quote

You agreed Ron defended her a lot and claimed he's still as awful as Malfoy to her and he's as bad as Malfoy? Unless he did something worse than Malfoy which you provided no evidence for, that seems like a contradiction. Then you go on to claim that how much danger Ron put himself in because of Hermione (including facing his worst fear and getting tortured among other things which you never acknowledged yet) still meant he is not a great friend (which you provided one point to support it, namely their arguments which I will deal with it below). You have an unrealistic expectation of what makes a great friend then because there isn't that many people willing to die for you even if they might not exhibit perfect behaviour all the time. I have already mentioned this in the last few posts and yet you kept choosing to ignore what I said.

I want you to respond to why Ron is not a great friend or an awful person when he deeply cared for Hermione's personal life and when he complimented her excessively and put up with her temper when she was stressed from the OWLs.

#+begin_quote
  (and without Harry there - as a buffer between the two - they would probably drift appart!)
#+end_quote

I would like you to provide evidence to show how Harry helped them resolve their problems or acted as a buffer in another way. Saying they would ‘probably drift apart' by itself is just an assertion with no evidence to support it unless you can provide the evidence to show why especially considering how much time they spent together without Harry and perfectly capable of having fun or working towards a common goal.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Draco spoke his wish of Hermione dying with a relish and he stated that wish 3 times and you're claiming he didn't want her to die just because he couldn't kill anyone directly? I would like to see more evidence from you justifying this assertion. Yes, Draco wasn't able to kill anyone directly. However he had no issues with other people dying in order to accomplish his mission (Katie with the necklace, Ron with the poisoned mead, handing Harry to Voldemort in the RoR, Crabbe killing Ron and Hermione) so stop taking passages out of context.

  Why is he still awful? Because of the constant fights
#+end_quote

This one reason is enough for you to outweigh how he was willing to die for her, how much he cared for her and how much he complimented her on her brilliance? OK.

If he's so awful, then why does Hermione spend so much time alone with him without Harry? Please respond.

Most of the arguments are started by Hermione who is a far more argumentative person than Ron when you look at how many arguments they each start with others like Harry. Ron simply argues back more often than Harry who tends to ignore her and just why does Ron speaking his mind openly to his friends' means he's awful you still haven't responded to me. Bickering and arguing are not the same as fights is that clear? For them, the arguments are simply like ways to pass time and to exchange ideas like about Snape and they really don't see anything wrong with them themselves (like how offended they were when Harry rudely told them to stop when he had no rights to do it) so why do you come in and distort what the arguments are about I don't know. It's also because of unresolved sexual tension, clear?

#+begin_quote
  (come on we have WoG that they wouldn't fit as a couple because Hermione and Ron are both very oppinionated, hell even Ruppert Grint who played Ron in the movies thinks they'd have had a divorce by now!)
#+end_quote

Whether they work as a couple is very different from whether they are great friends so what you said doesn't prove anything about their friendship clear?

Also you know we're talking about Ron not his romantic relationship with Hermione which is somewhat off-topic. Yes, I know people who don't like Romione will distort and misrepresent how much they fight. Could you list all the bickering/fights they had in the second part of HBP and DH when their relationship matured that were not under the influence of the Horcrux? I found one bickering session they had at Grimmauld Place over the deluminator, and that's it.

Where is your evidence that Rupert Grint said that you claimed he said? Give me the quote and link to a reliable source. Also even if they did divorce why does that make Ron specifically a terrible friend automatically?

I hate those ships as much as you do even though it's off-topic. However, your first statement is a baseless assertion ignoring how much Ron cared for Harry even when they were fighting. You still haven't responded to why would he turn to dark side for money when he can ask for money from Harry which you already acknowledged is true and which he knows.

  I know that jealousy is normal (you don't have to show it or stop talking to people because of it...hell I was jealous of my then best friend (from ages 5 to about 16) because he kind of was Harry (not an orphan but his parents weren't around often and they weren't the most emotionally supportive either) while I kind of was Ron (ok: the difference in wealth wasn't as large, but it was still visible!).

Broomsticks weren't the only thing Harry got that he didn't work for it. Try to refute the other examples I gave like Harry using the HBP book and passing it off as his work or the massive fortune he inherited. Even if it's just broomsticks it's not like Harry will let Ron play Quidditch using his Firebolt right (which gave him a SIGNIFICANT advantage over Ron's Cleansweep) which is the main purpose in the wizarding world for getting good broomsticks?

#+begin_quote
  Well, did James flaunt his wealth like Draco does? (I don't think so, despite the fact that James was quite spoiled...hell, he was friends with Mr. I-am-poor Remus Lupin!)
#+end_quote

Not flaunting one's wealth does make mean you are poorer than someone who does. Plenty of extremely wealthy people don't it because they know it's wise to not flaunt the fact that they are rich. Draco is a spoilt brat who thinks he should be the king of Hogwarts so he boasts about everything he has that's better than others which is actually quite stupid. Otherwise you haven't provided any evidence that James isn't as rich as Malfoy (and even if they do, does it change the fact they are both really rich) like what I asked you to do in the last post. Being charitable to a friend doesn't mean anything in terms of how rich you're compared with someone who isn't charitable.

EDIT: I did some online searches and seem to have found the article that reported Rupert's Grint's words about Ron and Hermione's future on Huffington Post and I am not convinced at all because of the following reasons.

First, if you read the interviewer's question, the question asked was “where you'd like your character to be off to” and NOT how you think the character will end up in their future so it's an entirely subjective question. The interviewer even said in the introduction that they “joked about the characters' future, which goes into dark territory for Ron and Co”. If that's not enough to convince you, Grint even joked about Ron living by himself and unemployed which contradicts the fact Ron is a very extrovert person and he was working in a joke-shop with George.

Finally, even if Grint did think the Weasley marriage is a failure without any back-up evidence it doesn't make him right. I don't want to continue discussing this marriage here because it's off-topic so if you want we can start up another discussion thread.

You also showed how the lying media articles printed by other sources could easily sway people who neither bothered to read the whole interview nor examined its context.

In summary, over the course of our discussion you have very few relevant arguments that are based on truth as given in canon. When there is something that you cannot respond, you tend to go off-topic (we are not talking about Ron and Hermione's marriage) or use strawman arguments (like Ron getting the prefect badge or how the Weasleys and Hermione are perfect when I never made that claim) or completely ignore them (how much Ron cares for Hermione and willing to die for her for example). When you do respond to something, you have tendency to make unjustified assertions (Bill and Charlie leaving the UK because of their family, Ron and Hermione being bad friends to Harry in OotP which justifies his horrid behaviour) or take things out of context (the bickering between Ron and Hermione, Molly's dislike for Fleur) You also like to make completely unjustified assertions and then cover them up with the meaningless IMHO. Opinions can also be separated into ones based on facts and ones that are not and your opinions make as much sense as saying ‘Voldemort is not such a bad guy IMHO' or ‘the Death Eaters have done nothing wrong IMHO'. However I guess I really should not have expected anything better from haters.

*** I am presuming you meant Hermione would continue to a Muggle college? If so, may I ask if Hermione prefers the Muggle society over the wizard society why doesn't she drop out of Hogwarts to go to a Muggle school or go and live in the Muggle world after Voldemort was dead? It's also highly doubtful Muggle college would accept her if she does not show any evidence that she went to a Muggle high school even if she is brilliant.

  It's not a matter of her "preferring" one to the other. As to why she goes to a school of magic instead of a muggle school, well I would think that's quite simple: You don't get to go back to Hogwarts if you turn it down.
#+end_quote

I am under the impression that Hermione went to Hogwarts because she would not fit in the Muggle world based on what we know about her personality at the beginning of PS. Her bossiness and lack of social skills would be very alienating to the Muggle children in her school and the fact that she must have had a few magical accidents like Harry and all other Muggle-raised children didn't help either.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione knows that she can go to Hogwarts and then later to college. I think that she is the type of person to put a lot of value into both educations, and I think that she would still have a desire to go to college - especially considering that there is no magical college.
#+end_quote

That's an interesting theory. However, considering that Rowling did give lots of details about what each of the main characters did after DH do you know any interviews that said Hermione went to a Muggle college (and please show me the link if possible)? All I remember is that she went back to Hogwarts to finish her NEWTs then started working in the Ministry pretty much straightaway mainly because she wanted to improve the conditions of magical creatures like house-elves which is not something that can be done in the Muggle world.

#+begin_quote
  Either Hogwarts forges muggle documents for muggle-borns OR the muggle government is much more involved than we think.
#+end_quote

Yes, I think it's rather easy for Hogwarts to forge Muggle documents and it's probably not exactly difficult for Muggle-borns to obtain documents like passports and other IDs legitimately. No, I don't think the Muggle government is involved with Hogwarts because we know from Hermione that Muggles wouldn't actually be able to see Hogwarts other than as the ruin of a castle with a large warning sign at the front.

#+begin_quote
  Afterall, is all these muggle-born students were never registered at a school then the government would fine the parents, and then eventually take the children away.
#+end_quote

Do you have anything to show this is actually what happened? When Harry went off to Hogwarts the Dursleys just told everyone that he went to a school that he clear did not go to and I don't remember the Dursleys getting any trouble for that.

#+begin_quote
  Remus works jobs in the muggle world all the time.
#+end_quote

OK that's interesting because I never knew that Remus worked in the Muggle world after he started studying at Hogwarts. Where in the books was this said or was it in one of Rowling's interviews? The only time where this could have happened is between the end of the First Wizarding War and when he became the DADA Professor in PoA. Correct me if I am wrong but all I can remember is that Remus couldn't find a stable job during these years and he kept changing jobs around that time because he only stayed in a job as long as his lycanthropy was kept a secret. As soon as his condition was discovered, he had to quit the job and look for a new one. It doesn't sound like Muggles would be able to discover a werewolf. I agree with you though that if he did work in the Muggle work, he would need Muggle documents which isn't exactly difficult to obtain with magic.
