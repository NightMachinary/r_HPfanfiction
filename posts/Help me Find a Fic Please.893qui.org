I have been looking for a fic that I read a while a go. So here is how it goes somehow Harry Potter ends up on the doorstep of Dimension traveling witch. She takes his scar for a clay Catman and passage through dimensions. He ends up in Crazy places and it archived in his journal but not actually written in a journal style. In the journal it has helpful advice and pictures from the people he meets .He goes to such places as the Pokemon Universe Gotham City and he was in a wartime Britain and lots of other things I'm I'm pretty sure it slash. Later on he goes to Hogwarts and only travels during the summer. He meet the mother of magic and young merlin in one of these travel. He also goes to the Mummy verse. So if you can find it leave a comment or pm.

Edit: I think I found the name of the witch it more than likely YÅ«ko Ichihara.


** This fic sounds either amazing or terrible and I'm not sure which...
