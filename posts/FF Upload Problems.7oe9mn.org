Is anyone else having issues uploading documents in the Doc Manager on FanFiction.net or is it just me? I'm getting an error message saying "File Upload Problem."


** Yep, same. A workaround is to export one of your existing chapters to the Document Manager, then replace the text in it with your new content and add it as a new chapter. That's what I've just done!

*** I wonder if anyone else is having problems with this. But I like your method! Thanks!
