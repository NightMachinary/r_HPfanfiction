For all his faults, Dumbledore's rather convoluted plans panned out: Harry died, but then 'got better' and Voldemort lost. But Dumbledore himself admitted that he was relying on conjecture and guesswork for a lot of it, he was simply very good at such things.

Assuming the following, what conclusions and theoretical resultant course of action you can come up with, if you were Dumbledore circa November 5th '81 (after Sirius's arrest, and the Longbottoms' torture):

- AD isn't an evil dark lord.

- He didn't know Sirius was innocent. (this would violate the detail above)

- He /does/ know that Harry has a piece of Riddle's soul and has become a Horcrux

--------------

Not /just/ looking for your best plans, but also your most amusing, your most ridiculous, and your most misguided while still technically correct based on what he knew at the time.

Also, let me know if there's anything else that I should include in the list of important known facts above.


** Not quite a riff on your comments, but this is technically canon: Harry Potter is the Dark Lord. Trelawney's prophecy proves it:

#+begin_quote
  The One. With the power to vanquish, the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who thrice defied. Him, born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord... Will mark? Him? As his equal? But He will have *power.* The Dark Lord knows. Not “And either must die at the hand of the either for neither can live while the other survives.” The one with the power to vanquish, the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.
#+end_quote

Sybil's prophecy was given orally, not written. As such, punctuation is ambiguous.

*** You could do it more simply:

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish, the Dark Lord approaches.
#+end_quote

And then infer "him" as referring to Lord V. Even prophecies can't bear to name him directly. Harry Potter will mark Lord V as his equal, and Lord V will have power that Harry knows not, while Harry will have the power to vanquish.

You know you're looking for someone who was born at the end of July. You can determine whether it's Harry by taking him to the Department of Mysteries and seeing if he can grab the prophecy sphere. Same with Neville and, well, everyone born in the second half of July. And the second half of the seventh month after Trelawney gave her prophecy. And the second half of any month that seems like it could be reasonably considered "the seventh month" until you have someone who can lift out the prophecy sphere.

Okay, Harry and Neville are your prime suspects, so you get it in one. You believe that Harry will become a Dark Lord and also that he can vanquish things, possibly Lord V. So he's your best bet for killing him, and you'd best ensure that he gets that ability fast while being weak enough to be killed in turn. Ideally Voldemort and Potter would kill each other.

Unfortunately, you know that Lord V has to return at least partially for Harry to mark him as his equal. So instead of just handing toddler Harry the Sword of Gryffindor and a pint of basilisk venom and pointing him at the gathered horcruxes, you've got to keep him alive. And you know he's going to be a dark lord, but you want him to be as powerless as possible -- or failing that, as obvious a dark lord as you can make him. Child abuse is a tool -- it tends to produce maladjusted people, people who are less likely to trust or turn to others and thus will not produce much of a following. Hopefully.

Oh, there are other means at your disposal, but they're not the easiest to enact. You want to ensure that Harry never turns against you -- if he's not too suspicious and he's sufficiently compliant, you might get him to take an Unbreakable Vow not to turn against you. A sensible precaution in any case.

You also want to tell him, from a young age, that he's only placed in his abusive household because of Lord V. Make it so he focuses as much anger and attention as possible on that enemy. This won't be easy, though.

Also consider experimenting with long-lasting poisons that can be suppressed with food supplements, so if Harry goes off leash you can take care of him. But this is tricky because Harry's going to spend a fair bit of time away from environments you control.

*** That's... interesting... I suppose that the commas and periods could be inferred from when Sybil chose to breathe... but yeah, that works.

Okay, that's not quite what I expected but it's perfectly within the rules I outlined. What does Dumbledore do then, if he opts for this reading?

*** You mean to say that the actual prophecy isn't written in the books directly in Trelawny's voice? Isn't it written when they view a pensieve memory of it? Or when Harry hears it from that prophecy orb? Do you mean to say that the reveal of the prophecy in the books came from somebody else? (i.e. Dumbledore speaks it, and thus, is open to what you're implying)

**** What he meant is that Trelawney simply spoke the prophecy rather that writing it down. Thus by rearranging the punctuation you can have the exact same words take on a different meaning.

** My pet conspiracy theory not explicitly disproved by canon: Ron did not open the Chamber of Secrets by imitating Harry. Hermione did, but she used Dark Arts to do it, so she covered it up.

What actually happened was that Hermione knew a Dark ritual (or Potion with minimal brewing time and requirements, intended to be used immediately upon synthesis, for you purists) that granted temporary Parselmouth abilities. Its ingredients were the larynx of a living snake, which she had brought with her for just such an eventuality (because with her Undetectable Extension Charm, she was not lacking for space), and a larynx of a living human, obtained from a random student who had to be sacrificed for the greater good, and whose death was later blamed on the Death Eaters. Having opened the Chamber, she obliviated Ron and implanted a false memory of him making hissing noises at the sink.

Even stipulating that Harry's senses and memory are perfectly reliable, this is not disproved by canon: Harry only learned about the events in question second-hand, so he could have simply been lied to.

** If we say that Charlus Potter and Dorea Black are James Potter's parents, Harry and Sirius are second cousins. [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/blackfamilytree.html]]

I've seen a good amount of evidence that could suggest it (Dorea Black would've had James at about 40 and would be dead before Harry was born). However, Rowling said that James' parents died old (57 isn't old). Then again, Rowling has said that she's bad at math. It could go either way.
