I'm interested in fics similar to Six Pomegranate Seeds (and its sequel).

I wasn't looking for specific pairings, and this fic appeared to provide a well-written plot with fascinating detail and intrigue regarding the inner workings of wizarding society.

I also particularly enjoyed the unconventional twist on Slytherin!Hermione, so anything in this vein is also welcome.

** OKAY. WOW. Thank you so much for posting about this story. I've spent the last three days doing nothing but reading it and its sequel. That was glorious. It's definitely going on my reread list. The only thing I can remotely think of as being relatively similar and complex and well thought out is '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]' But I think that's one of the famous ones so you might have read it...? If you haven't, I have to admit the caveat that it isn't finished, but what's there is *great* :))

*** Ooooo I haven't read it, but I try to avoid unfinished works if they haven't been updated within 6 months of my finding it. I'll still give Applied Cultural Anthropology a go.

Thank you for the recommendation, and I'm glad that you enjoyed Six Pomegranate Seeds as much as I did!
