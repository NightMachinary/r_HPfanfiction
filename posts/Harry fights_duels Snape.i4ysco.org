I'm looking for any fanfic where harry puts up a fight against Snape, preferably when he confronts him right after snape kills Dumbledore. It isn't necessary for harry to win the duel/fight but I do want him to put up a better fight than he did in the books and he can more or less hold his own against snape.


** "You coward!"

"You dare call me that!?"

"Yes, come here and face me like man. You slimy pale butthole face with greasy hair!"

"Very well, Potter." Snape sneered, "Since, you're so eager!"

The potions professor turned to face the boy. He threw a black curtain of hai back in a stylish manner and the time seemed to stop around him. Even the fire in the castle behind them seemed to be staring at them.

"This was ought to happen sooner or later," Harry prepared himself.

"I wouldn't be that excited if I were you. You irreverent whiny prat."

"You are going to pay for everything you have done. You slimy bat!"

"You're as useless as your father, Potter. He was unable to keep his face out of his arse as he was unable to protect his family."

"Shut up you git! You---you-- empty-headed animal-food-trough wiper!" replied Harry, "I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.‚Äù

"Four-eyed buffoon!"

"Lonely wanker!"

"Talentless Dunderhead!"

"Unclogger nose!"

"Drama queen!"

"Crying Friendzoned tosser!"

A loud uproar was heard before Snape could reply. They had an audience now. THe whole school body seemed to be behind Harry's back, while the Death Eaters were supporting Snape.

Hagrid stepped forward, "Knock this childish words already! The both of ye!" he thundered, "Are ye going to fight or what?!"

Both sides of the crowd yelled in support of Hagrid's words, they were turning impatient. Someone was passing a hat with bets already and McGongagall had pulled her sleeves back and was directing the crowd in a single war cry "FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!" they were all saying.

"Come on Harry, too much talk already!" Hermione complained.

"Yes, stop being a pussy!" Ginny agreed.

"Okay Potter, enough chat." said Snape, "It is on!"

"It is indeed," Harry turned to him.

"Its time for the..." Snape started...

"D-D-DD-DUUUUUUEEEELLLLLLL!!!!" Both yelled at the same time, as they took out their dueling disks and decks.

And the whole crowd roared as the first monsters were placed in defense position and the trap cards were laid. It was too much excitement, for a fan in the crowd let some foam out of his mouth as he threw his hands up then passed out before the fight, just of sheer excitement. Sluhorn was fangirling not far away. The duel was going to define who was the more manliest of these two once and for all. Hogwarts and Dumbledore's body -- which was 7 feet away from the battle -- would bear witness to it.
