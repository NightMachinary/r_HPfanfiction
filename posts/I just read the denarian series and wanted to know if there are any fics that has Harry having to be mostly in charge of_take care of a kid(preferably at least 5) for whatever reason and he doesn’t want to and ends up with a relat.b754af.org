#+TITLE: I just read the denarian series and wanted to know if there are any fics that has Harry having to be mostly in charge of/take care of a kid(preferably at least 5) for whatever reason and he doesn’t want to and ends up with a relationship similar to what Harry and Amaris have.

  Harry Dresden has taken a lot of blows to the head over his career, and woken up in a lot of interesting places, but... aboard the Hogwarts Express in the body of an eleven-year-old boy with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead? Yeah, that's a new one. Most people, they'd just enjoy the ride, but Dresden has read the books, and he REALLY doesn't like dark wizards...
