I'd really love any and all fics you guys recommend wherein someone else is Harry's father, or he gets adopted by a fatherly figure.

Sirius, Snape, and Lupin are all totally good.

I'd really prefer if it were teen Harry rather than kid!fic

The longer the better, but definitely quality over quantity. I don't particularly care about ships at all, but I'm not a huge draco/harry fan so if that's the central point of the fic it'll be a pass from me, dawg.

Thanks guys!


** Some of these are more esoteric than others, and YMMV, but here you go:

- Linkffn(When In Doubt, Obliviate): Harry is "adopted" Lockhart, goes about as well as you would expect.
- Linkffn(What You Leave Behind): doesn't happen (or be realized at least) until later on, but you definitely see its effects on Harry.
- Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): Snape is more or less made into Harry's foster father here, and its as complicated and painful for them as one would expect from canon characterizations
- Linkffn(Accidental Animagus): admittedly the premise is mainly Harry being a cat animagus to solve all the canon-problems far too easily, but its still decent if nothing else.
- Linkffn(The Darkness Within by kurinoone): adopted is a bit of a stretch here, and this fic has a rather poor history (look up A Shattered Prophecy if you're interested), but basically Voldemort raises and brainwashes Harry.
- Linkffn(Learning to Breathe): a real old one, and somewhat dated, but have you ever seen Full Metal Panic? Well this fic is sort of that, with Sirius raising Harry into basically a supersoldier (in an almost hilarious subversion of the whole training/OP Harry fics).
- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): Harry eventually gets taken in by the Longbottoms, with various mentor/father figures beginning with but not limited too Snape.
- Linkffn(Hail Odysseus): only really seen in flashbacks, but Harry was raised by Grindelwald mostly after ~10-11.
