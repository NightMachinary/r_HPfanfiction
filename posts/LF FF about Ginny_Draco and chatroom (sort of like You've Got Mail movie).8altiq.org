I read a long time ago one ff about Draco and Ginny. They were talking to each other in chat room and they didnt know with whom they were talking to. GinnyÂ´s nickname was Firefly, I think. But then Draco found out and Ginny finally found out at party or something.

I think it is old ff, maybe even 8-10 years.


** Is it one of these?
