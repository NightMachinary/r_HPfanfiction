I just discovered this sub a couple of days ago - and although I've never read fanfiction of any kind before, I'd be interested in some quality extensions to the canonical HP universe.

Is there a generally agreed list of good works and/or particular order of reading? Maybe I could get a clue from lurking the sub more than I have, but only half of the abbreviations I'm seeing seem intuitive as to what they mean, etc... :-)

NSFW doesn't bother me, but it's not explicitly what I'm looking for. (IOW I'm not searching for HP porn.) I'd really just like to be able to read a bunch more stories about the characters and events in that universe.

Can anyone point me to a good place to start and/or commonly accepted list?

Thanks!

*Edit: Well I see there is a rather thorough Wiki. Still, any pointers or etc are welcome!*

*Edit2: Thanks a lot for the continued suggestions. Thread is saved, and I'll work through everything that's here, eventually.*


** If you'd be interested in a series set in the HP universe with a similar tone to the original books, but with all original characters and setting, I recommend you check out the Alexandra Quick series. The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]].

Some info about the kind of things you like to read would be helpful for giving better recommendations. What genres do you like? Is canon compliance important? Are there any characters you particularly like?

Thanks, I'll definitely do so!

I've been reading scifi and fantasy more or less exclusively for about the past 30 years, so anything HP should fit OK. :-) I'm not a fan of Urban Fantasy, despite that you could argue there are some elements of that to HP...

#+end_quote

I just figured it would be the easiest place to start. I don't think I'll turn my nose up at much in the way of deviation. Though if someone has written a story with some *major* change, such as Dumbledore is still alive after he should be, I'm hopeful that they'll explain it in a way that doesn't break the fact that it's pretty clear that we are supposed to believe he's dead.

I pretty much like them all. *Edit: I fucking love Hagrid.* I'm a particular fan of Ron, and except for being sympathetic to Snape I really never found myself feeling much of a bond with the various Slytherin characters - but that wouldn't stop me from reading a book that centered on them. I really want to find good writing more than to dictate what it has to have. :-)

Thanks for the suggestion and help!

Try any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northrumbian's]] stuff. They are the best authors who write strictly canon compliant stuff.

** Don't limit yourself to strictly canon-compliant. There's far more AU or AU-like fics than there are canon-compliant fics, and thus there are far more /good/ AU fics than there are /good/ canon-compliant ones.

**** Yeah, I guess so. For me, the joy of fanfiction is seeing the characters confronted with different, non-canon situations, and then responding to them in their own unique way, OR (in some cases) changing a character's personality (slightly or drastically) and seeing how the other characters react to that. An example of the first that I love a ton is "Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen" by The Mad Mad Reviewer, and a truly spectacular example of the second is "Time Heals All Wounds" and its sequels by brightsilverkitty.

** If you prefer canon then this seems to come highly recommended: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]]

Asides from that, if you have a specific pairing or scenario you are interested in we can recommend some other stuff.

*** Thanks very much! Over time I may care less about it being canon, but I'm starting out in the shallow end. :-)

No real preferences other than it being an enjoyable read... Thanks a lot!

** Well there is a series I quite like which is the Darkness Within series. It is AU however, but I highly recommend it even though it is a long read. There are 3 main stories and one side story that is a must read if you enjoy the first 3. After you've read those there a plenty of one shots about the universe of this series written by the author (Kurinoone). I recommend reading the series in this order:
