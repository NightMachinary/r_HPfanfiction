I'm stuck on a time travel kick. I've read What's Her Name in Hufflepuff and To The Next, but i can't seem to find anything around the same genre!!! Please help!! I don't even care if it has mary-sue attributes at this point, I just wanna read some good time travel plots.


** Please, when you mention a story, link it. I know about “What's Her Name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes” linkffn(13041698), but what's the other story?

Oh, right. “To The Next by queenfirst” linkffn(12560378)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  "To the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure" --- Albus Dumbledore. Pretty words, yeah, but she didn't expect them to be so damn literal. Sorta-SI/OC.

  She didn't want to die, so she took the deal that was offered to her. And that's how her story as Marlene begins: armed with Ravenclaw's diadem, burdened with knowledge of the book series, and guided by the snooty Helena Ravenclaw, she must save the McKinnon family from their terrible fate. Book-reader-in-marauder-era.

** Hi! I'm writing one right now! Ted Tonks has a little sister who goes on a horcrux hunt.

linkao3(The Mudblood of Slytherin)

There's also the Reader on ffn, but only about 1/3 of it is at Hogwarts. The other 1/3 is during the first wizarding war and the last is during the second.

  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.
