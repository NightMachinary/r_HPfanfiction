** I can't get into this story,even after reading about three quarters of it. To my mind, the story keeps changing direction and the characters change personalities for no obvious reason.

The start is fine. It's unusual but it drew me in nicely.

Then he's at school and suddenly has a fear of women. Then he sets lethifolds on his teacher. Then he's over his problems and... Oh just other stuff.

Things happen then get retconned into the story later. There doesn't seem to be any direction, and the characters are unlikeable.

It's very well-written but frankly not very enjoyable.

** I've only read a little bit of it. It's well written, but I found most/all of the characters extremely unlikeable.

I need someone to root for in a story. I can't deal with it if every single character irritates me in some way.

**** Well, for me, I had to quit after Harry started torturing puppies with crucio. Really, if I see Harry doing that shit, I'd beat the shit out of him. Violently. If anyone here thinks that's not an unlikable quality, you are a seriously messed up individual.

** I really gave this my best shot, but stopped following a couple months ago or something. It does have a lot going on, but for some reason, I'm just not invested in it. The tone feels off, and the fic just feels like such a downer, and the characterization feels too different, contributing to a weird, generic YA vibe rather than anything unique. I found it boring the way that the shadowhunters tv show was boring.

I've read some real downers like Saving Connor, but those had a relentless pace. This just leaves threads to be picked up much much later, and I didn't have the patience for it.

** While I agree that it‘s well written, has an interesting setting and is quite enjoyable, I have one problem with the fic that causes some sort of annoyed frustration whenever it comes up. I'm simply going to call it “Harry and female characters”.

I can't believe I'm the only one feeling pretty exasperated about this. The early issues Harry had with females in general (thank god those are mostly over by now) feel like some weird adaption of an anime-premise and came up way too often to count as somewhat cringy comic relief. And even now I usually scroll over a paragraph or two when it comes to Daphne obsessing too much or using her /special ways/ to get what she wants, preferably sleeping in the same bed with Harry. /wink wink nudge nudge/ much. And of course Harry is this weird mix between gentleman, sheep and (pretending to be?) clueless that means nothing will get sorted out anytime soon.

Maybe it's just me overreacting to a pet peeve, but that's the one aspect of the writing that I really don't think is well done in any way. It's really annoying, because it prevents me from enjoying the actual story as much as it deserves.

*** While it can be viewed that way, it's exactly what a 13 yo would do to get what she wants. While in the beginning it was quite annoying, it hasn't come up much as of late.

He has a serious crush on his teacher but doesn't know how to deal with it because he doesn't trust her enough, from my interpretation. Regarding the teacher though, the beginning of book 3 from her PoV is contraditory to the rest of her character throughout the series. It's almost obvious she's Grindelwald's granddaughter, but from the early two volumes it seems she has some attachment to harry (not romantic, I don't think. Perhaps if he was her age) and that he is her only option as mentioned in the dementor trial chapter. However, at the start of B3 she says she is just using him for fun and that there are other options, making her seem like a little bitch.

**** It didn't seem to me like he was her "only option" in general, more like she had some goal that she wanted to achieve and Harry was the only option for that specific goal (whatever it is) and also happens to be quite interesting. After the events of the first two books she considers dropping Harry because being involved with him is so troublesome, and then remarks that the two years were a waste because Harry didn't turn out like she expected, but it would be even more of a waste to drop him now.

** I agree it's well written technically, but it has problems.

- There is a lot of noise. Useless noise at that. Like a third of the story could be cut with no consequence.

- The plot is convoluted. This ties into the previous point, the writing is just missing clarity. The author almost seems to write in tangents. All of the plot points should have been forshadowed better, because the reader goes through a lot of detail of dubious quality and the important stuff falls through the cracks.

- Most of the characters are unlikeable and annoying. Case in point, Daphne's pov for the last couple of chapters was like nails on chalkboard. I do think he nailed the voice of a vapid teenage girl (in that you want to clobber her) but I couldn't sympathize with her at all, even though I'm supposed to (dead dad & all). I won't even get into Harry inadvertently killing 250.000 people and not giving much of a shit.

- This one is subjective, but the things I want to read about are just not expanded upon. I.e how the ministry situation, the foreign aurors, Voldemort, Harry's magic, Hogwarts politics. A lot of "mysteries" the author introduced were kinda put in the fridge and forgotten. It's been 400k words (that's 4-5 novels, lol) and a lot of plot points should have been explained by now, unless he author intends to reach like a million.

So yeah, in summary, this story really had the potential to be great but it stays firmly in the simply "good" category because of poor structure.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

****** He did his best to solve the problem, yes, but he wasn't in any way remorseful about it. He's a sociopath. This is literally no different than The Mind Arts fanfic. They're both similar, in that they would rather gain power for the sake of power, and not any goal that the end they want.
