I remember that the swamp Fred and George set up during their escape was supposed to be hard to get rid of (I think a teacher tried to Vanish it, but it didn't work?) Wondering if that could have lasted through the war. Okay, I doubt it stuck around for two years, but did the books ever specify what the time limit was? I really like the idea of McGonagall making a space for it in the castle post-war, as a sort of homage to the twins.

  ‘Well, Flitwick's got rid of Fred and George's swamp,' said Ginny, ‘he did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he's roped it off

That's from OOTP Chapter 38, just after Fudge has acknowledged that Voldemort is back, so sometime early June-ish.

It was set up just after the Easter Holidays, so sometime late April-early May.

That's maybe a month and a half.

*** Ohh-kay, so my memory just sucks then, lol. I may call back to it, but it Flitwick got rid of it the Carrows almost definitely did in seventh year. Good to know, thanks!

**** Umbitch couldn't get rid of it herself and the other Teachers would not offer help
