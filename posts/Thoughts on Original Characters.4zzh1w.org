What makes a good one, what makes a bad one? Thoughts in general?


** Everyone talks about flaws, but I actually don't think that's the key to avoiding the Mary Sue.

Contrary to popular belief, I don't think the primary characteristic of the Mary Sue is her perfection. Rather, her primary characteristic is how quickly and completely she inserts herself into being important to the plot and/or the main characters.

You could write the most believably flawed character in the world, but if you had them come along in OotP and be best friends with Harry within a few days, people would still hate your OC and call them a Mary Sue.

Essentially, people hate OCs that disrupt the natural order, either in terms of the plot or in terms of the characters' social networks and interactions. OCs who disrupt those are viewed as illegitimate invaders.

The key to writing a good OC, therefore, is not necessarily to give them flaws. Rather, the key to a good OC is to find a legitimate niche in the plot/cast for them to fit into, which doesn't feel like they're usurping any pre-existing character's role.

  I totally agree with this. I love Fleur Delacour, and she's pretty much perfect. She's just a funny character and even somewhat inspiring. However, what makes characters like Raven Hecate Ruby Sakura Nightshade often annoying is that besides being perfect the author just shoves them into the reader's face "here is my OC, this is the new Harry Potter world now, it centers around Raven, deal with it". Well, that kind of OC better needs to be the most interesting person in the world for me to just deal with that - and some authors actually succeed in creating someone interesting. Often humour will save the day in such instances. But I think the original character needs to have a legitimate reason to exist in the first place, above all.

** Flaws make a good OC. No one wants to read about a completely flawless character who can never make a mistake. And quirks. Maybe the character only wears red socks. Maybe they snort when they laugh. The more realistic and relatable the character, the better.

*** You say that, put people didn't like my OCs flaws at first. She grew on them, but for the first five chapters there was a good portion of readers (some of which dropped the fic) that wanted her to kick ass from the start!

But yes, flaws are important, and more than that they should be flaws that cause problems for the character. That is why Bella from Twilight is not a flawed character - her clumsiness is merely endearing, it causes her no problems. Meanwhile Tonks, her clumsiness has clearly caused her problems in her career. For my own OC, her niavity means that she was nothe prepared for the gruesome realities not crime scenes, but it's balanced by her eagerness and determination to overcome it.

**** I feel you so much -- there are so many people who espouse the 'flaws are good' line, and yet expect characters to be perfect from the start! I completely agree with what you say about flaws causing problems for the characters -- I think it's only when traits cause actual issues for the character that they become aware of them and try and do something about it, and that can drive character development.

It's definitely important not to overdo flaws though. There's a lot of room for debate in this, but I think that in an effort to round out a character, the author can overuse the flaw factor to the point where the character just becomes downright irritating and difficult to stand. It can be especially damaging when the character's a main character, because it might become difficult for readers to identify with and become invested in that person.

**** I completely understand where you're coming from. It's hard to make people love a character that isn't perfect, but it shows real skill from an author to be able to write one. Authors typically want readers to love their characters, and who's easier to love than someone who's perfect? But it grows tedious to read, especially in fanfic. Personally I think it shows skills from the author to give their characters flaws, even if they're very subtle. It means you can create a well-rounded character, even if you run the risk of some people hating the flaw.

**** For next gen The Fall of The Phoenix by IfIOnlyWereAWeasley is a good one if you don't mind the whole "Harry and Ginny had a fourth child". It's on FFN and it's being reposted on Wattpad. The updates are slow (it's not finished yet) but each one is about 10k words so it kind of makes up for it.

For a marauders era Nobody Sees Me Wishing by solitaireclay07 is a cute Sirius/OC. It's on FFN and it's complete.

For a Harry Potter era The Journey to Words by istillwishiwasaweasley is a really great one. It's on FFN and it's complete. It's also the beginning of a trilogy (sequel is Courage to Words and the final installment is Order From Words; both are completed).

Hopefully you enjoy at least one of these! :)

****** I can see a plethora of reasons it may be offputting to some... but if you've ever wanted to give an mpreg, slash, creature fic a chance... this is IT. There's so much more to it than the summary suggests. I was hesitant to read it the first time because I thought the OC was going to be boring, hard to follow, mary-sues, etc... but it doesn't come off that way at all. I thought the mpreg was going to be /fairy dust/ happily ever after, but it isn't. I thought the creatures were going to be boring, overused, unimaginative.. but it's real. And very, very, very well thought out and done.

- It doesn't get tied up with 'blah blah blah, happily ever after' There's drama. There's angst. There's plot. There's plot in plot in plot. The fic-verse doesn't just stagnate around Harry and his partners. It goes out and you look into what's happening IN the surrounding families. The characters grow, evolve, and progress. The two OC mates don't get lost with Draco, Blaise, and Harry. They stand out and you'll end up knowing them as well as you know the 'real' characters.

- It's not just one slash couple surrounded by every other person in the fic in a slash relationship. Most of the other couples are hetero... though there is one brief mention/run-in with a lesbian couple and their children. But Hary is a main character, and as such, most of it is focused on slash. Tthere's sex. Lots of slashy, descriptive sex. If you can deal with the m/m relationships but not the sex, try reading it on FF. It's edited to make it more vanilla and not descriptive so it fits in with FF rules, etc.

- The surrounding relationships are all /different/ and they all have their own problems. For example... [[/spoiler][One of Harry's partner's has a bitchy wife... and her and Harry literally get into it, down and dirty cat-fight style. Like Harry almost rips her fucking leg off. But turns out the woman was in a previous mateship and she's got some craziness going on because her last mate and child were killed. So Harry helps her work that around and the relationships all progress.]]

- Harry isn't 'all-powerful dominant'. Harry doesn't rollover and isn't woe-is-he submissive. His creature inheritance is of the submissive nature, but he doesn't lose his SELF. He's still Harry. And it's beautiful.

- [[/spoiler][Snape dies. And it'll make you cry. It's heartbreaking and sad. And in the end, you'll be thankful he finally let go.]]

- The Mpreg isn't sugar-coated. It's real and gets down and dirty on raising children and the aches and pains of raising a child. [[/spoiler][Or several children, really. But they're all different. They all grow differently. You'll fall in love with Leolin. He's a fairy baby, and as such, you get to meet the royal fairies, and that whole can of worms... And then there's Farren, a hungry, big, laid back baby... sharing cookies with all the other babies, and then realizes he gave away the last cookie and didn't keep it for himself. It's such a tender moment. And A&E (nicknamed Accident and Emergency) are twin girls that Draco just dotes on like princesses.]]

... I could keep going, but I hope you give it a chance and end up loving it as much as I do.

**** It's not a Harry Potter fanfic so I don't know if it's alright if I post this here but if Lord of the Rings is your thing, this story has to give the most perfect representation of an OC. And it's a self inset to boot which is incredibly hard to make realistic and bearable. And boy is it good, it's basically just a girl gets dropped in the Middle Earth world knowing nothing about it and just has to survive. It even talks about her dealing with her period while on the road. I highly recommend giving it a chance even though it's not Harry Potter. It's also completed which is a plus.

** I find that OCs in fanfiction are pretty tricky in general. In your own world, you can add and cross off as many characters as you like. But in fanfiction, you're writing about an established network of characters and relationships that everyone is already very familiar with. It's like introducing a brand new friend to your small group of bffs from kindergarten and expecting there to be no awkwardness. I am just one person, but here's what I go by:

1. Good OCs must have a drive. What do they want from the characters? If they are simply thrown into the mix, then what do they want in general? What are their desires and goals? How does their history support that and how does it support the way they crossed paths with the established characters?

2. Good OCs must prove themselves to be accepted in a circle of friends. There's a moment (or a series of moments) in every relationship where things shift from acquaintanceship to friendship. Generally, some revelation of "wow, this person is exactly who I want around me" has to be achieved IRL to make a good friend, so why would this be different in ff?

3. Good OCs are not clones of the authors. Similarly, they are not a boring average-Jane or an endless fount of excitement. Defining choices during certain moments are what spells out a person's character, not a person's every reaction to every moment. Always have a balance with your ups and downs, fails and successes, etc.

4. Good OCs have a life that is not involved with the other characters. Before they came along, they had their own story. Don't let your OC just materialize as though they had no previous plans, desires, family, or friends. Unless OC is just that mysterious, of course.

** As a writer, I really like OCs. I write Teddy's era next-gen, so most of the characters are necessarily OCs because there are very, very few (literally only one) canon characters who went to school at the same time as Teddy. I like the freedom that they give me, and I love being able to build them up and explore their characters.

I've commented below on flaws -- I think that flaws make an OC so much more enjoyable to read, and to write about. OCs are often popular when people can relate to them, when they become invested in a character, and little flaws and quirks tend to make them feel more human. I also like character development, particularly if the OC is featured in a major role. People change over time -- an OC shouldn't start out perfect, and they shouldn't stay the same all through the story; rather, they should grow through the experiences that they face.

I also love it when OCs are given a background. People often have a particular reason for being the way they are. If the OC holds a prejudice against muggleborns, is it because they were bullied by a muggleborn in their early years at Hogwarts, or is it because they grew up in a family that believed in pureblood supremacy? Is an OC a bully because they were bullied, or because they feel threatened? When authors think about why their characters do what they do, they are often able to create an individual who feels more real, and who acts in believable ways.

*** The background is so important, but something I think separates good and bad OCs is how the background is revealed. There's nothing more off putting, to me, than the first chapter revealing a horribly tragic back story. I feel like it's better to steadily reveal why a character is the way they are - like Draco's character development throughout the books. It's a skill for anow author to know their characters history and deep thoughts, but resist the urge to dump it all on the reader right away.

**** Oh yes, definitely! Revealing too much backstory in the first chapter is always a red flag for me -- these things should be allowed to develop naturally for themselves, and I feel like building up to it is much better because it creates more suspense/tension and gets the readers invested in the character. I try to focus on steadily revealing things about my characters rather than telling you all about them at once, and hopefully it works -- based on the reviews that I get, it definitely makes people more interested and invested in the characters (even the seriously flawed ones).

When I started writing, I had no idea it was a thing you weren't supposed to do - especially to write a CC/OC romance which is what I was doing, and it was a bit of a shock when I found that out.

What makes a good one? well, decent writing first and foremost, and I don't think it's about flaws, but about making them human and relatable; but also an OC who easily could have been there in canon, but simply not seen by Harry. So an OC in Harry's school year at Hogwarts would be very difficult. So would a secret sibling. Or a new DADA teacher. Unless you are writing AU in which case I can't understand why anyone would object (although I know they do).

** Whenever a writer says they hate OCs, i find that their characterizations of draco are going to be in leather pants, harry will he whiny as fuck, hermione will be a goddess, ginny will be a harridan in training, and/or ron will be a complete mess. All ocs.

They'll also have griphook he helpful and the goblins best friends of harry for him either insulting them properly, saying may your gold flow freely, or just remembering griphook's name.

** I had this issue with my Harry, I know, I know... not an Original Character, but he essentially has been rewritten as so. A lot, and I mean a lot, of people have commented that they love his character that while he's a git, a prat, and every other unsavory word, they cannot imagine him being anything else but the perfectionist that he claims to be.

His intelligence, cunning, and wit all vanish when someone criticizes anything he does. He's very, very easy to provoke and will just fly off the handle and go postal about something trivial. The funny thing is, despite his desire to be great, he's a mother's boy through and through, and if his mother told him to get in the corner, he would.

My issue is that he's walking a very fine line between being a Gary Stu (is that the male version?) and I just cannot throw weaknesses at him as it'll break his character.

Anyway, I realise that this was for OC's and I just came along with my Harry and started stealing the thread... :s

*** I always thought that some people are stronger than other people, some better. You shouldn't feel a need to balance people out too much, because some people are just capable and thats fine.

He won't become a Gary stu if you have some people not like him for rational reasons. Not reasons which make them look like horrible people, but rational ones. Maybe they could find him argumentative, arrogant, confrontational, too judgmental. All of these are rational reasons for people to dislike a person at times, which can be a source for real character conflict.

That's what makes a character a Gary stu. There's not a single person who can be good and not like them, not a single problem not able to be easily fixed, and not a single time where the character is mistaken, wrong, and refuses to believe it. Gary stus have no internal conflict.

Avoid those pitfalls, and you can have your Harry thats a good person. Better than many. But the conflicts make then a good person, rather than a good Gary stu
