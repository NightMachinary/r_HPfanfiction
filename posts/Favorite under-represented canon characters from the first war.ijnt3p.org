I'm in the early process of writing a fic that takes place in the years before the first wizarding war, 1967-1971. I have a list of about 50 canon characters that I personally think would be good for minor roles in the story.

After reading through past posts I noticed people often request fics with specific characters. However characters from the 90s are mostly mentioned. Suggestions on who you would like to see included would be EXTREMELY helpful.

Thank you everyone who commented I now have even more to think about, and my list is up to 110 characters!!! Im going to cut it down based on who can contribute something relevant to the story.


** Peter Pettigrew. Fanon often make him some stuttering idiot, only good to be punished by Voldemort. But the guy managed to frame Sirius for all his crimes, and was a spy for a good year before that. Not to mention that James and Sirius chose him as the Secret Keeper because he had their full trust (unlike Remus).

I wish there were more fics with a competent Peter.

**** I'm not a fan of this fic for various reasons, but this is one of the few things that I liked inside. Also the fic that made me think about Peter as a under-represented character.

** It would be wonderful to see the Lovegoods. Given how stubbornly Xenophilius continued to publish anti-Voldemort material in his magazine, I would think that he and his wife probably did their own part in the resistance during the first war.

** Omg please ping me when you start publishing. I love it when people flesh out minor characters. Personally I would love to see Ollivander, Fortescue, Moody, the Longbottoms (who I headcanon as older than the Potters), the Prewetts, Emmeline Vance. That being said, these are minor characters who I don't think are particularly popular (that's why I'm so excited to see you writing this fic). So I don't know if writing those characters would translate to a ton of readers.

That's my two cents!

*** All good suggestions! I actually already have Moody as the last DADA teacher before Voldy curses the position.

** I would like to read more about all those heroes who died during the first war but are only given a sentence in the series such as the Bones, the McKinnons, Benjy Fenwick, Dorcas Meadows, the Prewett brothers, Caradoc Dearborne.

** The Prewett Twins, the Lovegoods, and the Longbottoms, as although they are well known, hardly anyone writes them in fics.
