So, let me preface this with a "This is not my idea" however, I saw this in a fic a looong time ago and would like to hear peoples thoughts on this.

Filch, being a squib, is resentful of students who are able to do things he wishes he could. He is a bitter man, but, what is really at the root of his hatred is Mrs. Norris' (mis)treatment at the hands of troublemaking students.

You see, little do they know, Mrs. Norris is actually Emma Norris-Filch, Argus' maledictus wife. It's why she appears smarter than normal cats, why Argus is overly affectionate towards her. And the source of his complete contempt for the students of Hogearts.

** I have heard the Mrs. Norris maledictus theory and I see the merit in it. I could definitely see that playing a role, and I think that describes the connection he has with her as well as the sadness he seems to express in Chamber of Secrets when she is petrified, but I'm not sure if I agree with that being the reason he hates students. I think that is that were the case, he would be more focused on protecting her than torturing the students. It is a really interesting thery though !
