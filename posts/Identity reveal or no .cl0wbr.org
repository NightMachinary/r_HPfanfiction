** Identity reveals are one of my favourite tropes. I say do it.

Otherwise your not really writing a Harry Potter story, you are writing an OC.

Edit: Also it depends on what your endgame is, is there a prophecy? Will Harry roll over and let Voldemort win?

If there is a prophecy, then it creates a condition where Harry's identity must be revealed at some point.

If Harry rolls over and let's Voldemort win, then that creates an unsatisfying conclusion to the narrative.

*** I'll keep most things like canon, with Harry just well informed and hidden. I'm still thinking about the endgame, but I'm planning to give Voldy a lowly death.

** It depends. How obvious is his disguise? Are others (Hermione) going to be able to figure it out? Will he tell his friends so that they can help? What will happen if Fred and George see "Harry Potter" on the marauder's map? If he's got a perfect disguise that nobody can figure out, not even with the map, then keep it forever. If his friends can figure it out, he'll have a small group of people who know and help keep the secret, but he could be betrayed later on. If it's too obvious, the secret will be out at the most inconvenient time possible.

*** His eyes and hair are different. He has framed a complete new identity. He does have trust issues, he'll tell no one, though the hat would know. And yes I'm making it a perfect disguise.

**** How's he going to trick the map though? Would a legal name change work? Will it also trick the Goblet of Fire so that entering "Harry Potter" won't work? Will he have the same friends as canon!Harry or a completely different set? Hermione figured out Lupin, if she's close friends with him she's got good chances of figuring it out (roughly correct age ✅, scarred forehead ✅, orphan ✅, constantly involved in adventures ✅)

***** Yes I will be changing his name the magical "ritual" way or some documentation way, which can be considered legal(yet to delve a lot in that matter). Anything can be entered in the Goblet, honestly. But I'm going to do a slightly easy take on it. Harry will be doing all adventures in secret so no way of Hermione knowing that, and he will be disguising himself thoroughly(because he is hella paranoid even before knowing he's famous). He won't make it known he's orphan, just some cooked up story easy to believe.
