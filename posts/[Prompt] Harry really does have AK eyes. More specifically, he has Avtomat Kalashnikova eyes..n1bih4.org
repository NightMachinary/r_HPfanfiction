This is an idea that has been floating around my head for the past few days. Have fun.


** Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort faced each other down on opposite ends of the Great Hall. The din of battle around them faded away as the two mortal enemies squared off in their final clash. Lord Voldemort was panting heavily - no easy feat given the lack of proper nostrils - but still held his wand triumphantly as he faced his foil.

"This has been a great journey, Harry Potter. And like all journeys, it must come to an end. Bow to me now, before I finish you, and I may still grant your dear friends a quick and painless fate."

Harry rested his hands on his knees, bereft of energy. This war had waged on long enough. It truly was time to end things.

He slowly dipped his head, closed his eyes, and drew in a deep breath. Voldemort cackled as he aimed his last spell. He began to utter the incantation - but was halted unceremoniously by a low chuckle from his foe. He scowled.

"Potter, it is rude to laugh at people on your deathbed."

"Well, you see, the thing about that," the boy began to rise up once more, "is there's something you should know."

Voldemort hissed, "and that would be?"

"I found it." The Dark Lord raised a brow as Harry opened his eyes once more, irises shining in the spelllight. "I found the power you know not."

The Great Hall erupted in shocked gasps and gunfire, and Lord Voldemort went down in a hail of bullets.

** Plot twist: You /really/ don't want to stand in front of Harry when he's crying.

** Hope he gets the right magazines. He's gonna feel rather silly during his stare down with Voldemort if he has a bunch of 7.62x39 instead of 5.45x39. I imagine he could probably use transfiguration to fix the mistake, but being that percise is a rather delicate art when a dark lord is in the middle of trying to kill you.
