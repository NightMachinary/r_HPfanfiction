Looking for stories where Harry follows Voldemort. It can be just as a follower or his lover. I love Gray or Dark Harry. I also like stories where he bickers and banters with Tom, you know in a sarcastic but teasing way, and he gets away with it be it amuses Tom or because he is a powerful ally and Tom doesn't want to kill him.

Now on the flip side, I also like reluctant Harry stories. You know where he is more Gray than dark. And he isn't sure which side he should be on. but he eventually chooses Voldemort.

And as a last resort, I'm also down for ones where he forced to take the mark. There is one where I think Voldemort is his grandfather? and he marks Harry as protection and Harry is pissed. For the life of me I can't find this fic anywhere, so if you know let me know. haha. But I like the idea that Harry isn't on Tom's side (at first) and is forced to take the mark, and eventually he realizes its not so bad.

I guess any stories where he has the mark and is on Tom side haha. I prefer slash, the main pairing doesn't have to be between Tom/Harry though.
