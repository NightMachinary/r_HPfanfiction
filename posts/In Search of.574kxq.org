Tried this on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]], they directed me here. I can't seem to find a story I was a big fan of. Was wondering if someone could help. Naruto HP crossover where Naruto is a professor at Hogwarts. He's on medical leave or something like that. Dying to read it, but can't find it. Please and Thank you P.s. if you have any Naruto/HP fanfiction to recommend that would be greatly appreciated


** If nobody knows offhand I urge you to search the subreddit - there have been tons of crossover rec posts and Naruto is usually popular in them. Sorry I can't link you right now!

** Since no one seems to know I shall recommend you a different subreddit once again, I recommend you try [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]]

** You probably not going to find it here. Your best bet would be to check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Naruto-Crossovers/224/1402/][fanfiction.net's Naruto/HP crossover sections]]
