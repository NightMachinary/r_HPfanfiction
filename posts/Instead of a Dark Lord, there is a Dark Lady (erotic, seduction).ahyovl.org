I once tried a Fic, that was in the 4th Year and Pettigrew screwed the Ritual up, so Voldemort was revived as a Woman. Now i would like to know Fics that has never had a male, but a Female Voldemort (yes, the name would be changed or she used it, for the Rear Purpose). What i would like to know, would be, that she would try to "convince" Harry to give it up and join her side. So yes, potential seduction en masse and Harry did get catched by her charms, but break eventually.


** I mean, that fic makes no sense.

He was a man up to that point. He was a man for what, 60 years? Just because he suddenly got a woman's body it doesn't mean his personality is gonna change and he is suddenly gonna start using seduction instead of violence.

Not much of a Dark Lord/Lady if your whole schtick is to jerk off your enemies.

*** It makes sense depending on your idea of Voldemort. Voldemort definitely used his good looks to his favor when he was younger. With my mental image of Voldemort, K doubt he would simply pass up a significant advantage like that if it was restored to a new height. I doubt he wouldn't be as violent though.

I wonder if Voldemort would have gender dysphoria...

**** No, he wouldn't. He'd use true polymorph and get his dick back.

***** But it wouldn't be his dick. It would be some other guy's dick which he would have to jerk off with which is pretty gay.

Side note: I think true polymorph can't affect yourself unless you're generous with the interpretation.

****** Mike Mearls frlm sage advice says it can be cast on yourself. Also, it's not someone elses dick, but your own. It's not a switching charm, but transfiguration.

And Crack'd Mirror by Cloneserpents has a Voldemort that starts as female linkffn(4045539)

As a fair warning both of these do have lemons in them

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.
