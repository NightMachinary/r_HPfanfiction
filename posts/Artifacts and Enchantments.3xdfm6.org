Looking for fics where artifacts and enchantments are more common place. I'm not going to give any other requirements on the fic because I want to leave it open ended and see what gets suggested. Thanks in advance to suggestions.


** linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari) Was a decent avengers/hp crossover, probably abandoned. But I do remember numerous uses of magical artifacts in the fic (Hermione gets fused to artifacts, and keeps discovering new powers).

  For two wizards thrown out of their own world and into another Earth populated by superheroes and gods, it looks to be a treacherous ride as they attempt to return home again. But when has the impossible ever stopped Hermione Granger and Harry Potter?

** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) is the best example of this I know.

**** To give two broad examples,

- Everyone who can afford it wears enchanted clothes, whether for comfort (e.g., magically light and air-conditioned), aesthetics (e.g., robes that change color and sexy robes that stay on even though basic geometry suggests that they shouldn't), and protection (e.g., enchantments that deflect some of the weaker attack spells, like the Weasley shields hats).

- Gift boxes that are enchanted so that their size and shape has nothing to do with the size and the shape of their contents. (I thought that this was a particularly nice touch.)
