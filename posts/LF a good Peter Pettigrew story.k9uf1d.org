  This is the Peter reincarnated as Harry story you didn't even know you wanted. Give it a try! No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable, falling down the slippery slope of bad decision-making is so much more human than rat. Peter's mam had always said he'd been born under a lucky star, but none of the stars' tales ever struck him as being particularly lucky.Peter counted them off in his head. Canis major, forever chasing the rodent Lepus. Orion, the hunter who fell to pride. Lupus, impaled on the centaur's spear. Aries, sacrificed so his golden fleece would save the prince's life.No, it was better to be a nonentity. Someone relegated to the forgotten parts of the history books. Someone small and inconspicuous, crouching in the corner like a rat.(In the farthest nook of the cupboard under the stairs, three Hallows sat, waiting.) AN: The pairings are tagged so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...
