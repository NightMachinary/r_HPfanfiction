I'm basically looking for a fic that when harry goes into the chamber and begins talking to Tom, Tom tries converting harry to the dark side essentially and harry agrees, even after he finds out this is voldemort. I dont mind whatever way Tom tries to get harry to join him.

I've read a couple with this or a similar premise but they're not usually completed. I dont mind reading ones that are in progress as long as they're long or if they're being regularly updated.

Also, if you have any general harry joins voldenort fic recs then please send me them as well please. Any pairing outside of canon ships for the golden trio would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

** I mistakenly read this as Drunk Harry joins Voldemort in Costco and now I cant stop laughing at the image of an exasperated Dark Lord trying to usher a drunk moody teen out of the store without losing his job as harry keeps saying I love you man and Voldemort is just so done with everything
