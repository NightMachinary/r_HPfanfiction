I'm looking for any fic where Harry stops aging physically at an early point in his life, preferably at a younger age than ten.


** The only fic I know of\\

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

** hmmm I remember coming across this a couple of times... in linkffn(Enter the Dragon by Doghead Thirteen) He looks younger than everyone else and forgets to age for a fair while, but eventually does update his human look. That sentence does make sense, I swear :')

The other one is... /thinks really hard -/ a time travel Harry one, I think. Just checking through my Favourites list now. I can't bloody find it D:< will post again if I come across it.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
