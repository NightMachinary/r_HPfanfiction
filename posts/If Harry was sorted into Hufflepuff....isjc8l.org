How do you think the school would react to his name coming out of the Goblet of Fire?

Do you think his fellow Hufflepuffs would still be angry with him or do you think they'd be happy to have two champions?

Would there be a conspiracy with the other houses where they think the Hufflepuffs rigged it to where both Harry and Cedric's name came out?

If so, would the Potter Stinks badges still say Cedric was the real champion? Or would they support perhaps Krum? Or no one?

Do you think Harry and Cedric would work together more? (I think they'd already have some form of friendship from Quidditch.)

Any other changes you could think of?

/Before someone says it, this is a hypothetical question. Please don't tell me Harry would never have been sorted into Hufflepuff in the first place. That's true for canon, but this is fanfiction we're talking about./

Thanks!


** It's a bit hard to answer this question, since Harry being Sorted into Hufflepuff should change a lot of Canon events (did he still tried to get the Stone, did he save Ginny and killed by basilisk, did Sirius still attack Gryfindor's dorm or was Ron with him in Hufflepuff . . .).\\
But assuming nothing change outside of where Harry is Sorted, Harry should have a lot less problem with the House.

The main reason why the Hufflepuff were angry with Harry is because their House tend to be overlooked and for once, they were in the limelight before Harry came and stole their thunder.\\
If Harry was an Hufflepuff from the start, then not only did the House got a lot of attention during the previous years (thanks to Harry shenanigances), but him being the 4th Champion that the House gets even more attention.\\
So, while Harry should still have inter House troubles (people who still think he was the "Heir of Slytherin" 2 years ago, people who prefer Cedric, or Zacharias Smith who is an irredeemable ass . . .), it should be nowhere as heavy as it was in Canon.

Draco would probably still try to distribute his "Potter Stinks" badges, he did it to mess with Harry as an individual after all. I don't know if they would have as much success (Gryffindor would have less reason to be angry with Harry than Hufflepuff in canon after all). But even if they failed, I don't think any House (as a whole) would support Fleur or Cedric. It's a matter of school pride after all, no matter who the Champion is.

Also, Cedric would probably be even more helpful than in Canon. The boy was written as the perfect martyr, so imagine a kind big brother/ mentor for Harry, which would made his death even more devastating for him.

*** Harry in Hufflepuff does raise the possibility of him being mates with Justin Finch-Fletchley, which would tie in nicely with the Dursleys being just the /worst/ kind of middle-class.

**** Between his name, the way he talked (in CoS) and Eton, I always imagined Justin as a posh kid. A Muggle equivalent of the Malfoys when it comes to wealth.

Also, even if Harry doesn't really interact with them, aren't the Grangers an example of "Nice Miggle-Class Muggles" (not sure how dentist are considered in UK)?

***** The Grangers are probably middle-class on about the same tier as the Dursleys.

The Finch-Fletchleys are probably a notch or two above the Dursleys, but given that the Dursleys sent Dudley to a public school they're probably not miles above them.

**** IIRC Justin's name was down for Eton, which seems like it would put him /far/ above "middle class."

*** People are influenced by their surroundings. So a Hufflepuff Harry might develop into a very different person over the years since he is around different people. I'd say that Ron does not become Harry's best friend in a Hufflepuff scenario since they don't get to spend nearly as much time together. Hermione, should she survive the troll through accidental magic, would probably become cold, disillusioned, bitter/lonely and a lot less restrained than in canon. There is no fixed recipe on how to write this, but Harry would be vastly different than in canon since he would probably end up in less adventures without a friend who wants out of the shadow of his brothers and another one who can make almost everything happen.

** Not exactly, but the effects are kind of similar in “A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic“ linkao3(22953583), Hufflepufs are to large extent pacified.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
