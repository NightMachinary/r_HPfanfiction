Fanfiction dueling often (not always) focuses on a few things that bug me and I'd like to see some other opinions. It all revolves around the amount of movement and focus on dodging spells. Several things about this annoy me, primarily how much it would put you on the back foot. Whether you believe in the necessity of wand motions or not they will without a doubt be faster than moving your entire body unless its some uber-complicated spell which requires seventeen motions in which case I would argue it doesn't belong in a duel. If one chooses to dodge in the elaborate fashion often described you will have more and more spells fired at you before you can recover. As anyone with a background in combat sports will tell you footwork is a vital, possibly the most important factor as you want to make someone miss by a millimeter not a mile so you are there ready to punish them, whereas if you do too much, ie. running/jumping/rolling/random somersaults and all the other things people think looks cool, you waste so much time then any window you have to retaliate is gone. Following on from the above, do people realise how hard it would be to aim while moving? I understand running/dodging to some form of cover then being stationary but it is unrealistic to pretend that accuracy on the move is even a fraction of the accuracy from a well balanced platform. Just think back to any shooting game etc how much worse it is to shoot while running. Another thing related to movement in fanfiction dueling is that it would require a lot of fitness. I understand that some people see a correlation between fitness and magical potential however I would argue that Dumbledore was not in his prime nor particularly fit when he was able to hold his own against Voldemort nor would he have been a pinnacle of fitness when he fought Grindelwald having spend most of his time as a teacher. Arguably the best duelist of the age doesn't need fitness montages so why does Harry? Finally, when in a fight against multiple opponents with allies dodging is extremely dangerous to those around you. If you dodge out of the way of a curse then it could easily hit the person protecting your back. It should be your responsibly to stop any incoming curses from your opponent aimed at you or your allies. I would like to see some thoughts, justifications or general comments on magical fights in HP fanfiction.


** So the reason I think dodging is so prevalent in FF is because it's a known quantity that writers don't really have to develop.

I'll give you an example. One of the later chapters of "I'm Still Here" by Katherinb has a fight between Harry and a death eater. Harry is chasing the Death Eater across the school grounds. As the DE is fleeing to an apparition point, they fire at some school children that happen to be about.

Then /In the middle of a chase scene/ the writer goes off on this overlong tangent about the incredible shield charm Harry uses to protect the bystanders. We learn what it's called, what is looks like, what it can block, when harry learned it etc etc.

By the time we get back to the actually chase, all momentum is lost.

This is especially frustrating as Harry has been teaching another student how to fight for the last couple of chapters. It would have been the perfect opportunity to teach the reader something, then during a climactic moment, have the hero use the thing we learned.

I think it was [[/u/Taure]] who said that duels are like a chess game. It isn't about who's the strongest magically, its about who can out think their opponent. Case is point, Dumbledore mitigating the Killing Curse with the use of animated golden statues.

But this requires planing and at least some education of the reader, so that you the writer aren't just pulling stuff out of nowhere, but the episodic nature of FF hampers this kind of forethought.

*** I'm a firm believer that there are two types of duel shown. Firstly we have the Dumbledore/Voldemort style where there is a mutual respect and it is more a test of knowledge and skill but there is also the brutal style in the thick of it where all manners and decency have long since fled and survival is all that remains.

** I too hate seeing dodging being advocated as a valid or even superior tactic to use in duelling. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because I imagine spells as moving too quickly to be dodged unless you are already moving out of the way before the spell has been cast (or are very far away).

We've never been given too detailed a description of the mechanics of duelling and blocking, especially as the linear nature of a narrative means you cannot present simultaneous action very well, but I think Snape's duel with Harry in HBP demonstrates that successful blocking of spells is about countering them /during/ the casting process, not after the casting process.

This in turn leads me to think that the picture of spells as projectiles is largely incorrect. I think the process of putting a curse or charm on something is largely the same: you're placing the spell directly on the target. When you complete the casting process, the spell will take effect on the target. As such the visual effect and spell travel occur /during/ the casting process, not after it. A duel is not "spell tennis". It's much more like fencing: you test each others defences, manoeuvre, and try to find an opening to strike. And usually, a single opening is enough to end the duel.

So I think 99% of the time, attempting to dodge in response to spells will not be a valid tactic. You cannot dodge in a controlled manner in response to already-cast spells. Rather to dodge you have to throw yourself around in an unpredictable manner to prevent yourself from being successfully targeted in the first place. So dodging can help you avoid spells for a time, but you're in no position to attack back.

However, on a related note, I think the idea of "aim" is generally overstated in the fandom. Certainly it's possible to miss. However, I don't think aim in magic has much to do with actual physical aim. This ties in with the idea that spells are not projectiles emerging from your wand and travelling in a straight line to the target like a bullet. Rather a spell is something you are putting "on" the target. I only really think a spell would miss if there's a sudden mismatch between the direction you intended to send the spell and the location of the target e.g. they have dived out of the way, or apparated, the moment they saw you raise your wand.

*** I have to point out that usually, "dodging" is used incorrectly anyway - bullets are far too quick to be dodged. And yet we usually say "I dodged a bullet" when the bullet missed us - often, because we moved. Hitting a moving target is rather hard.

In other words: diving out of the way, running, apparating - that's all what many see as "dodging".

**** I agree with you here. Whenever I see dodging used in fics though, I get the impression that spells are moving like as fast as a nerf gun fires or like an object thrown fast. And thus dodging spells that are already coming at you is more plausible.

It would be nice if writers could implicitly or explicitly carry across the speed of things. And do the same for their dodging, make it more descriptive like "running to the side to make it harder to aim, or "diving backwards when Harry saw the death eater start the final wand movement".

*** Do you think there are ever two types whereby one does travel like a stunner which is often described as a beam of light and the other is as you described on the target such as a levitation charm? If we take the heavy intent option of magic then if you intent to hit someone then you should, otherwise we might see horrendous implementation of longer wands/staffs specially designed for long distance accuracy.

****** No, I'm not saying the light comes after the effect. I'm saying that the light and spell travelling is occurring during the casting process (i.e. during the incantation) and that the effect occurs when the spell is complete.

So, with a stunning charm, the red light would be forming around your wand then travelling across space while you were saying "Stupefy!". If the spell is blocked before it is completed, then the light would splutter out. Otherwise when you finish saying the word "stupefy", the spell takes effect and the person is stunned (unless they are no longer there).

******** I generally take the particular physical description with grain of literary licence salt. For example, the Killing Curse is sometimes described as a flash of light, other times it's described as visibly travelling. I think the stunning charm has similarly been described in two different ways, sometimes as a nimbus of light, other times as a more "beam" like entity.

In short, I think that the physical descriptions that we're given are meant to conjure a certain impression rather than being a clinical description of the spell's appearance, which I imagine as relatively distorted as well as too fast-moving to fully discern.

So the Killing Curse would be a "projectile", but the Unlocking Charm would be "hitscan". Another way to describe it is to say that the KC is cast at the target while the Unlocking Charm is cast on the target.

It's not that canon compliant, but it inserts some order into the magic system that I find to be lacking in canon.

If it's instantaneous, those kinds of spells would all be useless.

Of course nothing of what I have said denies that spells move through space to their target. I'm basically just talking about the timing of this phenomenon.

*** "And usually, a single opening is enough to end the duel."

I completely agree with this. One of my biggest pet peeves in FF dueling is when characters use stupid prank like spells in the the middle of a fight for their lives. Tarantellegra and Rictumsempra are two I see quite often. I find it completely unrealistic and frankly fucking stupid to use any spell that doesn't end the fight if it connects. Every spell that directly affects your enemy should be a finishing spell.

**** Part of the problem is that said Tarantellegra and Rictumsempra actually /are/ dueling spells in canon. They shouldn't be, but they're what the Death Eaters were throwing around in OotP in the ministry. So if writers aren't familiar with actual fighting and are drawing on canon for how to write battles they've been badly primed for writing good duels.

I can see a use for them in group battles (regurgitating the usual defense for the ministry battle): they're ways to tie up other combatants in trying to help their hurt allies, especially if it's something they feel they can reasonably fix. A lethal curse isn't going to do that. They may also be useful for capture-but-not-kill fights.

When doing some basic hema stuff, my instructor's mantra was always 'you either win or lose a fight, there is no draw.' So I'd say spell selection should be those that are damaging if they hit but not leaving yourself vulnerable is more important until you can put them at a disadvantage where you can make a killing strike. So again, always shooting lethal stuff at them isn't always the best option (yes killing them quickly stops the fight, but if it also gives them an opening to attack back, it's not a great idea).

The best option is whatever keeps you safest.

They are "dueling spells" and they should be. Not all duels/fights have the groups on both sides wanting to kill each other. When you want to subdue your opponent, they make good choices.

**** A bullet that kills takes one guy out of the fight. A bullet that wounds/incapacitates takes out the target and the guy that has to drag them away from the fight. Or something like that.

Though I generally agree with you, one has to keep in mind that spells like the Tickling Jinx or Jelly-Legs were introduced in the first few books which are much more whimsy-fairytale. Then once we get into the YA books, suddenly you have The Insta Win Unblockable Death Delivery Curse. DE using the silly spells was, I think, a way to show that it was wizards fighting, who according to JKR's author avatar aren't the most logical folks because magic. So things that seem logical and obvious to us muggles aren't always the optimal approach when magic is involved.

Tangentially, this allows a neat explanation for why the traps in PS were what they were and not just a bunch of traps rigged to rain down shrapnel and acid if you stepped on the wrong tile on the floor. Snape's trial was prepared by a wizard of some muggle background and beaten by a wizard and witch of muggle backgrounds.

One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the Tower stairs --'

  ‘To set off the Mark?' asked Harry.

  ‘He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,' said Lupin. ‘But I don't think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.'

*** You haven't really solved your fundamental problem with the system here (spell tennis). All you've really done is scramble the order of events and made it kind of awkward to follow, as well as made it impossible to /not/ instantly get killed by anyone with a lethal enough spell.

I don't think you can have a simple system of magical fencing keeping strictly to canon. Spells have a wand motion component, and a verbal component. In order for magical fencing to exist, you'd need a number of spells which sound like other spells, and have similar motions, but do different things, mostly blocking other spells. For example, a spell which starts with /Expell-/ and starts with a twirly motion, but ends up as a different spell which deflects or interrupts motion-affecting spells.

Fencing, and really any sort of practical martial art, is dynamic. There's at least as many ways to strike as there are ways to parry, block, or feint, and it all comes together from reactions and predictions. Taking /what we know/ to exist in Harry Potter, if such a complex system existed, duels would look like two wizards spouting gibberish constantly while twirling about. It would be a battle of language and dance, two wizards trying to outmaneuver each other in the magical space between them, and while that would be interesting, it's not what exists in either the books or the movies.

Aim and dodging are the most likely practical skills in duelling because otherwise, duelling is either pointlessly lethal or more complex than can be reasonably extrapolated from what is depicted.

Alternatively, you could say that there's an incredibly easy spell which allows even young wizards to non-verbally deflect incoming spells, which is basically what the movies came up with, but I somehow suspect this would not make you happy.

** I usually consider a duel as a fight between two people, often with rules or even a code. It can happen on a battlefield, but as soon as ohers are involved, it's no duel anymore.

And in a fight involving multiple people, dodging and moving until you have hard cover means you will be much harder to hit by an enemy you didn't see in time - in the army, I was surprised how much harder it was to hit moving targets instead of stationary ones, and that was with an assault rifle and semi-automatic and even burst fire. If your opponents are using wands, you'll be even harder to hit. You don't look for footwork and telltales in such situations. Also, if you are so close to your allies that your dodging would hinder them, you are far too damn close. A formation which is that tight just invites Bombardas and other area-effect spells.

Dumbledore is the exception, not the rule, in my opinion, and I generally have him use transfiguration and conjuration a lot - creating walls and floating barriers in addition to using strong shields and creating animals to fight for him, to compensate for his slower movement.

In the same vein, Dumbledore's enemies will usually be forecd to move or dodge, since he'll be as likely to turn the earth beneath them to water (or acid), then to stone when they have sunk into it as he's to transfigure the debris behind them into a poisonous snake, or a swarm of spiders, or an animated stone net. Or fill an area with a burning or acid cloud, then hit their shields if they stay within it.

Those enemies who simply fire direct-damage spells at each other until a shield fails are usually the inexperienced and less dangerous ones in my stories.

I do agree though that in a proper duel, especially if it's a formal or sport one, watching footwork, and minimising your movement would play a far larger role. There you can afford to focus on one single opponent.

That's fine for a fanfic if you want to establish a new language convention, but within canon duelling is very much a synonym for "fighting with magic".

In any case I don't think magic lends itself well to group fighting tactics of the sort used by Muggle armies. I think there's a good reason why magical battles tend to result in the battle devolving in a number of smaller, mostly independent fights. It's a function of the variation in magical skill between wizards, whereas Muggle combatants tend to be more standarised in capabilities. A single skilled wizard can cut through a relatively large number of average wizards with ease.

So when you're fighting a force with significant variation in skill, you need to commit your own most skilled fighters to engage with their most skilled fighters in order to contain them. Similarly if you over-commit too many fighters to engaging with a single wizard in an attempt to overwhelm them with numbers, then you leave yourself vulnerable to the enemy doing the same thing to your own fighters who are left over. So the nature of magical skill I think predisposes the nature of magical battles to people pairing off with those of equivalent skill, with relatively even numerical distribution.

**** I do not agree with that view. At all. Not only does HP Magic offer many tools that make tactics beyond "pair up and duel" not just valuable, but actually far superiour - area-effect spells, conjured or transfigured or enchanted creatures that act on their own, spells that change the battlefield and can contain the enemy, as well as spells that are harder to defend against and allow even a relatively unskilled enemy to defeat or kill you with a lucky shot (aka, the Unforgivables) - but your tactics do not work as you think they do.

Even if everyone had the luxury to be able to pick their target at leasure, and the enemy would let them do it, instead of everyone starting to fight as soon as possible and attacking the best targets they see, the fact that the Death Eaters are masked means you don't even know until it's too late if your chosen opponent is actually more or less skilled than you. Combat involving multiple people and at the range we see in canon is chaotic, and brutal. There won't be any pairing up of similarly skilled opponents until the numbers of the figthers have been pared down - and at that point, odds are one side is already fleeing.

Also, you do not seem to know much about the Military either, if you think that a single skilled combattant is less effective in the kind of skirmishes that are comparable, number-wise, to magic battles, than a skilled wizard in magical combat. Just check the Medal of Honor citations for many examples of one good soldier making a huge difference - and not just because morale and momentum plays a huge role in battles.

So, to sum it up: Your tactic requires knowledge about the enemy that is not available in canon - Death Eaters are masked - or an opportunity (to observe the enemy fighting before picking a target) that won''t be there.

  So when you're fighting a force with significant variation in skill, you need to commit your own most skilled fighters to engage with their most skilled fighters in order to contain them.
#+end_quote

Or you feint with your worst fighters to tie up their best fighters while your best fighters clean up their lesser fighters. Then you can overwhelm their best fighters with numbers, after you've hit their morale by killing 60% of their allies.

***** I think we differ significantly on the extent to which average wizards can hold their own against skilled wizards. Committing 10 average Ministry workers to fighting someone like Bellatrix would I think result in 10 very dead Ministry workers in about 10 seconds flat.

** There are several things that should come into play in duelling scenes that often don't:

The fighting style employed; Duelling with wands is hard. You have to know what spells you are going to use-how they work, what effects they have, if they're area-of-effect or require accurate targeting, how quickly they act and how quickly they burn out-intimately. You need to know what movements are required, how the spell is invoked-does tone matter? Inflection? Does it require a particular enunciation? An accent even?-and what the effects are if the conditions are either met or not. This does not even factor in things such as spell-chains, that quirky little fanon idea that pops up sometimes.

So you have built up a little repertoire of spells to use. You know exactly how to cast them, how not to cast them and which situations they can apply to.

Problem is, someone with even moderate fighting abilities is still going to kick your ass if you don't actually train how to use them in a fight. Which is when you get to the section of stuff most authors skip-the actual training itself and its effects on the trainee's own combat abilities.

And what style they will end up favoring.

There would be fighting styles that emphasize the use of dodging in combat, just as there are styles that account for the fighter wearing body armor, being capable of concealing themselves or using enchanted weapons as part of their arsenal. This fighting style would be the domain of those that are either ridiculously athletic or come pre-equipped with shields to back them up though, because the first thing their opponent will do is try and box them in when they realise what the other party is doing. Well, that and carpet-bomb the area with area-of-effect spells that impede movement or outright immobilise the dodger as quickly as possible.

A dodger is generally going to come out on top against inexperienced duellists purely because they either don't have the repertoire or the experience to counter someone moving out of the way of their hexes and jinxes, but someone who employs any AOE explosive spells will hard counter a dodger within seconds. So when you have two firsty schoolboys going at it? Dodging is a valid fighting style in and of itself-and even then a bookworm with attitude could probably deal with you. When the opponents become more experienced though, dodging becomes little more than a kind of useful tactic as long as you don't mind tempting the other party to turn the battlefield into a hail of flying shrapnel.

So there's that.

The terrain: While duels are held on flat platforms where neither side has access to any cover whatsoever, they can also be held in graveyards. On a flat platform with nothing to trip on, dodging is an alright strategy. The opponent cannot really do anything to change the battlespace in his/her favor nor can they afford to cast the sort of spells that would basically blow up the dodger without risking hitting their audience as well. There are ways around that, so a duellist with even minimal experience or training could handle a dodger quite well.

In a graveyard however, the situation is very different. The soil is uneven, there are many hidden little pitfalls to stumble upon and there is plenty of cover to take advantage of. Dodging is suboptimal unless kissing the ground is part of your must-have duelling experiences while going from cover to cover and attacking from a semi-secure position is a far, far more viable option here. The temptation to use a crypt for cover and just shower the area with bombardas and confringos is great indeed, but with great cover comes greatly impeded lines of sight. Sneaking around and ganking the opponent from behind is another option those with access to camouflage spells or invisibility cloaks would definitely consider. Factor in the existence of peruvian instant darkness powder and fire spells and you have even more options handy...

And that's not considering what fighting in an urban environment may be like. Dodging in such areas is practically required as being blindsided is practically a guarantee, but it is not the overarching path to victory most depict it as. Again, a dodger is only as fine as his footing allows him to be. All it takes is one stumble and your opponent has you bang to rights.

The underlying intent: Is it murder? Part of a contest? An actual 'you-pissed-me-off-so-now-I-am-hankering-to-kick-your-ass' fight? That will dictate many things-the repertoire of spells the combatants are allowed/willing to use, the tempo of combat, the viciousness of the tactics employed and many other things. Consider it this way-if it had been Voldemort on stage with Lockhart, Lockhart would have been used to redecorate the room, regardless of the original purpose of the demonstration. However, depending on the intent of the duel, bits of Lockhart may have still been alive enough afterwards to be put back together.

So the intent matters here-and renders dodging more and/or less viable, depending on the situation.

There are a lot of factors that most authors don't account for. They see dodging as a viable tactic because they don't actually think about the consequences of said tactic-the way the enemy will adapt to the situation, the way a dodger will account for changes in the terrain or counteract any battlespace control measures the opponent will employ, what spells someone can use when dodging, how dodging is affected by the inevitable pileup of both fatigue and injuries sustained in battle etc.

It's not a style meant for prolonged conflict-dodging is a tiring and stressful activity to undertake, particularly in live fire situations like a duel. With the speed at which spells can hit and the level of attention that needs to be devoted to both successfully predicting an incoming spell as well as plotting out the safest and most efficient path a dodger can take to get out of danger/into position to retaliate, it starts off hard and rapidly approaches impossible. As an overarching strategy, it lacks finesse. Taking cover is often the smarter option, shielding long enough to weather the spells before retaliating offers up more options and outright being the first to attack every time has the same disadvantages to it with the benefit of actually having you dictate the flow of battle pretty easily. Hell, if it came down to it, maybe dodging is a viable tactic when paired with non-wand-based ranged weaponry, but the benefits of such a tactic are... controversial at best. Besides, even with things such as enchanted firearms being a factor, creating and taking cover are vastly preferrable to spending an entire duel basically on the run.

** I think it's a function of age of the protagonist, as much as anything.

For the first few years of magical education, the typical wizard or witch can only cast basic jinxes; they have to enunciate their spells, limiting their "rate of fire"; and they can't shield, so the only way to avoid being hit is to get out of the way. So, yes, they are going to be dodging a lot if they want to get anywhere.

Then comes the 5th year, and the student learns the Shiled Charm, which suddenly means that dodging is not as critical, and ability to cast spells well --- perhaps while maintaining the Charm --- gains in importance over physical ability, though dodging is still a viable strategy instead of shielding, depending on the circumstances.

Then comes the 6th year, and if the student elects to take NEWTs in DADA, they learn nonverbal casting, making their casting much more rapid and much less predictable, as they get better at it, and dodging against them therefore becomes much less effective.

Standing one's ground, shielding, and countering becomes the dominant strategy, and with experience, we end up with something like the duel between Molly and Bellatrix: rapid exchange of spells by opponents focused on each other that ends when one of the opponents is distracted.

Of course, if the person has a specialty, like Transfiguration, it might be incorporated in their dueling style, especially if they are as skilled as Dumbledore or McGonagall; but they are the exception rather than the rule, as are the greatest of Dark wizards, like Voldemort.

** Dodging is indeed often taken to ridiculous levels, because it's an easy crutch for an author who can't think of more interesting descriptions, so they just have the character dodge between shooting bullet-like spells, like it's some gun-kata show.

However, I don't think the concept itself is inherently bad. It has its uses, but many fanfic authors don't account for the fact that different wizards may have different styles. Moving around, casting spells on the move makes sense for Harry, who's a Seeker and was catching small objects like nobody's business from the first time he rode a broom. Then you have Dumbledore, who's so awesome, so monolithic that all the movement he needs is either in his wrist or he just apparates.

The problem is, that's as far as most fanfics go. A little imagination goes a long way.
