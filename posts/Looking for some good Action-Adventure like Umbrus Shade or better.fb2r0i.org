So, I binged umbrus shade the extremely annoyed ravenclaw in two days and I must say I enjoyed it immensely.

I would like to find works that are akin to Umbrus Shade, with it's non-romantic plotline. The guy is focused on living in the world, not snogging whoever happens to catch their fancy.

Also, I want to bring attention to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world][Rebirth in a Magical World,]] A harry potter fanfic staring another ravenclaw OC who was reincarnated from our world. He only read up to Order of the Phoenix in his time, and so he doesn't know about horcruxes or that dumbledore dies. It's still updating. Starts from previous death, goes through the first few years, in his second year at time of writing this. He's born a couple years before Harry Potter, and thus there's two years before we even touch the original triple. It's Awesome, and perfectly satisfies what I wanted out of Harry Potter Fanfiction.

Give it a read.
