All the reasoning below are just my internal feelings of what American wizards and their culture would be like (in a vague sense), and my fan wank about the cannon that had been established so far. I'm interested to see what others might think about this, and how you imagine Wizarding America and Ilvermorny.

Some of these opinions started to form around the time that I read linkffn(Populating Wizarding America by Dr. Platypus) and I admit that I was highly influenced by reading it. So shout out to Dr. Platypus.

I know that the founding story states that a lot of things that Ilvermorny built itself upon where things that Isolt was told about Hogwarts secondhand. But, that second hand knowledge could have been skewed, miss-remembered, or the info that she was getting wasn't entirely reliable based on who was telling it to her.

It's been nearly three hundred years since the school was founded. Given the typical American attitude towards rapid updating of buildings and traditions not usually seen in much older places, like Europe, I expect to see some modernization. If not a modernization of the building(s), then a modernization of the culture of the school, and it's curriculum. I would want to see a mixture of a skewed Hogwarts and typical American high school culture (not movie high school, real high school). Also, with the history that the US has concerning witch hunts, which by magical standards happened fairly recently, I expect to see an emphasis toward learning to muggle blend within American wizard culture.

Fantastic Beasts established that Americans in the 1920's where kind of afraid of muggles in a way. I don't think that would always translate to being ignorant of the muggles that they are trying to aviod. Some might take great pains, or pleasure, in learning just how their muggle neighbors think and how to replicate that in order to participate in their local comunity. The US is commonly callled a meltingpot, and that means that there is a constant influx of people from all sorts of cultures arriving and gifting and receving culture with the people around them, especially in large cities. I don't think that wizards would be entirely imune to this, whether it be culture from muggles or wizards from other countries.

I also imagine that not a lot of pureblood wizards would have wanted to leave their comfort zones and settle in the "New World". So off continent born wizards that immigrated where probably predominantly muggleborns and halfbloods, maybe fleeing wizard wars and muggle/muggleborn prejudice in their home countries. If those immigrating wizards where, and are, a majority muggleborns and halfbloods, I think that it's safe to assume that they would have knowledge of muggle culture because of the closeness that they might have with their muggle relatives.

As far as Native American wizards are concerned, I admit that I don't know much about Native cultures, so I don't try to assume and make the same mistake that J.K. did. But I do think that, with the right research, and careful handling of the material that they are writing, a fic author could be successful including Native American characters and the culture and magic that they bring to the narrative. This is something that I would very much like to see, if I can't someday write it myself.


** In canon JKR tried to make the wizarding world's problems analogous to the Muggle world. In Britain: classism, social conservatism, and governmental incompetence.

Following this line for America suggests one possibility: that by analogy to the American approach to guns and cultural acceptance of violence, dark magic is much more tolerated in wizarding America with similarly violent results.

This fits fairly well with Fantastic Beasts, where the government's primary concern is Muggles and secrecy, not dark wizards, and where they are quick to violent solutions: the ease of summary execution and the willingness to kill Credence despite being a child.

** The Alexandra Quick series is a masterful portrayal of Wizarding America. Its long, and incomplete. But i still dont regret reading it. It brings in the native and international demographics that realistically would have been there. It gives a ‘new/frontier' sort of feel to a lot of it. And it is one of the best written fanfictions i've seen to date. My favourite series.

** I assume that the East Coast up to the Mississippi is made up independent enclaves originally founded by the kind of wizards too extreme for Europe. Thanks to having wands, they pushed the native wizards out until they managed to reverse-engineer wands themselves and the enclaves started to turn against each other, at which point a stalemate of sort developed and the border more or stabilised. The West Coast is mostly Magical California, a (former) province of the Magical New Spain - the Aztecs, being hated by just about everyone else on the continent, were wiped out by the Conquistadores before they managed to develop wands themselves, all of which happened before the SoS went into effect.

** JKR had so much potential with North America, and she completely ruined it. I'm sorry, but if she couldn't do a thorough job of it, as she did with Harry Potter, then I don't think she should have done it at all. Leave it to someone else. A lot of American history was ignored, building blocks of the country like slavery, genocide, etc. She based magic off of a colonialist, basically, an Irish witch who came and essentially made magic 'better' in North America, as if those previous to her had been complete barbarians (only feeds into the stereotype that Natives have to be trained the white way in order to be proper humans).

So what happens? Instead of having a school that should have been built by the Native population, or a school that should have been built as a refuge for runaway slaves (which not only would have been a better analogy to the history, but would also make more sense why they were such an insular, protected society), she made it distinctly British. I think it would have been awesome to hear about Harriet Tubman having an actual magic made underground railroad, something like the Hogwart's Express, which would take those people all the way up to Canada (where the actual school would have been, not in Mass. if she's going to start so far back). Or maybe there'd be one in Louisiana, the wizarding population there could even have their own creole-based language.

America is big, you can't pile everyone up into New England. You can't have three/four major schools for all of Europe, and then have only one, British-influenced one in all of North America (which not only includes Canada and USA, but Mexico, the Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the D.R.). I know it's not easy, but like I said, if you can't do it, don't do it at all.

You can all disagree with me, but I feel like JKR made the American wizarding world into one big, stereotypical joke, and we're not. We're not a British colony, we are our own country with a very, very complex identity. As is Mexico, as is Canada, as are all the countries that make up North America.

Sorry if this was a little bit of a rant, but, to answer your question, my wizarding America is amazing. It's colorful, it's got a variety of pockets all over the country (not just Massachusetts and New York) each with their own distinct culture. Different people from all of the world have come together to form a melting pot of magic, traditions have been altered, advanced, added. People have had to die to keep some of these traditions, others have had to go into hiding. Laws are not universal, it will change between each community/region, because that's how America is. I hope this answered your question. Thank you for listening.

  This essay is a study in the demographics and geography for fanfiction writers who want to envision what America might be like in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. It is certainly not canon; it rarely rises above the level of rank speculation!

** Still throwing together a personal headcanon, but so far I've got this.

There is no magical Congress. Matters involving magic fall under purview of the Department of Magic, a part of the executive branch but with that be small condition. Every four years, the Department makes a report to Congress, utilizing polyjuice, obliviations, and other magical trickery to make it seem like nobody is missing during the few hours it takes to brief everyone. These reports are largely useless but are also constitutionally mandated, meaning a great deal of Department resources and time are used up every four years to make it happen. Luckily, there has been no apparent sign of brain damage to any members of Congress due to the semi-regular obliviations. ^{/s}

The DoM is mainly divided into different agencies handling various aspects of magic. Each agency is headed by a director who reports to the Secretary of Magic. Notably, the DoM has two agencies handling law enforcement: the Auror Department and the Battle Magicks Department. Aurors handle regular law enforcement while warlocks of the BMD are often sent abroad to assist other magical governments in suppressing dark wizards and creatures. Magical America is often as deeply involved in other countries' affairs as regular America.

This bureaucracy is funded by taxation of almost every form of magical trade. A common saying in Magical America is “A sickle for the shopkeep and a galleon for the taxman.”

Luckily, the wide variety of magical flora and fauna makes for a thriving economy across North America, with magical enclaves in almost every region specializing in different plants and animals. A somewhat lax immigration policy also makes for a wide range of magical styles being present across the nation, with different schools catering to different types. In lieu of one large organization like Hogwarts, there are around a dozen smaller schools servicing the country.

I could write more, but I'm on my phone and most of this is from memory from my attempt to write a fic a few months back. I think you get the gist of things. Mainly, Magical America in my mind is vast, varied, and largely uncontrolled. Aurors are more akin to cowboys and noir detectives than straight-laced soldiers and cops.

** If anyone is interested. There's a Tumblr called: americanwizarding.tumblr.com. I actually prefer it more to canon. I've written a handful of fics (not posted) that have a character or two from these seven schools. I especially like the California school since I'm a California girl and you wouldn't force me to go all the way to Ilvermorny.

** America is not a member of the ICW because we would've completely rejected the SOS out of hand IMO. Our nation is a no-go zone for wizards of ICW-member nations because of this, so no immigration on that front.

We have so many stadiums that Quidditch and Quodpot are played in Muggle stadiums (with Muggles in attendance thinking they're watching something else).

** Ignoring Fantastic Beasts, I imagine the wizarding US to be a social-democratic state, like Norway. In my opinion, Durmstrang didn't always ban muggleborns from attending. In fact, the ban was made by an extremely conservative headmaster, coincidentally at the same time as massive emigration from northern Europe happened in the muggle world. So, the muggleborn families moved with their muggle cousins to the US, after it was clear their children would not get an education at a wizarding school. Thus, as only a small percentage of the restbof wizarding Europe moved, large parts of wizarding northern Europe emigrated. They established a welfare state, with close bonds with the muggle government. German and Polish are recognized as official languages along with English, with Norwegian, Danish and Swedish commonly spoken.

*** For all we know, Durmstrang might not even be anywhere near Norway. We're playing more with a Baltic-Finnish vibe, which I think is where they have it on the Pottermore map (even though it says northern Sweden/Norway). And actually, it was created by a Bulgarian (or Russian?) witch, so having it follow Norwegian culture/society doesn't make much sense. I also have to disagree with you and say that they'd have made their franca lingua German, especially since German is the main language (after English) that Eastern Europeans learn (speaking as an Eastern European myself).
