:END:
Hey.

I'm looking for a specific fic that I recently remembered reading a long time ago (I had gotten it as a PDF from a Yahoo Group so I'm not sure if it was posted elsewhere) from what I remember of the fic:

- Harry does a ritual to go to another dimension (or the past I can't quite recall) and become an Elf.
- he sets up a sanctuary of some sort, with a portal in the forbidden Forest.
- an injured Remus (who is still a student) is transported to the sanctuary after being injured by a hunter in the forest.
- I think Riddle ends up attacking the sanctuary (by disguising himself as a student) which causes Harry to have a fractured magical core.

That's pretty much what I remember from it, but would be cool to find it again and give it another read as from what I can remember I rather be enjoyed it.

Thanks!

*** That is the one, thanks so much! I couldn't get my Google-fu working at all to get it.
