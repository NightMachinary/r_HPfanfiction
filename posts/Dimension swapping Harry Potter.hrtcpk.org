:END:
I am looking for more fics like In Another Place ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9737014/1/In-Another-Place]] ) or The World as We Knew It ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It]] ).

More specifically, I am looking for dimension swapping fics where a Harry from the canon dimension or canon-adjacent dimension is swapped into a lighter, softer AU where Harry has been growing up as a normal child. I will also take fics where the swap happens from a dimension that is worse than canon, like an AU where the war went south, and Voldemort managed to destroy Wizarding Britain (a la Nightmares of Future Past, or the beginning of a Game of Chess).

My main requirement is that a Harry that has grown up and survived under harsh conditions --- abusive childhood, annual murder attempts, full-blown war, watching friends and family be tortured and killed --- swap into, or even usurp (like in World as we Knew It) a Harry who has grown up in a lighter, softer, fluffier AU. In other words, like a normal child surrounded by friends and loving family, without the responsibility of defeating a psychotic, genius mass murderer hanging over his head even before he was born.

I am specifically */not/* looking for dimension swap fics into darker dimensions or even dimensions where the alternate dimension Harry is estranged from his family. The main reason I am searching for these kinds of fics is that I love to see how a battle-scarred Harry would handle integrating into a found family, and how he would rise to the challenge of protecting them should new threats arise.

Bonus points if the story has progressed to the point where the swapped Harry tells the story of his life to his AU family, because I love reaction scenes to the insanity that is Harry's life.

Bonus bonus points if the story also includes other characters that have swapped into the lighter, softer AU alongside Harry.

A big thank you in advance to everybody who responds.


** Well, I literally just posted this same request without knowing, for "In another place".

What a coincidence. That's slightly disturbing.

However, you have just given me another to read then! Who knows, maybe the two posts will get more requests eventually?

Edit: Many thanks for the 200k words I now have to read, in your debt

*** You are welcome!

Also, I found your post, and read the three fics recommend there!

So my itch is scratched for the moment.

** Linkao3(How Like Home) this is WIP but it's good so far

Also, in â€˜The world as we knew it' I've been out of as someone suggested that Harry didn't actually dimension swap, it was just a hallucination. Is this true? Thanks!

*** I just found out about How Like Home from yet another post earlier today, and havr already finished it.

Desperately waiting for the author to update again!

And no, Harry wasn't hallucinating in "The World as We Knew It". It was a true dimension swap. I think the hallucination idea is from a different fic, "Destiny Reversed", if I remember correctly.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.
