Do you think that young Tom found a lake where a bunch of people were dead and that's what scared Amy and Dennis (rather than Tom being the culprit for once)? Or maybe it was just a place where he dumped all those bodies that disappeared over the years? Or maybe he pulled a Hamelin piper and enchanted a bunch of people from nearby villages to drown themselves in the lake?

Any thoughts?

*** I still like the idea of pulling a Hamelin piper. That story has something really creepy to it especially that it's based on some real accounts when something happened and a bunch of children disappeared. Hypnotizing rats to throw themselves in a lake and children to walk into a cave kind of also seem to follow the theme.

**** Yup, nothing against that (and I LOVE [[https://youtu.be/-xlbvRy2-Kg][this movie]] from my 1980s', also notice the music), but loosing whole community would make a real strain on the Statue of Secrecy. It is hard to explain a vanishing of whole village by a gas leak. Given we have never heard about the calamity like that, gradual storage of missing persons is more probable.

***** Geez... that movie makes it even creepier than I imagined it.

I think though a story could still be explained by mass migration to the big cities or abroad and the village getting depopulated (rural depopulation has been happening for decades throughout the world).

****** Also, you know, flooding an entire valley to make a reservoir has happened in the UK's not too distant history, so it's not beyond belief that entire communities would have to be abandoned for some reason or another.

If you can't think up a flood, maybe building development. All the wizarding world would have to do to cover up the disappearance of an entire community is build a Merry Hill...

** I always liked the idea that the inferi were there partly as guards, but lately just to put them somewhere. I am not sure Voldemort seriously expected someone go go after his Horcruxes, after all, even if somehow someone found out about them, how would they find that particular cave?

I think that canonical Voldemort used inferi openly during the last war, and maybe he just needed somewhere secure to store them between uses. Perhaps cold water helps preserve them or the lake was specially enchanted.

I think it is implied, and according to the wiki explicitly stated in some of the extra stuff, that he accumulated the body from the various magical and muggle attacks, rather than a single mass murder event.

*** Yeah. Cold anoxic water would prevent decay, and the fifteen-odd years of inactivity is plenty of time for them to become largely [[https://youtu.be/gi0Gi0sqXwg][adipocere]], a waxy substance made by anoxic bacterial activity in a body's fat.

The adipocere would probably explain why Dumbledore immediately went to a fire spell to drive them back, the adipocere would be particularly flammable.

** I'd say it's probably a combination of the bodies of some of those "disappeared" and a bunch of Muggles that, to everyone else's knowledge, just went missing some time in the 70s. It's an easy way to collect "raw materials" - just find some Muggle that's alone, Imperius them to come with you (so you don't have to carry the body), then AK them at the lakeside and turn them into an Inferius. Heck, Tom probably used it as a way to /relax/.

** Most likely explanation is that they were all the collective "missing" people (muggle, magical, squibs, et cetera) before and during his first reign of terror.

*** It sort of make sense but then why not use the bodies to also protect the rest of the Horcruxes. At the very least the ring...
