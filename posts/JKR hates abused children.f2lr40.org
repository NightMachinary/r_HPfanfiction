Merope Gaunt - dies destitute

Voldemort - becomes evil megalomaniac

Severus Snape - mostly evil, murdered by snake

Sirius Black - spends adult life imprisoned and continuously tortured, murdered by drapery

Credence Barebone (Fantastic Beasts) - turns into obscurus, "murdered" by aurors then turns evil

Harry Potter is literally the only abused child with a happy ending.


** Abused children don't tend to have happy endings. It's a sad fact of life that abused children often either perpetuate a cycle of abuse or end up doing poorly in life.

** Dudley is arguably abused though not in the same way as Harry and eventually turns out okay.

I also wouldn't necessarily classify Voldemort as abused as a child.

*** I would argue that any child in a London orphanage in the middle of WWII probably grew up abused. Income inequality was insane, as was the treatment of orphans. Using poor children for all kinds of menial and dangerous labour was still the norm. Crime was rampant and inescapable for many under threat of violence.

**** I mean yeah if you compare him to children nowadays almost all were abused in that time period but if you compare him to other children of the time he wasn't more abused than them. If anything he was the abuser even as a child.

Also another person in your favor is ariana Dumbledore.

***** I mean, Tom was probably a sociopath, but as with your example of Dudley, being a bully to other children does not preclude a child from being abused.

****** You can also be a sociopath/psychopath and be a perfectly functional and productive member of society, no genocide needed. It's not as deterministic of evil as some of this fandom seems to think.

****** But with Dudley many of his peers treated better than him whereas with Tom basically everyone was having a bad time, even those who werent living in an orphanage. Almost all children were treated like shit in the 40s.

******* Just because trauma was common doesn't mean its effects were negated. A lot of poor children back then were in abusive and/or exploitative situations. A lot of poor children were also violent to each other, because violence was normalised in their lives. Violence against children causes them to grow up violent, whether that violence is common or not.

***** Death rates in orphanages at the time were much higher than death rates outside orphanages. Orphanages were abusive even by the standards of the time.

** I am not sure it's that consistent:

- Neville was dropped out of a window when his uncle tried to elicit his Accidental Magic. He ended up OK.
- Ron's brothers gave him a bona fide phobia. He ended up OK.
- Someone already pointed out that Voldemort was probably the abuser more than the abused.
- Was Sirius abused? He rebelled against his family when he came to Hogwarts and moved out shortly after, IIRC.
