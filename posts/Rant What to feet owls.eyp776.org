I'm always so annoyed when people write in their stories how they feet the owls some vegetables or corn or stuff.

Owls are birds of prey and exclusive carnivores. They don't have the digestive system for that stuff. At least give the poor animals some bacon or stuff!

** Seconding another guy's question, what kind of crappy fics are you reading? I've been reading fics for ~14-15 years, and never once saw vegetables as food for owls.

Owls wouldn't be able to eat bacon either, as JKR herself has acknowledged.

** I mean they're clearly magic, probably engineered or enchanted to be able to find people and be more intelligent and emotive than normal owls. If you create a messenger bird, you want it to be resilient and reliable, and that includes giving it the ability to survive just about anywhere. I reckon those birds can most likely eat anything.
