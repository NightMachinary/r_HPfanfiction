Prefer Drarry or Snarry, but I'm happy with any non-het pairing.


** I read slash all the time and have tons of favorites! Anything by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Saras_Girl/pseuds/Saras_Girl][saras_girl]] is great for Drarry and for Snarry I loved [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936][Cambiare Podentes]].

But I have hundreds of recs - waaaay to many to write here - on my [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][ao3 profile]]. They're all sorted with tags and my comments. You'll be able to tell pretty quick if we have similar taste in fics based on my comments I think.

Also if you do look through that and see any that I haven't read and are good, please let me know! I feel like I've read all the great Drarry at this point.

I know! I think that's why I liked it so much (even if the premise was kind of odd it worked.) I'm just not one for au s and occ and such which turn mostly keeps away from.

****** Ahh I get it. I hate OOC stuff too. And a lot of people say anything with Harry gay is OOC but I totally disagree - if the writer makes Harry still feel like canon Harry I'll read almost any pairing (hence my rec for that Snarry above).

You should try Put Your Guns Away it's Tea Time and the sequel if you love canon compliant stuff. It's rec'd in this thread and is the best thing I've read lately by far.

Also for a good "twisted canon" (like the events from canon are all the same but you find out other stuff was happening behind the scenes the whole time) fic, read [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/39680][Twist of Fate]]. It's in my top five fics of all time and is definitely my favorite romance.

*** I just read the first Cambiare Podentes last week! Honestly, the premise had me rolling my eyes big time (re: what Harry had to do) but I thought the execution of such a cheezy and cliched premise was actually really well done.

I agree that this is a good rec for what the OP is looking for because the pace/believability of the relationship growth here was actually some of the best I've read and definitely the best I've read in similarly troped fics.

**** Yeah this is actually the only Snarry I've ever liked other than time travel fics. In general I find the age difference weird and I think it would be so OOC for Harry to ever give Snape a chance romantically. The use of the trope that Harry HAS to be with Snape to save the world not only was well done but made Harry's relationship with Snape believable. Also there were so many times when I was reading it that I could relate to Harry so well (even though I've never been a slave lol). This is a great read for anyone who likes slash but usually hates Snarry.

** I don't have any recommendations besides those that have already been posted. The entire 'slash' genre lacks a lot of basic things. No denial, no finding yourself, no abuse. While the last one isn't a good thing, it's a defining moment and I doubt that everyone would be accepting of gay people.

A lot of fics just throw the relationship and one night everything clicks. Where's the failed relationships? The mixed signals from other men? Where's the revelation that the character is indeed gay.

There's no friendship to lovers, either. It's just a quick kiss and boom, done. Maybe I'm just a bit picky, but I've found it hard to find a decent and well-written slash fic that explores the discovery of it.

*** I really don't usually do this (and I apologize for crashing your thread, OP), but:

If you're at all interested in femslash, I wrote a somewhat long oneshot that is mostly Pansy Parkinson coming to terms with being queer. As a queer woman, I tried to at least incorporate some of what I hope are more realistic feelings & situations. In any case, there's certainly lots of confusion & mixed signals & worry of rejection from both the other person and their friends. Will totally understand if you're not interested though!

  Modern, non-magical, university AU. Pansy Parkinson is just fine, thank you very much, finishing up her degree with her best friend and mostly-boyfriend and no, she is not thinking about a certain pair of dark brown eyes and making a total fool of herself in the process. Unfortunately, Pansy Parkinson's year is about to go wildly off course.

** Ok, I'll try. [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3416][Know Thine Own Heart]] - Snarry, very AU. Some historical view, where Snape is clearly gay, and Harry not so much? A lot stuff happens. Some drama, some humour, some romance. If you have ever read those historical love novels, you might find it extra funny. :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9559865/1/Rebuilt][Rebuilt]] - Voldarry, also very AU. I absolutly love it, and it's slow build. Tom/Voldemort inrested in Harry in other way at first, but then wants him in every possible way. Action, adventure, mad max world style, impossible physics. :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2816397/1/Bloody-Skies][Bloody Skies]] - one of my fav fan fiction ever. Harry/OC, but totally worth it. Harry is gay, and its just a part of his character and story. He tries relationships, but it is not 'one and forever' type, no forced into gay-ness because veela / marriage / something else. But it is also not romance, there a lot of adventure and world-building, a lot of good original characters. And who he ends with in the end? Oh yesss, 5/5 cupcackes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721089/1/Dracos_Boy][Draco's Boy]] - I didn't read it to the end yet, Drarry, muggle AU. Also, slow build, from-friends-to-lovers?

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655266/1/To_Kill_You_With_A_Kiss][To Kill You With A Kiss]] - time travel, Tom/Harry. Romantic with some adventure. Also, kinda slow build.

  When Narcissa Malfoy calls in her life debt so that Severus can fulfill the terms of his grandfather's will and secure the Prince family estate, Harry agrees to marry Severus Snape and live with him for a year and a day. But Prince Manor hides a secret in its overgrown gardens, and Narcissa isn't helping Severus out because of her kind heart. Harry thinks he's going into the marriage with eyes wide open, but he has to maneuver around the Malfoys' machinations and come to terms with his growing feelings for Severus even as the magic in the gardens gives his life a new, unexpected purpose.

** There are exactly two stories with slash that I've both read in their entirety and actually liked. The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][The Sacrifices Arc]] and the second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1343968/1/Snakes-and-Lions][Snakes-and-Lions]]. Of the two, Snakes and Lions contains a pretty realistic romance. There is a sequel up in the authors [[http://gatewaygirl.insanejournal.com/][insanejournal]] page.

** I recently read linkao3(at your service by faithwood) and liked it. It kinda continues the Draco obsession from HBP and I don't think Harry realizes he likes Draco until very late on in fic.

also I remember I used to really like linkffn(eclipse by mijan). Also ends in Harry and Draco together.

Just realized I don't like to read actual relationship. Just like to read them getting to the relationship .....

Also second the marriage stone which was posted elsewhere.

  [Traduction] ...Tu es un homme mort, Potter. Tu vas me le payer !... Lorsque Draco Malefoy jura de venger son père, Harry faillit bien lui rire au nez. Mais cette fois ce ne sont pas des blagues de collégiens que Draco a en tête. [slash post t.5]

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.
