  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that?I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister.Oh god.(Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.

** linkffn(You Were Always There)

It's not explicitly a self-insert, but it's an OC story that seems like a pretty standard self-insert. It's... I don't know. If you just want to read a Harry Potter story on a fanfiction site, it's perfect for you. It's written well enough, not full of spelling and grammar mistakes, and it's got plenty of reviews from people that loved it, but it's just... unimaginative.

Basic idea is that Harry makes a friend (OC) in the neighborhood as a child, and that friend ends up going to Hogwarts with him. Friendship eventually turns to romance, like you'd expect. My issue is that it's just the exact same story. I read the first 3 (there are 6 parts currently, one per Hogwarts year), and the OC character doesn't have any impact on the story at all. She's just there. Aside from being nice to Harry pre-Hogwarts, she doesn't /do/ anything that doesn't happen in the original story. It's as if the author just threw in a random OC to be Harry's eventual love interest, and instead of actually creating a role for the OC in the story, they just gave her half of Hermione's lines. Every single thing the OC does that affects the plot is something that Hermione (or, rarely, another character) does in the original story. Other than that, she's just there to compliment people, be complimented, talk about how she hates Malfoy, and flirt with Fred and George.

  During his childhood, Harry hated being with his aunt and uncle at Privet Drive. Yet there was always the one person who made him happy, who made it bearable. Mia Thatcher was his first and best friend, and nothing could pull them apart. What happens when they both receive letters from Hogwarts? What adventures will they face and will they pull through together?
