Redeemed Draco stories are kind of iffy with me, I'm rather critical on them, even though I love reading Draco stories/redeemed Draco as a sort of guilty pleasure.

But, so many of them happen because it's about the ship, and not about the person. Like people redeem Draco, because they want him shipped with Harry, Hermione, Luna or Ginny in their story, and in order for that to work, he has to be redeemed.

BUT! Here's the thing, I don't want a story where Draco is redeemed and he ends up with someone, I want to see him struggling to convince others that he's trying to change, while also having "relapses"

Have it be difficult for Draco to be on the Light side.

Have it be where people like Harry, Ron, and the others distrust him, have it be where he lets it slip and accidentally insults Hermione and calls her a Mudblood, or calls Ron a traitor to Purebloods, et cetra.

NO pairings with Draco.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Edit: Draco can end up in a pairing, but it has to be minor, not the main affect of his change.

Is probably the best example of this. Draco is forced to live as a muggle post war.

** Been a while since I read it, but I think Draco's a bit like that in Harry Potter and the Worth of the Soul, linkffn(7388739). There is a ship for Draco in the epilogue, but not in the main story. Sorry if my memory of him is wrong, but even if it is, the story's really good, and I hope you'd enjoy it anyway.

** linkao3(The Dragon and the Moon)

It seems ship-centric from the title (I'm sorry!) and it's a bit of an odd pairing, but there isn't any romance for a solid 100k words. It mostly just feels like friendship development. There's a lot of mistrust between Draco and the other students, and it's written sooooo beautifully that I couldn't not recommend it. He slips a LOT. It's wonderful.

** Okay, so, not sure if it fits all your criteria but, while Tea With Mrs Granger is going to be a D/Hr pairing in the sequel but the first part is pretty much no relationshippy stuff at all. It's got a very interesting premise and has a Draco working through /Stuff/ to be better.

It's one I looked forward to every time it was updated. It does have some content warning stuff though (it's in the tags)
