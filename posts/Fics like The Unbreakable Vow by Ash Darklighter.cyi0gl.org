Pretty much what the title says. I decided to read The Unbreakable Vow after having been in a reading drought for a while now and I /loved/ it. Unfortunately, now that I've finished it, I'm back to not knowing what to read, so if anybody has some recs that would be great!

I'm a /huge/ Hinny fan but I'm fine with reading outside of that, too, as long as it is Harry centric. My only request is that, for the romance fics, Harry be paired with someone his own age and preferably not Hermione, Daphne, or Draco (although if you have a really good rec with them together that's fine too). I also don't care about the length or if it's completed or not, as I binge read uncompleted fics a /lot/.

Thank you for any help you can provide in advance!

So you've basically exhausted the pool of decent hinny fics? Asking cos if you haven't, go to harryandginny sub and look for the rec post; if you have, I wonder if you've read linkffn(essence of revenge by tgfoy) before and if so, how is it?

  The battle was over. The victors woke into a new dawn, a new era had been born. They were free to live, free to find happiness, free to love. But a cloud drew across their world almost unnoticed, a darkness gathered strength. A new plot conceived. Vengeance approached. Harry must face a new battle, a war for his very being. A story of the 14 months after the battle of Hogwarts.
