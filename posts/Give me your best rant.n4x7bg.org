It has to be harry potter related but apart from that no restrictions.

Your fav or most hated character or ship or plot points or fic or head canon or whatever.

That thing thats harry potter related you could drone on about for hours.


** Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw's colours in fanfic VS canon

In fanfiction it seems like a crime if a Gryffindor character wears green; one of the most favorited "prank" seem to be the Marauders/the Weasleys/ Harry to dye something from the Slytherins in red and gold. Like wearing the colours of another house is very embarrassing.

I only realised that recently - because that's such an big deal in fanon, that I started to believe there are some roots in canon. Turns out there isn't:

The robes Molly buys for Harry in fourth year are green, nobody gives a f*;

The main colour of the Malfoys sitting room is red;

The Burrow doesn't show any Gryffindor-colours;

Ron's room is orange, because of his Quidditch-Team;

Slughorn's party decoration is mostly golden;

The only two characters who ever had colour-coordinated rooms were Sirius and Regulus Black - and let's be honest here: that was classic teenager rebellion/angst. Sirius' mother wasn't happy that he was in Gryffindor - so his whole room became red and gold. Regulus wanted to show his parents he is not like his brother - so his room became silver and green. If you look at those rooms Sirius and Regulus were the most teenagiest teenagers in a series full of teenagers - and we didn't even get to know them at that age really: it's in their rooms alone (and I give it to J.K.R - that is a writing/characterization masterpiece).

Anyway - back to my point: the only two characters who ever gave a damn about the house colours are two (troubled) teenagers. But in Harry Potter fanfic it is treated like that is some thing even adults really care about.

** Just a few statements on mis-used characters:

*Hedwig*.\\
In canon Hedwig is basically a symbol of Harry's connection to the Wizarding world, then an avatar of his anger, but then there's the Battle of Seven Potters. She's treated like an action figure accessory, stuck in a cage during an AERIAL battle, until murdered. At least in the movies they had the good sense to allow her to actively sacrifice her life for Harry.

Or howabout *Ginny*?

How much cooler would it have been in book seven if Ginny was the one to help Hermione and Ron down to the Chamber of Secrets. That sounds like an awesome scene to play out -- Ginny revealing that her exposure to the diary left her a parselmouth, then she has to return to the scene of the trauma, plus possibly being one to kill the horcrux in Hufflepuff's Cup. Totally would have proven her worth instead of an editorial note about her being Harry's 'soul-mate' or whatever.

Consider *Ron*, who in fanfic is sometimes made into Ron the Betrayer.

I wish that there had never been a canon instance of Ron turning his back on Harry. He stood by him to face giant fucking spiders and stood in front of him when he thought Sirius Black was going to kill Harry. It could have been a bromance of the ages, if Ron had been the one to stand up and say 'I believe Harry' when his name came out of the Tri-wizard Cup, and I think it would have been a better turn if Hermione was the one to get mind-bent by the horcrux enough to get separated from the trio in the last book.

Could you imagine that? Dumbledore believes in Ron enough to give him a book of fairy tales but hands the light-stealing/giving device to Hermione, knowing that she will become frustrated or might be lost along the way and need to find Harry again. When she leaves, EVERYONE would think Harry and Ron are essentially screwed. Ron would agree to visiting Godric's Hollow because he understands how important family can be to a person.

In her absence, the two men would fight but afterwards they would also confess their feelings for the girls in their lives. Ron would resolve to tell Hermione how he feels with Harry's encouragement... if they ever find her again. In the meantime, they'd listen close to Potterwatch in fear of hearing that she'd been captured.

Don't get me started on *Tonks* -- JKR invented this really cool character with awesome abilities who should have been central to the Orders strategy to monitor and undermine the Death Eaters' infiltration of the Ministry, and she's either stuck on babysitting duty, blubbering about because of a guy, or sidelined with a pregnancy. It's like 'We have Wonder Woman on our side. She's a great cook. I love her souvlaki.'

*** Ron I think especially shouldnt have been the one to leave the second time since he left in goblet of fire. It just feels repetitive and like he hasn't grown when he has. Hermione left the group actively in book 3 but it didn't feel the same. Harry didn't get to miss her the way he had with Ron in book 4. Hermione leaving in book 7 would have let him miss her in the same way.

Ugh everything about Tonks bothers me in book 6. Nothing about her character in book 5 suggests that she would get so attached to a crush rejecting her that she would mope for a whole year shes 24 not 14. It really feels like Rowling wanted all the Marauders to die and one to leave behind a orphan for Harry to be the godfather of for a parallel and ruined Tonk's character and all the interesting potential she had just for a parralel. Just so she could have a kid and then die.

Also its really fucked up Remus was pressured into a relationship and then within months just had to accept becoming a father no time to even acclimatize to a relationship .

**** To be honest, I can see Tonks' point of view on the relationship in another way. It feels like this person that she probably got to know better in the Order, especially since they both have strong feelings for each other, is sort of avoiding a relationship for fear. Remus fears rejection because he thinks he deserves it. Then Tonks has feelings for him and tries to make him understand that she knows about his condition and chose to be with him anyway. Remus is a great person, but sometimes his insecurities make him a coward, and the whole thing made me reckon that he fears rejection, so he rejects people first.

However, it still annoys me because she was too patient. I feel like Remus needed a lot of therapy before starting a relationship. I feel like she shouldn't have tried so much, not because it makes her whiny or whatever, but because he doesn't deserve it. She doesn't have to fix him.

***** I think thats how Rowling intended it. But in execution in my opinion it doesn't come out that way because you aren't shown you are told. Or at least it can be easily misinterpreted.

But also even if Remus fears rejection and feels hes not deserving and says no then the answer shouldn't be to pressure him after a funeral. They should have still waited till he became comfortable enough to engage with this voluntarily without outside pressure.

I dont think pining is inherently bad but it just seems inconsistent with the character you knew before. Especially on this level when its just a crush it's not even like they were together for some time but he broke up because of his self loathing. That I could understand more. Though Considering Tonks was only 24 at this point and Remus was 37 that age difference gets more squeamish for me if they started dating got together earlier when Tonks was younger.

****** I think at this age it's a grey area. If she was 19 or 20, I'd say she's too young, but at 22-24 you are supposed to be more mature already. The difference varies from person to person.

The problem is that we don't know much about them, especially Tonks, and we don't get to see how their relationship evolved, as you said. I agree that she shouldn't have insisted so much, but this might just be who she is, in the sense of trying to fix problems, fighting for people she cares about, etc. Tonks seems to be that sibling / friend who doesn't give up on you even after you gave up on yourself. It would make sense that she'd do the same for a romantic interest. Though, I agree that it was poorly executed.

Since we don't know them well, it could be anything. Maybe she was stressed out, which just added up to their issues, but she usually is better than that. Maybe she really is whiny and immature. We don't have enough information.

True. In her defence, it must be hard to keep track of everything and she is very creative, she pretty much invented a culture. But yes, sometimes she loses track of what is already established and creates some plot holes e.g. the Fidelius Charm.

*** I'm currently thinking of rewriting a bunch of books in the series. I recently ran with the idea that someone made about Harry getting some of Lily's book that was written in Ancient Runes (I have a guilty pleasure for fics where Harry's super interested in history and Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies, so that's what I'm writing), and now I want to write an AU Goblet of Fire. That'll probably just follow the idea I got. I also had the idea of making Ginny a Parselmouth. I think that would be really cool to mention, and I have the idea of both Harry and Ginny apprenticing under Bill for Curse-Breaking. That'd be wicked. If you want to check out a scene that I wrote for it, I could link it?

Also, while I have a guilty pleasure for Harry being super abused, I'm actually going to have him and Petunia reconcile. Maybe Dudley, as well.

And he knew something was going to happen at hogwarts enough to start hurting harry as soon as the summer started with stealing letters even though lucius doesn't seem to have had an actual plan. It was in many ways the least likely scenario for tom to manifest as lucius plan involved handing a sentient book to a girl whose father identifies and destroys sentient objects at his day job.

He refuses to listen to harry when he asks him to stop and actively sought to get his guardians to hurt him. And ultimately he could see harry seemingly constantly but never offers any help with the basilisk.

Slytherin house is hated on so much from the fanfics I've seen, and almost everyone is evil and agrees with pureblood bullshit.

If Rowling made say-Blaise Zabini or Daphne Greengrass becomes friends with Harry and flesh their personalities out, it would be so much better! It would be a fair show of Slytherin and show that NOT ALL SLYTHERINS ARE FUCKING EVIL. That shit is so ridiculous.

** Why the fuck did Fleur Delacour get a part-time job at Gringotts to improve her English?

I'm putting the “Fleur was a favorite to be chosen as a Champion” and manipulative!Dumbledore messes with the Goblet of Fire shit from fanon and movies aside.

When the Goblet of Fire announces the champions in the books (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong) Harry mainly recognises her for her looks, not because of some silly entrance pirouette.

#+begin_quote
  “It's her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
#+end_quote

We know it was a great honor to be chosen, and some of the other Beauxbatons students took the Goblet's decision differently than, hm let's say, Angelina Johnson.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh look, they're all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
#+end_quote

I think it's safe to assume that Madame Maxime wouldn't take some average students to compete at the Triwizard Tournament -- meaning that Fleur was one of the best.

We also know that Fleur was quite passionate about it:

#+begin_quote
  “Why should 'e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot.“'E 'as ze chance to compete, 'asn't 'e? We 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money --- zis is a chance many would die for!”
#+end_quote

Fleur was not only highly skilled and undeniably pretty; she was brave, and as we get to see later, caring. Even if we skip everything that happened to her before the Third Task, come on -- she was attacked by a fellow champion who was under the Imperius Curse, the second champion died, and the third one came back with a corpse, tortured and with a sliced arm, claiming that a DARK LORD CAME BACK TO LIFE.

What does Fleur do next? She moves to LONDON.

Not only that, she does it almost immediately -- Harry came to Grimmauld on August 6th 1995 and he finds out that Bill already works with her at Gringotts.

Why? To improve her Eenglish. NO. Just no. This makes me so mad. Fleur Delacour is NOT a character who is “wordly” #wanderlust #travel. NO. She laughed derisively when Dumbledore wished them welcome upon their arrival, she shamelessly sat with a muffler wrapped around her head and was completely displeased with foreign food and disliked HOGWARTS.

J.K.Rowling made such an amazing, complex character and completely ruined it for me. What was the point of her coming back? Having a wedding in the seventh book? She could have easily used Remus and Tonks for that one. It would have even been a bigger thrill; Remus being a werewolf and Tonks being an auror estranged from her pureblood family, mainly the murderous Death Eater aunt.

Just... ruined. I know it's silly since it's a minor character, this probably is not even worth to rant about, but it really irks me. Don't even let me get started on Tonks or Ginny. Yikes.

*** I'd like to add to that that Bill Weasley was born in 1970 and Ron in 1980. As someone with siblings both 10 and 12 years older I'd like to say you have zero common ground with your siblings life experiences, social contacts and interests at the age of 16. Sure, you love your siblings, but there is a certain disconnect there.

If I were 16, and my sibling came home with a girl I went to school with, who was only 3 years older than I, I'd be overcome with a certain "ick" feeling. This is a sentiment my brother shares because I know he expressed as much to me when I was 16, and one of his friends introduced him to his 16 y/o girlfriend. I am pretty sure that was one of the reasons their 2 decades of friendship sort fizzled out shortly after.

That shouldn't be any different from Bill when he ran into the girl his kid-brother's best friend had to compete against in school at his job. The second he heard her age he should have instinctively planted her right between Percy and the twins, age wise. You know, his significantly younger siblings.

It feels extremely predatory. And it should have definitely felt that way for Bill as well.

I would have found Remus & Nymphadora's marriage a lot more palatable to read more about despite their age difference being larger solely due to the fact that Nymphadora was older by the time she fell for Remus and was in a secure financial position by having a job for some time, and had family to fall back on within the country.

**** I remember there was a part about when the competitors families were visiting in the books for the last task the weasleys had come for harry.

The quote was something along the lines of "Fleur was eyeing up Bill's long hair and fang earring with interest." I often took that as read that that was Fleur the one who chased Bill, not the other way around. Hence why, if she found out about him working for Gringotts, would make sense she would seek work for a "chance" encounter.

Also this is probably mostly based in fanon, but I do accept it, that Fleur being part veela means that she often has men of all ages falling over themselves for a chance with her (considering how say Ron and Roger Davies acted around her plus how the wizards reacted to the full veela at the quidditch world cup).

I feel that Bill probably wasn't just with her for her looks or affected by her Veela powers and she really appreciated that fact and that actually made them able to have an actual relationship instead of someone just looking for a trophy wife.

** you opened this can of worms.... why I love Ron Weasley to the bone.

Let's just say I am a huge sucker for the whole 'underdog' character, aka the character who is just... less good at things compared to his peers which fit Ron very well, but despite this, he still takes on the same challenges and threats that Hermione and Harry does, even if he could just walk away at any time and live a much easier and less dangerous life, he stays by their side through thick and thin, even if he is nothing special in terms of power, intelligence or ability.

He is a loyal friend, the heart of the golden trio, and the guy that is a reality check to Hermione and Harry.\\
Without Ron, Harry would be a miserable lonely kid with barely any friends.\\
Without Ron, Hermione would be a secluded book-worm without any friends, spending all her time with her nose in the books, and not truly experiencing life to its fullest.\\
He is the guy that keeps them happy and bound to earth.

Also, I seriously think he gets a bad rep. Yes, he has made mistakes, but that only makes him human and relatable and people are way too quick to demonize him for his actions.\\
like examples:

1. people call him disloyal, despite sticking with Harry through it all. Yes, there was the fourth year, but he was a teenager going through a very hormonal part of his life with the added burden of his inferiority complex. I can fully understand that the tournament was just the straw that broke the camel's back after a lifetime of being in the shadow of not only his siblings but also his best friends. It had to come around at some point.\\
   Also before anyone mentions him leaving them at the Horcrux hunt, he was CLEARLY influenced by the Horcrux and in much worse pain than the rest due to him being splinched and therefor weaker due to him needing to recover from a heavy physical injury. If anyone blames him from that, they can try to cut off a piece of their arm and try to see how great a mood they are in, while also barely getting enough food to live and no true medical treatment.
2. people call him mean and a bully towards others, especially Hermione. Yet those same people tend to forget that Hermione is just as harsh towards Ron and equally guilty of being a bully at times and being mean-spirited towards others.\\
   Also, all those 'fights' Hermione and Ron have? It is rare it is actually a true fight where they get hurt emotionally. Hermione and Ron both love to argue with each other, they enjoy the exchange of words and ideas and just riling each other up, they both love it and it is rare it goes too far (and often when it goes too far, they are equally to blame)\\
   They even get offended if Harry says their arguments are annoying or tells them to be silent. That should be enough evidence that they like the 'fighting' and arguments.
3. people call him bad for thinking Slytherin's are bad.\\
   This one just makes me laugh. Yes, there is a lack of proper character-depth in the average Slytherin, but it is blatantly clear that Slytherin's are either A) Supporting Voldemort or B) Neutral towards Voldemort. When a Slytherin fights against Voldemort, it is the exception to the rule, the minority of a minority.\\
   If suddenly 1/4 of a school suddenly said they either supported terrorists killing my family or were neutral towards the idea, then I would be fucking pissed at that group as well and see them as awful human beings.

Not to say he is flawless, however, as he has many flaws as mentioned including, but not limited to: He can be lazy, (Lack of focus on studies unless needed badly and tends to rely on Hermione for aid)\\
jealous (speaks for itself)\\
loud-mouthed and often has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth and speak before thinking\\
a tad judgemental (Slytherins, even if I think that is somewhat justified)\\
can hold a serious grudge against those he feels have wronged him and when he gets angry, he is very stubborn about it.

So yeah, I fucking love Ron Weasley. He is a great friend, a stabilizing element to the Golden Trio. He has many great attributes, but many flaws that are VERY human and too many fans, often those who only watched the movie and thus got a wrong representation of Ron Weasley, tend to demonize him over unfairly, despite other characters having equally large flaws or just objectively worse flaws, yet them being ignored or straight up forgiven.\\
There are legit reasons to dislike his character, even if I disagree, but often I feel like those reasons are inflated to the extreme or just taken out of context (either accidentally or on purpose)

Lucius Malfoy tried to kill Arthurs only daughter out of pettiness. I am pretty sure Arthur had lots of reasons to hate Lucius even before that - and none of them has anything to do with him being Slytherin or a Malfoy.

Especially if you think about that Arthurs mother was most likely a Slytherin and from a equally "dark" family as the Malfoys are.

No, it's Lucius Malfoy and his actions Arthur hates.

also, I don't think we ever see any evidence of Hermione being 'marginalized' by the other girls. If anything she is the one marginalizing Lavender and Parvati due to their love for divination and their girly behaviour.\\

*** Sirius is one of my favorite characters, and I like to think that he would have suffered the same fate as Remus had he lived to Deathly Hallows.

I've been thinking lately, you know that bad Remus Lupin moment at Grimmauld Place? It only happened because Rowling had this idea of /just the three of them/ going on the Horcrux Hunt, and I think she used Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore a lot here. But that wasn't enough. Simply saying that it's Dumbledore's orders is not enough to keep one of your father's best friends to help you. It's not real.

Hey, an experienced adult wizard who deeply cares for you want to help you with the extremely dangerous (and lethal) quest? No, thanks, it needs to be just Harry, Ron and Hermione. Ooh, we can make something important keep you away! A pregnant wife? Sure, let's roll with that.

She made Remus a bad guy here, but I don't think she had any other choice, really. She could have made him not come to them at all, but that would be out of character. She could have made Harry say that he made an Unbreakable Vow with Dumbledore, but Harry would then have to lie. If this weren't a young adult book, it might have been plausible, but nope. Having Harry turn into a liar right before their plan to steal from Umbridge... not good.

So Remus had to be a bad guy. Or dead.

Had Sirius been alive at the point, it would have been even harder to keep him away from the Horcrux Hunt. And even though I still get teary-eyed when I read that chapter in the Order of the Phoenix, I would rather have him dead than turned into someone with even more mistakes. We know he made a couple already.

Like Snapes Redemption should have been about him changing his mind about blood supremacy not his obsession with Lilly. But Rowling probably liked the doing things out of love narrative

Rowling wanted A marauder to leave behind a kid for Harry to adopt as the kids godfather as a parallel to his own situation. But she fucked over Tonk's character to do it and ruined so much potential with Tonks just to make a orphan right before the end of story.

What werewolves symbolize is interesting but then creating Greyback making him a werewolf supremacist who is psychotic and targets children....Rowling wtf

Tom Riddle paralleling Harry is interesting and neat Except you made the biggest leader for the blood supremacy movement a half blood who would probably be treated as a muggleborn by blood supremacists when he entered the Wizarding world knowing essentially nothing about it. It makes way more sense he'd hate wizarding elites as much as he hates the muggles . Him creating a movement that thrives on blood supremacy when he thinks hes half blood makes no sense . The half blood being the biggest threat to muggleborns and the biggest proponent of pureblood supremacy while he's fought by a group that mostly pureblood is weird.

I think that unless you are doing an AU where Hermione is dark from the start of the fic or where Draco has switched sides earlier, like in 4th or 5th year, it is a horrible pairing. It just doesn't work for me, because he is canonically xenophobic, and a Voldemort supporter by his 5th or 6th year. I get that when you are 11 or 12, you are more than likely just parroting your parents' views, but in CoS, he clearly states that he believes all muggleborns to die. In PoA, Malfoy is clearly stated to have been ignoring Hagrid, and then insults Buckbeak and expects Buckbeak to not react, despite Hagrid telling the entire class that they're “easily offended,” and that it ”might be the last thing you do.” To me, this ship is like writing a fictional story about Nazi Germany, and pairing a high ranking Nazi official with a Jewish woman.

** My biggest rant issue right now is all the people saying JKR is a terrible writer in HP fan sites across Reddit and tumblr.

Like every concept that you're writing about from magic ones like disillusionment charms and dementors to extremely complex characterizations like Sirius and Remus, to the childlike fun in Fred and George or Ron's snark are all her creation.

Their favorite is that JKR sucks at world building. The HP world is literally the best world building in a book. All YA adults strive to be like her and are not as enjoyable.

Another is that JKR does poor characterizations. Said my authors who are writing Remus as a timid cinnamon roll and Sirius as a playboy or Harry as some superman asshole and Hermione as a shrill do-gooder. JK's characterizations are so on point and real compared with the many stereotypes in fanfiction.

Finally, they say JKR was anti many things in her books: 1. SPEW shows JK against social justice and activism-- the SPEW arc is one of my favourites as it is SO REAL. The people you save have often internalized abuse and the way it plays out is pitch perfect. 2. Tonks was coded trans and then made to marry Remus--I know many people just like Tonks who are cis-het. With her personality, you can't just say 100% that she was trans. Why can't you be an amazing auror, cool, a tomboy and be cis-het? 3. JKR is anti-diversity--Given the time the books were written, they were at the time celebrated for their diversity. She had all ethnicities, sexualities, etc. Its like damning Jane Austen for not making any of her female characters an engineer.

I can understand people saying JKR is a terrible writer in a Margaret Atwood fan site. Sure, thats not a forum dedicated to a world created by JKR. But in a HP fansite? You're literally proving the opposite of what you're trying to say.

BONUS: also not a fan of fanfic where author clearly hasnt read the books and rants about inconsistencies that were discussed in detail in the books.

Also worth mentioning that Tonks' possible trans/poly-ness doesn't preclude hooking up with Remus, a character allegorically tagged as AIDS sufferer and who was originally 'played as gay' by the actor.

Your suggestion that fans had coded her as Trans and were upset by her being treated as just another girl, I partway agree with and disagree with; sure, she filled a masculine role with a special power that suggested uncommon gender and/or sexuality, but I don't agree that her falling for and marrying Remus invalidates the suggestion. The fact that one of the most competent characters around was sidelined for a tragic romance and ill-timed pregnancy is what drives me batty.

Regarding tragic romance and pregnancy, that's what I found so nuanced. I know so many people like tonks who had a similar life trajectory. I am in a profession similar to tonks (not police or any armed force, but similar) and am surrounded by women like her. While most do not go this way, a proportion do fall in love tragically and get pregnant. I really appreciated that jk upended expectations there. You meet tonks and you think she's gonna be badass all the way through and fight the war properly but another aspect of real life happens.

** Be prepared, hot take incoming here and it probably won't be well received by you guys but fuck it here I go.

People need to cool off and calm the fuck down about the whole Snape bullying thing. Here's my opinion. I don't give a fuck that he's a bully. That's right. Snape is a bastard, and a dickhead, and a nasty person to be around unless you're a Slytherin or a member of the staff...that said, I don't give two shits about his 'bullying' of students. It's blown way out of proportion and people hate on the man way too much. He's a dick to students? Big fucking deal. Even the Neville's greatest fear thing is blown /so fucking far out of proportion by some people in this fandom that it's fucking mind boggling./ If you take the time to re-read PoA again, you'll realize the whole thing was a fucking joke! Even Neville was laughing at it because the idea was outrageous. The entire class was laughing because Neville didn't want to admit it and even he had a laugh about it!

I find it hilarious that people have so much outrage on Harry's behalf about Snape that even when the man himself forgives him, people can't seem to let go of their hate for a fictional character. I've even seen takes of people saying he's worse than Riddle, Umbridge and Bellatrix combined like WTF? How the hell is being a dickhead and insulting students worse than torturing people to insanity or orchestrating genocide? Honestly. Snape is a dick but he's just that, a dick. People try to make him out to be a child abuser when he's just an asshole. The Snape hate in recent years is so far gone it's hilarious. Seriously folks, he's a dick head, not the devil, not a child abuser. And I might be one of the few people here that likes the fact that he's a dick to Harry. Whenever they're in the same room I love their interactions and the fact that Harry doesn't back down makes them even better. Most people hate Snape because he constantly rails on Harry and that's cool...but I'm the opposite, their mutual antagonism is great and I love the fact that he's an asshole.

If you're the second or third most important person to saving the wizarding world (Behind Harry and arguably Dumbledore IMO) then you earn the right to be a dick to those around you. People blow Snape's assholery way out of proportion and say it's 'unforgivable' and Snape doesn't deserve any forgiveness whatsoever. Since when is being a bad teacher and an asshole an offense punishable by rotting in the seventh level of hell?

*** Alot of people shit on the marauders for the whole prank thing with Lupin and the Snapes worst memory incident.

So they make them feel guilty for that incident in fics and stop bullying Snapes post wolf incident.

But thats not really what happened Snape's worst memory was after the werewolf incident. Sirius and Lupin confirm their antagonism towards Snape didn't stop after the worst memory it was just less blatant all the time.

And this makes sense since its indicated this was a back and forth with Snape and his soon to be official Death eater friends vs the Marauders. And because Snape was actively stalking the Marauders to out Lupin as a werewolf

It also makes sense because this was literally during a war and Snape was openly supporting wizard Nazis in front of everyone but Lilly. Thats why everyone around them just watches because Lilly is in denial at this point but everyone else knows. No one is sympathetic to the actual Nazi being made miserable. Neither is Lilly once he calls her a slur and she can't be in denial anymore.

Its suprising to me that there aren't more fics making the marauders sympathetic in their feud with Snape considering he's a blood supremacist who supports a genocidal snake man wouldn't be hard to do.

**** You raise some good points OP. I would just like to point out that JKR herself has described the Marauders' behavior as "relentless bullying" on several occasions and that the bullying started well before Snape displayed any blood supremacist views in 1st Year. I won't lie and say that later on as Snape got more and more involved with his roommates that he didn't gain beliefs in blood supremacy but he clearly didn't harbor those beliefs in the beginning. Later on Snape, became a piece of work, but in early days the Marauders targeted him for little to no reason in my opinion.

After all, let's not forget who started this whole feud. On the train James mocks him first by saying "I'd rather leave than be in Slytherin". If James had just said nothing and kept his nose out of what was meant to be a private conversation between Severus and Lily then nothing would have happened.

Snape did gain blood supremacist views later on in his life at Hogwarts(likely acquired due to his growing friendship with Mulciber and Avery) but the Marauders started bullying him way before all that. JKR herself says that James bullied Snape because he was jealous of his friendship with Lily, and since she's the author, I trust her judgement more than Sirius and Lupin saying they bullied him because he was "up to his nose in the dark arts". Jealousy was the root cause of James' desire to humiliate and degrade Snape, and that's why they bullied him(initially).

Furthermore, I'd like to ask you OP, why do you think Snape became friends with his roommates? Personally, I believe that they offered him protection from the Marauders in exchange for Snape's expertise and knowledge of Dark Magic. As far as Snape using Dark Magic debacle, I am of the opinion that he strictly learned and never used Dark Magic during his early years. Granted, Lupin describes Sectumsempra as a 'speciality' of Snape's but Snape only invented that spell in sixth year owing by the fact that he'd written it down(In HBP) in a NEWT textbook that Harry appropriates in 6th year. So in the first five years, Snape has not used any Dark Magic at all(not even one time) since Lily never flings that accusation at him and never confronts him about it.

I will not defend Snape in regard to his actions as a death eater because they are indefensible and frankly he was an evil bastard for joining Riddle, you and I are in agreement there OP. But Snape's tale is a cautionary one, ask yourself do you think if the Marauders had merely left him alone he would have grown closer with his housemates? Better yet, do you think he would have joined the DEs if he was just left alone to keep to himself during his school days?

Snape did support blood supremacists in his later years that much is true and I concede that, but the books indicate that he only accrued those views at a later date well after the Marauders started bullying him. So what is their justification for bullying Snape then in his early years(IE years 1-4) if he's not a blood supremacist? Dark Magic? Nope. He only invented Sectumsempra in 6th year after five years of bullying and Lily never accuses Snape of using dark magic(but she does accuse of him of associating with people that do use dark magic tbf). Was it because he's a Slytherin? Quite possibly, hardly grounds for justification for bullying someone simply because of their house but that might feed into their rationale. The Author herself said James was jealous of Snape because he had the one thing he could never have. So while they bullied him perhaps in later years because of valid reasons like Snape's views and his desire to join Voldy, I want you to know OP that the reason they bullied Snape first is because of jealousy.

***** Firstly Snape was already anti muggle before hogwarts . This is from his memories before hogwarts.

/"I know who you are. You're that Snape boy! They live down Spinner's End by the river," she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. "Why have you been spying on us?"/

/"Haven't been spying," said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. "Wouldn't spy on you, anyway," he added spitefully, "you're a Muggle."/

He also already had anti muggleborn sentiments.

/Normally," said Snape. "But you're Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents."/

/"Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?"/

/Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair./

/"No," he said. "It doesn't make any difference."/

This isn't him deciding that being muggleborn isn't bad no matter what purity nonsense he's heard. This is him deciding Lilly is the exception. Something he further backs up when he goes to applogize to Lilly for the slur and doesn't get why being a bigot and making Lilly the exception would be bad

/"Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends-- you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"/

/He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking./

/"I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine."/

/"No-- listen, I didn't mean--"/

/"-- to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?"/

As for James and Sirius they start their feud with Severus in my opinion to impress each other not because they feel any sort of way about Snape.

/"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile./

/"My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said./

/"Blimey," said James, "and I thought you seemed all right!"/

/Sirius grinned./

/"Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"/

/James lifted an invisible sword./

/"'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad."/

/Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him./

/"Got a problem with that?"/

/"No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy--"/

/"Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?" interjected Sirius./

/James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike./

/"Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment."/

/"Oooooo..."/

/James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed./

/"See ya, Snivellus!" a voice called, as the compartment door slammed.../

James has a bias against Slytherin for unknown reasons but is loud about it . But he likes Sirius so far and Sirius would like to distance himself from his family as soon as possible and he getting along with this James kid. 

Snape makes a snide retort at James that's pro Slytherin. Sirius seeing pro Slytherin as the same as bigots like his family and wanting to back up this new kid he likes fires back.

James approves since Snape looks down on the house he is attached to and has developed a immediate distaste. Then Sirius joins him in mocking Lilly aka Snapes friend. They being little shits but little shits who don't care about anyone's approval but each others.  And from what little we see of them in school this continues to be their dynamic.

When James harrassing Snape in book 5 Snapes worst memory Lilly gets him to back off but when she leaves he goes right back to harrassing Snape even though at this point he likes her and knows she wouldn't approve. That doesn't matter. The person whose approval matters is Sirius. James starts dramatically fucking with Snape because they both hate Snape and like seeing him miserable. And he decides to fuck with Snape because Sirius is bored and wants him to liven up.

Not saying that a great thing because that's kinda fucked up. But it wasn't because of jealousy. It was because they enjoy fucking with people they hate/dislike as far as what they depict in the books. And why they do hate him is pretty open ended it never really explored. But given they join the Order hate blood supremacists and werewolf haters and dark magic users I dont think hating Snape cuz of his bigotry and interest in dark arts is a unfair assumption.

Because while sectumsempra may have been created only 6th year by him ( though I swear that was the spell he used end of 5th year on James in the memory but it is unspecified) Im sure he didn't just wake up first day 6th year decide to play with dark magic and make sectumsempra that same year.

Im fairly sure he'd been dabbling with the dark arts for a few years to come up with a good effective dark spell. (Also I personally think the Marauders got more vindictive after the werewolf incident because they were mad at Snape stalking them and trying to out Lupin and now they didn't have to worry about that but were still pissed at him. So while im sure it was pretty intense for a period of time before Snapes worst memory and probably for a significant time after, I think it started out pretty non intense. Snide comments mostly maybe trying to trip each other im assuming for a while. It started because they rubbed each other the wrong way and later the Marauders hated him for being a bigot.)

But what is in my opinion a unfair assumption is saying the Marauders influenced snape to become friends with death eaters because of their bullying when he was already a bigot before he ever met them. Not to mention that being bullied by two purebloods who happen to dislike blood supremacy doesn't immediately lead you to supporting genocidal blood supremacists especially not when your best friend is a member of the class they want to genocide. This is not a natural cause and effect.

As for interviews and stuff I dont really count those as canon. I only count whats in the books not just cuz Rowling has added weird shit into the world lately but also cuz interpretation of text should be able to stand on its own without the authors interviews death of the author and all that.

I will say its really questionable making halfbloods who would definetly be shit on and just flat out considered muggleborns by many pure blood supremacists be the ones who very on board with the beliefs and do so much to spread those beliefs. I say this both for Snape and Voldemort. Especially when so many of the Order are purebloods themselves ( in Harrys time anyway).

I get why Rowling did it given the themes of the book and what it added to Harry's story. But once you look at just Voldemort or Snapes stories and the overall blood supremacy movement and its impact it had it makes less sense.

** This is not my rant but it's impressive nonetheless.

#+begin_quote
  So, recently I have been reading Harry Potter fanfictions on this site and on others, and I must say, many people get way too much love for stories that deal with the exact same concepts as hundreds of other authors. And to make matters even worse, many do not write in a manner that makes sense. And yet, these stories get thousands of followers and favorites, along with hundreds of positive reviews. It sickens me that so many people are so desperate for the same cliche plot and characters that authors that basically steal ideas from others can get a large following. Has the bar for writing really sunken so low? Have hundreds of people really forgotten the quality of the source material for HP? JK Rowling may be a bit of a bitch, but that doesn't take away from her writing at all. The fact that so many people seem to be pleased by, /dare I say it,/ horrible stories with dialogue and actions fitting of nothing of HP's caliber.

  I did not mean to rant, but it just upsets me. I will be going out of my way to observe canon and preserve characters as best I can. I also want my story to have an air of originality that is not as common as I would like. With that being said, fan fiction is basically the concept of changing that which is already written. There will be some changes in this. The changes I make will be provided with a background as I hate it when authors just make random changes without context or reason. For example, the name HADRIAN for HARRY drives me crazy in fan fiction. The concept of changing Harry's name is okay to a certain extent. His name is Harry, but logically, it could be written in a way where it stands for either Henry or Harold, or another name that Harry could be a nickname for. A boy named HADRIAN would not be nicknamed Harry under any circumstance. Another thing about that is that in no way is Hadrian a name that would be commonly seen in the area of the world in which HP is set.

  The last thing I want to address is the cliche use of child abuse to further the plot of an HP story. I find that concept sickening and wrong, as child abuse is used by hundreds of authors as a plot device. Child abuse needs to be taken seriously. It happens in today's world every day, and yet, somehow, fan fiction authors have decided that it is a good way to make minor changes to Harry's character. When was the last time a fictional story that is published did well while using child abuse as a plot device? NEVER! I'll answer that question for myself. There are other ways to do make changes to Harry's character without having the Dursleys abuse him. Yes, they were slightly verbally abusive to him, and he might not have received a full meal every meal, and he might have received an unfair level of chores for a boy his age. However, in no way does physical abuse need to be included.

*** I'm honestly a bit saddened by this rant (no shame on you for posting it). I feel the need to rant just a bit in response (again, not aimed at you but at the original poster of this). I think sometimes we forget that a lot of people write fanfiction for themselves. For many people, it's a hobby or a way to improve their writing. Lacking originality or perfect writing doesn't make the endeavor any less worthwhile for the person writing it OR the people who enjoy the story. This is not about writing what "sells" or what someone considers to be original. It's about playing in the sandbox of a story we love. What's the harm in getting compliments for your work? What's the harm in encouraging a young writer to improve? Why does it matter that "bad" stories get likes and favorites? Clearly, someone likes them. AND THAT'S FINE!!

As for the point about child abuse, the post is right that it's sometimes over-used. Perhaps exaggerated. But I think most people who write those fics believe that they are portraying it in a thoughtful way. Whether it comes across that way is another matter altogether. For a young or inexperienced writer, something like child abuse can be hard to tackle. Also, the reason it's so prevalent is because it IS canon. What the Dursleys did was abuse, whether or not they ever actually hit Harry (which there is plenty of reason to think they did). As for the claim that child abuse never makes popular stories....I beg to differ: Matilda, Identical (Ellen Hopkins), Carrie, etc. Actually, I think the trope of painting abusive guardians as just a slightly amusing reality of an orphan's life without ever addressing it (which happens in HP as well as (perhaps to a lesser extent) in Matilda) is far more damaging than some inexperienced authors taking things too far. Some of the emphasis on abuse in fanfiction is a response to the lack of acknowledgment in canon. Anyway, my point is really that we need to stop picking apart fanfiction like this. If people want to read all the Inheritance fics on ao3, that's great! If someone wants to write those fics, that's great too. I'm getting a little tired of all the negativity about what people like and what people write. We all have preferences, and we have the right to share them. But we shouldn't be acting as if our preferences are the only acceptable ones. Anyway, I'm very sorry for this rant. I'm just sad that we can't enjoy fanfiction for what it is: fans who want to dabble in writing.

*** These are such strange things to get on a soapbox about.

Sure, there are a lot of popular fics out there that are basically repetitions of the same plotline, but certain ideas are popular for a reason. And it does frustrate me to see fics with atrocious grammar getting tons of praise, but, like, if it's not your thing, just move on. People like what they like.

I agree about the Hadrian thing. I find it really cringeworthy when Harry's name is implied to be anything other than Harry, and I feel like Hadrian became a popular choice because it's a "cooler sounding" name than Harry. Eyeroll. Still worst fanfic sins have been committed.

I both agree and disagree about the abuse. I agree that a lot of authors throw in horrible abuse for shock factor alone, or as a plot device that is quickly scrapped once it serves its purpose. But I've seen it handled incredibly well in a lot of fics, even when the writer portrays the Dursleys as physically abusive. It's not unrealistic for them to have gone that far in canon. They wouldn't have tortured him, but I can definitely see Vernon and Petunia smacking him around. There was even an instance in book 5 when Vernon tried to choke Harry.

The person who wrote this rant is /completely/ disregarding the canonical abuse Harry experienced. The Dursleys weren't "slightly verbally abusive"; they were highly verbally/mentally/psychologically abusive towards him, and in a normal world he would have been incredibly damaged by it. He was made to feel unloved, unwelcome, burdensome, and worthless his entire childhood, and he spent ten years with absolutely no positive relationships in his life. There's no realistic way he could have emerged from that unscathed. In canon he was periodically locked up for days on end without regular meals, to the point where he had to sneak out at night to feed himself.

It pisses me off that the person who wrote this rant talks about the Dursleys treatment of Harry like it's nothing.

There, that's my rant.

** If we're talking about the books: shallow Slytherins, and Ron and Hermione are indeed sort of toxic. If we're talking about the movies: Half-Blood Prince is overall awful (which sucks because it is one of my favourite books), Ron's rant when he abandoned Harry and Hermione shouldn't have had its lines changed, and Voldemort's death destroyed everything the books built up. If I explain everything, I will write a book here.

Also: Cursed Child. Everyone talks about Delphi and all, but why in Merlin's name did Cedric become a Death Eater? I was going to give the book a try, but I gave up after I found out about that BS. This is probably the most out of character thing in "canon".

Fanfics: twincest, any relationship between minors and adults (why does everyone make Snape date Harry or Hermione????)

From an in-world standpoint: I hate Snape and The Marauders and honestly Lily lost my respect after I realised she thought James and Sirius hanging Snape upside down was amusing (she had to hide a smile). I get their story is sad, but at the same time, I can't sympathise with any of them. At best Lily and James because Harry didn't deserve to lose them. Also, Fred and George are jerks, why does everyone praise them?

** Rowling fucking SUCKS at trying to write a diverse world. I get that it's a given, considering she's a TERF, but c'mon dude.

The main School for Magic in East Asia is in Japan? Ah yes, Japan, which is much younger than China, and also has an entirely different language from the multitude of other countries, and is guilty of many war crimes against other East Asian countries. Sure. Filipino people totally wanna send their children to Japan for schooling. Sure.

There's only one magical school in Africa? Like there aren't a considerable amount of countries and languages that vary? Just three schools in Europe? Just the fact that Hogwarts is the only school still surprises me honestly. I guess it could fit more for them, but for other areas, I highly doubt that it would work. She really is short-sighted on that shit.

** Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

*** Yes, thank you. If you wrote me as a self insert waking up as an 11 y/o British Muggleborn you'd have to write me bawling my eyes out about the magna carta, Amnesty International, and how I'd be expected to join a society where I have no rights to be certain of.

Innocent until proven guilty? A fair trial? Well, chat with either Sirius or Hagrid about that. And Fudge during Harry's trial for that patronus? "Laws can be changed!" Are we all going to ignore that Ex Postfacto?

There is so much so incredibly wrong with the wizarding world that if I were a Muggleborn, I might seriously consider handing out leaflets where I printed all my grievances, before setting myself on fire in the Diagon Alley out of protest.

And that is not even going into how MACUSA isn't made any less horrible in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Are we all going to gloss over how Magicals aren't allowed to befriend or marry NoMaj's? That's an Apartheid Regime! And what about the execution at the MACUSA? Robbing one of their memories first? That is robbing a human being of ones Self, unmaking them, before going to kill them for something they don't even remember anymore? Please give me somewhere to hurl.

I appreciate canon Hermione's activist spirit, but I don't understand for the life for me why she as a marginalised individual, who knew exactly how precarious her position as a Muggleborn was shortly after the fall of Voldemort, and how many Death Eaters got off with an "oopsie daisy imperiousy"; who had seen how Harry had no protection from the press as a minor, who was slandered; did not have the bright idea to secure her own human rights first.

** So this is probably very cliche but i choose draco.

I mean Harry Potter refuses to make friends with an 11 year old just cause his friend called him a death eater and slytherin an evil house. The fact Ron is prejudiced doesn't matter but when Draco retaliates and defends himself he's called evil. Draco insults Ron but Ron started it. And Mind you its an 11 YEAR OLD KID. A child shouldn't be called a death eater no matter what. Its not the childs fault on how his parents turned out. Ron has done nothing for his parents to turn out good. I understand that there is bad blood betweent he families but Ron us as bad as Draco but he is right cause his family belongs to the light side.

Moreover who do you think draco would've gobe to for refuge. Dumbledore..... the man who favors gryffindor. That is not a secret. Slytherin worked hard to win the slytherin cup in draco's first year but Gryffindor wins cause he murders someone. Regardless of who he is, it doesn't matter. In fact if things had gine wrong, haf the dig got out or something else, maybe if voldermort succeeded then what. It didn't matter that the Golden trio's stupidity could get the whole school in trouble.

Furthermore Mcgonagall gives Hermoine a time turner to attend extra classes. Now thats just stupid. The girl is 13. It doesn't matter is she's the brightest witch of her age, she's a kid.

Next Draco is crying in the washroom and Harry just enters and starts a fight like you dumb. Whatever the accusations, there is a time and way for things and when he almost KILLS DRACO he gets off with a detention. I assure you if Malfoy had died, they would've simply said good riddance.

Lastly kids are innocent and immature. Draco was a bully and he was prejudiced but what did ithers do to help. The others declated the 11 year ild boy evil. Kids are supoosed to be taught that whats good and what's bad. No one knkws this shit when they are born. Humans are different than animals cause we have the ability to learn and improve.

With the way JK Rowling writes, i think its safe to say she considers everyone else as monsters and only the golden trio as humans and their supoorters of course like bullshit. Like sure JK Rowling gave an amzing idea like amgic and all is cool but her olit sucks. Like its a horrible plot. Or not even the plot, the character development is what's wrong with the whole book. Like i can name fanfiction written better than the harry potter series and no Draco is not always the main character and the golden trio are never evil. They all work together. Draco learns form his mistakes, he is taught by people that whats right and what's wrong.

Furthermore there was no one to helo Slytherins or in fact any kid from dark fanily. They had no choice but to join the dark lord cause at least if dark side wwre to win they would get something. The light sode would always sneer on them based on their family names. So yeah there it is.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter refuses to make friends with an 11 year old just cause his friend called him a death eater and slytherin an evil house.
#+end_quote

Harry met Draco in Madam Malkin's when they were getting their robes fitted.

First he started talking about trying to bully his father into buying him a broom to smuggle into hogwarts (which reminded Harry of Dudley).

Draco is the one who first talks about hogwarts houses "I know I'll be in Slytherin" and says he'd leave if he was placed in Hufflepuff.

He then proceeds to call Hagrid a servant and a savage (to Harry's first ever friend and the man who's introducing him to the magical world. Even if Draco doesn't know that, still not a great start.)

Moving onto shit on muggleborns "I really dont think they should let the other sort in, do you?".

Now with who actually starts the anti-slytherin brigade is actually Hagrid! Harry saying he'll probably be a hufflepuff hagrid responds with

"better Hufflepuff than Slytherin. There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."

He doesn't say ALL Sytherins are bad, but on the other hand you can't blame him for holding a grudge since it was Tom Riddle who released a baslisk in the school and then blamed it all on Hagrid when a girl died (Moaning Myrtle). Also just to add when the chamber was opened again and Draco is talking about how someone does last time and how he "hopes it's Granger" that time. Personally that alone always makes me wonder why people think Dramione would ever work?? Moving on.....

#+begin_quote
  Ron is prejudiced doesn't matter but when Draco retaliates and defends himself he's called evil. Draco insults Ron but Ron started it.
#+end_quote

Ron doesn't actually say anything against Slytherin per se. He worried about what would happen if he wasn't put into Gryffindor like the rest of his family

...

"mum and dad were in it too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin"

"That's the house Vol- I mean You-Know-Who- was in?" [Harry asked]

"Yeah" said Ron.

...

And that was the end of it. Again, Ron never said anything directly against Slytherin but worried about what his family would say if he werent a Gryffindor. He never says

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin is an evil house.

  Draco insults Ron but Ron started it
#+end_quote

Personally it looks to me Draco started it. Introducing yourself like James Bond (even if you don't know who James Bond is) is always going to sound odd from an 11 year old. Technically all Ron did was cough at that but it was Malfoy who took offence and started throwing the punches with

"Think my names funny, do you? My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford. You'll soon find some wizarding families are better than other, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."

Like seriously. Twice? That is two times you've just straight up degraded people you've barely met and never actually talked to, but actually happened to be people that have showed Harry nothing but kindness and friendship. Read the room my dude. Which he doesn't by the way!

Cauwe again its Draco that gets offended when Harry tells him he can tell the wrong sort for himself. He never explicitly says no to Draco's friendship but Draco doesnt exactly endear himself to a friendship with Harry by saying

"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter. Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them either. You hang around with riff raff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid and it'll run off on you."

Like if anyone is being antagonistic between Ron and Draco, I'm straight up gonna say Draco. And that's before Harry ever meets Ron if you count the Madam Malkins incident.

Yeah okay afterwards Ron starts telling Harry about the Malfoys

"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were the some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoys father didn't need an excuse to go over to the dark side."

#+begin_quote
  A child shouldn't be called a death eater no matter what.
#+end_quote

Ron never called Draco a death eater. But theres clearly bad blood between Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy but if anything, both 11 year old boys appear to be parroting what they've learned from their fathers.

I don't know what the malfoys have against the light but I can understand why the weasleys might have something against the dark side, considering Molly's brothers were killed by death eaters.

So if anything the first person to call Draco a death eater was Harry in 6th year. And he was right.
