I've been enjoying the "What Am I Reading" threads but what I don't like is that there's no real followup. By the time I get around to reading someone else's suggestion we've gone a week and there's something new. Posting my thoughts on the previous thread feels like necroposting.

So my suggestion is that there's also a weekly "What WAS I reading" post, specifically limited to thoughts on the previous week's Reading posts.

Does that make sense or should we just post "This is great/crap" on the previous week's post?


** Maybe just split the weekly post? Have two top level posts, one for “What I am reading” replies and one for “what I was reading” replies?

*** If that's going to happen then we'll need to ditch Tournament mode. It's already confusing enough.

**** I've actually never really participated in the thread before(just started in this specific community), but looking at the thread, it might be unfeasible. The main reason why it's in contest mode is so that you can easily scroll through each user's list of reading materials, and get their impressions on whatever they happen to be reading, without having to scroll through an ungodly amount of linkspam, with the option to show replies to see the links.

Unfortunately, Contest mode is basically an "All or Nothing" game, so if we went with my suggestion, you'd either see none of what the other users have read, or, once you clicked "show replies", all the comments and linkspam to go with it. There's no way to go automatically just showing the top-level replies to a comment.

***** That's exactly my concern, and why I suggested formalising a second thread. I acknowledge it's a bit of a cumbersome way of doing it but having thought about the alternatives, this seemed to be the one that made most sense.

** I think a better solution is limiting the duration of contest mode. From what I've seen, discussion seems to be limited to the more popular and typically recommended stories. This seems to indicate that while reading time is a factor, the greater factor is that the first few comments may not always be the most popular. People may not scroll through to the end to find stories to discuss. I think limiting contest mode to a few days would be an adequate solution.
