#+begin_quote
  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU
#+end_quote

This story is /phenomenal/. It provides unique looks at magic (particularly medical magic), a surprisingly mature Hermione/Cedric ship, and was the first fic I ever read to answer the age old question /What the hell is a Hufflepuff?/

If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. Seriously. It's great. If you have read it, what did you think?


** I read this a while back and thought it was great. The writing was wonderful and all of the issues (like disability) were handled with taste and great understanding. I did have some problems with Hermione's characterization, though. [[/spoiler][She's so logical and strong and confident, and of course she would feel insecure at times, as everyone does, but the sheer intensity of her "good girl" obsession in regards to sex is pretty silly. I can understand those worries, but they were way overblown. Perhaps the author was just trying to demonstrate that the fear of being seen as "slutty" or "easy" /can/ be a real issue in relationships, but it was dwelled on so much that it just got annoying and unrealistic. I simply can't see Hermione Granger being so insecure about something so insignificant, especially after having it explained /over/ and /over/ that she's being ridiculous.]] I mean, it wasn't a dealbreaker for me, but it did get on my nerves and really threw me out of the story due to its OOC-ness. If we were talking about, like, Hannah Abbott or something, then maybe I could've believed it, but... whatever.

Other than that, though, I loved the story. Cedric is awesome. This story really does him justice and shows that he's an all-around great dude. And I absolutely /loved/ all of the Hufflepuff House parts. Minisinoo truly gets what Hufflepuff is all about. It's sad that the sequel was never properly finished, but the story is so long anyway that it's still very satisfying to read.

And Minisinoo also wrote /Aorist Subjunctive/, a Harry/Cedric series (available [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][here]]). Also unfinished, but since it's a series of novellas and was abandoned between novellas, you aren't left totally hanging at the end. Like /Finding Himself/, all of the significant issues are dealt with wonderfully (but in this case it's Cedric's sexuality rather than disability). Worth a read for anyone who likes both slash and Cedric (because Minisinoo's Cedric is the best Cedric ever).

*** It's funny--I never saw Hermione's characterization as being OOC. We don't ever see directly see her in a relationship in the books; it always occurs offscreen. I didn't find it too difficult to believe that her character could be like that in a relationship, especially considering how firmly she sticks to rules and her conceived notions of what a good student/person would do outside of relationships in canon. (I did find her character a little annoying, but that's because I can't entirely relate to her inner conflict! I think it's a valid conflict, just not something that evokes a lot of sympathy from me.)

** Oh this was SO, SO good. I read it a long time ago, and this really made Cedric a fleshed out character for me. One of my favorite AUs, and just goes to show why fanfic can be so freaking awesome.

**** Yea, that's why I never start WIPs anymore, got burned by great stories that were never finished a few times.

** Thanks for the rec! I've read a couple Cedric!lives fics, so I decided to give this a shot. The author seems like he/she can write, but I just couldn't get past the first chapter, because they used movie canon instead of book canon for the maze scene at the end of GoF. :(

*** It is. The story closely mirrors the plot of OOTP, but it doesn't draw from movie dialogue/scenes that heavily again. I'm sorry that's such a turnoff for you because I think it could be worth it if you could get past that. But we all have our "pet peeves" with fanfiction. >.<

**** So true. Some things that other people can't stand don't bother me at all. That's why I replied instead of just moving along -- I could tell that this is a well-written story, even if it's not for me.

** Much of that story is great, especially the description of how Cedric deals with his injuries and his work to unify the houses. However, the author spends way to much time writing about Cedric's much less interesting relationship with Hermione. That topic just dominates all the others.

*** I didn't mind the relationship with Hermione. I thought that it was part of how Cedric comes to accept his injuries and important in giving Cedric a connection to the Trio and their actions in OOTP (eventually, he and Harry get closer, but at first Hermione was the link). I also thought the relationship with Cedric helped Hermione mature and also was used to explore different controversial aspects of wizarding society (house elves, for example). It also highlighted Hermione's weaknesses, which unfortunately isn't explored much in canon.

I also like a good romance, but if one was less fond of them, I could understand that aspect of the story being too much.
