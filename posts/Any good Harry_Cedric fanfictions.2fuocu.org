I can't really find any complete ones, and I have a hard time finding fics using any other site than Ao3 (if I did that one right) and Fanfiction.net

I will be grateful for anything you give me as long as it isn't blatantly "Oh let's fix everything that can be used later on to advance the story in about five seconds then bs our way with lemons until we hit the 10 chapter mark." I hate those ones...Always so misleading.

TL;DR Any complete/good Harry/Cedric fanfics? Any site is good. Can be anything as long as it has some Harry/Cedric.


** I'm assuming you've read the Aorist Subjunctive series? If not, it's a must. Apologies, my link is actually to the ebooks: [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29]]

** Try these

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859556/1/A-Lack-of-Color][A Lack Of Color]] I would particularly recommend. Absolutely fantastic fic. And read its sequel too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9368501/1/Love-War][Love and War]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2459573/1/Champions][Champions]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4456140/1/Decoding-You][Decoding You]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3010218/1/The-Boy-Who-Loved][The Boys Who Loved]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4819976/1/Alone-Again][Alone Again]]

And yes, Aorist Subjunctive is the best Harry/Cedric fic I've ever read. Definitely read it.

***** Lack of Color is awesome. How good is its sequel comparatively? I've been burned recently by awesome fics with terrible sequels.

****** The sequel is decent quality, I would say about the same quality as Lack of Color. It is unfinished however, and he is a very slow updater, I don't think he's abandoned it yet, but it's not outside the realm of possibility, and you're going to be waiting a long time for it to finish if it is.

How have you liked the others so far? A Lack of Color was my favorite of those, besides Aorist, but the others are interesting in their own rights.
