** Fleur Delacour was at a disadvantage, a situation she rarely found herself in, ever since she was a child on Veelarin she had learned to cover her weaknesses and exploit her adversaries', a deadly game of power, words, and daggers that was a pastime in her homeworld, her natural prowess with the Force only helped her always come out on top. She was ever so glad of her planet's policy of denying the Jedi Order their force-sensitive children, of course, this also made them disliked and distrusted by the Republic, at least officially, and forced them to deal with all kinds of people for trade.

People like Harry Potter, smuggler and bounty hunter, the closest she had to an actual friend(besides her sister) and she was loathe to admit one of the few people that she had a modicum of trust for, not only was he completely immune to her people's powers of persuasion, both Force based and those more natural, he always fulfilled his part of a deal, as long the other side did the same(and he somehow knew if they did), if they didn't he would show how prodigious he was with a blaster.

But she doubted even that talent would save them now, and outnumbered and outgunned, by these /slavers/, associates of the people who took her sister, he had tried to warn her, but she foolishly walked them into an ambush, and now here she was surrounded by Gamorrans, twi'leks, Droids, and her target, a dirty Twi'lek known as Glon but called himself "The Procurer", leering down at her from the balcony.

"Tsk. Tsk. Not so brave out of your planet now aren't you birdie? How do you noble types say? Ah, 'you overplayed your hand, my lady' " he finished with a pitiful try at a cultured voice, but his lackeys(those that weren't droids) laughed the same way.

"And with all the money you have, all you could bring was Potter? A good shot I will admit, but even he can't take down all my friends here." he gestured his hands at the nearly thirty armed henchmen he had brought. "Not before we gun you down."

Fleur chanced a glance at her companion, he had a Mandalorian chest plate, but no helmet, and most importantly, /she/ had no armor at all. He had one blaster pistol aimed at her target and another at the nearest threat, one of those thin battle droids that were getting on the market.

Her mental math was clear, he would down maybe seven of them before he was overwhelmed, and she would manage two. Maybe if he had a full set of beskar, instead of just a chest plate and bracers, she could use him as a shield, but that plan was discarded too.

Harry looked strangely calm, serene even. He always looked like that, but she thought she would see at least some sweat.

Fleur did her best to not show her panic, hiding it behind her aloof mask the best she could.

She decided to try and bribe Glon, her family would pay a lot more for her than he could get on /other markets./ She would try to include Harry too, if only to convince Glon it wasn't worth trying to get him.

Before she could speak, Harry did, much calmer and even colder than his normal genial and honest(superficially) attitude.

"So, Princess, do you have a plan? A way out?"

She tried to come up with what to say, but apparently her expression was enough, Harry closed his eyes and sighed, cursing under his breath, before whispering so only she could hear, "Stay behind me." What? Was he mad?

Before she could react he shot Glon right in the knee, making him scream in pain, his henchmen were shocked enough for Harry to shoot eight more times, dropping the droids closest to them, the four behind them and the Gamorreans with heavy weapons.

She knew what would come next, the barrage of blaster fire, she refused to close her eyes, but Harry stepped in front of her as the ones still standing took aim and dropped his blaster, further confusing her, before pushing his now free hand forward, and utterly shocking her as the nearest ten shooters in front of them were knocked back, /hard./

She saw some of the henchmen step back in shock but the already primed droids fired. She shouldn't be surprised when the jade green blade came out of /somewhere/ on his belt and deflected the shots, but she was.

She only came out of her stupor when Glon started screaming.

"Jedi! Kill the Jedi!" She wasn't about to let that happen, and started shooting, trying to stay behind Harry as he started slowly /advancing,/ his /lightsaber/ on his right hand a blaster on the left one, he mowed down the droids first, most of them with deflected shots she could barely see, the blaster he used on the scared henchmen, that she guessed were amateurs hired to bolster numbers, given the way they had completely lost their cool the moment they saw a lightsaber.

In the sixty seconds between Harry whispering to her and now, eighteen bodyguards had fallen, all the droids and the more professional looking men, the rest had bolted and run.

All but one, Glon was pathetically trying to crawl into the balcony, but Harry /jumped/ and cleared the three meters height easily, immediately cutting off the coward's pleas with a stunner shot from his wrist launcher.

Fleur almost collapsed when she realized that it was over, her head spun a bit and she had to hold herself on the wall, she had been through a few scuffles in her homeworld, but nothing like this.

"Are you okay?"

She flinched in surprise when she realized Harry was back down, holding an unconscious Glon by the back of his collar.

The Veela took some deep breaths before sliding down on the wall to sit, she looked up at her companion, she was used to betrayal and lies but never from him, it hurt more than she thought it would.

She scowled up at him, "So, Jedi spy?"

Harry scoffed, "I doubt they have something like that with how uptight they are, but no, not a Jedi, not anymore."

She raised an eyebrow and looked pointedly at the lightsaber still in his hand, now deactivated.

He glanced at it, before shrugging and raising it for her to see, it was finely crafted in chromium and durasteel, but it was scuffed and dented. "What? This? Do you know how hard I worked to make this? And I spent practically all of my childhood and bit more learning how to use it, might as well not let it go to waste." he looked at her, and she could see the barely concealed fear of rejection on his eyes. "And it saved our lives today."

She raised herself, and swiped the dust from her clothes, she should've known better than to wear white on a desert planet.

She looked at Harry, "That it did, and now I finally know how you are able to resist our talents, Mr. Potter." she pointed at him with a triumphant expression, and almost smiled back at the relief on his eyes, she would never recriminate him for it, not after he saved her life, she was practical like that.

He snorted, "It's more will than anything, Fleur."

She harrumphed, but said nothing as they silently walked to his ship that was parked close by, a sleek silver craft that had seen better days, but still had some charm, a relic according to Harry, X-70 or something that Harry called Firebolt for some reason. Smugglers.

*** As soon as Glon was secured in a cell and they were in the upper atmosphere, Fleur turned to Harry, trying to hide her curiosity.

"So 'Former Jedi'? Did they just let you leave?"

He sighed and she felt, through her limited empathic abilities, a spike of anger and sadness from him. Curious.

"They did. We had some 'differences of opinion' and thought it best to part ways."

"And they just let you take the fancy sword with you?"

He smirked, "It's the only thing that truly belonged to me." he looked at the horizon, but she saw he was seeing something far away, "They were /magnanimous/ enough to let me take my clothes and my Master paid my transport to anywhere I wanted." He said that with a fond smile.

"Your Master helped you?" She always imagined Jedi Masters as those stern, uptight people who would sometimes come to her planet to complain and even demand they give their Force-sensitive children to them, she doubted those would do anything more than turn their nose at those that left their precious Order.

Harry laughed, and she was hit with the doubt if he had guessed her thoughts or /read/ them.

"Master Qui Gon is great, totally different from most of them, he did his best to help me and even offered to accompany me until I could get my bearings in the galaxy." he frowned and looked outside the window, "I couldn't cause him any more trouble though, and I needed to do things myself, the bastards already blamed him for it. Assholes" he gripped the control stick a bit too hard before reeling himself and activating the autopilot with the coordinates for their hideout. The ship smoothly adjusted course and Harry pushed a few more buttons, a different hum coming over the ship before reducing until it was barely there.

Fleur looked at Harry in askance, he grinned.

"Cloaking Device."

"Bullshit."

He laughed at her crassness, he loved when she let out the real her a bit, "It's true," he rose from his chair, and she followed him as he caressed the wall, "This beauty here may be old, but she is full of tricks, and has many tales to tell."

"How did /you/ find it? I know our pilots have tried to get it from you many times."

Harry laughed again, carefree, and Fleur had to hold back her smile, she always liked when he laughed, he was normally either serious or sarcastic, never just happy like this, she liked it.

"Of course they did, but that's a long story, but involves me and a surprise trip to Raxus Prime."

She laughed as they entered the main hold, which was the living room, kitchen, and eating area at the same time.

Harry offered her a cup of water, that she took as she sat, she thought about what they had accomplished, or rather, what Harry had accomplished, they had Glon, the man who knew where her sister was.

She frowned at the cup, she had been useless today, more than useless she had almost ruined everything. She had been powerless and she hated that. She turned to look at Harry who was looking at her in concern.

"Teach me."

He was taken aback by her declaration, or more precisely, demand.

"What?"

"Teach me to use the Force, to do what you did today."

He frowned at her, and she couldn't few anything, as she suspected, he could block that too.

"I am no Master."

She placed the cup in the table with a bit more force than necessary and glared at him.

"I don't need a Jedi Master, I need you to teach to do what you do, teach me like your Master taught you."

His frown deepened, "I can't teach like Master Qui Gon, and even then it takes years..."

"I don't need to learn the intricacies of the Force, I can already use mind tricks and compulsion, just teach me how to throw people across a room by waving my hand at them!"

She was on her feet and screaming at him at the end, before stopping herself and sitting back down, she looked at him apologetically.

"I am sorry, it's just that I was so scared today, and Gabby..." she couldn't stop her tears as she covered her mouth, Harry quickly covered the distance between them and took her in his arms, gently guiding her to the couch where he sat down beside her and began to caress her hair and lightly rock her.

"It's okay, Fleur, we will find her, I promise."

She hugged him tighter and tried in vain to contain her sobs.

"I was so stupid today, I could've ruined everything!"

Harry brought her closer until her head was laying on his chest and he began rubbing her back.

"We all make mistakes, Fleur, the important thing is learning from them."

She half laughed and sobbed, "Did your Jedi Master taught you that?"

She heard Harry's chuckle reverberate from her position and found herself comforted by their closeness.

"He actually did."

They stayed like that for a few minutes until she calmed down, but didn't leave his arms. The silence was broken when he tightened the embrace and said, "I will teach you, I have some...materials I found along the way that can help, and you are a quick learner."

She sniffed, before caressing his cheek, they had never been this close, but it felt so natural, she liked it, and they were alone, she could give herself this comfort.

"My brave Knight." she teased.

He snorted, before placing his hand over hers and looking her in the eyes, green met blue and he smiled at her.

"I was never Knighted, my Master said I was ready at fifteen, but the other Masters disagreed, apparently 'Your combat skills, exceptional as they are, do not compensate for your lack of discipline.'" he finished in a stuffy, self-righteous voice. "I left soon after."

Fleur giggled, actually giggled, she cupped his face and looked deep into his eyes.

"I don't care for the opinions of stuffy old men who don't leave their ivory towers, to me, you are /my/ Knight."

She then did something she had always imagined, and unknown to her he too, their privacy, stress, and adrenaline high from earlier just encouraged Fleur Delacour to bring their faces closer and kiss Harry Potter.

He froze, and she thought he would reject her before she felt his hand on the back of her head begin to caress her hair, while the one on her back brought her closer while he deepened their kiss.

Her senses where assaulted by the desire but also by the deep affection for her he was emanating, she couldn't stop the pleased sounds coming from her, who knew Jedi knew how to kiss.

As they separated for air, both were looking disheveled and flushed, but Fleur felt hope soar in her heart, for she had also felt the brotherly care Harry had for Gabby and his utter determination at saving her.

He looked at her with a teasing smile, "So, any chance of you calling me /Master?/"

Her laughter echoed throughout the hallways, and soon she was sleeping in his arms, more deeply than she ever had since her sister had been kidnapped.

**** Basically, they interrogate Glon and have some adventures(deepening their relationship and beginning Fleur's training) while they track Gabby to a large Slaver compound, a distribution center in the Mid Rim.

Luckily, Qui-Gon Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are in the planet for a training trip, they team up (Obi-Wan is reluctant, but follows Qui-Gon who is happy seeing Harry doing positive things) and manage to rescue Gabby, they uncover how large and terrible the organization is and find out about some future plans to kidnap more children in the Republic neglected Outer Rim, Qui Gon wants to help, but they are recalled by the Council to go as Mediators to Naboo. They part on mostly friendly terms, Qui-Gon apologetic but Harry is well aware of Jedi politics and admits his Master is the best one for the job.

Harry and Fleur, after rescuing Gabby, who was horrified at what they did to the ones they kidnapped(she was treated with a bit more dignity because they were contemplating returning her for a very, very large ramson), decide to dismantle the whole organization, they go back to Veelarin to drop off Gabby and inform her parents of Fleur's decision, they are supportive, always knowing their daughter would someday want to leave.

Harry begins to train Fleur in earnest, she quickly learns the more physical aspects, but Veela are very connected to their emotions, and she powers many of the techniques with them. Harry is a bit wary, but being trained by Qui-Gon and never really buying into the philosophy of suppressing his emotions starts experimenting, he is well aware of the Dark Side, but his ambitions at the moment were protecting Fleur and stopping the slavers.

Harry has several materials he gathered in his travels, one of them is a map to a Holocron, they track it to Dantooine where he finds a Sith Holocron that contains knowledge about some of their more powerful offensive techniques both physical and mind based ones.

Harry quickly learns things like Force Lightning, and more aggressive lightsaber styles(Juyo), Fleur learns very powerful mind manipulation techniques, and some Sith Sorcery.

They fall deeper into the Dark Side, but their disposition is still in the Light, to help others.

They start hunting down the slavers and bringing down their operations, being such a small but powerful unit, with a Stealth Ship(Harry begins restoring and upgrading it with funds taken from the slavers) they are very effective and start getting a reputation.

The Holocron contains a map to Korriban, the Sith Homeworld, where great repositories of knowledge are found. They decide to go there after they destroy the slavers.

Among the end of Naboo Crisis, Harry feels Qui-Gon's demise and his anger and grief push him to finish off the slavers, after months of dismantling their operations they find their last fortress on the sands of Jakku, where he and Fleur eradicate them.

They become something of a legend in the Outer Rim, spread by grateful freed slaves. Palpatine only hears of them later, but is too occupied with his preparations to the Clone Wars to give any attention to rumors.

They return to Veelarin, rich, and marry, after some years of living a happy and peaceful life(but still training), they decide to leave due to a dream from Qui-Gon and wanderlust.

They go to Korriban, finding the ruins of the Sith Empire, and learning much of their history, and about the Old Republic, recognizing that many of their failures are still present. Some of the Ancient Lords of the Sith appear and offer training hoping to restore lost knowledge, among them Darth Imperius.

They return a year later, basically full Sith, but with the ideals of freedom, and the desire to help. They find out the corruption of the Republic allowed for another slaver organization to spring up. And that the Republic is now on the brink of a Civil War.

They've got their work cut out to them.

Wow this evolved fast, I just had to write, it probably needs some editing, but I need to sleep and I always wanted to write a Star Wars fic.
