A common trope in most fanfiction is that being immune to a Vella allure would make them like a male more but it actually would have most likely gotten you killed because that would have been something prized by Veela slavers.

Because really all the allure is a natural defence against predators .

Maybe a younger Veela might find it romantic but older Veela would have seen someone that is Immune as a threat that needs to be eliminated.

P.s. Are there any good stories with this as a plot point?


** Veela slavers? Natural defence against predators? Have I missed anything on Pottermore, or is this based entirely on fanon?

**** Yeah, and there's no problem with discussing fanon here. However, since there's not much canon information about Veela, so it's entirely up to the author how to interpret them. So without referring to a specific author or fic, there's no way to answer your question.

***** It's not from a any fanfiction that I currently know of it's just logic.

But even if its logical that there would have been Veela slavers they would hardly put something like that on a site like pottermore after all it is a site targeted at children.

Then again with the powers that Veela show In Cannon they could also be the ones capturing slaves after all the allure does seen to make men highly suggestible

** Maybe it'd be an issue if the 'allure' was their sole power. But they are shown to have magic and use wands (Fleur uses one) just as well as a regular, boring wizard. EDIT: plus there is the whole bird/harpie transformation with fireballs that isn't well explained but is canon nonetheless (I thought it was fanon until recently).

You described 'allure' as a trope, so I'm guessing you're aware that the fanfictions generally do not line up completely with canon the issue.

All that being said, a fic where Harry gets hunted down by Veela would be great (as long as they really do try to hunt him down, and don't become his harem when he flares his big manly aura).

*** Just for the record, I'm pretty sure Veela can't do wand magic. Fleur is a quarter-Veela, and the wiki says that half-Veela inherit beauty and charm from their mothers and magical ability from their fathers.

**** The problem with this is that it means there are male veela. I mean, that's fine, but as far as I know, the mythical beings veela are obviously based on are strictly female.

***** There doesn't have to be male veela. Some insects can reproduce both sexually (with a partner) and asexually (basically cloning). Maybe veela can too.

****** That's a good point. Personally, I prefer the idea seen in some fics that Veela + Muggle = full Veela, while Veela + Wizard = half Veela.

** Well, considering the Veela Allure isn't even a real thing, using a terrible cliche to make up an even more arbitrary and terrible plot point seems dumb.

*** You know, i muse about is a lot. People say there's no allure but then why did ron try to climb out of the box or why did someone else claim they flew to the moon? Sure, incredibly beautiful women make us men do stupid shit but rarely ever do we try to commit suicide to impress them.

** Evolution doesn't work that way; Veela probably didn't evolve; they'd make a lot more enemies that way; every violent encounter involving a Veela is a chance for a Veela to die; and there's nothing to indicate that someone is that much more likely to try to attack Veela simply by being immune to their aura.

Canon strongly implies that the aura only affects males and possibly only heterosexual males (with fanon being clearer on the point), so you're talking about a war to exterminate humanity. If you make it so the aura affects almost all humans, there's a problem identifying who's immune -- are Veela the rulers of society, combing through their thralls?

Fix all that and you have...well, at that point, they'd barely be recognisable as Veela, but at least there would be a sensible story.
