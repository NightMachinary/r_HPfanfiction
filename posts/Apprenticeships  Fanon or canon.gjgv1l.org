Does anyone know if apprenticeships were canon? I've been wondering why there aren't university type institutions in the wizarding world, at least, none that I've come across. How else do these wizards/witches further their education and become proficient in their chosen fields?


** Fanon. Masteries are also fanon.

** It's fanon, but it's not contradicted by canon, it just never comes up.

** It is fanon, but it makes sense. There is just not enough magicals to make whole university worthy of the effort and costs. Overall, there is none post-Hogwarts education mentioned anywhere.

** Fanon, canon doesn't say it /is/ a thing but it also doesn't say that it /isn't/ a thing, it makes sense in my opinion due to the complete lack of post Hogwarts education.
