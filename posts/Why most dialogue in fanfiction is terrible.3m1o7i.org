The thing that annoys me the most about fanfiction, apart from the lack of respect for the English language, the stupid and overused plot lines, and the fact most of the good fics are abandoned, is the fact that a lot of writers seem to have no idea how to write prose during dialogue.

Now I'm not talking about what the characters are actually saying; a lot of the problems surrounding that could be fixed if one simply remembered the average age and level of education of whoever they're writing. I'm talking about the prose, the in-between bit, the ones that actually make it all flow together.

I have three main problems that I would like to address and that I feel could go a long way towards improving your writing. If you've made these mistakes, don't feel bad about it. It's hard to even realize what the problem is at first.

Now, just to show you an example, I'm gonna take a bit of dialogue from the very first chapter of Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy. Don't worry, no spoilers if you haven't read it.

--------------

/"The Canons are not going to win the League cup this year Harry!" ranted Ginny accusingly, "Surely the Magpies are going to win?"/

--------------

What's wrong with it? Well, three things, as far as I can tell. One, the author forgot a comma, two, the author placed a comma where a period should have been, and three, the adverb 'accusingly' was used.

Now, apart from the fact that it can be argued whether Ginny is even ranting at all, I don't understand how it's possible for her to be ranting 'accusingly,' as though she's, well, /accusing/ Harry of something. All she's doing is disagreeing with him about whether or not the Cannons are going to win. In my eyes, there should never be too much emphasis on what is going on between dialogue, stringing it all together. That bit should only exist to make the dialogue flow and feel less broken.

A better way to handle it would have been:

--------------

/"The Cannons are not going to win the League cup this year, Harry!" ranted Ginny. "Surely the Magpies are going to win?"/

--------------

There you go. No unnecessary information. The reader is getting the same exact information they were getting before, but it all flows much better because they are not having to stop and process the fact that the writer is suggesting that Ginny is accusing Harry of something.

Now, in all of this, I want you to understand that I have nothing against Paffy and her quite honestly great fic. It's a minor criticism that I think is worth following. In her example, it even makes sense to use the word 'ranted'.

But let's go a bit further: let's take one of the stupidest fics ever written and by far the worst example of this I have ever seen. I am of course talking about Harry Potter and the Four Heirs. Special thanks to [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]] for introducing me to this abomination.

In this story, it seems that the writer has made it their goal in life to make the dialogue as awful as possible. I'm just going to show you a few examples.

--------------

/"Stop thinking about that!" thought Harry angrily./

--------------

Usual business here. A completely useless adverb that could be simply thrown away. Heck, the story seems to be written in third person limited, meaning third person from a single character's perspective, so there wasn't even any need to specify that it was Harry who was thinking. It could have simply been:

--------------

/"Stop thinking about that!"/

--------------

The same exact amount of information is being given to the reader here.

But it gets worse. Oh, so much worse.

--------------

/"GET UP BOY. YOU HAVE BREAKFAST TO MAKE!" snapped Uncle Vernon nastily./

--------------

Ah yes, because it would have been so unclear that Vernon was being nasty unless that adverb was there! Thanks, writer.

That's not how 'snapped' should be used, either. It's used when a character suddenly loses their cool in the middle of a conversation.

--------------

/"They're always saying someone is out their, who is a threat. Look at that Sisius or who ever he is. Look what he was, he was one of them. Had to be that boy's Godfather. You know Petunia we could hand them Harry and he can give them that murderer," said Vernon eagerly./

/"They know Harry wouldn't tell them. Harry is a threat to them. It is because he is Dumbledore's right-hand man. The Ministry cannot place a finger on him,‚Äù said Petunia slowly./

/"If the boy is Dumbledore's right-hand man, does that mean he is as powerful?" asked Vernon curiously./

/"Oh no, I don't think so. Harry is just a vital part of their world. He has to be at the right age before they can make him any more powerful," replied Petunia simply./

--------------

God, it just keeps going and GOING! If you think I'm cherry-picking examples of this, I'm not. These are the only bits of dialogue in the entire story thus far. The last bit also illustrates another problem, that being that the dialogue verb is too specific. Like the reader couldn't have worked out that Petunia was replying to Vernon if the writer had just used 'said' instead?

--------------

/"The pan is ready. I don't want any burnt bacon on my sandwich and I want eggs!" snapped Vernon aggressively./

--------------

Boy, thank god that adverb was there! Otherwise, I would have just assumed that Vernon was snapping peacefully instead.

Now, don't get me wrong, verbs like 'replied' and 'snapped' do have their place in dialogue, as do adverbs (very occasionally). But writers don't /want/ to read dialogue verbs or adverbs, they want to read the dialogue. Give it some freedom, let the words themselves make it clear that your characters are angry or sad or they're being facetious. Readers are not robots--they know how people act when they're feeling a certain way.

At least, I personally do. When I read dialogue, I picture it in my head as if it's happening in a movie, and my brain gives it inflection and emphasis all by itself. I'm nobody special, and I've no doubt you do the same.

So, next time you're writing a line where Ginny is being a bit snarky, are you gonna write 'the redhead replied sarcastically'? No. You're going to write 'said Ginny' and tell all those useless embellishments to go fuck themselves. For examples of how to do this correctly, refer to any dialogue segment in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling.

Thanks for reading.

** Great idea for a post. If I can borrow your soapbox:

Adverbs modifying speech tags are usually a bad idea, but I'm not sure you're coming down hard enough on speech tags that aren't "said," which have always distracted me even more. To borrow an example from your post: If you can't tell Ginny's ranting from what she's said and the situation she's in, she's not ranting. If you /can/ tell, great---you don't need to use the word "rant." If you're worried you're saying "said" too much, and people are going to be distracted by the repetition, just cut a few of the speech tags entirely and revise the conversation so that the ones you cut aren't necessary to make it coherent.

I think the biggest sign of weak fanfic dialogue is when it goes on too long because the author doesn't seem to know or care what situation his characters are in. Again, borrowing your example dialogue---the Dursleys /know/ Harry is a wizard, and who his godfather is, and that someone's trying to kill him, and that they are somehow responsible for him. They each know that the other knows this.

And yet in that dialogue they seem determined to explain the situation to one-another as though they've never heard about any of this before now. (Also, they seem to struggle with "Sirius" yet have no trouble saying "Dumbledore," which to Muggle ears sounds faintly ridiculous even if you /don't/ hate wizards.) I was going to try to cut it down to demonstrate how short it could be while still conveying exactly as much information, but it sounds so bananas coming out of the Dursleys' mouths that it's just unsalvageable.

We prune our actual speech based on the situation we're in, what we want, what we're trying to hide. There's a ~5-page John O'Hara story I loved teaching that is literally nothing more than a car salesman talking to a prize customer, a friendly bartender, and then his wife---on the same day, feeling the same things, about the same subjects. It's called "[[http://engl210-vautour.wikispaces.umb.edu/file/view/How+Can+I+Tell+You+by+John+OHara.pdf][How Can I Tell You?]]" I can't think of a better 10-minute lesson in how important context and relationships are in dialogue.

I kind of disagree with this, at least as a general rule. I feel like if the situation and what she's saying conveys "rant" and you use the dialogue tag "said" there might be a tonal disconnect. That being said, it's definitely easy to overuse more colorful dialogue tags. Some writers seem allergic to "said".

**** In general I think most things that present themselves as Ironclad Writing Rules are overbids---I think adverbs are great, especially when they're used to alter the rhythm of a sentence---so to some extent I agree. In particular I'm fine with speech tags that modulate volume and tone, rather than trying to classify the "kind" of speech your character is doing.

i.e., if you want to say "she whispered" or "she yelled", I think that's probably the least obtrusive way to do it. It's "ranted" or "snarked" or "sneered" etc. that really drive me up a wall, and that are unfortunately super common in fanfiction.

"The adverb is not your friend." There's nothing wrong with 'said', most readers ignore it anyway. It flows better and almost always speech adverbs are unnecessary.

Also, never ever ever touch a thesaurus while writing. If your vocabulary isn't great enough to write a story without it, you should write something simpler and read more until you can handle it. This is a huge problem for fanfiction writers - never use a word you had to look up. Never!

** Another important (to me at least) aspect of writing dialogue: just use "said.". Seriously, just use "said." Out of all of the things you could do to improve a chapter or fic, playing "pick a synonym" for the word "said" is probably one of the biggest wastes of time and effort. It may seem boring and repetitive to writers, but I promise you that your readers won't notice, and certainly won't care. That's because the word "said" is supposed to be unremarkable in this context. Its function is to connect the dialogue with a character. So long as that connection is made, no one really cares what word you use, or paid all that much attention to it. So just use "said." Don't spend your time and energy trying to be creative "here."

In my opinion, you should use "said" at least 80%of the time. Restrict the use of alternatives to situations where you want to emphasize something about the dialogue or character. For example, use the word "asked" when two characters are having a fierce debate and someone interrupts with a question. Use "snapped" when there's a lighthearted conversation, but someone is upset by something and so they reply with an angry retort that sends out of place. Use "stammered" when McGonagall catches Draco bragging about something and he had to come up with some type of excuse to avoid trouble. But restrict alternatives to scenes like these, where you want to emphasize something. Otherwise, just use "said."

** Playing on your theme here, I can provide the benefit of my own experience as an editor; I spent a few years as a copy-editor and creative consultant for various advertising and entertainment companies.

In general, people neglect the fact that dialogue is action; often using a particular line of dialogue as exposition. Sneaking expository dialogue into a 'full scene' can be fine, provided the exposition is weaved into the otherwise valuable content. Most of the time, in my experience reading fan fics, a great deal of dialogue serves no purpose whatsoever.

What 'dialogue as action' means: every scene in a narrative context should advance the plot (with some exceptions for thematic value) and the economy of language is important. People instinctively know this because all 'good' writing follows this rule, but it's not a lesson that people often learn (in my experience). Dialogue is often a form of conflict, as dialogue between two characters in perfect agreement is boring as fuck. Conflict doesn't necessarily mean explosive disagreement, often it just means increasing tension, which is super fucking important. Most of the time agreement between characters ends the scene, and it's the result of a conflict that advances the plot. We see this in HP all the time, when Hermoine is reluctant to break a rule or abandon her studies, and must be convinced of the importance of a certain action; the act of convincing her is often an impassioned bit of dialogue that serves the purpose of exposing a bit of information to the audience (like illustrating what's at stake and building tension for the next scene) and also creating an opportunity for some great back and forth conflict between characters, which all serves to advance the plot and send the characters on a one-way path towards the climax.

We consider, in general, adverbs to be lazy because they're often used as the substitute for action, but adverbs can, when used correctly, enhance a scene in an economical fashion. Of course, the english language is so rich that often a word exists that better illustrates the moment than 'angrily'. If deleting the adverb has no significant effect, get rid of it.

There's always a lot of storming, barging, and bursting through doors into scenes, this is usually fine, but often in fan fiction it seems excessive, unnecessary or outright gratuitous because the moment hasn't effectively been primed. If there's no tension leading to that moment, if it's not the result of a build-up within a character to a breaking point, it's just a wasted opportunity that potentially hurts the overall narrative. This is more about expression/release of tension which can either deflate the arc or weaken the subsequent conflict than about dialogue, but the dialogue that follows these moments either leads to a form of resolution in conflict, such as a battle of wills that changes characters relative positions, or a false defeat/victory which advances the plot. If the high conflict dialogue in these moments doesn't advance the plot, it's wasted tension.

Before people bring up "My Dinner with Andre" or a Whit Stillman film to refute this, I'll add that interesting and thematic Dialogue is often an exception to the Dialogue as action rule - for example Voldemort's expository declarations or the various professors lessons. Often these moments in HP exist not so much to expose information, but to set up theme and illustrate character. Using these tools sparingly, as a way to expand tension over time and 'live in a moment' for a while. Sometimes a scene in a vacuum will seem boring, but surrounded by two other scenes that develop the arc or the plot, you're actually adding tension by pulling back for a bit. Scenes where the plot is carrying on around the characters without their direct intervention is the string of the bow.

Conversations between Harry and the Dursleys are usually marked by a lack of Harry 'exploding', instead he broods, stews, and suffers. The dialogue, even though it's not combative, is still conflict, and it adds tension, which increases the weight of the following scene. Dialogue for the sake of dialogue is a waste.

As far as language and word choice, I'd recommend that everyone read The Elements of Style. You can find it free at Gutenberg.org here > [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37134]]

** I disagree with how useless the information given in one of the examples is. The thought "Stop thinking about that!" doesn't have to be linked to anger, it can also be linked to annoyance, for example - which would probably slightly change the scene.

The same goes for "said". There are a lot of sentences that have the exact same wording, but differ greatly in what they actually mean, based entirely on how they are said. You can change the wording to infer the meaning, but that can lead to quite stilted dialogue, or simply dialogue not fitting a character.

"That's great!" he said, enthusiastically.

The same wording, two completely different meanings, but easily distinguishable when actually talking.

When we talk, especially face to face, we pick up a lot of information from visual and audible clues. That should be represented in a scene, in my opinion - especially if you're using a point of view that takes you inside the head of a specific character, and not a more neutral author's viewpoint.

*** In both of our examples, it would probably be beneficial to give context. In [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=157356][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]], before "Stop thinking about that!" is this small paragraph:

--------------

/There was something very special about Harry Potter. Something that everyone of Privet Drive thought was something children read in books. Harry Potter was a wizard. Harry Potter lay daydreaming, staring at the foot of a bench. Only recently, someone that was a second father, to Harry, had died by falling through a magical veil./

--------------

It's obvious from this context that Harry would tell himself to not think about it because it pains him, angers him, makes him grieve. To specify that he's angry about it is unnecessary.

Likewise for your example. Taken out of context, it's impossible to know whether the dialogue is meant to be sarcastic or not. If it were fleshed out and given some proper context, it's likely that the meaning would become apparent. Take for example this segment of DH:

--------------

/‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ‚Äúbecause it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them./

/"From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.‚Äù/

/‚ÄúWhat, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?‚Äù asked Harry./

/‚ÄúOh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,‚Äù said Ron. ‚ÄúI was wondering what we were going to do with them.‚Äù/

--------------

Does it need to be said that Ron is being sarcastic? We gain this knowledge from both A, knowing his character and B, the context given to us by the dialogue.

In a way, it's even possible to distinguish between the examples you give by changing the exclamation mark:

--------------

/"That's great!" he said,/

/"That's great," he said./

--------------

While both could be said with sincerity or irony, it's easier to see the second example being used in more of a sarcastic way, but again, it all depends on the context.

**** Whether Harry tells himself to stop thinking about Sirius falling through the veil because it makes him too angry, or because it is too painful, or a mix of both, is important in my opinion.

I personally prefer to have more such information, to get a better grip on a scene. Some details, snips, touch-ups to make a scene more than just a few lines of dialogues with a couple "he said" "she said" thrown in to show who's talking right now. That includes "-ly" information, since that's often easier and breaks the flow less than some convoluted hint at how angry or sad a speaker is.

**** I'd argue a lot has to do with proper character development and setting the stage properly. I think it might be just as important as the dialogue itself. That said, in terms of dialogue, sometimes world choice matters and not just the tag.

That said, I read many fandoms where authors love to write out of character and they don't develop them properly from the start.

** the other thing is that now days a lot of schools are having kids write like that. in elementary your taught to use adverbs and adjectives all the time as "describing words" and then that's it really. they never go back and teach anything else because on the other papers kids write they are written as informative texts not dialog unless quoting something for an English essay. at least at my high schools (im not sure about others) we where told don't use i or dialog as it took away from the facts and the facts where the only thing that mattered.

** I prefer [[http://blue-author.tumblr.com/post/127007499475/writers-doughnut-say-the-word-you-meat-to-say][this advice]] myself.

But in all seriousness, yes, limit adverbs and unnecessary dialogue tags. Use them when they're the best tool available to draw or divert focus where you want.

** A very high portion of fanfictions are filled with useless information. I'm currently reading linkffn(agand and again) and i just read first sentence of each paragraph. Rest is useless. About useless adverb usage, i don't even realize they exist anymore. I just read dialogues and look past the rest. This, of course, is no excuse for writers who got me used to this.

** Overuse of adverbs in general are a hallmark of weak prose. Most sentences should be able to carry their own weight without unnecessary descriptors. So I don't think it's a problem with just dialogue writing.
