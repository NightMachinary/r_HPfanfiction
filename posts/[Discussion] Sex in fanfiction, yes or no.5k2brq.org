Dear readers/writers, how do you feel about sex in fanfiction? I'm not talking about PWP etc, where sex is the main point, and which I like if they are well written, but about plot based long fics who happen to have a lot of sex scenes. I myself usually find it a turn off, since I feel that most of the time it doesn't contribute to the plot/story but exists more to prove a point (such as "Harry is such a tool" - in my experience it occurs the most in superpowered Harry fics, for that reason). I acknowledge that in real life most people are sexual beings and thus having sex scenes in a long fic is realistic, but to me it mostly feels pointless and detracts from the overall product. If the plot necessitates a sex scene, I prefer a "fade to black" kind of approach.

What do you guys think?


** Though I may be exactly the kind of author you're targeting, I've felt that one of the key advantages of fanfiction and its lack of editorial oversight is that we /can/ write those scenes for which most publishers would insist it be written as a fade to black or euphemistic distraction so purple as to be ultraviolet- inscrutable.

Of course, my early attempts at fulfilling this promise of free expression were abysmal, but I feel that I've improved greatly in the delivery... sometimes.

For certain, I could remove half the sex scenes I've written in my most recent story and still retain the meaning, but the other half are integral to the story and relate directly to developments later in the plot, by design. I think it's worth exploring, especially considering how powerful the influence of sex is in our lives.

*** Your last quote is something that I always find chiming in the back of my mind when someone complains about lustful people making stupid decisions. There are plenty of fics that take "thinking with your pants" to an unworkable level, but people really underestimate the mental clouding that can occur when a person is infatuated.

**** I totally agree with that! I find myself getting so caught up in a scene or how a character is supposed to act or how I know they would characteristically react to a situation that I forget to consider how they as a /human/ would react. So so so many historical decisions were made because this king wanted to sleep with this woman or this person wanted that one's land. Greed, lust, laziness, etc can literally change history.

**** I do enjoy writing them, but the reason I'm reconsidering their value in that particular story has to do with a change of intent. After a few chapters, the reviewers were getting more interested in the progression of changes to the canon rather than who I could hook up together.

At the same time I'm still being praised for some of the later sex scenes, so to keep the audience I'm willing to continue spicing up the story when it makes sense to do so. I have extracted a few sex scenes that just weren't that plot-relevant or even logistically probable and intend to post them separately for those who enjoy the erotica. It's like I'm now writing two interlinked stories in tandem (again).

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Depends on the how/why of the scene. I dislike harem fics quite strongly, so I tend to dislike sex scenes in those stories just as much. They tend to be written as if by a 13-year-old virgin who's finally found his or her dad's porn stash and thinks it's THE BEST THING EVER!!!

The "fade to black" seems like a cop-out, honestly. Either do the thing or don't, I am perfectly capable of deciding if I want to read it or not, and if not I'll just skim until I see it's over. Otherwise mentioning the fact that your characters is having sex 9 times out of 10 has no impact on the story, and the lead up was probably just some mushy, lovey-dovey, "twu wuv" BS and now I don't even get any smut to make up for it.

A lot of the sex scenes that are included in fanfic tend to be full of flowery euphemisms and avoid actually mentioning what's being done as much as possible. "Harry worshiped her body and drowned in the pleasure of their love made physical." is about as sexy as getting The Talk from your grandma. Authors who write scenes like this can also just skip the sex scenes and build-up.

A /good/ sex scene can convey quite a lot. Changing feelings between characters, emotional closeness, vulnerability, character growth. I once read one sex scene for a Dragon Age fic that yeah, was pretty much PWP, but it left the characters so damned exposed and raw that it didn't feel like PWP.

So my rules as a reader for a good sex scene are:

1. Know how sex actually works.

2. Grow some balls and actually commit to some raunch.

3. It's not common for people to orgasm together unless they really try.

4. 15-year-olds should not have "fantastic" sex the first time they try.

5. Unless the chick is a banshee, she should not be screeching and moaning from start to finish. Build up to that and save it for things she really enjoys.

6. Use actual descriptors of what's going on, none of this "Harry ran his hands up and down his goddess' glorious body" nonsense.

7. Dirty talk is an art form, but if you're no good at it, just go Google some lines and leave the "Oh my love, take me now!" for the Harlequin romance novels.

** 98% of what I read are romances so I actually expect to see sex somewhere in my stories. It adds to the anticipation of the relationship for me, especially when the act is written after the couple has finally gotten their act together and are now ready to commit to each other on that next level. Honestly, I don't read rated T or heaven forbid, rated K romances because I don't care for the fade-to-black scenes. Now that said, too much sex can be too much and I have left or heavily skimmed through stories where sex is essentially a third character in the story.

I only ask because the skill of writing is something developed through visualization and imagination; veteran writers who are married and have children may be horrid at presenting an explicit sex scene. A young writer with talent, no fear and some worthwhile research materials can put together some of the most titillating scenes.

You have to experience it to really know what you're talking about.

** It really depends on a lot of things to be honest. With some pieces, the sex scenes add character or relationship aspects that might not be properly conveyed elsewhere. Often times though it is not necessary and should be removed. Sex scenes are extremely difficult to write, let alone /well/, and as much as I applaud the effort done by the author, if I can skip it, I likely will.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good PWP (and I have a number bookmarked), but like others have said, it's a very rare skill to have.

If the main character is ace, I'll happily make an exception: their sexuality is still handled in an adult way by their saying no, not interested, rather than pretending this major part of many peoples' lives doesn't exist.

** I used to read them a lot more when I was a teenager and largely unconcerned with how sex actually worked. As an adult I rarely seek it out specifically and am ambivalent about it in longer fics that I read. If it really adds to the story, that's awesome. If it doesn't add anything at all, and the story is getting mediocre, I might just close the tab and move on to another fic. Pointless sex scenes just make me feel bored, not annoyed or disgusted. I care far more about the emotional significance of the acts, and most of that is developed outside of the bedroom anyway.

In my own writing, though, I'm not confident enough in my own narrative voice to write anything explicit. I'd rather imply or just keep it PG for the most part.

A majority of the time I prefer the fanfics I read to have sex in them; because for fuck sake the characters are emotional hormonally charged teenagers, if their isn't any sex it's unrealistic as hell to me.

That being said, if there's no sex in a fic I'm reading by the time I get to chapter 15 or 20, I will often drop it like a bag of dragon shit on fire unless the plot is absolutely stellar. It doesn't have to be good sex, it doesn't have to be anything more than implied or a "fade to black", but if I'm going to continue spending my time reading a fic there has to be sex in some form.

Sex, as pretty much anything else, is ok if it serves a point in the story. If it doesnt it doesnt belong there, just as any other activity wouldnt. Sex for the sake of writing sex is ok in a smut story, but no where else.

And even if sex is important for the story, keep it classy and dont go graphic.

** I do agree that fanfiction on the whole is not the best place to find well-written sex scenes, probably because most writers are fairly inexperienced in that regard - not necessarily in the nuts and bolts, but in the emotional side. Teenage angst leaves me cold I'm afraid.

But in fiction generally, I like it in romances - as long as it packs an emotional punch. I do use some short sex scenes in my own stuff and I hope I make a reasonable job of it. No one has complained yet anyway except for a troll :) Which is success of a sort I supppose.

I don't mind if it exists, as long as I can skip it easily, and some authors are considerate enough to warn you about it. When it is hard to skip, it is a pain. Reading all the way through the Sacrifices arc was the hardest thing, because there's relevant dialogue in there sometimes, and the start and end aren't sharply demarcated.

** As a reader I am fine with sex being presented in stories, both original and derivative ones, for as long as the occurrence of the act makes sense to me in the context of the story (meaning that, regardless of whether or not I personally agree with the decision, I see why the characters would decide to do it). That said, I am fine with both getting the scene proper and with a fade to black, although as I am generally not looking for titillation when I start reading a book that is not designated as porn it means that I simply get through the scene and make sure I didn't miss any important details and then I move on, meaning that the worth of those scenes is often lost to me.

And as a writer I did write scenes of this kind, but they were always scenes that were solely for me and the actual work always had a fade to black instead, as I really like to use ambiguity as a tool (well, that and the reactions of women's bodies I write in those scenes generally tend to be based on how my body reacts, which makes it kind of hard to show it to people).

** My opinion is that often fics fall into a trap whereby once they get their pair together they do little else but have sex. Which although might be like a real life "honeymoon period" doesn't serve plot/story.

I quite like a sex scene, or two over a long fic but any more and I tend to skim passed. No matter how well done they grow dull with repetition.

In the outline for my WIP I have a draft sex scene which I flip-flop on plans to include. I drafted it because it drew out the emotional truth of the characters and served the plot in using physical intimacy as the means of creating emotional distance. I like it, my alpha readers have agreed that it makes the break into the third act work better, but I still hem and haw over it's inclusion.

*** I feel the same. Sex scenes have their place, but a lot of writers have the obligatory sex scene every chapter and it often serves no point.

** too many sex scenes in fanfiction are poorly written wish fulfillment, and honestly add nothing but word count to a story. Of all the various sexual scenes I have read, few are realistic, and border on copying a porn movie. Honestly , unless the story was written to write sex scenes, most of them can be dialed way back and still tell a story. Not criticizing, I like a good PWP as the next reader, but I know that upfront. Good writing doesn't need it. to quote something I wrote years ago.."and the young couple did what young lovers do" It got the point across, and didn't detract from the flow of the story.

** I usually don't care much about them, it only actively turns me away if it reads like the author wanted to try his hand at writing a poor porn scene. Other than that I usually skip through them and carry on.

On the other hand, I actually have enjoyed some when they are contributing to the story - not really for plot, but for character development. Depending on the setting it can be a huge show of trust or something similar and if it has notable effects on a relationship and is well written it can really get some emotional attachment to the story across.

Another interesting attempt are sex scenes where magic is actually involved in some way, mostly for the way it's written. I think it's most common in (soul-)bonding fics though, which can be a whole can of worms to open regarding quality.

** If it doesn't add to the story it should be cut. This applies to pretty much everything.
