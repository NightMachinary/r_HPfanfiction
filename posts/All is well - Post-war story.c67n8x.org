*** Great question! Of course, I wrote it so I'm a little biased, but I personally think I captured the essence of the characters somewhat consistently and in-character. The story itself is, admittedly, nothing outrageously original and sophisticated, but I believe the plot points and the tearjerking scenes, along with what I hope is somewhat good pacing, will pull this story's weight

**** So like the reason people like to read things that have original elements in them is because the originality makes them stand out. If a story did something really differently from the rest of the fan fiction written about it, I would probably be more inclined to read it than a spectacularly well written story with a less than impressive premise. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of good post-war stories out there, and what you might need is something in the summary that will set yours apart.

***** The thing about it is my story is canon-compliant, which doesn't leave much room for going off-limits in terms of standout elements. My greatest strength is creativity in creating diverse atmosphere and conveying feelings and emotions more deeply than most, while also highlighting the key ups and downs of Harry's life as a hero and its ramifications. To answer your proposition, the “problem” here would be that to see the real distinction, you have to actually read the story for yourself, because those are usually not elements you outline in your description.

*** Of course, I'm open to concrit, as I'm always striving to learn from my mistakes (and don't worry, I'll make quite a few, I'll admit)
