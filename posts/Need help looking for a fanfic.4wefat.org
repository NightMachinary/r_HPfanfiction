I read this Fanfic couple of months ago where Harry's friends go to Azkaban where Harry has been living there for quite some time and they also find out that he is married to Tonks, Bellatrix, and Fleur with children.


** I don't see Fleur, but was it linkffn(2267009) ?

*** I read this as well but no this isn't the one I am looking for. But thanks for reminding me that this exists :) Edit: Found the fanfic I was talking about ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3980149/3/A-History-of-Azkaban]]).

  Harry is sent to Azkaban for murder. Years later Dumbledore comes to release him but what he finds is nothing like what he was expecting. Dark and very unforgiving Harry
