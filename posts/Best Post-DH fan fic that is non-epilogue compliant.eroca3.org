Title, doesn't have to have the canon pairings but no slash please. also preferably the fic keeps the characterization close to canon, no Bashing. good prose and grammar would also great.

Edit

would prefer something with him being an Auror. also i should have mentioned i would prefer it wouldn't focus on the new generation as it takes places a few years after dh and the new generation just does not exist.

**** Just read it, it's very close to Harry's canon depiction, and the story is very credible.

Harry is fighting for the exact same cause as before, against an incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. Just because he claimed the title of a dark lord doesn't mean he's throwing his lot with the likes of Malfoy.

The summary already stated that Ron and Hermione are with him. In the story you will find great interactions with George, Neville, Susan, and Fleur.
