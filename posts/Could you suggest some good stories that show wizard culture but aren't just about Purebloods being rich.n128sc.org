Whenever i read a story that says its going to explore wizarding society all that happens is Harry begins to act like and aristocrat (Pretentious little Dick), I'm looking for more normal wizard life. Anything except "Pureblood Culture".


** This. So many of these are just aristocracy and NOTHING ELSE. I want to see a shopping scene. Not the usual Indy!Harry one, where our rich protagonist buys a giant trunk and a wand with more cores than anything Intel has ever dreamed of.

Give me the apothecary and a potions master kibitzing about the "proper" way to sort ingredients. I want to see the artist who carves sculptures out of graphite then uses alchemy to turn it to diamond. What does the balloon animal seller-equivalent give to kids? There's so much worldbuilding space there and it isn't being used.

Other fandoms have plenty of great SI fics, but for some reason, virtually every HP SI is extremely poorly written, and has the SI skipping through canon as the ultimate Mary Sue, treating the setting like a theme park and just being all around cringey.

Linkao3(Cisme) is very philosophical and introspective. Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort) Is a sociopathic SI into LV. Not the best writing but has some original ideas.

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom, AU where Tom Riddle never lost and he mentors Harry

Blood Crest, Harry is raised by a necromancer. He's dark but also sort of timid and not at all OP

HP & Prince of Slytherin, subverts all the tropes in the best way

HP & the Natural 20, hilarious story about a DnD wizard who is summoned into the HP universe

Pureblood Pretense, potions prodigy trades places with her purebred cousin so she can study with Snape at Hogwarts (based on Alana the Lioness)

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3
