****** The author has always been really slow about updating, which is why I'm still holding out.

It establishes that Harry's very powerful but incredibly traumatized. The story hasn't even got to the First Task yet but it's still riveting, definitely worth a read.

The romance is currently non-existent if you're worried about that.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  “To make sure that the basilisk dies?”

  “To make sure that Hogwarts is well and truly safe,” Harry corrected. “The year Hagrid was expelled, the Chamber was open and there was a chance for the snake to be killed. That chance was missed, ignored, whatever. Fate had to wait for a true Parselmouth to arrive to offer the chance again.”

  “What do you propose we do, Evan?”

  Harry looked Dumbledore straight in the eye and said, “We kill the damn thing.”

  “And I assume you know how?”

  Harry shrugged and looked sheepish. “A twelve year-old did it the first time, I think I can manage it, sir.”

  Dumbledore gave the idea some thought. “You believe this will help us in finding the diary?”

  “I don't think it will just suddenly appear in our laps, sir. But,” Harry's voice was full of conviction, “I do think that until the basilisk is destroyed, the diary is necessary to the future.”

  Dumbledore finally nodded his agreement and looked at Harry, the twinkle reemerging in his eyes. “Twelve, Mr. Potter? You must have been an interesting child to have about.”
