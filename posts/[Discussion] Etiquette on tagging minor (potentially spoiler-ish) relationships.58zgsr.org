** IMO you should only tag characters, or pairings that are crucial to the story. It's real problem on AO3 where there are tags for everybody who appears even for one line. It's misleading and unnecessary.

*** I definitely agree with the AO3 problem! It would be better if there was a way to limit the number of ships you search for, or to set a "priority level" or at least exclude ships you don't want to read.

The struggle for me is, what does it take for a pairing to become crucial? If they move the plot along in a really important way but are not actually in it a lot, is that crucial? What about the other way around? I'm sure it's case-by-case pretty much always, but I'm just always looking for more input.

**** In case of pairings I would tag it only when if its romantic subplot forms important and big part of the story. There is no need to tag something that is mentioned, even if it moves plot along.

To compare it with the characters. Would you tag Godric Gryffindor in a fic where mention of his heroic deeds inspires main character to be braver and do something plot relevant?

***** That's a good way to think of it, in terms of tagging characters. Again, it's the line between importance and size of subplot that I'm still finding challenging, but I think it seems like the consensus is air on the side of not tagging if unsure.

** I believe you should only tag major pairings. You could include a tag that simply says "background pairings" and an author's note saying that if people want to know more then they can comment, or if you have a personal blog or tumblr, etc, you could make a post there mentioning the pairing and direct people to it.

You might get a few complaints from people who don't like a background pairing, but in my experience people complain a lot more about over tagging of minor pairings. Someone who's looking for fics about a certain pairing isn't going to have that much interest in stories where that pairing is hardly seen, and it can be very irritating to be browsing through a pairing tag and have a bunch of stories where they don't show up all that much.

*** I like the idea of the 'background pairings' tag! I've used it before, and also tagged the background pairing, but in a situation like this one it would make sense to just have that as a quick thing and then expand further somewhere else.

I agree about the frustration when looking for fics (especially common with rare pairings) when they're mentioned and you read six chapters only to barely see them ever. I think it makes more sense to under-tag rather than over-tag, in this case. :)

** I think tagging the main character/pairing is important and everything else is just annoying. I filter pairings pretty much everytime i'm browsing ff.net or ao3 for somethign new and if you tag something that isn't actually a big part of the story i just get annoyed.

Similarly i dislike it when authors don't tag a pairing at all. If they want to have some suspense or several different relationships for the main character then i would prefer if at least the possible relationship partners were tagged without the relationship itself being indicated.

I might be obsessing a bit but pairings in a story are fairly important to me because there are some that i just can't stand and no matter how good the story is i won't want to read it. If such a story is not tagged with the relevant pairing I just feel like I wasted my team reading as far as I did only to find out that it's a story with /that/ pairing and then just stop.

It's gotten to the point that I just open random chapters and skim through them in order to find out pairing before i start reading because the author didn't tag them...

On the other hand if the pairing i don't like only plays a minor role it won't bother me too much but if it's still tagged i likely won't read the story.

*** So, see, your whole post feels like all the same contradictions I have mentally. Pairings are very important to me, and I browse almost exclusively within pairings, rather than by genre or anything else.

I also have some that I just can't stand and make me close a story instantly.

So here's the dilemma, then: would you rather know the pairings that will exist in the story, even if they're minor, so that you can decide not to waste time on a fic? Or would you rather only know the main pairing and then be frustrated later if a pairing you don't like comes up?

I don't /think/ any of the pairings I'm including are particularly polarizing. There's one that's probably a bit out there, but I think the bigger polarizing pairings are things like Snarry, or Tomione, etc, both of which are definitely not and will never be present in the story. Instead it's odd ones, the inclusion of a femslash couple that may raise some brows for example.

I dunno.

I think I'm going to lean to not tagging pairings and maybe as the story progresses I can see what the general consensus seems to be. There are two main pairings that are rather integral to my story line so those will get tagged and hopefully that'll be enough.

**** As I said i mainly only care about the main pairing. Most stories focus only on one anyway. I don't particularly care if Hermione is paired with Snape as long as there's not 10 chapters talking about it.

On the other hand if you do tag it and it only plays a minor role I won't read your story /because/ it is tagged.

So in general i agree with you, don't tag anything other than the main pairing and everything's fine. :)

** On AO3, the most important thing is never fail to properly set the archive warnings and to be reasonable about the rating. Oh, and you should make sure that M/M is in the category set. Those are the things you're kind of /obligated/ do there.

However, on AO3, the tags there are just for people to find the fic they want, they're not a warning mechanism etc. so I wouldn't worry beyond that. Include or leave out whatever seems reasonable.

*** Yeah, AO3 is certainly an interesting place in terms of content - tagging too. Unfortunately I struggle endlessly trying to upload things to ff.net so I have pretty much given up posting over there.

It's a good point about the warning mechanism thing though, AO3 really has no excluding system so people I'm assuming are searching more for what they want, rather than filtering what they don't.

**** Oh, you can absolutely exclude. Use "-" in your tag search. Equally to the point, though, if you scan the icons while looking through the results for what to read.
