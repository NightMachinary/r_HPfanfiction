So, I started reading HP fanfics nearly three months ago. I haven't stopped since. Many a sleepless nights were spent reading stories. I've learned a few things in my time:

- I'm only here for the smut
- I'm not original and am into that Dramione nonsense
- I wanna share my freaky thoughts

I finished writing a story that I sat on for about a month until I decided to release it on ffnet and ao3. I'd really love some feedback because not everyone reviews on these websites and even though I have decent traffic, I can't improve my writing skills on numbers alone.

​

I've been posting a chapter everyday (because I need immediate satisfaction and I can't deny my readers of that) and I'll post two tomorrow so it'll be completely released. It's a little long winded but trust me, the payoff is worth it, in my humble opinion.

​

I haven't done this before and don't think I can post a link so it's called /A Curious Thing/ by Keeks1664. You can find it on the aforementioned websites above!
