** There's also one where Harry gets chosen as professor in 6th year. Probably dead, though.

**** Can't find it. I'm pretty sure it was called “Professor Potter” and it was on Ffn. I'm fairly sure the unique thing about it, outside the timing, was the Triple Test, if anyone else can find it.

Also, it was him or Umbridge.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.
