Seems pretty obvious, they bond while helping to raise Teddy, yet I've never seen it.

Thanks.

** Nymphadora Tonks and the Secret Admirer fits, but about half of Chelseyb's stuff is Honks, and it's the best of the genre in my opinion

** Would really like to see something like this!

[[/u/Pete91888]] 's suggestion has just made me want to read it more. Shame that it's abandoned.

*** I really like the idea but I don't think anyone has done it well. The fic Pete recommended was really badly written, I stopped reading it.
