Lily tearing Harry a new one for even considering his plan, James suggesting that he ought to kill the Death Eaters from under the cloak one by one or Sirius suggesting that he did enough for the country and should simply find a nice tropical island and a local beauty to enjoy life. Anything really.

No m/m and no Death Eater whitewashing, please.


** The theory that spirits cast be the stone always end up somehow calling for the user to join them in death(even a happy/curious person calling for a chat) has become headcanon for me. Not sure where I saw it either, though I think it was mentioned in "For Love of Magic"?

** Yes I agree Hellstrike! It always seemed super creepy and disturbing that Lily, someone who got herself killed on the off chance to save her son's life as a baby, would appear before him later and then urge him to go kill himself!

That's why I do like the theory someone put here once about the Resurrection Stone enticing its users to commit suicide and that the "spirits" aren't actually real, or if they are their being mind controlled or something.

It just totally does not FIT Lily that she would do that to her own kid. She'd probably actually tell him to run the other way and go live! She died so he could.

I guess that's just more JK Rowling putting plot before character though? :( Like all of book 6. :( :(

You can have both? They don't have to be mutually exclusive. Someone who lays down their life so others can live can still want to live themselves. And had Harry done it any other way, Voldemort would have killed a fuck load more people when he entered the battle.

***** But it seems very odd if a scared teenager suddenly reenacted 300. Because being scared shitless is in the way of efficiently slaughtering large quantities of enemies. If you read "To Hell and Back" or interviews with Simo HÃ¤yha, they aren't afraid during their most famous moments. Beforehand and afterwards, but not in the heat of the moment.

*** The versions of Lily, James, Sirius and Remus that come out of the Stone are a machination of Stone, an artifact of Death, one which, according to the story, nudges the user to Death.

They've got virtually nothing in common with the actual people who lived.

**** Right, that's my interpretation too.

The Resurrection Stone is actually a lying piece of junk that encourages its owner to commit suicide.

That being said, the hallucinations it generates can perfectly tell Harry to get some serious explosives, use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak up on his enemies, and blow everything within a few hundred meters radius to smithereens.

Afterwards, Harry's friends should have it easy cleaning up the rest of the scums. It's a pity Hagrid has to die too, but I think he will be understanding.

***** Not sure how you can say that it isn't canon, just because it isn't explicitly stated.

Lily, when she lived, gave her own life without a thought for Harry's. Even the echo of Lily that comes out buys Harry time to escape. It is the exactly same for James - his last action in life is try and buy time for Lily and Harry to escape. Sirius, when he lived, well...he literally lived off rats to be close to Harry and provide support. When he learned that Harry had been lured to Ministry, he comes with the rest of the Order to try and rescue Harry, even though he's a wanted criminal with a Kiss on sight order attached to him.

After all that their real-life selves do, we have the Stone's versions saying shit like, "Dying? Quicker and easier than falling asleep," and "You've been so brave." If that is not them egging Harry on to die, I don't know what is.

******* But is there a /guarantee/ of an afterlife? Ghosts are just imprints left behind, the stone might have been created by a mad wizard and then misidentified based on the legends its spawned, the veil of death may be a similar artifact, and Limbo-King's Cross may have been a hallucination. Hell, we know that Dementors exist; whose to say there isn't a whole ecosystem of horrors that feed on the departed mortals?

Sure, there's evidence that the afterlife does exist, but there's also a set of circumstances in which all of that evidence exists despite the lack of a (pleasant) afterlife, as the combined efforts of mad wizards and natural phenomena in the mortal world.

I don't mean to be so bleak, but still, so long as magic is a thing, you can't trust your eyes and ears 100%. That stone could have been created as a trap - or trapped by someone after its creation - and could very well be trying to subtly kill everyone who uses it; no afterlife necessary.

******** Broooooovhe dementor and ecosystem comment has be SHOOOOOK!

It makes so much sense too. It's obvious that wizards don't know everything about monsters (evidences by lots of little things with hagrid, the fact that there are wizards in the field studying things still.

So it totally makes sense that there are beings who eat up all the residual magic and soul after wizards die. Like it makes more sense for them to exist them for them not to

******** I made that comment to explain why Harrys ghostly parents might want Harry to walk to his death. The previous commenter has made arguments over several comments, that the parents must be faked by the stone, because real parents would never want Harry to die.

But assuming the parents are real, that would mean there is a guaranteed afterlife. And if that's so, it might be quite reasonable from the perspective of the dead parents to want their child to join them.

I agree with you completely in that from the perspective of a living person, the stone offers no real proof that dying is a good thing, and if I was in Harrys shoes I would not consider it a proof of afterlife.

But if the summoned ghosts are real, than it would make sense for them to want their loved ones to die, because they wouldn't actually be dying. They would just transform to a different state of being.

** I read recently a story where each Hallow actually beckons the user to their death. The Wand makes them courageous, sure of their power, makes them want to fight and, consequently, to find themselves in situation where they can die. The Stone summons spirits/fake apparitions that lure the wizard to their death by appealing to their love for them. The Cloak instead encouraged its wielder to remain anonymous and stay under the radar, just do the absolute minimum necessary to remain alive and nothing else until they could pass the Hallow on to the next generation thereby continuing the cycle.
