:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been trying to find this fic for a few years now! I hope you guys can help. Anyway, I remember that Harry goes back in time and brings a bunch of others with him, and everyone who died also came back, they lived in Potter manor (not 100% on that) but I remember voldie was there as he had been “reborn” or something and was tom riddle again and he taught the group how to fly like death eaters (with the weird black cloud thing) I remember Cedric and Fred both remembered that they died. I remember Harry was also MOD and had death pretending to be Voldemort and McGonagall inviting him to sit at Gryffindor table to fck with dumbledore

  Harry was supposed to survive the killing curse during the Battle of Hogwarts, but Fate, Destiny, and Death had other plans. Harry died, but when he did he learned the truth about Dumbledore, Voldemort, and the people whom he thought loved him. He came back to make some changes! *AU* Bash! Some Weasleys, and Hermione! Dark Dumbledore!* ABANDONED See profile for details.
