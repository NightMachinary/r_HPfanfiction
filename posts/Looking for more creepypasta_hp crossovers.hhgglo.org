So I've read a few of these and am looking for more. I've read through Brother in Arms(in all it's 93 chapters glory) and Harry by Proxy, as well as Tale of the Clown's Mage and Brillian Potter. I've pretty much read through the tags on FFN and Ao3, but haven't checked out any other websites, and I don't know if there's more out there that aren't tagged as a crossover. So give the best ones you've read.


** Not sure if I can find it, but there's a fem harry one if you want to page through that tag.
