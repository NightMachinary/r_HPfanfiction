Hey guys, I have been looking ages for a fic I read a few years ago. Some details I remember. Harry and Hermione go back in time to when James and Lily are alive using some potion. I think it happens in 6th year. Ron is watching over the potion. They pretend to be married and live next doors to James and Lily. While they are back in time they also start destroying the horcruxes and eventually they replace James and Lily in their house on October 31 when Voldemort comes... Any help would be brilliant.

  Dumbledore concocts a cunning plan to travel back in time and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. His untimely death prevents him from going so Harry must go in his place, and take the one person whose help he really needs with him.
