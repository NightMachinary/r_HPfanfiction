Before Harry attended Hogwarts, he always had the ability to summon an ethereal Stag.

When he summoned it, he would have pleasant dreams that night, and anyone in a 0.5 mile radius would feel an inexplicable feeling of joy.

Of course when he shows this to Professor Flitwick he is immediately taken to the Headmaster's office.


** Sounds like a Genius!Harry , he would probably get whole lot of recognition and teaching for it
