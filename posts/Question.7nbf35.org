What are some American/British muggle pop culture references in the mid-nineties that can be tattooed? I was picturing my OC Josephine and her two younger sisters getting/having similar tattoos Both Josephine and her younger sister Clarissa already have a tattoo but they will take their youngest sister to get a tattoo after she turns 17.

They're half-bloods since their dad is a squib and their mom is a muggle.

**** It's a reference to your poor choice of title. I believe so anyway.

*** They were born in America between 1973-1979. But their dad and granny are British while their mom is an American muggle.

I was thinking something from a TV show. I was going to use a Doctor Who reference but I want to do something else.

**** One idea I have: I do believe Pink Floyd was relatively popular at that time, and the cover of [[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-EzURpTF5c8/maxresdefault.jpg][the dark side of the moon]] might make a cool tattoo.

Just one idea, didn't grow up during that time though :/

***** I got the idea of the movie The Princess Bride which was released in 1987 which was Josephine's third or fourth year.

** A classic 90's tattoo for a woman is a Chinese word (that likely doesn't mean what she think it means), or a tribal design on the small of her back (tramp stamp).

*** I had one of my other OCs get a dragon tattoo on the small of her back.

I was picturing the tattoo on their shoulders or arm.
