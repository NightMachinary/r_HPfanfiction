** Suffering, bitter and paranoid. Slytherin is a shithole infested with pureblood supremacy where no one calls out the likes of Draco Malfoy when he calls for racial purges. We don't see any of the lot ever stand up for what was good or right.

Hermione would have to watch her back 24/7. She would make no friends there.

*** On the bright side, they /probably/ won't attempt to murder her until Voldemort returns, whenever that happens, because while bullying can generally be swept under the rug, a dead student not so much.

/If/ she can progress in magic quickly enough, she might just be too dangerous a target to go after after Voldemort does come back.

***** I think we've had this conversation before. Yes, there are more methods to conceal a crime. There are also vastly more methods to investigate one---not to mention the risk of your victim becoming a ghost---so it's a wash.

Despite a civil war raging outside of Hogwarts in the 70s, parents from both sides still sent their children there. It took once-in-a-century genius, a "clean" murder method nobody could even imagine, a gullible headmaster, and a highly convenient patsy for Tom Riddle to get away with murdering Myrtle---and even then, had Dumbledore been the headmaster, he would have probably dug deeper and caught him.

Now, combine that with the general squeamishness that people, including Slytherins like Draco, have towards murder and the Slytherin traits of self-preservation and distrust. How many Slytherins would have both a decent chance of pulling it off and the willingness to martyr themselves to the cause of their house's purity?

Now, once Voldemort returns, Hermione better be ready, because Voldemort's favour may well be worth risking Dumbledore's wrath.

How do you know this? In particular, there is a general consensus in the fandom that Myrtle's murder was used to create the Diary horcrux, and I don't think a mere accident would suffice for that.

Fun fact: they were shipped to Azkaban /after/ the Dementors had left it.

To the point, with respect to the Ministry and Umbridge, what you are describing is people standing by as evil is perpetrated, or contributing to it in very indirect ways, just by doing the same jobs they were doing before, but under a different government. You are describing a failure to be a hero, not a lack of squeamishness.

Draco proves my point: he only had the stomach for convoluted, indirect plots; but the more complex the plot, the more likely it is to fail or kill the wrong person and, paradoxically, the more tracks it leaves.

Actually, that could be a plot point in a Slytherin!Hermione fic:

1. Some upper-year slips Hermione a cursed artefact.
2. Hermione detects the curse or discovers the plan, and manipulates one of her bullies---say, Pansy---into stealing it from her as she is wont to.
3. Pansy is killed or maimed.
4. Adding to the official investigation, the Parkinsons call in favours to find the culprit, who is ultimately betrayed by their peers and sent to Azkaban.
5. No one ever touches Hermione's stuff again.

******** Because if Riddle had planned the murder, he would have been better prepared for the aftermath. Just look at his parents murder a few weeks later to see what he is capable of. And from what little Myrtle says, it really sounds like she just stumbled into the whole mess rather than Riddle tracking her down. There's no Motive.

********* Myrtle was an eyewitness to the basilisk, and so Tom Riddle killed her, even if he hadn't been planning to. That's murder in the common use of the word, as well as under both English and US law (Second Degree Murder in most US jurisdictions). Anyway, I think that your point is that he didn't plan it and so his cover up was not ideal, and it doesn't hinge on the definition.

I take your point that he probably could have orchestrated a murder in Hogwarts even better had he had a chance to plan it, but that only partially negates all his advantages, and it doesn't change the fact that Hogwarts was considered safe for children on both sides even in the middle of a civil war.

--------------

Very few Ministry officials were actually involved in the tribunal or had close contact with those they oppressed. Vast, vast majority just continued doing their jobs. The way I see it, to attempt to murder Hermione prior to Voldemort's return, a Slytherin or a group of them have to pass through a number of filters, which includes being willing to commit a murder in the first place, believing themselves able to do it in a way they are willing to and get away with it (or willingness to be prosecuted for it), actually being able to do it, and not being squeamish about doing it directly, if that's the most effective way. Each filter makes the attempt less likely or less likely to succeed.

** Another neat Slytherin!Hermione idea was originally [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ten-a-surprise-you-be-sure-not-to-miss.636976/post-59860717][posted here]]. I don't know whether this person every wrote the fic, but it could be a very elegant Slytherin!Hermione: single point of divergence, and avoiding the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine][Trauma Conga Line]] that the premise suggests.

1.  Hermione's parents are murdered by a renegade Death Eater when she is around 10, or maybe as late as during her Diagon Alley shopping trip.
2.  As a PR move, Lucius Malfoy proposes to adopt her.
3.  The Malfoys charm Hermione and she agrees to the adoption.
4.  Dumbledore would let the Malfoys adopt her in the hope that amid their virtue-signalling, some of the virtue might diffuse into them; but he would take precautions. (I can picture him taking some object, like Hermione's mother's necklace, enchanting it, and telling Hermione to wear it always; and telling Lucius that if he or Narcissa hurt her, he will know and will not allow law to bind his wrath.)
5.  The Malfoys spend some time parading Hermione in public, but then when the novelty wears off, they pretty much leave her to her own devices, interacting with her as little as possible.
6.  Draco makes up for it by saying out loud what his parents are thinking.
7.  Lucius and Narcissa are not happy that their adoptive daughter has more talent and a stronger personality than their son, but there isn't much they can do about it.
8.  By the time she gets to Hogwarts, after being paraded around as a Muggleborn charity case, and resentful of the parental affection Draco is getting, Hermione has a chip on her shoulder a metre in diameter, and ends up right alongside him, in Slytherin.
9.  Driven by the need to prove herself and a sense of foreboding that if anything happens to a supercentenarian wizard, she might just be quietly disposed of, she seeks out any and all magic that would help her, and any and all allies she might be able to find.
10. But, the time with the Malfoys have given her somewhat better social skills and some preexisting connections, as well as a "model minority" status, so she is not completely ostracised and at least has study partners, if not outright friends, mostly in Ravenclaw, but a few in Hufflepuff and Slytherin.
11. Draco is somewhat radicalised by his experiences with Hermione. Based on their preexisting conflicts, she is going to rub her every achievement in his face---while calling him "brother". That would inspire a level of loathing towards Muggleborns that would make him far more eager to serve Voldemort than the more abstract sense of solidarity he had in canon. Ultimately, though, he just can't keep up.
12. Of course, at some point, Voldemort returns and demands that Lucius dispose of the Mudblood as a loyalty test---if nothing else to prove that he is more afraid of him than of Dumbledore.
13. Hermione executes a contingency plan and narrowly escapes to go to Dumbledore for help.
14. Dumbledore stashes her with the Weasleys and/or Sirius over the summer, where she becomes acquainted with the Order as well as Harry and Ron.
15. I can see her snogging Ron: she finds him attractive, Ron is the anti-Draco, and she is in the habit of going after what she wants; and Ron despite himself finds the scary workaholic Slytherin witch appealing.
16. There would probably be some non-bashy friction between her and Mrs. Weasley, since Hermione is used to taking care of herself and doesn't appreciate her form of mothering.
17. Back to Hogwarts, Hermione is conflicted between returning to Slytherin to show that she is not afraid and being able to sleep at night, because some upper-years ganging up, murdering her, and fleeing Hogwarts to join Voldemort is a remote possibility but one that she can't ignore. Ultimately, despite spending a summer around Gryffindors, she chooses safety; she can't be resorted, and she attends her classes as a Slytherin, but she sleeps at an undisclosed location.

From that point, you'd probably have a wizarding war with Hermione being unambiguously on the Order's side and quite a powerful asset, but she never quite puts herself into the chain of command: she just has too much resentment over being used by others.

** The way I see it, for someone who doesn't fit into the Slytherin's existing mould well---whether Harry, Hermione, Snape, or Ron---Slytherin is a high-risk--high-reward place. It will either spur them to do great things (possibly great and terrible) or chew them up and spit them out; and sometimes both, as in Snape's case.

Hermione---gifted, resourceful, outspoken, blunt---is a particularly extreme case of this, for reasons others have outlined. It will seriously test her "Killed---or worse, expelled" mindset, but it will also light a fire under her arse: unlike the rest of her year, the only way she can get any friends and even ensure her safety is by displaying overwhelming magical power---while keeping some in reserve, in case someone surprises her; and Hermione is very good at learning difficult magic quickly from books.

I can see a concerted effort to make her drop out; but Dumbledore could probably mitigate that by announcing that /if/ Hermione is driven to drop out, then Slytherin will be denied the House Cup until every single student in the house at the time has graduated. Sure, it's a collective punishment, but House Points are already a collective punishment. That would /probably/ reduce the incidence of severe bullying and sabotage, but it won't make Hermione any less ostracised---perhaps the opposite, even.

I don't think anyone will actually try to murder her until after Voldemort returns---at that point, Dumbledore won't have a monopoly on uberwizard violence. By that point, she better be ready to take all comers.

--------------

Several years ago, I outlined a 7-year fic in quite a bit of detail, even wrote some scenes, then decided not to write it because there were some issues that I was not able to resolve some issues to my satisfaction. It was quite a bit Darker and Edgier than what I described above, however. The assumption is that she would be constantly bullied by students of all years, and there would be little that Snape (and Dumbledore, though he'd be largely ignorant) would be willing to do. If I were to outline it today, I probably wouldn't make that assumption.

In the end, she becomes a vicious Dark witch and an anti-Malfoy, anti-Voldemort fanatic. She spends most of Hogwarts throwing her grades and playing the meek perennial bullying victim, while assassinating several of her peers in order to influence politics outside of Hogwarts and make a horcrux. The main points:

*Hogwarts:*

- The canon plot gets derailed pretty hard at the end of the first year, when Harry never confronts Quirrelmort, and Quirrelmort grabs the whole Mirror of Erised and flees. (He never does get the Stone out of the Mirror, but after a few years of work, he manages to synthesise enough Elixir of Life to come back---destroying both the Mirror and the Stone in process.) It is further derailed in the second year, when Hermione, being friends with Myrtle, ends up taking the Diary before Harry; then as an unintended consequence of her Legilimency practice, exposes Pettigrew, and then manages to knock him out with a crazy-prepared Potion.
- She makes the horcrux on Hogwarts Express at the end of her fifth year. She does it for the greater good, of course: she is just too indispensable to the anti-Voldemort cause, even if Dumbledore himself doesn't know that and only knows that there have been deadly several tragedies on his watch that have been awfully convenient for him and exonerated Sirius politically. In fact, up until she felt her soul tear, she wasn't sure it would take, since the cold-blooded murder she had committed to make the horcrux was for a good cause.
- Around the start of her 6th year, shortly after she had made the horcrux, Dumbledore finally connects the dots and summons her. They have a long conversation during which they reconstruct WTF had happened over the prior 5 years, including the 2 of Voldemort's horcruxes that had ended up in Hermione's possession and how Voldemort managed to get a new body. Hermione does not admit to any of her crimes, and Dumbledore believes strongly that she has done what he thinks she has done, but he also can't move against her without handing Voldemort a huge victory. In the end, they discuss (in hypothetical terms) the philosophy of how justified her tactics are in the world they inhabit. They have several more conversations over the year, as Dumbledore is increasingly incapacitated by the ring curse (that did get him on schedule).
- It does enable her to get the Horcrux out of Harry without killing him, because, having performed the horcrux ritual, she can reproduce the parts of it needed to separate the two souls. (Hence why Dumbledore didn't do it in canon: he didn't have first-hand experience making a horcrux.)
- She caps her Hogwarts career off around the end of her 6th year, by manipulating Draco into killing her with the Killing Curse, while making it look like he did it to make a horcrux. She then flies off to get herself restored by her followers (at that point, Penelope Clearwater, Ginny Weasley, and one or two Slytherins she had turned). However, she gets greedy and tries to lure out Lucius Malfoy to assassinate him before Draco is Kissed (the punishment for making a horcrux), which backfires, and while Lucius dies, Draco is mostly exonerated though now as terrified of Hermione as he is of Voldemort, and Voldemort becomes aware of her and followers.

*Conclusion:*

- To salvage the situation---since Voldemort is still significantly more powerful than her, and since Dumbledore had died---Hermione pulls out her last resort scheme. She had figured out how to conjure antimatter a while prior, but it requires constant effort to contain without annihilating, so it only works as a suicide attack. And so, she asks to meet Voldemort under truce---and offers to let him choose to take whatever precautions he wants---and the moment they are close enough, she dispels the containment magic and annihilates them both and everyone around them, to buy her side more time. (My headcanon is that the restoration ritual is only possible three times a year: the Summer Solstice and the two Equinoxes. You /don't/ want to try it during the Winter Solstice.)
- Once they are both in their shadow forms, she realises that her soul is bigger than Voldemort's (since she only made one horcrux, whereas he made 7), and so she spontaneously decides to ram it, and they begin to fuse together, increasingly sharing a mind. Hermione is mostly in control, but Voldemort is better at mind and soul magic than she is, and so she can feel that he might win in the end.
- She flies to the homunculus that her followers had prepared for her and enters it. She then proceeds to tell them and her allies (Sirius, Harry, and possibly others) where to find Voldemort's remaining horcruxes from the information in their shared mind. (Voldemort might have rehidden some of them under Fidelius, but isn't it convenient that she happens to be sharing a soul with him at the moment?)
- She also tells them how to find her horcrux and instructs them to destroy it as well, keeping the homunculus sedated using the Draught of the Living Death until that's done, then killing the homunculus to send both of them into Limbo---because the risk of Voldemort taking over their combined mind---including the knowledge of how to conjure antimatter---is too great.

*Ending:* Two possibilities:

- *Happy:* Some time after, the homunculus is slain, but even as Hermione feels herself without a body again, she feels herself being cleansed of Voldemort's soul. Her followers and allies risked not destroying her horcrux, but for her willingness to sacrifice her life and her afterlife, magic gave her a boon. She returns into another homunculus and restored to her physical body. Restored, surrounded by friends who showed such faith and mercy for her, she feels an urge to cast a Patronus and succeeds for the first time.
- *Bittersweet:* Her allies do destroy all horcruxes as instructed, but while Hermione never quite repented for her actions, her willingness to sacrifice her life and her afterlife healed her soul enough to allow her to continue to the Next Great Adventure, as Voldemort's soul remains in Limbo.

*The planned title:* /Hermione Granger and the Greater Good/.

Now, if all this strikes you as a tad wanky, I am well aware of this, and it's part of why I decided not to write the fic after all. I /have/ written a few snippets that I'd posted in various places, however.

*** It's a fic that I follow and sometimes recommend, but I feel that it's throwing in too many extracanonical setting elements, favour from others, and power-ups to the protagonist to genuinely explore the premise.

In some sense, a Hermione who has a prophecy about her or a destiny is no longer really Hermione: she no longer has the self-made newcomer ethos. If the New Blood thing had been entirely a bluff backed by her intellect, massive amounts of hard work and discipline, and no small amount of skulduggery, I would enjoy the story far more.

I also felt that her being friends with Harry while scheming behind his back with her Slytherin classmates to harm Ron should have had more consequences, and getting away with that bordered on /Green Girl/-style suedom.
