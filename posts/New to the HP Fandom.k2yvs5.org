Hello all, I'm from the Percy Jackson Fandom, but I've always had a love for the Harry Potter world. I write fluffy mortal AU's and decided to give some of the HP characters a shot. I just published the first chapter of the crossover story. It will be HP character x PJO character, so that I can learn how to write HP characters. They're one-shots about how the characters could have met. I would appreciate any constructive criticism and feedback. Thank you and take care.
