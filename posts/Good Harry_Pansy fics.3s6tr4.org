  Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

#+begin_quote
  When Pansy finds herself on the wrong side of Voldemort, she persuades her parents that only one person could help them. Harry. A story that looks at what could happen if Harry had someone who loved him, someone who would push him, and someone who would back him financially.
#+end_quote

Similar characterization to most Daphne fics though.

*** Most people don't like pansy but like daphne. Pansy seems to be the antithesis of hermione in canon, xenophobe, dumb, ugly, dainty, and weak. Daphne on the other hand in most fics is a perfect oc. A better hermione because she's deviously smart. Truth be told Daphne and Harry fics are a guilty pleasure for me but I wish there were more pansy Harry fics. Why is Draco likable when is just as much of an annoying turd like pansy. it's baffling how its popular for Draco to be redeemable and a great character but not pansy.

  Pansy wanted to turn in Harry because she was scared.
#+end_quote

Of course she was. She wasn't a noble gryffindor. Marietta Edgecombe did worse to harry as a ravenclaw. What draco did in fear was worse cause he let a bunch of psycho terrorists into a school full of children. Pansy wanted to turn in one person to save herself, but through that she could save many. Basically people like attractive actors. In the movies draco, Hermione and snape were all more attractive than they are described in the books.

***** Well, to be fair to him, this Pansy story predates pretty much the entirety of the Daphne craze. A lot of his stories seem super cliche, but he was one of the first (if not a first) to incorporate a lot of them, and a lot of fics since then have merely gone with the same formula. So, pretty much, we can blame Jeconais (and a few other early authors) for a lot of the shitty cliches that get regurgitated in every other fic to this day. It's just a shame that this dude never really improved in his writing.

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.
