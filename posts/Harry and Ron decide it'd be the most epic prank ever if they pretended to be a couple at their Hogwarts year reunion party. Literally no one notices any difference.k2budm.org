** When they met up again in Hog's Head - Harry dressed as a vampire, Ron as a Dementor - that Halloween, it had been a while since they met. Ginny had decided to do a world tour, so she was with her brother in Egypt now, and Harry was, he confessed, feeling a bit lost. ‘Normally I'd be attacked by now,' he said, drinking his beer. ‘Now the only thing I need to worry about is my kids getting in trouble.' ‘Well, the Reunion is coming up,' Ron said. ‘You can see them then.' Harry grimaced. ‘Wouldn't be the same,' he said, thinking back to last year. Ron had gotten marvelously drunk and told the most wonderful stories, making it all seem like one big adventure, with a stereotypical villain to overthrow, much like his books. He and Hermione had, to their credit, done extensive research and even Harry had been roped into telling about his experience with Quirrel, the Chamber, Lupin and, once again, Voldemort's revival. The writing was brilliant, but Ron was a far better story - teller and not at all uncomfortable with the attention, so he had spent all his time entertaining the students, instead of with the others. That wouldn't have been a problem, he told himself, if Harry hadn't been stared at and asked for details and confirmation, such as with Ron's Sorting Troll, something he /insisted/ happened his first year. ‘ - Could prank them this time,' Ron said now. ‘Sorry, what?' Ron blushed. ‘Work at the Shop's rubbing off on me,' he muttered. ‘I am just saying, we could do a easy prank, like pretending to be a couple or something. To spice things up a bit. I mean, you're bored sick otherwise, and I think we both know how to do that couple thing.' Harry rather liked the idea, now that he thought about it. It would be awkward, sure, but it would be awkward for something he was /doing/, instead of something he had once done with little choice in the matter. Hermione would approve too, he thought, if only because of the message it spread. ‘Yeah, sounds fun,' he said. ‘So, do we hold hands walking in?' ‘Of course! And I'll talk with you a bit more,' he said, almost apologetically. ‘A loss for the students,' Harry quipped. So it was decided then. They'd make sure to kiss each other on the cheek at least once before going to meet others, use pet names frequently, and so on and so forth.

As he stood in front of the Great Hall, Harry felt de familiar nerves coming up. Ron squeezed his hand. They walked in, anticipating the weird looks they'd no doubt get.

‘Welcome, Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley,' Professor McGonagall said, barely looking twice. They blinked and continued. ‘Uncle Ron!' A tiny redhead came running up to them. ‘Hugo says you've got the /best/ stories! Will you tell us about the Sorting Troll and the Chess Game of Doom, Uncle Ron?'\\
He, too, did not even look at their hands. ‘Darling?' ‘Go ahead,' Harry sighted. ‘Harry Potter, sir, you were there weren't you? Is it true what the books say? Did you burn the bad man?' Harry began to wonder if the kid was related to a House Elf, with his high, squeaky voice and the ‘Harry Potter, sir' and Merlin, he was /tiny/! With a slight sight he began answering. The rest went much the same. Nobody even looked puzzled at the pet names and the kissing, even when - in slight frustration - they began to kiss for real. The only difference was that kids who wanted to interrupt them were shushed away by the staff.

The next day, the papers ran a short but happy article called ‘/True love at last!/' were the writer contently noted that ‘/after all their struggles and hardships, and after what looked to be a rocky reunion last year (see page 2), it looks like at long last, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley (Twin Souls or Cheaters? Find out on page 5-6. For more information around their exploits, see pages 8-10) found each other, not in a whirlwind romance but in a relationship that only those two could have; build on mutual support and shared memories of the War. While it is unknown how their girlfriends took it, I am sure we all hope they broke up amicably. In the meantime, here are seven pictures of this cute couple. For more pictures, we have dedicated the entire next page to those sweethearts! For more history on homosexuality, see ‘Servant or lover? Merlin and Arthur explored'. For a comprehensive history, check out ‘The Wizards of Stonewall' and ‘A Complete History of Sexuality In The Magical Community' which now has a sequel; ‘On Gender in A Transfiguring World'./

Well, Harry thought, as he watched himself kiss Ron, with a wink and a smile. This has gotten a bit out of hand.

**** I wouldn't say that it hates slash, but just that the most common slash pairing are unfortunately incredibly toxic ones. I've read some of the Harry and Ron slash fics that are out there and enjoyed a few of them (the ones I didn't were mainly just because of poor writing), but I absolutely refuse to read a Drarry or Snarry fic for the same reason I won't read a Dramione fic, I hate the idea of people being paired with someone who consistently abused them.

***** Oh, come on. It's obvious in this thread than any other that "most common slash pairings are toxic" is just an excuse to validate homophobia in this subreddit. The original comment was about Harry/Ron, the most vanilla lgbt ship possible in this fandom.

How many times have you seen Delenda Est recommended in this sub? Because I'm pretty sure it's in top 3, at least. So how is it that a fanfic with Harry/Bellatrix as the main pairing can be so popular, while Harry/Draco requests are downvoted to hell? They are both Enemies-to-Lovers ships, but I'm sure we can all agree that only one of the enemy characters there is completely irredeemable, and it's not the desperate teenager.

**** Aside from what [[/u/KimeraGoldEyes]] said I can think of two other reasons. 1. The movies portray Ron as a garbage character, all his good moments are given to others and he's downgraded to comic relief at best which played into a lot of fanon tropes about how awful he/and the Weasleys in general are and 2. I think Harry-Ron are just a really solid platonic friendship, there's rough patches but overall just a really good friendship and there aren't enough positive depictions of friendships imo

Whenever I see a ship I personally disagree with, I just scroll past it. Just because I don't like reading female ships most of the time, that doesn't mean I'm going to downvote someone who asks for Hermione/Luna or Ginny/Luna. That'd be pretty freaking hypocritical considering most everything I read tends to involve male ships, as well.
