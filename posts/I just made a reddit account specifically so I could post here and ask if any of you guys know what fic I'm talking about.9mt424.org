If you help me find this specific fic you will win my undying gratitude.

It was an dimension travel fic. Neville was the boy who lived, and he did everything canon harry did in his misadventures. Other Neville was even bffs with Ron and Hermione, and I think Frank even replaced James in the marauders. The only thing Neville didnt get was the invisibility cloak and the Dursleys. Lily and James were tortured to insanity instead of Frank and Alice, which meant Harry still ended up with the Dursleys with the added bonus of also getting all of the self esteem issues canon Neville had early on. (Eg. Being portrayed as cowardly, magically weak, kinda stupid, ect.)

As for plot, I remember that AU Harry was killed in a fire at St Mungos while visiting his parents. Everyone in the room at the time (Lily, James, and some rando Auror) were also killed. I think Mcgonagall was waiting for AU Harry outside the room at the time too?

Anyway, so a couple months pass after the fire and everyone in this alternate dimension thinks Harry is dead, (which he is) but then canon Harry accidentally travels to this dimension. I dont remember who finds him, but he eventually gets recognized and everyone just assumes hes AU Harry somehow. Canon Harry doesnt correct them and just kind of rolls with it bc hes not exactly sure what happened I think? I think I also remember him being kind of mad that nobody had known the other Harry well enough to notice he was an imposter.

Other details I remember: I remember the timeline in the Alternate dimension was a couple years behind the canon universe. The alternate universe was definitely post triwizard tournament, I think it started in 5th year because Umbridge was definitely there, but it could have been after that and Umbridge just stayed at Hogwarts longer than in canon. Canon Harry was older than that, I think post-final battle but I'm not sure.

Basically the fic was Harry trying to solve the murder of his alternate self, find ways to stop Voldemort/prevent the others from making his mistakes, and do all this while not drawing any unnecessary attention to himself.

If I remember something else I'll put it in the replies or something I guess. Sorry this is so long, it was just such a good fic. I've read a lot of fanfiction, but this is one of those fics that I will literally remember for years. It haunts me. Please help me find it so I can let it haunt other people too. If anyone can help me find it I will love you forever and like try to return the favor sometime.

*** Oh its absolutely possible. I usually find a trope I like and then consume as much of that trope as I can get my grubby little hands on.

There are two scenes I remember perfectly. The first one is when Harry breaks into St. Mungos to look at security footage/memories/ records of the day AU Harry died, and it was like a bomb hidden in a plant or something. Basically, Harry realizes the fire was set to kill the Auror in the room so he couldnt ID a deatheater or something. AU Lily, James and Harry were just collateral damage.

The second scene I remember is the one where Neville Hermione and Ron decide not to invite Harry into the DA. (As described above) I remember that one very clearly because it was really funny to me. It like a college student getting left out of a middle school study circle, and yet he was so affronted. Like "how DARE they not let me in!!! I'm supposed to be defenseless!!! If anybody needs the DA its me!!! " eventually he admits that it would be harder to keep his cover in the DA, but the hilarity of his initial reaction really stuck with me.

That title seems familiar, I'll go take a look. If it isnt this fic, its probably a fic I've read before, and likely a good one if I still recognize the title.

** I think you've mixed up two fics. The scene you've described where the 'original' Harry and his parents die in a fire in the long-term ward of St Mungos, after a bomb is planted, is from A Stranger in the Promised Land by serpant-sorcerer (AKA Jono) linkffn(3592984) It's the sequel to A Stranger in an Unholy Land. Neville isn't the boy who lived though, Katie Bell is the girl-who lived. Everything else is exactly as you've described; Harry's parents were tortured to insanity, Harry grew up isolated like cannon Neville, the fire that kills all three and the rest of the ward was orchestrated via a bomb, which Harry discovers by stealing and reviewing the security tapes, McGonagall was outside the ward and meant to be supervising his visit. New Harry takes over the old Harry's life and keeps his identity a secret, Katie is living his original life with Ron and Hermione (plus Neville), and they don't trust him to be included in the RA (AU title for DA).

There were only four chapters ever posted to ff, but some more were posted on the yahoo group for the story and can be reached [[https://strangerinland.weebly.com/a-stranger-in-the-promised-land.html][here]].

***** Maybe? I thought he was in gryffindor bc I remember the au golden trio not trusting Harry enough to invite him into the DA. Like they thought he would crack under pressure from umbridge or something. But they felt bad about it tho, bc obviously Harry was so defenseless and helpless, so they start tutoring him separately from the DA. Which is hilarious on multiple levels, like Harry knew exactly what they were talking about when he interrupted bc he remembers having the exact same conversation, so when they dont invite him and change the subject hes like personally offended. And on top of that hes like already defeated Voldemort at this point. Hes better than all of them, and yet there he is, in a spare classroom with the AU golden trio, pretending to be a dumbass while they "teach" him Expelliarmus.

******** Hi, just wanted to let you know that the story you are after is definitely a stranger in the promised land, I've just reread what there is of it.

It has useless Harry being replaced by a Harry that had already defeated a Voldemort(in the previous story).

He isn't invited to the DA.

Katie is the Girl Who Lived.

The useless Harry and his parents are killed by a bomb in St Mungo's.

Harry breaks into St Mungo's to watch the security footage.

It has Lockhart hiding behind a potted plant in the security footage as a disguise to escape just before the bomb is planted.

And the actual target wasn't the Potters, but a healer that was in there.

Some helpful questions that could narrow the search:

Is the fic completed or no? Any guess on that front? That helps cut out some of the extras.

About how long ago did you read it?

Is it likely on fanfiction.net or is it on one of the other smaller forums?

Lastly, if there's a love interest aspect, that I can search by.

Honestly idk when I read it. It definitely was longer than 2 years ago, so anything written since then is out. 2011-2016 was my peak fanfic reading years, but it could have been older than that.

I'm almost positive it's on fanfiction.net. I knew of mugglenet, but I pretty much used ff.net exclusively until ao3.

I dont remember any ships. In fact I'm pretty certain it wouldn't fall under any sort of romance genre.

Today I also remembered that the auror that also died in st. Mungos had his face wrapped in gauze or something (I think). Also I'm fairly certain Harry was in remedial DADA (again, I think, that might have come from a different fic.)

Also I'm almost positive the plant that exploded was devils snare. It had moving tentacles and it was a plant mentioned specifically in the books, just not for blowing up obviously lol.

*** That's definitely possible. I'm absolutely certain about Harry, James, and Lily dying together in the fire at St. Mungos via bomb hidden in the potted plant. I'm certain Neville was the BWL and was friends was with Ron and Hermione instead of Harry. I'm also certain about that the AU golden trio thought Harry would would crack under pressure and so they didn't invite him into the DA.

** The St Mungos stuff, is definitely in Stranger in an Unholy Land (maybe it's in other stories too).

This description reminded me of a story where Harry travels to a dimension where Lucius attempted to/succeeded in killing alt-Harry but then canon Harry miraculously appears and has to figure out why Lucius is trying to kill him (maybe with the help of Draco?). I think that alt-Harry is dating Hermione and Harry's brother/Neville is the BWL. That's the only other story I can think of where Harry is trying to solve alt-Harry's murder

If someone could help me find that story, that would be swell.

EDIT: nm, it's Free Will and Fate by Sara Winters. He didn't dimension travel, he went back in time and changed things, then went forward again. `And it was Snape trying to kill him. The Harry's brother/Neville stuff isn't there though.

Is there any way for us to go through your fic history? Like do you mean your search history (in which case we cant really help) or like favorited fics or fic history on ao3? (Which we could totally go through for you)

***** Lmao I would, except in middle school/ early high school I read a lot of fanfic through proxies to get around school firewalls reading through proxies. So theres a good chance I wasnt even logged in when I read it.

I should have more time this weekend, I'll go through my fic history then. Maybe we'll get lucky and i just missed it before.

I wish we could some how run our fic histories against each other and find the similarities.
