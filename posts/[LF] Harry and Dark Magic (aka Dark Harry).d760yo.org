Looking for fics where Harry is adept at, and uses Dark Magic extensively. He either finds it more efficient, is better at it, or gets 'addicted' to Dark Magic. Rituals and Necromancy, and exploring other obscure arts are good too. Nothing too over the top where he suddenly earns 1000 lordships and special powers overnight, but something more like gradually building his knowledge and delving into the Dark Arts.

I'd prefer it to be a Gen fic, although pairings are fine so long as they aren't the focus of the fic. (And if they are it best not be Harmony or any kind of Harem fics preferably. Slash is fine too. But in general nothing with a huge age gap with teen Harry and an adult character because I find some of those quite difficult to stomach sometimes)


** I'd recommend Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy by wickedlfairy17[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/3/Jaded-Eyes-of-a-Prodigy][Jaded Eyes if a Prodigy]]

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** I see this recommended all the time, and the plot just seems absolutely retarded to me... Maybe the summary doesn't do it justice. I don't know.

** Harry is not necessary dark but the tone of the story is certainly darker and Harry does delve into darker magic and uses it.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
