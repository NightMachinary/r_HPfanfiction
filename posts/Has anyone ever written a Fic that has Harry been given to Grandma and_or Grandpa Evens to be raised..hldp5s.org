I am trying to find or prompt a fic where either or both of Lily's parents are still alive when she and James are killed and Harry is sent to live with them. It could be he has a good childhood with them and that changes all of the books. Or a He lives with them for a bit then either they die or the Dursley's put them in a nursing home or both. Then Harry ends up with the Dursleys and his life is worse then cannon because he is old enough to remember what a good home is like.

** I am having such trouble finding this one for some reason, but I read one in the past couple months where dumbledore still drops him on the dursley doorstep, but Petunia takes him to her parents to raise him. She stays involved in his life and Harry actually likes her and Dudley. Remus Lupin is involved later too. It was pretty good - I'll let you know if I end up finding it
