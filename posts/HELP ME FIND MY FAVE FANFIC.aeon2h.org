Hi, So I've been part of the hp fandom since I was like 2 and when I was 12/13 (6-7 years ago) I read the most AMAZING fanfic on wattpad. It had like 49 parts and they were all really long. In it Harry learnt how to do wandless magic and became even more powerful; eventually being able to turn himself into a dragon at will. He became a teacher at Hogwarts and he like kinda adopted one of his first year students cos she reminded him of himself or something like that. It covered until the birth of Lily Luna.

I LOVED that story soooooo much and now I honestly can't find it anywhere, can anyone help?

I'm just getting over a major period of depression and anxiety which meant I stopped reading, writing and basically doing anything I enjoyed and now I can barely remember things that happened before the depression started like 2-3 years ago.

The only good thing that came out of it is since I barely remember anything I can re-read all my old faves and it's like new but I just remember this one sooooo well and I wanna read it again, so if anyone has any clue what I'm talking about then please help. üòÅ


** Can you remember anything about the description? Any more specific OC names like Lily Luna?

*** I remember that Harry walked with a cane and has to be in the hospital wing after the war, he was then put on bed rest at the burrow when Ginny fell off her broom and he used wandless magic to stop her fall. I remember nothing from the description or specific oc names but I think that the girl Harry like basically looked after had black hair and purple eyes and her name has completely escaped my memory. ‚òπÔ∏è
