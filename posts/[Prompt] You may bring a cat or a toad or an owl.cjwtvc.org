** Is “cat” actually limited to just domestic cats? I don't think the rules specify.

** A cat.

How vague, he thought while his fingers ran over the dried words of the letter.

He knew it probably meant a domestic house cat. One that would curl up underneath the rays of sun filtering in through the window panes. One that would purr in content after scratching their chin and patting the top of their head.

Living with the Dursley's had taught Harry how to get he want while staying within the rules. He quickly learned how to find loopholes and exploit them.

He usually got in trouble but it was fun nonetheless.

So now, with a folded up parchment in his back pocket and the knowledge of several beasts keeping books in his head, he was standing in front of the entrance to the Zoo. With a wicked smirk, he made his way past the lions. He glanced at the Cheetahs, a possible option. The Lynx's had caught his attention but he kept moving forward. He wanted to make an informed decision.

The panther's nearly had him stopping to start casting spells. How they stalked along the tree limbs had him entranced. But he did move his eyes from the enclosure and moved to the next one.

He was happy he did so.

There was an Ocelot sitting lazily on a rock blinking up at the sun. It's tail swished mindlessly behind him. Harry wasn't sure what it was, but there was a pull to this male Ocelot. With his newly acquired wand, one that yet to have the Trace on it, he started the familiar bond spell. Once it settled between their two minds, the large cat looked up at him a /murred/ at him. He sent images of nightfall and his return before he made his way out of the Zoo.

Breaking into a Zoo at night is easy when you have spells.

The bond that had been created by the spell helped keep the familiar tame. Easily understand the authority the boy had over him, it took to protecting him. Staying by his side and keeping his family at a very far distance. His last month is his relative's residence was very easy to maneuver.

He had enjoyment when boarding the train.

Many people his age had screamed and darted away from him. Parents had pulled their wands and aimed it to the oversized cat. Other's just stared at it from a distance.

The only one who braved coming into his compartment was a shaky bushy hair girl who told him that that was not an approved animal.

He smirked, "They said I could bring a cat. This is a cat." He could see the argument in her eyes but when the Ocelot, Pan, raised it's head and narrowed its eyes at her she quickly slammed the door shut and ran down the train.

A blonde boy with gray eyes joined in his boat watching the cat the entire time.

"I'm Harry Potter," Harry introduced after getting out the boat, "and this is my cat, Pan."

"Draco Malfoy," He responded nervously.

Harry wasn't surprised that he was sorted into Slytherin. Nor was he surprised when the House heads called him to the Headmaster's office.

"That is not an approved animal!" Minerva stern told the boy.

"The list said I can have a cat. This is a cat."

"That's not what it meant!"

"Ah, but how was I supposed to know? A cat is a very vague term. If you wanted me to bring a domestic house cat, that should have been stated." He patted Pan on the top of his head, "Plus I can't get rid of him now. He's my familiar."

To the staff's displeasure, there was an Ocelot in the castle for the next seven years. Harry did notice the letter's the next year had stricter wording.
