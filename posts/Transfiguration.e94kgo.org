What is transfiguration? I'm not talking g about changing one thing to another.

What are some things people misconceive about it?

What's fanon and what's canon?

What are some important things to remember?

What do you like to see, and what are your favorite examples in fanfiction.


** Transfiguration is the branch of magic concerned with altering a thing's physical composition and structure - what JK Rowling refers to as an object's “fundamental nature”:

#+begin_quote
  “Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

  Spell: The generic term for a piece of magic.

  Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.” (JK Rowling's Old Website: Spell Definitions)
#+end_quote

Although JK Rowling phrases this as the difference between “Charms” and “Spells”, from the example of “turning a teacup into a rat” she's clearly talking about Transfiguration. A Charm, unlike a Transfiguration, is stated to “not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject”, which means that the reverse holds: Transfiguration does fundamentally alter the properties of the subject.

JK Rowling has been consistent on this. As early as 1998 she stated:

#+begin_quote
  “With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.” (The Herald, 7 December 1998)
#+end_quote

The change that Transfiguration makes is a permanent one. We know this from two sources. The first is the pig's tail that Hagrid gave Dudley, which did not go away on its own and had to be surgically removed:

#+begin_quote
  Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. (GoF Chapter 4)
#+end_quote

The second is from the legend of Quintapeds in the companion book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them:

#+begin_quote
  In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and Transfigured each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five-legged creature. [...] The Quintapeds cannot talk and have strenuously resisted every attempt by the Department for the Regulation and Control of magical Creatures to capture a specimen and try to untransfigure it... (Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Quintaped)
#+end_quote

Now, no one knows if the legend of the Quintapeds' origin is true or not. But the key part is that wizards, including the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, consider the story credible enough that they have attempted Untransfiguration. That means that the story -- including the permanence of the Transfiguration performed -- is within the realm of Transfiguration possibility.

So Transfiguration is not some kind of tactile illusion. It is not that the original object lurks “beneath” a layer of Transfiguration magic. Rather, the object is fundamentally, physically changed into a different object.

The permanence of Transfiguration also makes sense. Since Transfiguration is a physical change, there's no reason for the object to revert to its previous state. Physical objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects in the absence of magic. You would need some new magical intervention to make a further change.

Transfiguration can be reversed with Untransfiguration:

#+begin_quote
  “I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level.” (OotP Chapter 29)
#+end_quote

But the possibility of Untransfiguration does not mean that the original object is still there, “underneath”. What then is Untransfiguration, if it is not /removing/ a transfiguration to reveal the object beneath? It is likely the /reversal/ rather than /removal/ of a transfiguration.

How does this reversal take place? One clue is from Dumbledore, who tells us that magic always leaves traces:

#+begin_quote
  “How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment.

  “Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.” (HBP Chapter 26)
#+end_quote

So even though nothing physical remains of the previous object, there will be a magical trace of what the object used to be.

*** I agree that transfigurations are permanent but do they retain their sense of self? So if you change a match into a needle do you need spell that changes a needle into a match or would it just require a general dispel?

**** McGonagall could un-transfigure Malfoy without specifically knowing it is him.

***** Which means that it's only permanent as in the magic doesn't run out after some time, although it's probably possible for a skilled wizard to enchant something to untransfigure itself after a specific time or on a specific trigger event.

** Transfiguration gets more difficult the larger the target is, with dragon sized targets being pretty much the maximum an expert like McGonagall could maybe manage to transfigure.

Transfiguration can bypass a creatures innate magic resistance.

Its easier to transfigure things into things that are more similar to itself, this similarities could be basically anything, from having a similar size or shape to having similar names.

+It seems easier to to turn large things into smaller things than the other way around.+

It also seems that its easier to turn animals into object than the other way around.

Vanishing and conjuration are also part of transfiguration magic(though there are charms that can do similar things).

edit: a mistake.

*** Some of those seem to fanon, no?

I can't think of canon examples for 1, 2, 4, 5.

3 and 6 seem to be supported by the books (First lessons in TF, and in HBP they explicitly learn vanishing. However, iirc, conjuring water ("Aguamenti") seems to be a charm?)

**** 1 and 2 are based on Hermiones suggestion of Transfiguration for the first task of the Triwizard Torunament.

#+begin_quote
  "Well, there are Switching Spells. . . but what's the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous.. . . *The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide. . . . I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . .* unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . ."

4 is based on me misreading a line, so thanks for correction,

5 is based on when we see them learning transfiguration certain things in class.

For example they learn to turning animals into objects during second year where they turn beetles into buttons, but they only start turning objects into animals in third year when they turn teapots into tortoises.

And yes Aguamenti is a charm, its one of the charms that does something similar to conjuration, but Mcgonagall mentions that conjuration is part of transfiguration and is the opposite of Vanishing, but that they wont learn it until their NEWT years(likely seventh year, since sixth year seems to be about human transfiguration).

**** Could be that it's a charm that performs a specific transfiguration over and over again.

  aguamenti() {
       while(not finite) {

Best example of this I've found is the arithmancer series /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]]).
