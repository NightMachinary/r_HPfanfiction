We've had pet peeves threads ad infinitum, but 97% of the time, they're just re-hashed re-bashes of the same old storytelling tropes. Friendly goblins, magical cores, Evil Dumbles, Prongslet, apartment trunks, Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived, Durzkaban, etc.

But what about storytelling structure, or the actual writing in a fanfic? Do you notice the prose, not just the plot? Is there stuff that sticks out to you, that can make or break a story outside of basic spelling, grammar, and punctuation?

Here are some writing features I noticed about the fics I've read and dropped over the years:

- Same-y sentence structure. Every sentence has the same rhythm with little variation in pacing, usually a shopping list of actions following the "X did this action and said that" format. Someone pointed this out as a "Now you can't unsee it" quality in Robst fics, and Merlin's beard, they were right. The more engrossing fics vary sentence lengths and have a good balance between dialogue, actions, descriptions, and thinking.

Example of no variation sentence structure:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "Harry looked at the dog. It had thick black fur. He had never seen a dog that big before. The dog looked at him and barked. Harry was so surprised that he tripped on the kerb."
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

- Epithets. When the writing goes out of its way to avoid using characters' names. Instead, you get an elaborate description of a character's looks and stat sheet. I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d7sagj/harry_potter_and_the_unintentional_epithet/][cautionary tale on the danger of epithets.]]

#+begin_quote
  Example:

  #+begin_quote
    "The green-orbed Firebolt-owner divested the blonde Nimbus 2001-owner of his shirt. The younger wizard's emerald gaze smouldered, slender digits carding through the tall pureblood's silvery platinum tresses."
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

- Author verbal tics, where they fall into a habit of using the same phrases or expressions over and over, and you can make a drinking game out of how many times you see a phrase appear. If a character in the books says a phrase once, it's taken by fanfiction and run into the ground.\\

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "His heart skipped a beat", "She tugged her braid and smoothed her skirts", "She folded her arms beneath her breasts", "As luck would have it", "In a split second", "In a world of trouble".

    "M'boy", "Dunderhead", "Brother mine", "Brightest witch of her age".
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

- Too many rotating perspectives. In a story about Harry Potter, every single minor side character gets a plotline, a life story, and a dream to be accepted in a famous Parisian hairdressing school. Every time Harry does something, you get a dozen reaction shots. The story ends up with a 500k word Year 1.

- Tiny chapters. See a fic that's 300k words. I'm interested. Chapter total: "500". Nope. I am aware that some authors do writing challenges and push themselves to upload ~1k chapters every day, and this is normal in the Asian novel world, but I can't get into tiny chapters because their format creates pacing issues in the form of a cliffhanger -> resolution -> new cliffhanger cycle.


** And some dialogue-specific writing features that bug me out.

- Same-y dialogue, identical voices. Without the "said John Doe" dialogue tag, there is no way to distinguish one character from another. Somewhat synonymous with the "Fanon Draco" voice, which I have never seen as frequently as I have in fanfiction. Typical characteristics: smirky and dry sarcasm, constant raising of a single eyebrow (and EVERYONE does that, not just one person), Hollywood-style quippy dialogue with pop-culture references, like Marvel bander or Chandler from "Friends".

- Low-effort dialogue. No attempt to make the character's dialogue match up with their personality, age, time period, or setting.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "I didn't mean to yeet our sister!" said Albus, wringing his hands in agitation.

    Aberforth lifted an eyebrow. "Cool story, bro."
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

- This slips into Americanisms in dialogue.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Fred dropped a stack of brightly-colored boxes into Harry's arms. "We won't charge you a dime."

    Ron held up a pygmy puff. "What about me? I'm your brother!"

    Fred smirked and lifted an eyebrow. "That'll be twenty bucks, thanks."

    Ron scowled and tossed the pygmy puff back into the pile. "I'm telling mom!"
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

- Accents. Sometimes it's Hagrid, sometimes it's Fleur or Viktor. If you're unlucky, you get a character written with an accent when they never had one in canon (McGonagall, Cho). If you're super-duper-unlucky, you get an author who thinks a unique accent counts as a personality trait.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "Well, you're back t' th'silk,” she says innocently. “Mayhap th' tykes need a reminder tha' they didn' hallucinate anythin' yesterday.”

    “But Harry tol' me it's th' house o' th' Brothers, not jus' that Ignotus fellow. Stuck w'another house, Sev.”

*** The dialogue and character voice is such a big one for me. I will generally quit reading if I dislike the way the characters sound especially the adults. I often decide if Snape focused fics are worth reading almost entirely on his first few lines of dialogue and internal thoughts. If Snape talks and thinks like a generic teenager and has zero of his sarcasm and snippy mocking dialogue then I know that I may as well be reading about John Doe OC than a complex morally grey character. Same goes for Dumbledore and other adults as I expect them to sound different and more mature than teenagers.

There is just so much fanfiction out there that I have gotten more and more picky about what I read. Most my decisions on what to read come down to how much I enjoy the writing style, the prose and the dialogue. A good writer can take the most ridiculous stupid plot line and make an amazing story out of it so the plot doesn't even matter too much in the end. An amazing plot and story premise only goes so far if the writing is mediocre and bland.

Those aren't so much Americanisms as Mugglisms. It wouldn't be any better with "pence" for "dime" and "quid" for "bucks", methinks. In any case they are cases of the author being factually wrong about the world, not anything to do with the writing itself. Americanisms in dialogue do happen and they are annoying if too egregious, but this isn't really an example of that so much as it is of people forgetting that /Harry Potter/ takes place in 1990's England and Scotland in a parallel society that is itself pretty different from what Muggle British society & culture were like in the 1990's, let alone the Muggle American one.

But what I'm saying is that the mistakes are /functionally/ the same --- the author is using the money of their culture, overlooking that the Wizarding World is a different society --- and while the American variation is an "Americanism" in the sense of being a consequence of the author being American, it's not a matter of language.

****** To answer your speed edit - the kind of Americanisms in fanfiction that you're talking about, which aren't interchangeable vocabulary words, aren't things that appear often in /dialogue./ Most of them are narrative tropes, not part of writing structure. And Americanisms in tropes is a whole different thread.

Examples would be: Varsity sports teams and players, American holiday traditions, extreme tuition and medical debts, universal gun ownership, the Miranda warning "anything you say will be held against you" when arrested, and aspects of Civil vs. Common Law.

******* I will note that not all of that is a huge issue - for instance, "extreme tuition" is quite present in Britain, as from what I can tell boarding schools can /easily/ reach into the thousands of pounds a term - the average seems to be at ~£10,000 a term. It's not a stretch from canon that Hogwarts would normally be expensive - I know that JKR has stated since that it's free, but in terms of book canon there's no real indication either way.

Medical debts are also another thing that's not guaranteed to not be there in the WW - after all, part of what makes the Wolfbane Potion so hard to get (in addition to difficulty to brew) is that it's very expensive - and would seemingly be covered by a wizarding NHS, if it existed. We also can deduce that the Ministry doesn't cover all health costs - for instance, IIRC Lucius Malfoy gets his way to the great seats in the World Cup by making a big donation to St. Mungo's. So it's possible that they get donations and support from the ministry to cover all health costs, but it's not at all guaranteed - particularly since the NHS only was established in 1948, not a long time for Wizards.

The other examples work well, though I suppose there is a case to be made to treating universal ownerships of wands in the WW as analogous to universal gun ownership.

Also, for things like holiday traditions, the Miranda warning and law, I don't think the Wizarding World should be very much like Muggle Britain anyway, so I have no strong objections to authors basing themselves on what they know rather than British customs specifically.

** I certainly notice the writing - usually not on purpose/deliberately (ie, analyzing it) but in the feel it gives off. Frankly, it's the reason I drop most fics - the writing quality being poor enough to not draw my interest.

Your example of the same-y sentence structure is a good one - I'd also add that a lot of short sentences do the same feel to me.

Dialogue is a tough one, because it's very difficult to write good one I find - but yeah, if the words they use stand out too much, it's kinda ridiculous. American-isms isn't necessarily a problem for me (depends on which ones they are, and how much they have in it) - but other aspects can easily make me shake my head at poor writing.

I personally find it hard to overlook bad writing to enjoy a work - probably more so than any tired trope, honestly.

*** Short sentences and one-sentence paragraphs can work, if they're infrequent. It can be a useful way to add tension and movement in action sequences, as long as the rest of the story has varied sentence/paragraph lengths. It makes the kicker moment hid harder when the sentence is short and abrupt.

Example from the books:

#+begin_quote
  A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob. It would not turn.

  He was shut in.
#+end_quote

If it was written in one paragraph, with no variation in sentences, you wouldn't get the same effect.

#+begin_quote
  A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Harry was terrified of being interrogated. He strode across the room and seized the doorknob. It would not turn. He was shut in.
#+end_quote

...And that's the difference between Robst and JKR, lol.

I think dialogue is one of those things that, when it's good, it blends in seamlessly with the characterization and story. You don't really notice it, because you're fully immersed in the story and characters. But when it's bad, it stands out and ruins the story and turns the characters into tropey caricatures. Kind of like a getting into a car or elevator. When it's working well, it's a smooth ride and you forget about it and get where you're going. When it's broken, it ruins your day.

I just flipped to a random chapter in "Harry Crow", and the blandness effect comes from every sentence of every paragraph having an identical structure with minimal variation. Character name's or pronoun, the action they take, result of the action.

#+begin_quote
  Bill had fired three hexes at Harry in quick succession, all at different body parts. Harry had deflected the first one at Malfoy again, dodged the second but the third one connected with his thigh. Harry though didn't cry out, merely bowed in acknowledgement to his teacher's skill.
#+end_quote

Outside of the dialogue, the rest of the prose is a running commentary on what's happening and what everyone's doing, with very little prose spent on developing character through contemplation and thought, like the Harry written by JKR. The Harry in the books /thinks/ about what's happening around him, not just acting and reacting like Robst's Harry. JKR's Harry gets angsty at times (OotP), but it also makes him feel like a human and not a robot.

#+begin_quote
  He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione's shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.

Constant short sentences and run on sentences are the only ones I know straight away that that's what's bugging me. I can overlook bad spelling and grammer pretty easily, my mind kinda corrects it as I'm reading so I don't always notice it unless it's something glaringly obvious to me. But I've definitely given up on something if the style bugs me in some way, usually only shorter or one shot fics, but sometimes longer ones as well, I usually give those a few chapters to improve first if I like the story itself.

It makes the author look bad but chances are it was a simple mistake missed by editors and publishers. Fanfiction on the other hand is more of a hobby. It's done for fun and to improve your own writing. There shouldn't be an expectation for things like spelling and grammar to be perfect in fanfiction in my opinion. Not everyone is going to have someone to check over their work and even if they do the chances of something being missed are still pretty big.

** Completely agree with everything said. I would also add some i noticed

- repetitiveness - quite often it isn't even some common trope itself I have problem with, but how much some authors are milking it. You can bet if you see 'Mione mentioned once, it will be from there on referred as such by every character including narrator. Another example would be that stupid Weasley twins-speak. I could handle it once (with an eye-roll), but their dialogue is always the same for the rest of the fic

- some authors are really bad at understanding how fast can time pass in different situations. In some you will have explicitly mentioned something happening hour from now, then after 10 lines of dialogue, it is there. On the other hand when some fast-paced, "intense" moment happening, author just randomly throws several minutes into it - like character making some "shocking" revelation and the whole rooms is frozen is astounded into silence for five minutes. Or they will have just casual dialogue in the middle of the fighting. It is not that big of a detail, but always throws me off focus.

** Yes. I do notice the prose. Part of that is because I do my own writing and am more drawn to the editing part of writing, so it is sometimes hard to take off the 'editing' hat while reading stories that don't engross me. If a story engrosses me, then I will forgive many a writing sin, however.

- Same-y sentence structure.\\
  This is something that I struggle with myself at times. I have certain ways of joining certain clauses together, and ever since a good friend pointed out that to me a few years ago, I've been very conscious of it. It honestly takes me consciously looking at the flow of the prose in my own work in order to improve on this, and I don't always do it well.

- Author verbal tics\\
  I see this all the time and am guilty as sin of it. For example, I have a habit of beginning my sentences with things like, "to be fair" or "well" or something similar. I'm better at this in writing, but some of my tics still leak through. I have a few favorite words for describing things that I have to edit out.\\
  Many authors do this. For example, Timothy Zahn has an unhealthy love of the word 'sardonically.' Rowling likes to modify her quotative verbs with adverbs rather than using another verb as a quotative verb. For example, in OotP in /Dumbledore's Army/ she writes "'Yeah, it was!' said Ron enthusiastically..." rather than saying "'Yeah, it was!' Ron enthused." Taken by itself, either way is acceptable. But sticking to one over the other almost exclusively is a tic. Not to mention Rowling's need to "adverbify" nearly every quotative verb.\\
  On a semi-related note, I have to resist the urge to flip off the author through the screen whenever I hear the word 'dunderhead.' Please, authors, let go of this word!

- Epithets.\\
  Ugh, I am at a constant battle with epithets. I get their use. Really, I do. But I've read so many fics inundated with them that I find it hard to use any of them in my own writing, even where appropriate. Therefore I tend to err on the opposite side of the spectrum, where I almost never use epithets. To avoid excessive use of proper nouns, I have to carefully craft my sentences so that who is being referred to is understood via context.

- Too many rotating perspectives.\\
  I actually don't see this very often. It does get annoying when I do.

- Tiny chapters.\\
  Another thing I very rarely see. More often, I see excessively long chapters.

- Same-y dialogue/identical voices.\\
  This is common and unfortunately won't go away until the author makes a real effort to characterize each person in their head. Voicing a character can take many forms. Regional diction (certain words or phrases unique or semi-unique to the location in which the character grew up), preferred words (one character likes to use the word 'therefore', for example), wittiness (do they pun or are they savvy to the more fun turns of phrase?), optimism/pessimism (do they look for the good or bad in things?), dialogue flow (do they tend to trail their sentences off, or finish sentences in 'eh', or do they only use as many words as necessary?), etc etc etc.

- Accents\\
  I try not to write accents as much as allude to them. I found Fleur's speech to be only tangentially related to how French people sound when they speak English. And unfortunately many fanfic authors have managed to make Fleur's "Phlegmglish" even /worse./ It's far too easy to stereotype here, so I avoid it.

*** There's a weird dichotomy of newbie fanfic writers:

1. Fics that only use "said" and one other dialogue tag. "Sighed" or "drawled" are the most common.

2. Fics that use every other dialogue tag /except/ "said". You get the whole thesaurus thrown at you, with a matching adverb. "Trumpeted uproariously", "thundered heavily", "screamed shrilly," "bellowed vulgarly", and the classic one, "ejaculated loudly".

Then there are scenes like Ron making a suggestion to Neville, in which we get "'Good initiative,' Neville felicitated." I wish that the author (who is fluent in English but not a native speaker) would put down the thesaurus and/or get a beta.

** Great summary. IMO the writing is the most important thing there can be in a fic - i can at least give a try to some fic when the premise is kind of weird or only tangentially interesting if the writing turns out alright, but if it's off i'm not even gonna bother with something that has a great premise/summary.

I don't think short chapters really are that big of an issue (or maybe i just didn't run into them) - more often than not what i see are chapters that are a tad too long and could use some splitting for easier reading. Or culling in genereal, there's far too many overinflated fics.

I think the only thing that ain't bothering me from what you people mention are Americanisms - but i'm not native, so that might be the reason. Your example, as someone already pointed out, isn't really an americanism - more of a muggleism, which really are out of place, especially in that money-related context.

We get to explore the magical world more, the culture ... the summer before Harry's 4th year is a great example of this it's Chapter 12 and page 152 before we actually get to Hogwarts in that book

It can be the best or worst part of a fic especially if you add in a shopping trip.

I think it's a matter of both personal taste and the writing of the author. I enjoy long stories that go into a large amount of detail, but understand people can find it unnecessarily long-winded or taking to long to progress the story. I can also find fics to be the same way, but the long fics I like have more than enough details and progression to keep me reading despite the short timeframe.

Ultimately, a lot of what OP's "actual writing" refers to is what I'd call just technical details. While, yes, on the whole I prefer fics (and stories in general) that are more polished, I try to judge fics by how they deal with thematic, character, and plot development, which is why looking at how a fic deals with storytelling tropes, even well-worn ones, is extremely useful, since they easily lend themselves as litmus tests for how an author deals with themes, characters, and plots.

*** *EDIT:* The poster deleted their comment, but it was an accusation of me complaining about bad writing without giving constructive advice to help.

I did, actually. Most of them are self-evident.

- On sentence structure: "The more engrossing fics vary sentence lengths and have a good balance between dialogue, actions, descriptions, and thinking."

- On epithets: Use characters' names.

- On verbal tics: It's a habit, don't fall into it.

- On too many perspectives: In a story about Harry Potter, focus on Harry Potter.

- On tiny chapters: "their format creates pacing issues in the form of a cliffhanger -> resolution -> new cliffhanger cycle." Pace the stories better, by taking more time to write longer, substantial chapters, or plan the pacing so the chapter break happens at a natural scene transition, and thus avoiding unnecessary cliffhangers.
