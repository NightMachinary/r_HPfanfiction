To clarify, this is meant to happen /before/ the climatic events of /Prisoner of Azkaban./ Basically, what could happen if Lupin approached Hagrid about Pettigrew by himself.


** Remus chuckled nostalgically to himself as he spread the old map across his desk. He traced the familiar lines of Gryffindor Tower, just making sure Harry had gone to bed and wasn't wandering the corridors. It still bothered him that Harry had mentioned Peter. On the map. It wasn't possible.

He scanned the edges of the map, looking both for signs of damage and signs of Black. Instead of the filthy dog, he spotted what Harry had seen. Peter Pettigrew. Now in Hagrid's hut. Remus rolled the map up.

He unrolled it again. Just to be sure. But it was still there. Peter Pettigrew.

Rolling the map up a final time he sent a Patronus (suspiciously dog-shaped) to Professor McGonagall. It was time to confess.

It was nearly dawn when the pair arrived at the hut, two plain-clothed Aurors in tow. McGonagall knocked sharply and insistently until the door was opened.

"'Mornin' Professor," Hagrid said groggily, then corrected, "Professors. What can I do for you this early."

"I understand that you have a rat in your hut," Professor McGonagall told him quietly.

"Oh, yeah. Young Ron's pet. I'm sure he'll be glad to see it's not been eaten after all," Hagrid said grabbing a lidded jar off a shelf next to the door.

"Thank you," McGonagall replied taking the jar and casting an unbreakable charm on it. She turned to the waiting Aurors. "Be ready." She calmly lifted the lid to let Remus see the thankfully still sleeping rodent. At his nod, she closed the lid and charmed it in place.

"That's him. I'd recognize Peter's animagus form anywhere," Remus all but growled.

McGonagall nodded and handed the jar over to the Aurors. "If he escapes before he is questioned-"

"He won't, Professor," the taller of the two said, nervous about cutting her off. But more so about what threat lay at the end of her sentence. "You have my word. I was in NEWTs level charms with both the Potters. They were good people."

The Aurors walked to the edge of the grounds and disapparated. Two weeks later the Daily Prophet declared Sirius innocent. At the end of the school year, Remus and Sirius picked Harry up from King's Cross station and took him to live with them in number twelve Grimwald Place.

*** nice. Just a nitpick: Daily Prophet cannot declare anybody innocent, they are just a newspaper. Daily Prophet can only report that the appropriate authority (I guess, Wizengamot in this case) found him innocent.

**** Yeah, should have said announced his innocence. Of course, the way canon portrays it, it's not far off.

***** The daily prophet would announce his innocence the moment they heard he was getting a trial.
