That is set after the gang is out of Hogwarts and begins with Hermione being on her own the muggle world going to college. She starts to sense that she's in danger and leaves to a small town where she is attacked but manages to get away to her hotel room where Harry is waiting for her.

Pretty sure Ron shows up at some point and they witness another magical school being victim to a terror attack. Also another thing I vaguely remember is Hermione being attacked by her college roommate in a club bathroom.


** That sounds like linkffn(War Widow by anthfan)

  After the war the Trio has split. Harry's disappeared and Hermione has turned away from magic as a way to deal with being alone. But now there is another threat to the wizarding world, and the Trio must unite once again.
