Harry gets put into the body of himself in another time (by death itself or other means) where his alternate-self has low confidence, is bullied and looked down upon, while generally being ignored by his siblings and rest of his family members, but when he takes over the people that have done all the stuff to his alternate-self are in for a rude awakening.

its a rather down to the point request but i saw one awhile back that only had 1 chapter and was written in 08 i believe? and the idea caught my interest, harry was a hufflepuff in the fanfic and he ended up killing himself because his sister kept pushing him away and accused him of 'causing a scene' when all he wanted to do was talk to his sister.

so if there are any stories like that out there let me know and ill take a read, or if someone fancies writing this sort of story again go ahead and let me know so i can give it a read, ive gone through a lot of TT fanfics recently and i went through the betrayal stories ALOT (over 400 by this point) and i just need something new to read xD


** Seen something along these lines a month or two ago. Was on Archive of Our Own i believe. I remember he “woke” up in this new life where he had siblings and James, Lily were alive. It went down a plot line I didn't like so I stopped reading it. Can't remember the name sorry.

*** I recognise that, he basically kept waking up between the alternate and his actual timeline (if it's the story I think you're talking about)

**** Now that sounds interesting lol. The one I'm talking about basically became a story about smut if I remember correctly. I quit reading when Harry was putting hormone “potions” in Lily's perfume or some shit like that just to fuck her. Basically a good plot line turned into a story which I assume was filled with silly smut (didn't finish it so might be wrong). But it does line up with what your looking for. If I remember correctly he had no friends and his siblings didn't even have much of a relationship with him. Harry was just ignored. I think he was fat at the beginning as well LOL. He was like a Peter Pettigrew without the Marauders.

  Harry takes advice he shouldn't, to do something he really should have known better than to try. Still, all's well that ends well, right?

** Ok i absolutely love this story even though it will contain TMR/Hp pairing that I am not a fan of. Involves auror!Harry bodyswapping with some bullied Slytherin teen in the 60s and some underlying sinister reasons that is still unfolding.

*** Interesting, I'll give it a read, although I'm not a fan of the pairing that does sound exactly what I'm looking for.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.
