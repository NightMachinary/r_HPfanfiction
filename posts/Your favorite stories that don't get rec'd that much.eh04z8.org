I'd rather NOT have character bashing if possible: But if it's done in a believable way, I'll allow it.

Can be from any ERA

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

**** I don't think so. It is about Dumbledore raising Harry after he checks on him at the Dursleys. But even if it was, why does that matter?

***** Because some people have preferences and that's ok

Also because the top three slash characters are

- Snake Satan

- Embodiment of hatred and resentment

- Literally the worst of the "casual" wizard racists

So I suppose people may wanna pass on those. Don't know why they're so popular, to be perfectly honest, it disturbs me and I'm not het myself.

** They Shook Hands, by Dethryl : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version]].

Best Slytherin Harry fic imo, covers all 7 years of Hogwarts. Though the final one hasnt been started yet, and tbh, I fear it has been abandoned. Fantastic fic all around, only saw it mentioned here once or twice.

*** This was the first Slytherin Harry fic I read, it's really good. (Gets a bit more AU as the years go on but it's well written and kept me occupied for ages!)

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
