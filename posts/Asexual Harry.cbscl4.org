Any fics out there that feature an asexual Harry that literally doesn't care about romance in the slightest?


** Linkffn(In the mind of a scientist)

This Harry has a beautiful naked metamorphmagus in front of him and all he thinks about is performing experimental surgery on her to figure out how the metamorphing works.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

** The Coiners' Paper Trail has an asexual Harry, but it's also slash, specifically Harry/Snape. Linkffn(7042124)

On ao3 you can also filter for fics with an asexual tag.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Asexual+Harry&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling]] (filtered with the tag 'asexual harry')

But it seems you get better results by filtering for more generic tags, ie 'Asexual Character' or 'Asexuality'. Of course, I can't attest to the quality of these fics.

  The Ministry needs to approve Severus Snape's application for him to start his life again after the war. Harry Potter has set himself up with a non-dangerous specialist muggle career. Neither have been particularly good at avoiding trouble for long.

** Growing up and discovering his sexuality is a part of my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter). Harry gets his personality split into five pieces, and three of them just don't care about the physical aspects of relationships at all (with one of them also being aromantic as well). The other two are just concentrated bundles of horny that have no idea what to do with the realization that "girls aren't yucky anymore" --- as he's only thirteen and is currently in the midst of the trainwreck that is puberty.

I have no plans to put him in any relationship, and as he's currently figuring things out, his five heads won't be able to agree on having a relationship with anyone at all for a long time.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay.
