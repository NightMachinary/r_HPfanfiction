Listen we have a lot of creepypasta, urban legends, and SCPs. I want to see what you can come up with by merging the two? Oh two wizards messed around and made Slenderman a reality? Someone creates a chain post that if you don't mail to your friend a ghoul comes and takes you down the sewers. "Professoror Lupin, Ernie says there's something dressed like a plaque doctor in the dungeons, can you deal with that?"

IDK, I feel like there is a lot of potential.

** There's a story, Harry By Proxy on FFN. The story is decent, not the best, but it's alright.
