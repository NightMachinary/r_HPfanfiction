Thinking about having harry explore knockturn alley 2nd or 3rd year and agree to help start basically an outcast revolution based on squibs muggleborns goblins etc he finds . Im wanting potions and eventually alchemy to be a major theme and resource but i need to know what the main outcast squibs are actually capable of magically if anything.?

Do they have any magical capabilities they can see dementors and magical buildings like Hogwarts


** It is possible, but the most realistic answer is probably, no not really. Let me grab my laptop, get off mobile, and I'll expand on what I mean.

Edit: Have laptop.

Even Rowling is vague on the abilities of squibs to perceive and interact meaningfully with the magical world. It is however important to remember that for all of their similarities magic itself sees Squibs and Muggles differently. For evidence of this i point you simply to the fact that Filch is even able to work at hogwarts, when in GoF we are told that muggles would just see ruins and a sign telling them to keep out. You could make the argument that this is a special exception for Filch, however pottermore has more examples of squibs at hogwarts. Rowling even telling a tale of one sneaking in in an attempt to be sorted.

So what does this mean for us and potions?

Well if we look to pottermore ( [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/potions]] ) the answer does not look good.

Rowling says "It is often asked whether a Muggle could create a magic potion, given a Potions book and the right ingredients. The answer, unfortunately, is no. There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup)."

So just looking at that specifically the aspect of wand work being needed, we can see that it would not be possible for a squib to make a potion, as they can not use a wand, as we learn definitively from Filch's failure with KwickSpell in chamber of secrets.

That being said I believe there to be a passable work around for this. We know from apparent differences between muggles and squibs in the canon, that squibs can to a degree interact more meaningfully with those things that are magical than muggles can. So i think you could make a compelling case that if a squib were educated in the art and interactions of potions ingredients, and there was a wizarding overseer around to do the wand waving needed, that a squib could complete a potion with help. A muggle likewise could do the same, if not for the statue of secrecy breaking that would be involved.

So if you want to work it into your story you could have an enterprising muggleborn student who was good at potions, but could not find someone to help him achieve his mastery or whatever, but instead finds a bunch of squibs teaches them to make lots of the basic potions, does the wand waving in his potion warehouse and bada-bing bada-boom muggleborn/squib potion factory.

We know magic works through intent, though. Meaning if the spell casted to keep muggles out was intended to keep muggles out, but not squibs, it won't keep squibs out.\\
The thing is, you don't need magic to discriminate between Muggles and Squibs, you only need Wizards to do the distinction.

**** We don't actually know that magic works though intent. We know that some aspects of magic and spells are influenced by the intent of the caster.

Conversely we do know that magic has laws and underlying universal rules that outline and define its limitations and interactions with the world.

For instance. You want to conjure a chair. There is a spell for that, the intention of the caster may influence the type of chair, or size, etc... but at the end of the day it's still a chair.

You're also not going to get a chair if you cast the levitation charm.

So even so assume intent matters, if you want to keep muggles out, your intent is going to be to keep out people without magic (because that's literally the only difference between muggles and wizards) and since squibs don't have magic, bingo bango squibs would be kept out too.

But that doesn't happen when you cast a muggle repelling ward/spell so there has to be some measurable or meaningful difference between squibs and muggles.

Edit: if you only need wizards to make the distinction with intent in those sorts of spells, why not just cast a ward to keep death eaters out of hogwarts or wherever really? Why not cast a spell that doesn't let people who have murdered someone in cold blood pass through a door, and use that as a way to test guilt?

***** No. Your intent is to keep Muggles out. Intent has to do with language. If you want to keep Muggles out, you're gonna use a spell that keeps Muggles out. Because Muggles are a valid category. Magic knows perfectly well what you would consider a Muggle. I imagine you could use the same spell or a similar one to keep out blue eyes people. In this cas you'll cast a spell to keep out blue eyed people, not people who lack melanin in their eyes. That's because magic doesn't work like physics. It's both very literal and very symbolic, as is obvious from the books. Hell, the spell to levitate something is different from the spell to carry something, which is in turn different from the spell to summon something. All 3 of these spells do basically the same thing. The only difference is in the purpose aka intent of the spell.

Also. There isn't a single insight, that I remember of, in the way conjuring works in canon. So I'd like to hear your rational about that chair thing.

****** I think you just kind of argued against yourself at the end. The only difference in those three spells isn't that the intent is different - it's that the spell is different. To go along with your argument, you should say casting a spell to levitate something but with the intent to summon it to you would summon it to you.

But you didn't. And you can't. Because the spells are different for a reason.

******* That's because you don't understand my point. If magic didn't work through intent, it means every spell has a very definite effect that doesn't rely on intent. Which means the spell to levitate something, the spell to summon something and the spell to carry something will be one and the same. It will be a spell that can move things around. The single fact that summoning, carrying and moving things around are seen as different by magic means that, fundamentally, a spell is the traduction of an intent in an action. It is obvious that the difference between those 3 spells is in the intent they traduce far more than in what they physically do. It is different, for exemple, in the Wheel of Time, where magic is achieved by the 'physical' manipulation of magic, and the effect comes from the way different threads of energy are weaved around each other. Can you see the distinction? The important thing isn't whether or not you can modify your spells through intent, but that the spells themselves are a direct traduction of the intent of the caster.

Not necessarily. If spells don't work on intent, they are essentially machines. You could design one to move a thing away from Earth (but not from side to side), another to hold something to a fixed location relative to you, and a third to move something toward you. These are just limitations on either geometric translation or application of force.

You could even create a conjuration spell with a mind-reading component that could conjure a chair of the type the caster is thinking of. (Similar to how you can build a hands-free web browser with eye tracking and an electroencephalograph.) But that would be an explicit part of the spell, something you specifically added, rather than a general aspect of magic.

It's hard to tell the difference between a world where magic itself responds to intent and one in which nearly every spell includes a mind-reading component. The former requires one of the basic parts of magic to be a certain way; the latter merely requires a bit of technology and a widespread desire for convenience. But I'm reminded of the Douglas Adams quote: /the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks./ Magic responding to intent has that kind of integrity; witches always writing their spells to read their own minds doesn't.

********* Interesting. Thanks for the quote from Adam's, I didn't know it. I like it.

Something else to keep in mind, too, is that a spell which encodes your intent somehow, as a part of magic's operation, or a spell that reads your mind to know what to do basically achieve the same thing (if we put aside flavor or esthetic concerns about how magic should feel) with one difference. It's more complicated, it requires more magic to work. In the first case magic just needs to do is effect, in the latter it still needs this but also to read the caster's mind as well. It's amusing because it reminds me of Ocam's razor (between two hypothesis you should choose the simplest) though it totally doesn't apply in this case.

** Technically, the answer is a straight-out “no”, because Pottermore says that there's wand-work necessary.

That said, the books themself do not do a good job at showing the above to be true: Snape claims that there's “little wand waving”, which could be and up to a certain point is, via lack of proof of the opposite, shown to mean no wand waving at all, and the one time we do see them using their wands there is the implication that this is done to find out what ingredients are needed rather than because it is a necessary action to creating a potion. Madame Rowling has had a lot of time to do /something/ about it, and yet only chose to go clear about it via Pottermore, so I will not blame anyone for choosing to think differently (i.e. that squibs can brew potions) nor will it be something that breaks the story or whatever.

That said, even if one does ignore the Pottermore thing, clearly magic is required to change what would basically be a nonsense soup into a potion. For potions that use clearly magical ingredients it could, at least to a degree (decreased potency?), come from those ingredients as catalysts, but potions the ingredients for which just aren't magically potent enough for their needs would need quite a substantial insertions of the brewer's magic, and those potions squibs just wouldn't be able to brew, not on their own.

The squibs' ability to see magical buildings and dementors and stuff most likely comes from the fact that having magic changes how one's senses develop, and until a certain time after their birth, time that may even be years after that points, squibs do have some magic, the left-over magic of their parents, so though they are on the level of muggles when it comes to the ability to have magic there are still changes in their development stemming from having magical parents. The fact that the changed (wizardly/witchy/whatever) development does not complete but instead stops at some point when the squib's parents' magic evaporates from them fully may be the reason why Figg could not see the dementors fully but only vaguely.

** In my headcanon they're complete muggles who just happen to be born of wizards. Anything a muggle can't do, a squib can't either. Ms. Figg was lying about the dementors to help Harry out (her description was very shaky and she was anxious and unsure about it) and Filch would need someone to bring him inside Hogwarts before he could see it.

But I forget if Pottermore actually wrote anything that contradicts that.

Edit: or Filch could just know that despite the fact that he sees a pile of ruins and a sign telling him to keep out, he just needs to push past that and keep walking until he's inside, then those "ruins" become Hogwarts to his sight. He might not need a wizard to bring him in. Or he might have an amulet or other spell on him to let him see Hogwarts.

** For stories I write, my default is that squibs can interact with magic items in a variety of ways. There will be some potions they can't brew on their own due to required spellwork, but they can do at least two thirds of the curriculum up to OWL level. (And almost nothing after that due to the requirement to incorporate spells.)

In theory, you could have a potions manufactory in which the majority of the work is done by squibs, with a handful of full mages to do the necessary wand-work.

If I'm going to go into more depth about the process, I'd have it so you can use enchanting to get around the spell requirements, and you can use slow and resource-intensive means to enchant things as a squib. So if there were an island with a curse on it that ensured everyone would be a squib, you'd get a more industrialized and less personally effective magical society.

Other people write it differently, and that's fine. Saying that squibs are basically muggles from magical families simplifies the world, which makes it easier not to write yourself into something silly.
