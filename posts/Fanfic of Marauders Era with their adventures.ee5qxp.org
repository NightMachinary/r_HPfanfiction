Just like the title says I want to see some happy, funny, crazy Marauder's going about the school. Longer fics prefered but any will do and if they also go on to include the Lily/James romance I'd be incredibly grateful.

If the fic does go on to seventh year then must be cannon pairing of James with Lily pleas. Anything else I don't really mind happening differently as long as they end up together.

Thanks so much, happy holidays!

*** Thanks I'll be looking forward to reading this, and I was trying to see is this fic complete by chance and James/Lily. I couldn't quite see it labeled or stated anywhere by the author

**** It's only gone through the middle of their third year so far but will inevitably be lily/james since the author wants it to be canon. It's on hiatus right now but, as someone who's been following it since the first few chapters, she does always come back to it after the long hiatuses.

*** Definitely, I'm okay with any pairing as long as James and Lily are together(if the story goes on that long or is set during seventh year). I'd be glad to read your Sirius/Remus recommendation!

**** This fic, Hopeless, has the marauders sound like actual teenagers. Very natural dialogue. It's set before 7th year & is short- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2430569]]

All The Young Dudes is one of the longest fics I've ever read (188 chapters). It's Remus-centric and has really good writing. It won Marauder medals for its protrayal of James & Remus. I basically regard it as canon- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

Have some others but I'd have to dig them up.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
