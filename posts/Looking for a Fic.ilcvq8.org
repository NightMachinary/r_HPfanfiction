Iâ€˜m looking for a fanfic but can't remember the title or the author. :( I just remember that hermione and snape were talking in his living space (might've been a marriage law fic but idk) and he tells her that Harry's grandparents weren't happy with the marriage of James and Lily. (they were prejudiced I think?)

And I just remember that I really liked the concept of that, because James parents are always written so accepting of muggles and muggleborns.

So, if anyone knows which one I mean I would be eternally grateful haha
