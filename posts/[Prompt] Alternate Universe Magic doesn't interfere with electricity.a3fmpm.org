I'd love to see what smart muggleborns like Hermione could do with computers and magic combined.


** Magic doesn't interfere with electricity in canon. Also, see [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/technology][this]]

Hogwarts interferes with radio signals. Yet somehow, they are still able to get the Wizarding Wireless to pipe music and talk shows in to their receivers in the common rooms.

*** The Wizarding Wireless is using devices enchanted to act like radio, I don't think it's using actual radio waves.

**** Not that I would take the wikia as authoritative in any way, but what is shown in that scene is Harry's surge of /accidental/ magic having an effect on the local power grid. Magic in and of itself doesn't disrupt electrical signals in the Potterverse. Other universes like Dresden Files include magic having a disruptive effect on electronics. So does the work of alien technology in movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The fact that Diagon Alley, St. Mungos Hospital, and the Ministry for Magic exist hidden in downtown London is indication that the presence of magic in these places isn't disruptive. Not enough to threaten the Statute of Secrecy, in any case.

***** of course you're ignoring the fact that it cites the source.

specifically goblet of fire chapter 28

Hermione: "All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air. No, Rita's using magic to eavesdrop, she must be... If I could just find out what it is...ooh, if it's illegal, I'll have her..."

Hogwarts =/= magic.

In GoF Arthur uses magic to repair an electronic item (the Dursleys' electric fireplace). Magic doesn't break electricity, /Hogwarts/ does.

******* Literally the next line is that the excess of magic is what breaks electronic devices.

I always figured the issue was that ambient magic makes the laws of physics more malleable, so you get power surges and dropouts in electrical circuits. This isn't a problem when fixing things, because after the item is fixed the magic is gone.

Exactly. It't not magic per se, but a location being incredibly magical. Hogwarts is likely the only location in the UK which is sufficiently magical for the effect to occur.

********* I mean, it's still magic causing the issues. I'd imagine the Ministry and Diagon Alley have the same problems. My point was that magic is the issue, not Hogwarts.

Besides, modern electrical devices such as phones and mp3 players are delicate enough that performing magic in the area would risk corruption of data and other issues.

********* Your being quite stubborn on this. The prompt was for a story where magic doesn't interfere with electronics, i'd say magic making electronics go haywire as magic interfering with electronics. Also the fact that there isn't technology shown also backs that statement. Sure the purebloods might make it difficult, but your saying that in over 100 years, if technology could work, they wouldn't choose to incorporate any of it. That seems more farfetched than the actual explanation. Magic, and tech just don't mix well.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

*** I might be misremembering but I'm pretty sure Hermione says near the end of Goblet of Fire that electronic bugs don't work at Hogwarts because the magic makes them go haywire, and if this were true I would assume it's the same for other electronic devices as well.

** I've always thought that magic doesn't interfere with electricity. IMHO it's just the explanation that technologically inept purebloods came up with when they set their house on fire by trying to microwave a metal pot: "Clearly Magic somehow interferes with electeticity and it doesn't work right in our world!"

Cue the release of a Ministry pamphlet a few days later informing the public about this incompatibility.

*** Yes, this! Absolutely!

Technology doesn't work at Hogwarts you say? Maybe that's because /there's nowhere to plug things in!/ and middle of nowhere Scotland inside a big stone castle is a recipe for poor reception. Do purebloods understand this? NO! Their 'experts' can't even /pronounce/ 'electricity' let alone understand its function. And who writes books like Hogwarts: A History and explains these things to incoming muggleborn? Ignorant (and often racist) purebloods for whom 'because magic' is a viable explanation for everything in their lives!

Sorry, this particular topic always seems to get me riled up.
