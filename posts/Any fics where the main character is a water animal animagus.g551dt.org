Preferably a fish, dolphin/whale, or other purely water-based creature rather than an amphibian, water bird, seal, etc, that can survive on land/in air.

Bonus points if we get to see their first transformation where they're thrashing about on dry land because they didn't know what they'd be.


** Well, here in [[https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/sharks-and-serpents-11734321]]\\
You have the best brazillian written fic that i've ever read.\\
The female protagonist is a Shark animagus.\\
It's very well written but it's in portuguese.

** There was one that had Harry be a water jaguar, basically an aquatic feline. I think it messed up the process as well, and he basically turned half-human and had to hide it with magic.

Don't remember the name atm.

** It's pretty hard to come up with a scenario where a water animagus form is useful in terms of plot. Without that it's an unfired Checkhov's gun.
