With James, Sirius and Amelia as Aurors and DMLE Director, the aftermath of the riots changed. Then there is other stuff such as the main characters shopping, Free Use Committee stuff.

********* Yeah I know there's some in the chapters already posted, but I'm specifically looking for the free use and the him as a girl with guys. Are there any chapters where he's already switched to being a girl and has been with a guy, or practiced with a dildo or something?

Most else of what I like that I'd want to read falls under bdsm, and you don't write that.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Harry and his twin sister are the Twins-Who-Lived, and their parents survived that Halloween night, there is a sexual social experiment at Hogwarts known as the Free Use Experience. Starting at the age of fourteen, students can willingly volunteer. Willing witches are used sexually, not only in private, but also in public. Harry Potter, a Metamorphmagus, who can change his gender, is forced to volunteer in the Free Use Experience as a girl at least twice a week -- including once during the week when he/she must attend classes during the day. To prepare for the Experience, Harry, his twin sister, Rose, and his girlfriend Hermione have begun a sexual relationship prior to their Fourth Year at Hogwarts.NOTE: This story is my most mature and risque story to date. It is not for prudes or readers under the age of 18. This story will probably have some type of sexual situation in many chapters. Read the warnings (tags) and heed them well. If you do not favor (or qualify for) any of this, turn back now. Relationships and Characters, and Tags are not final and will be CONSTANTLY UPDATED!This story can also be found on Fanfiction.net under my pen name/real name Vance McGill

***** Girl!Harry will. It isn't exactly Slash, because by then he'll be comfortable enough as both a guy and a girl. Which is why it is a Gender-Bender story.

  It's Hermione's last night at Hogwarts. She and an unexpected dance partner generate enough heat to burn the floor.
