I'll start with one that I think deserves way more attention, Certain Dark Things by evejenson [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712/chapters/39807054]]

Description - Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck.

It manages to combine some elements that might seem hokey and cliche (slytherin fem!Harry, accompanied by the shadow of death, had a a super powerful pet snake) in any other fic, but with great success. It's no power fantasy wank, or super complex AU that it is impossible to follow, while also being engagingly fresh and inventive with the things it tweaks. The few AU elements seem very carefully picked and the author seems to have it all well planned out, with an overarching narrative and reveals I'm looking forward to finding out about. It it started in 1st year and now is midway through 3rd, the author posts very regular updates so I have no doubt it will disappear either. It falls into none of the common issues created from starting from 1st year, like being boring rehashes of canon with tiny tweaks.

TL;DR QUALITY In progress AU, frequent updates, good characterization (no genius sexually active 11 year olds)

So yeah

Please recommend fics that you've never seen recommended before, but you feel deserve more attention, or are otherwise underrated in your opinion

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.

#+begin_quote
  July, '95. Harry's worst ever summer. Against a backdrop of Tory suburbia, royal divorce, Britpop, hip hop and war in the former Yugoslavia, Harry is sticking it out through a summer plagued by the twin demons of trauma and puberty. He's going to be okay---just not this year.
#+end_quote

A Harry-at-Privet-Drive fic, if that's your thing.

This is an angsty oneshot. Doesn't show Ginny in a positive light, though.

  Tom laughed. “Are you barmy? The Silver Jubilee. The King's been ruling for twenty five years.”

  Harry's hand dropped. So did his stomach.

  “The King?” he repeated.

Something I stumbled across a week ago.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368]]

Description: Tom Riddle was sorted into Gryffindor. There is nothing to fear.

(If oneshots and multishots aren't your thing, you can probably skip ahead to Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, which, by accident, has a pretty good recap of what you need to know to hit the ground running in that story.)

This is really good and you can just skip to the long fic story is you don't want to read the one shots of Tom conquering the wizard world. Tom is still Tom an his take on Gryffindor values is dark and twisted.

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]]

Summary: After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

Good story. A good take on Hermione goes back in time. Alot of potencial but it has not been updated in a year. My biggest issue is that Hermione is kind of naive but as this is an story narrated by Tom Sr maybe is just how he sees her.

4/5

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410]] If you have read up to at least the end of chapter 10, then your missing am awesome time travel fanfic . Like, not gonna lie, one of th better if not the best fic that characterizes even the minor side characters. It deals with Dumbledores Manipulative side in a non-bashing manner and even addresses squib rights and whatnot. It was a very pleasant surprise how good it was (is, since there is one more chapter remaining)

** I wouldn't really call Alexandra Quick a hidden gem. A good read, but very well known.

Recently read Ariadne Black and the Thread of Life, and thought it deserves more credit.

#+begin_quote
  The year before she began Hogwarts, when her mother died and the Malfoys took her in, Ariadne Black thought that things couldn't get much worse. She was wrong. Now one friend hates her because of her house, another is missing at all hours of the night, and her father's a murderer. But at least she has the chance to get some answers, right? Now in Year 3. Sirius daughter AU.

*** Yeah the AQ series is fairly popular, but because it's an oc story set in the USA I guess, I don't see it recommended very often. Maybe bc OC stories have a well earned reputation for being self insert power fantasies, people who might enjoy Alexandra quick end up skipping it

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft
