They are a lot of important secondary characters in Harry Potter who we were not given a lot of information about, Amelia Bones and Barty Crouch Jr. for example.

I want to hear people's opinions on which House do you think this character belongs to, and what year did they go to Hogwarts?

​

- Amelia Bones

She was Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which is an important and prestigious position. We know of two other DMLE Heads, Barty Crouch Snr and Harry Potter. Harry became head of DMLE at the age of 40 whilst Crouch Snr was head around his 40s. Leading me to hypothesis that Amelia Bones who was also considered a strong witch might have become head at her 40s also. If that's the case, then she was probably born in 1955, and attended Hogwarts in 1966.

Respected and celebrated by most, the father of Gregory Goyle called her a "troublemaker" and that someone should teach her a lesson, presumably disliking her due to her unbiasedness and his association with the Death Eaters. Also giving Harry a fair and unbiased trial. Showing no favoritism to either Fudge or Dumbledore. Making me believe she was either Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff.

​

- Barty Crouch Jr.

Barty Crouch Jr. his birth date is actually known, 1962 meaning he was in the same year during Hogwarts as Regulus Black.

He achieved 12 owls during his school years, was able to disguise himself as Alastor Moody to the point that he fooled Dumbledore, and was able to confunded the ancient Goblet of Fire. Barty Crouch Jr was definetly a power wizard. He also had a sinister nature since he participated in the torture of the Longbottoms, and even comforted Neville after he was triggered by Barty's lessons on the Unforgivable, he also like showing off and being prideful in his work. Making him a Slytherin.

​

- Alice Longbottom
- Frank Longbottom

We hear from Minerva and Alastor Moody that being an Auror is intense work. Both Frank and Alice were respected and celebrated Aurors that their lose was a devastation to the Wizarding World. The Auror program takes three years for training, then you must past test to become qualified. Meaning that Alice and Frank must have undergone the training and testing. After that they must have had a few years being Aurors, in which they became well known and respected among their ranks. Perhaps 3 or 2 years. They most likely did these things before Neville's birth in 1980. Therefore they started Hogwarts in 1967 and left in 1974.

Hogwarts House is most definitely Gryffindor.

​

If they are anymore characters, comment them and I'll try to give them a date and a hogwarts house.


** isn't it confirmed that at least Frank was a Gryffindor because Neville was expected from his Gran to be in the same house as his father?

** - Amelia Bones

I agree on most of your theories. I have her born c. 1954, Edgar c. 1952 (he had at least two children who would've been born in the 70's), and Susan's dad c. 1957. Families tend to be sorted to the same House, so she's most likely Hufflepuff, but Ravenclaw and Gryffindor are also possible.

- Barty Crouch Jr.

I'm guessing you got his age from the Wiki, which is slightly incorrect. Barty went to Azkaban several months after Sirius, so it would've been 1982 by then. Sirius also said Barty was 19, so Barty was born c. 1963.

It's also possible he was sorted in Ravenclaw, for many of the same reasons you've already listed. Barty Sr. was also firmly against Death Eaters, so it's unlikely the family was in Slytherin (but still possible; Jr.'s sorting into Slytherin could be another source of tension between father and son).

- Frank and Alice Longbottom

Neville feared getting put in Hufflepuff. This could have been a general fear (Draco also feared it) or it could have a firmer basis. Frank was in Gryffindor but it's possible Alice was in Hufflepuff.

They're celebrated Aurors so they were born pre-1959.

- Bonus: Alastor Moody

He was forced into retirement so he's at least 60. This places his birth year in the early 1930's; he would've been at Hogwarts at the same time as Riddle (1927) and McGonagall (1935). He was almost certainly a Gryffindor.

- Bonus 2: Kingsley Shacklebolt

He knew James Potter even though he wasn't in the First Order. This means he likely went to school at the same time and was born sometime between 1954-1966. He was probably a Gryffindor as well.

ETA: Regulus was born c. 1961, making him a year younger than Sirius.

** Fun fact, it3s never SPECIFICALLY stated anywhere in the books just what house Hagrid belonged to. It was said to be Gyrffindor (as expected) on Pottermore, but then that info got taken down for some reason. I saw a pretty convincing YouTube video justifying how it made sense he was in Slytherin, based on how he was on first name basis with young Tom Riddle and he, a half-giant, was so easily able to sneak into the dungeons at night.. don't think I believe it, but they did make a bloody good case for it.

And bonus, Moody is definitely Slytherin. Makes the most amount of sense, he knows the dangers of dark wizards because he was raised in the midst of them

** I think we technically don't know what year regular black was in. He could have been 1 or 2 years below Sirius.

*** The Black Family tree had him born in 1961 and I assume that he was out of Hogwarts when he decided to go against Voldemort so I put him as being born between January 1st and August 31st of 1961 , which puts him in Hogwarts from 1972 to 1979.

The one from back in 2006 that Rowling shared for a charity, though I could have sworn that Cygnus had been born in 1929 , this looks like the one I got Regulus's birth year from.
