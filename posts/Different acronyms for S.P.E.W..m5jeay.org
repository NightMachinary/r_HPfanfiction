:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic recently in which Harry wanted to name the DA(Dumbledore's Army) ,HAG(Hogwarts Advanced Guard). That reminded me of a fic in AO3 that had an entire chapter wherein Harry and Ron make up different names for S.P.E.W. but they are mostly potty humour and sexual innuendos. If it helps I think it was a crack fic which pointed out plot holes and irregularities in the book.

*** Yeah I loved that story too! It's my favourite harmonie fic, the development of the pairing comes naturally and realistically to the point that it could have happened in canon.
