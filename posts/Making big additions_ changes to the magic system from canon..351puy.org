Just wondering what everyone's opinion on this is. For me it is a huge deal breaker.

I don't mind minor alterations (I can't seem to escape some of the common ones anyway) but there's nothing worse than when I'm getting in to a fic and it starts talking about gypsy fart gas spells or something.


** Additions: fine, so long as they're in keeping with the tone and methods of the canonical system and don't unbalance it.

Changes: I'll tolerate very small changes if they have a clear purpose and are reasonably thought out. I'l a lot less likely to tolerate changes if they make the magic system weaker.

Caveat: unless the story is a massive AU.

****** In the few instances we see 'wards' though, runes aren't even mentioned. I refer here to the Horcrux cave from Book 6 (unlocked simply by smearing blood, not by tracing a rune); the Chamber of Secrets (unlocked by Parseltongue password); the Fidelius; shielding in combat, etc..

Not to say that you can't use it in your fic. As SniperGW points out canon has almost no rules so you can invent your own. In fact, the rules given canon don't seem to work within the books themselves.

To give just a few examples...\\
Wandlore from Book 7: wands change allegiance when won, and won't work as well otherwise. This violates several occurrences where we see Expelliarmus used to capture a wand, and fails to explain why as early as the first book Hermione was able to just take and use Harry's wand.\\
Fidelius: you have to be told or read the secret in order to know the location. Yet in Book 7 they seemingly have to abandon Grimmauld Place because a random Death Eater mook made it inside. By the rules given prior, he should not be able to find it back.

******* Your wandlore example requires a closer read of DH. Wands do not change allegiance when won. The *Elder Wand*, being the ultimately disloyal wand, changes allegiance when won. Other wands have greater loyalty, though it varies between wands. For wands with sufficient disloyalty, they may recognise new masters after being won, but not in the same way as the Elder Wand, where they completely abandon their old master.

Further, only the Elder Wand is so disloyal that it recognises a simple disarming as defeat.

JKR confirmed this as the correct reading in her Pottercast interview:

#+begin_quote
  I see wands as being quasi-sentient. I think they awaken to a kind of- They're not exactly animate, but they're close to it, as close to it as you can get in an object, because they carry so much magic. So that's really the key point about a wand. Now, the reactions will vary from wand to wand. The Elder Wand is simply the most dispassionate and ruthless of wands, in that it will only take into consideration strength. So one will expect a certain amount of loyalty from one's wand. So even if you were disarmed while carrying it, even if you lost a fight while carrying it, it has developed an affinity with you that it will not give up easily. If, however, a wand is won, properly won in an adult duel, then a wand may switch allegiance, and it will certainly work better, even if it hasn't fully switched allegiance, for the person who won it. So that, of course, is what happens when Harry takes Draco's wand from him. And that's what happens when- But you know what I mean? (MA: Mm-hm.) (SU: Yeah.) Oh yeah, Ron, (MA: Yeah.) the Blackthorn wand, from the snatcher. So that would be sort of rough and ready, common or garden, a wand favoring the person who had the skill to take it, it would favor them. However, the Elder Wand knows no loyalty except strength, so it's completely unsentimental. It will only go where the power is. So if you win, then you've won the wand.

*********** Conversation with Ollivander:

#+begin_quote
  “Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”

  “Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn't it still his?”

  “Perhaps not. If you took it --”

  “---I did -- ”

  “---then it may be yours. *Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.*”

  There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea.

  *“You talk about wands like they've got feelings,” said Harry, “like they can think for themselves.”*

  “The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”

  “A person can still use a wand that hasn't chosen them, though?” asked Harry.

  “Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.”

  The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.

  “I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it safely?”

  “I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but *the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master*.”

  “So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail's wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.

  “Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.”

  “And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.

  “I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry's face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.”
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine. The fact that winning a wand in a duel is not an absolute rule is clearly presented up front with words like "usually" and "in general". The semi-sentient nature of wands is heavily implied, and Ollivander explicitly says that transfer of wand mastery via conquest varies from wand to wand, and that it it varies depending on the manner of taking.

************ Sorry, I feel argumentative today ;)

"usually" and "in general" mean that this behaviour is the /norm/ for wands, not the exception -- at least that's how I interpret English.

If Olly had said "*In rare cases*, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change." and "the conquered wand *might occasionally* bend its will to its new master." THEN I'd say you have a point.

****** I really like the idea of Ancient Runes being runic magic. That said, I think the best explanation for what that class most likely actually is would be: Teaches students how to read signs that say "do not touch this, it will kill you slowly and hurt the entire time you are dying" in a variety of ancient languages.

No, it doesn't. There's not even the slightest hint in canon that it is a thing; there's no real world inspiration that might make it plausible. We know, from the actual goblet of fire, that words on paper might be important, but there's no hint at all that the way they're written makes any difference. Magic can't read.

****** The problem is that if runes are so important, it should be a compulsory class. By granting an elective a level of importance equal to the core classes, you're clashing with the canon system. The very fact that Ancient Runes is optional demonstrates that it is non-foundational to the use of magic. It's an extra, not a core component.

Protection charms on locations are some of the most common spells around: literally every wizarding abode will have them, and they're key for keeping Muggles out of magical areas. If runes were necessary for casting such spells, it would surely be part of the core curriculum.

Also, they study history at Hogwarts, and that doesn't have any practical magical purpose. But it enables you to understand magic in its societal context. There's no evidence that Ancient Runes is any different: a class where you study a language which is of historical and cultural importance to wizarding society. Such a thing can come in useful without being involved in the casting of magic: see Hermione's runic copy of Tales the Beedle the Bard in DH.

******* Except that an obscure language class with nothing but trivial value to other aspects of their world is a waste of an elective.

My headcanon (or headfanon perhaps) is that enchantment (making Charms persistent) uses modern 'runes' as taught in NEWT level Charms class. What then makes Ancient Runes valuable is that it teaches about the evolution of magic use- like studying Pascal and other older programming languages to learn how it built up into modern scripting tools.

As just a Scandanavian script it wouldn't mean much compared to actual language classes or an introduction to Ministry law or even some Arts classes.

You realise a lot of schools teach Latin, right?

Also, the electives are kinda meant to be wastes. It's a running theme. Divination is useless, Care of Magical Creatures is a doss, Arithmancy is intensely obscure. It would be strange for Ancient Runes to so useful compared to the others.

Your headcanon is going to have to be headfanon, as we've seen Charms last for very long times without any runes.

********* Latin is studied as it teaches much about modern languages which developed from it and because a considerable segment of historical documents are written in it. It's not obscure, even if it is dead. My comparison stands.

The electives aren't well-taught but that doesn't make the /subjects/ unimportant. Like many school subjects, their relevance to the student may not be evident until long after the classes are done. Divination is real and meaningful, but hard to discern. Magical Creatures are a primary aspect of living in the magical society, right alongside magical herblore. Muggle Studies should be valuable for maintaining the Statute of Secrecy. Arithmancy seems to relate to Qabbalistic numerology, though how it would be applied takes even more conjecture than Ancient Runes or Astronomy.

** It depends how its done. Canon magic.. is 'magic', essentially. The rules aren't explained, and its mysterious and magical and does exactly what J.K needs to advance the plot.

If the magic system is to be detailed and explained, it needs to be properly thought out and deep. Half-arsing it with semi-explanations and contradictions is one of the worst thing a fic can do.

** I suppose it depends on what you mean:

It kind of distracts me when an author essentially tries to grammar nazi JK's Latin and say that a spell ought to be X not Y.

Including runes as runic magic or other 'alternative' magic viewpoints be they native american or oriental or whatever depends /heavily/ on execution. Different but equivalent, fine, it doesn't bother me that asian wizards don't use wands because they instead use this other thing that's kinda the same thing. But... making up a new magic system that's obviously and blatantly better and having only Harry learn it is pretty WTF inducing. I'm fine with the explanation for why spells in Britain are in Latin and people use wands being "because Romans" but the Romans weren't retarded. If there was an obviously better way of doing things they would have noticed, they had contact with Asia after all. Cultural plagiarism was kinda their thing.

I can mentally justify rune magic being so damned useful, I suppose, but it really ought to take a /long/ time to prep, and or be immobile because otherwise why have wands? Why isn't it a core class? yadda yadda yadda... see [[/u/Taure]] and [[/u/wordhammer]] in the other comments for more.
