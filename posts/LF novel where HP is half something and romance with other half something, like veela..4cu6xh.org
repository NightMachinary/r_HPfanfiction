So Harry has to be like half vampire,fae,dragon or anything else similar, should be powerful and either fall in love with another half creature and by this I don't mean centaur, I mean like half veela or etc. If he gets a harem it's even better but it needs to be stuff like half veela or half nymphs and stuff(I've read some fiction where daphne was a half water nymph or something but the rest of the harem were normal and they didn't get along with Fleur, that and harry was full human). If it would be Fleur as half or maybe quater veela with somebody else that is half of something water based, both with Harry and eventually getting along would be amazing.

I've tried reading animagus mishap, wasn't what I was looking for because I hate rape in any story, and there was one where Harry was a forgotten big brother that gotten together with Fleur, Grabrielle and some vampire but I dropped it because he was human and I don't like when one lover is immortal and the rest not. Also the Eragon crossover was close but not quite, way too many random characters in the harem that did nothing, the only good one that got close tho.

I wouldn't mind if he is fully not human I just don't him to be immortal while the lover/lovers are not.

So what I need: -Half creature Harry -Romance with other half creature(Harem of them would be better but I've been looking and failed to find any) -Powerful Harry -If it's harem they get along in the end -Bonus points if it's Fleur and another water based halfing together with Harry(Hell I'll live with it if he's even human if he's strong enough in this type of story)

Thanks!


** "On Crimson Wings" might fit your request, depending on what you define as "Half-Dragon" and if it's OK that Harry doesn't start out as it.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

** "Cold Blood": Fits your request, apart from the harem. Harry becomes a Half-Dragon. Slow reveal, good world building and Background, and romance.

*** Of course, the ending is a bit of a let-down because, some insignificant things aside, everything starts suddenly going their way. A bit of a shame, honestly.
