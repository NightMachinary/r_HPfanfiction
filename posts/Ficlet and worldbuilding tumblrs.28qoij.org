Something I hardly see discussed, and wasn't even aware of until recently, are tumblrs dedicated to exploring minor characters, the wizarding world, or alternate wizarding worlds. Some tumblrs are dedicated to building one single universe, while others are collections of vignettes. Some are written by a single or a few authors, some take submissions, or both.

Examples:

- [[http://livesandliesofwizards.tumblr.com/][livesandliesofwizards]] - my favorite collection but no longer updating
- [[http://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/][thepostmodernpottercompendium]] - single universe
- [[http://36viewsofhogwarts.tumblr.com/][36viewsofhogwarts]] - character-centric
- [[http://thelethifoldwitch.tumblr.com/][thelethifoldwitch]]
- [[http://americanwizarding.tumblr.com/][americanwizarding]] - American magical worldbuilding

A friend and I started our own ficlet blog earlier this month for the ideas we never had the time or patience to write into a full novel, since we're both otherwise retiring from fic. We're still finding our personality, but we'll likely remain graphic-centric, character-centric, occasionally silly, and focused on post-war and next gen.

Thanks!

** Ooh, there's also monsterblogofmonsters, which explores creatures and conditions in the wixen world. Often ties in known mythological creatures.

Departmentsofmysteries has case files from the department of Mysteries. There's a little bit of a plot concerning the agents if you choose to read into it, such as a time line, and the agents are all canon characters with code names (no spoilers!). But you can ignore all that and just look at things like a room made to screw with time for the purpose of studying werewolves, or information about the veil. All nicely tagged with a separate tag page where it's broken down.

(sorry I love those two blogs!)

*** I've seen those! I know there's a close knit network of HP canon blogs, so I didn't list out every one; wizardhistory is another one that just started. I tend to seek out more character/commentary-centric blogs personally, but those are great for anyone interested in expanding lore.

** I'd just like to say that I've been woefully in the dark about all of these! I'd planned on deep cleaning my house today and tomorrow - not anymore! Thank you! These are magnificent!

*** Glad to have introduced someone! They seem like a bit of a niche; if I had known about them sooner, I'd have started one sooner :)
