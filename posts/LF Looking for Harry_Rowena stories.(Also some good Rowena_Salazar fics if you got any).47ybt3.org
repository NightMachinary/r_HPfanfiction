Looking for stories that are complete or being updated monthly/bi-monthly but hey, I'll take what I can get. Having HP/RR and SS/RR as two of your favorite pairings is a struggle when almost no one writes them.

On a side note I recently read Cleverness and Cunning by Mademoiselle Anime Amour and, imo, it is one of the best Rowena/Salazar fics out there(well semi Rowena/Salazar), not that there's much competition though.


** Linkffn(The Templar Death, Shaken not Stirred)

One of my favored completed story.

  Harry is involved in a temporal incident during a skirmish with Voldemort at Privet Drive. For him, a decade later, with new allies and a love, he returns on the Autumn Equinox a few months later, a powerful mage with a dislike of those corrupted by dark magic and abilites to kill a Dark Lord. How does a man who wants nothing more than peace struggle through brutal, bloody battles?

  Rowena Ravenclaw the most intelligent witch of her age. Salazar Slytherin the most cunning. Her life is full and rich, whereas his is bitter and deprived. When their minds and personalities clash, things are never quite the same.
