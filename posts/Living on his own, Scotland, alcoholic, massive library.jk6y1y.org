:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi All - I've recently found the world of HP FanFiction and read so much it's all blurred into one....! Does anyone know of the one above?

Also looking for one where Harry is a spy, living in a shared house, Hermione sacrifices part of her life to save him and ends up speaking to the goddess of love. Thanks in advance


** Goddess of love part sounds familiar - linkfffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past]])

** The one in the title could be /Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux/. At least that detail matches. He becomes an alcoholic and lives alone in some remote stormy village by the sea after Hermione dies.
