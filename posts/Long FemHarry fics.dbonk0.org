I've read most of this series...I've read Victoria Potter (i live and breathe for it), Girl in the War, Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic, Dreams of Today, and the Runic warding of the British isles fic (paraphrase the name).

No fem-slash. Always a girl, please. No potion incidents or trans Harry. I'll read any pairing, though.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** natural fem!Harry or gender bended fem!Harry as well (no potion incident)? linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) is rather nice story, it is just slightly too much smut (with traces of BDSM) for its own good. And yes, it is a bit of Severitus, but no Snarry.
