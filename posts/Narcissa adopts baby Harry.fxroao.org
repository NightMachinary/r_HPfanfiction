:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I'm looking for this fic wherein the Malfoys adopted toddler Harry after finding him abused by the Dursleys. They disguised him as Sirius' squib child from a gold-digger and took him in. The healers/officers praised Lucius and doesn't believe he's a Death Eater because he's so supportive of his wife's "new project."

There's this hospital scene wherein they had to cover up Harry's magical scar and Narcissa had to use magic. Hospital alarm went off and a nurse came in and found Narcissa and baby Draco playing with baby Harry. She explained that she used her magic to change Harry's hair color because Draco is excited to have a brother.

Dumbledore was desperate to find Harry so he sent out the Hogwarts letters earlier under the pretense of whatever. The Malfoys tricked the tracking magic and Dumbledore failed to locate Harry. Snape was also present in their [Malfoy kids] childhood.

I hope anyone knows this fic. Thank you!

[EDIT] Found the fic thanks to another Redditor. Title is "Little White Lies" by Luthien Saralonde. It was seemingly abandoned but fortunately, the author updated just last March after six years. Hope you guys enjoy it! Link will be in the comments.


** Haven't actually read it, just thought I'd help search, so was it by any chance Little White Lies by Luthien Saralonde?

  REUPLOADED WITH ORIGINAL AUTHOR'S PERMISSION! Lucius Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and father to a very demanding fifteen month old son, didn't think for an instant his life could get any harder than it already was. But when the Daily Prophet announces the Boy Who Lived is still missing, Draco and Narcissa are adamant he be found and brought to live with them. Read and review!

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the weird and wonderful story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II complete. (Warning: Part II ends on a cliffhanger. If you dislike that fact, Part II, Chapter 35, might be a better place to stop reading.) Part III is on indefinite hiatus.
