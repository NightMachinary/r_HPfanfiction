** I like the idea in theory, but I've found that it's rarely executed well, especially in the case of Harry Potter fics. I think part of the problem is that people ask "is [insert villain here; usually Malfoy] redeemable" rather than "does [insert villain here; usually Malfoy] deserve the forgiveness of the people they've wronged," which, while obviously similar, are meaningfully distinct questions. I can't speak for anyone else, but if a racist, classist asshole called me a "filthy little [n-word]" I would /never/ date them, which is one of many reasons I hate dramione.

*** True.

But if it happened years ago and the person is trying to repent for their sins, that they are trying to change?

And yh I'm black so let me gove you an anecdote. When I was young a lot of people called me half boy, not because I'm mixed race but because my mother is European, my dad wasnt.

My mother is Albanian and my dad is from Morroco, which is unusual. And now this one boy always said I was a mixed prick.

I never liked him, now we are good friends. People can change, what happens when your a kid happens as a child.

So the rules apply with anyone, if they are truly changing for better than why not give them a shot?

**** I'm not trying to speak for anyone but myself: if you can/would forgive someone like Malfoy for saying and doing what the character canonically says and does and move past it, then more power to you, but I wouldn't. I've been in not dissimilar circumstances a few times, and every time, I've cut ties with the person in question, and I stand by each decision.

And again, it's not even an issue of redemption: regardless of whether I believe the people in question to be "redeemable," I, personally, am not invested in their success or failure in that endeavor. If they turn around and become great people, cool, but they've burned their bridges with me and I want nothing more to do with them.

Edit: to specifically answer your question of "why not give them a shot:" they aren't my responsibility, and Malfoy isn't Hermione's or Harry's, nor is he anyone else's of the people he's victimised.

** As I've gotten older I enjoy these kinds of pairings, because I can view these characters how they are, kids. These “evil” kids are literally children born into privilege brainwashed into blood superiority, and aren't given a chance to grow out of it in the canon series. They have every bit of potential to become better people later in life, and while some carry grudges through the rest of their lives, others can forgive.

** Well, I don't like any of the ships you listed, but i can talk for Scorpius/Rose fics (I'm pretty much a thrid gen reader). So here are my thoughts.

The problem is not so much the trope itself, but how it is handled. First off, we must remember most of fanfic writers are amateurs, so you will se a lot of mistakes at storytelling, pacing, story structure, character motivations, etc. Enemies to lovers has very well established formulas, but not everybody follows them in the right way. So there's that first.

Then a less technical aspect comes into play, which would be more related to personal experience and conceptions of love. You see, I feel like Hollywood has filled us with a lot of wrong ideas about romance (and I make myself clear here, this is just a personal opinion and nothing more), one of them being "the more intense your feelings, the more genuine they are." Well, I personally disagree with that one. But many people out there believe the earlier statement, so there's this common trope of "I treat you like shit because I actually love you but don't want to admit it", or "we love each other so intensely that we get to fight a lot and enjoy having hate sex". In my personal opinion, that's toxic as hell, but who caares? A lot of teenagers say, that's romantic as hell.

Now there are basically two approaches in which enemies to lovers can work. In the first one, you have two genuinely good people who for whatever reason get the wrong idea about each other, but eventually see themselves forced to get to know each other better, find out they're not that bad, become friends (or at least have a mutual respect relationship) and then fall in love. The other formula goes pretty much in line with redemption arcs. As I haven't written any of these, I don't know as much about it, but as the title suggests, it's all about a character who gets a redemption and therefore gets to have the other person's interest.

Now, I don't see how the first one might apply to any of the pairings you mentioned, although it can with Scorpius/Rose fics because they're basically unknown characters, almost OC's. But for Drarrys and Dramiones, the best approach would be the second one. Now the problem again is not the redemption arc itself, but how it is handled. From what I have heard, a lot of dramiones treat Draco as if he was a poor guy mistreated by his parents and who basically had no control over his actions durung books 6 and 7. However, if you're a good reader, you realize this is not exactly the case. So you must work on Draco ACTUALLY getting over his false believes to have a satisfactory redemption arc. For that, of course, you need conflict, you need tension, you need him to make mistakes, etc. Because no, redemption arcs don't work well when it's all about someone 'healing their SO's inner demons". In this specific case, Draco should have a redemption on his own and just then start developing something with Hermione. Still don't like the couple though, but my point here is: it's all about the way you write it.

** Could be fun, but the HP fandom has so completely overdosed on this trope that it becomes utterly nauseating.

At least for this fandom, I prefer fics that deal those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums efficiently and ruthlessly. I don't want anything that propagandizes endless "second chances", "good guys don't kill", "we must always forgive", and blah blah blah.

****** Ah, my mistake: I got your response partially mixed up with someone who replied to the same comment saying that nobody is beyond redemption, which is simply not true. That said, I don't disagree with the OP's point: the Death Eaters are supremacist terrorists, and I'd never condemn a character for killing one in battle. Even if I don't think it should be anyone's to first instinct do so, I don't think it should necessarily be a last resort, either.

**** No, those who have initiated and committed atrocities, genocides, and war crimes should all be brought to justice. I don't care about whether they are born evil or not, I don't care about whether they have redeeming qualities or not, all I care is their intentions and actions.

For example, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler][Heinrich Himmler]] is said to be a loving father and wonderful husband, and yet he was also head of the SS and a chief architect of the Holocaust. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann][Adolf Eichmann]] is said to have never personally killed and tortured another human, and yet he was the person responsible for implementing the Holocaust. Read [The Banality of Evil](The Banality of Evil: Hannah Arendt and "the Final Solution" [[https://g.co/kgs/zBQdWX]]) about what "evil" really is, and trust me, it's not restricted to those monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villains like Voldemort.

In the HP world, Death Eaters are depicted as even worse than Nazis during WW2. Not only did those scums want to carry out genocides and implement an absolute tyranny, but also relish in personally torture and murder their victims.

I have had enough of fics that try to find every excuse for those perpetrators, while trying to pick every bone with their victims who are defending themselves with lethal force.

*** Everyone deserves redemption. Everyone should at least be given a second chance because when they are not we throw them away like a broken toy. Like they are worthless. And that's when people get desperate.and desperate people do terrible things.

I've been on the edge, I almost killed someone. I went into my house and brought a knife with me one day with the intention of going to this guys house and murdering him. But I didnt. I dropped the knife and talked about it. The guy I was going to deserved it, he stabbed my cousin who just hit 15. I was GOING to kill him. But It's not edgy, it's not cool. Death is disgusting, and romanticizing it doesn't make it better.

Killing the bad guys doesn't justify the end, that's why I find heroes like Spiderman and Batman the best. Because they know Death is a one way street. That's why when you come back after a tour in the Millitary your changed. Because killing someone will always stick with you.

I used to think like you, I was pro death penalty for England about a year ago. But I realised I cant be killing people without letting them try to change. Because nothing changes, it's just an endless cycle.

I would much rather prefer fics that go into the mind of a Harry that tortures and kills, and how he slowly realises that bit by bit he is being torn off.

And I will get downvoted here, a lot of people dont believe in redemption. They believe characters like Snape and Draco should be put in prison or executed and for a while back I agreed.

But this quote has always stuck with me:

"If you kill a murderer, the amount of murderers in the world remain the same"

I cant remember were it's from, maybe a batman comic or something? But it made me actually think about it.

Harry killing Voldemort in cannon was a hard thing for him to do, he didint want to kill Voldemort, he just wanted the suffering if others to end. Harry is a selfless character nit a selfish arrogant one that tries to play God by taking lives away.

Who is he to judge who lives or dies? Because his parents died?

And the Death Eaters weren't Nazis per se, I would draw a more comparison to the KKK. Masks, and predominantly South (Riddle was from London G, that's down South of England)

And good guys dont kill, they do what's necessary. Arrow season 2 perfectly sums it up, while later season fuck it up Season 2 is effective in telling the audience why killing affects the person.

And being able to forgive is a strength, not a weakness.

But maybe this is my inner Dumbledore coming out, after all he isnt a manipulative scumbag nor a wasteman. He is a Headmaster and a straight up brother. I mean his plans had plans.

I hate bashing :p

Sorry for my rant, I was just feeling a bit sad today. Tho it is your opinion bro

Please give me a break. Voldemort and Death Eaters were primarily modeled, though not exclusively, after Hitler and the Nazis. Even JKR had confirmed this analogy in multiple interviews herself.

Are you so quick to forget the scene about the Muggleborn Registration Commission in DH?

Are you so quick to forget what Snatchers were doing?

Are you so quick to forget what Azkaban was?

Are you so quick to forget what Kingsley said on the Wireless about how Muggles were murdered and tortured?

Are you so quick to forget that they were using Cruciatus on Hogwarts students during detentions? A worst form of torture on children?

You want to give these sadistic genocidal scums second chances?

****** But there were war crime trials in Nuremberg after the war. Wherever you fall on the discussion of culpability for following orders, I think we can all agree it wasn't practical to try every participant of the Axis armed forces for their part in the war. In Wizarding Britain, it's much more feasible to do so due to smaller numbers. And Wizarding Britain has at least a couple forms of the death penalty that we're aware of (Dementor's Kiss and The Veil)
