Harry at this point would be Head of Magical Defense and would would assemble a team of Aurors to hunt down a powerful wizard naming himself the Yellow King. This story would involve the most ancient and forbidden of magic Occultamancy, meaning the creation and summoning of dark and magical creatures through the manipulation of life and ritualistic sacrifices.

Literally just thought of it but if anybody has any ideas, feel free to brainstorm in the comments.


** I think it's a good idea. I've seen it mentioned in passing in fics, but hardly ever as the main plot.

There's one where Tom Riddle traces Voldemort's steps and comes across a captured demon-creature-thing that he accidentally sets loose (in Italy, I believe). He (in disguise), a local witch, and Dumbledore, have to fight to contain it again. It was only a chapter though and I don't remember what it's called. Maybe have Harry team up with someone he wouldn't want to/was enemies with?

In Runic War, the reason Voldemort has red eyes is that he summoned a demon and saw hellfire with his own eyes and so now they're tainted for lack of a better word. But that's just a sentence.

If you want some inspiration:

Hermione Granger, Demonologist is about a young Hermione summoning demons as friends. The fic only follows her first year, and the epilogue kind of brushed over what a war with demons could have been like. You've probably already read it though, but I think everyone who's read that wanted the rest of it.

Linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good)- Harry summons demons to deal with Voldemort. My favorite horror fic in the fandom.

Linkao3(Dark Lord Who)- Bellatrix fucks up a ressurection and brings back a dark lord for every self sacrificing death in the Final Battle. The first chapter alone has a good ritual scene, but some of Baba Yaga's fighting hints at very old languages and she summons a big black shadow to attack at one point.

  Bellatrix Lestrange uses dark, sacrificial magic to bring the Dark Lord back to life after Harry Potter has given his life to defeat him. However, asking for a "Dark Lord" turns out to be a tad bit too ambiguous. Baba Yaga is having fun, Godelot is a sadistic bastard, Herpo the Foul brags about his horcrux, Tom Riddle is unimpressed. (Dark)

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** The last book in the NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series has something of the sorts. The theme comes into play earlier on but it's only clear what these forces are only in the last story of the series. Still you'd have to read all the stories in order for the final one to make sense.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 7 of 7, sequel to "Albus Potter and the Chaos Contagion." (Read all previous installments first!) The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Albus discovers there is a very fine line between power and madness, a very blurry line between right and wrong, and no line at all between our world and the Abyssal Vortex. FINALLY COMPLETE!
