The Doom Slayer mistakes the witches and wizards of the world for corrupted humans and satanists, and decides to stop the spread before it is too late.


** He'd be stopped pretty quickly tbh, unless you're making it so his armour is spell-resistant or something.

****** That only works if he can take them by surprise. He has an entire castle to kill, they only have to get a single spell to land on him and he's done.

Not to mention the fact that he's not going to find ammunition refills in Hogwarts.

******* He never took any demons by surprise and they're dead all the same. The only potential challenges would be the staff, and perhaps a few of the highest years. A lot of students would also be so traumatized by seeing the Slayer chainsawing their friends in two pieces that they'd be unable to act.

********* Not necessarily, when you have them hurling fireballs all over the deck. They are also substantially more durable than a human, and as such a shot from the super shotgun could potentially kill a lot more than one person.

********** Fireballs don't paralyse you for hours on a single touch. Again, that makes no difference to the fact that he needs to get the drop on them.

It also assumes that wizards don't have a countermeasure to guns, which is fairly unrealistic given that guns predate the Statute of Secrecy by a wide margin and wizards participated in multiple wars. Nobody wants the embarrassment of getting ganked by a crummy muggle.

*********** But we are also in Britain here. The only people I know of who have access to guns are farmers and land owners. Also, the Slayer is a literal god of destruction. It stands to reason that if he can shrug of explosion that would obliterate the average man that he would also be resistant to magic, to say nothing of his armour.

*************** Yes, but it could be the same universe. The events of Doom transpire in the future. As such, the Slayer could have been transported back through time. And I don't think that it does operate too differently, as the two could be related magical branches. For instance, fiendfire or incendio could be related to the magic used by the imp's.

I'm not sure why this is surprising to you. Yes, people who bend reality impossibly six times before breakfast are extremely powerful. The fact that they wear goofy outfits and aren't very sensible doesn't change that.

********************* The Doom Slayer uses brunt force, and is supposed to be the unstoppable force wherever he appears surviving against all odds and winning. I suppose it depends on how you play the games, but there aren't many options for surprise attacks or stealth. It just isn't his forte. You can't expect the huge, hulking slayer whose weapons all make a loader bang than a nuclear bomb to employ stealth and surprise tactics. It just doesn't work.

A 1st year petrificus totalus is more than adequate to incapacitate anyone, to say nothing of the many nastier options.

An 11 year old wizard could take most adult muggles as long as they have their wand.
