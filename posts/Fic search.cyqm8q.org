#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.
