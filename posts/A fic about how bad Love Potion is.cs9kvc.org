This is a thing that made wizard hitler ( if voldys mom was less rapey this could all be avoided). That brainwashes and mindcontrols people something that is seen as so wrong in the books the spell doing something very similar in the books is outlawed. That never causes good things when you see the actual effects of it in series. And children created in its influence are incapable of forming any meaningful relationships with anyone of any nature. But its also something that is treated very casually by people who are considered good. Mrs Weasely like like oh I used it no big deal. Its sold in joke shops its a harmless thing that only girls ever seem to use. Its a really weird disconnect. I need more fics where people talk about how awful it is to use and experience.

Edit: If its a fic where someone who uses it is held accountable and through that how bad the love potion can be explored that works. Completed long fic preferable if not completed at least long.

Edit 2: so the incapable of forming meaningful relationships isnt true for everyone just Voldemort. So that bit isnt an effect but the rest of the things are


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617][An Hour of Wolves]] linkao3(14164617) deals with the aftermath of Romilda drugging and raping Harry, though it's incomplete.

(And as a side note, the idea that people conceived under the influence of a love potion are incapable are love isn't canon - in fact, JKR has explicitly refuted it.)

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

This isn't really in evidence. It is significant that Voldemort was conceived under the effects of a love potion, but it is a symbolic significance, not literal. It drives the point home, in the telling of the story, that Voldemort is so disconnected from love that his conception itself was performed under a twisted, unreal imitation of it. It does not follow, from this one known instance of correlation, that all children conceived in such circumstances will inevitably be sociopaths.

*** Thank you, a lot of people don't realize that it was intended to be symbolical. Hell, in canon it's not even confirmed that Merope used a love potion (that's Harry's and Dumbledore's guess considering the situation and that she was more likely to use that rather than something like the Imperious).

Edit: Also just imagine how fucked up it would be to say that rape-babies can't feel love and will all grow up to be psychopaths. Voldemort was a product of a fucked up upbringing, and all the inbreeding probably didn't do him any good either. The only role the love potion played was that his father abandoned his mother and him, which more than likely started his hatred of Muggles.

**** Yeah, I would credit a lot of things in tandem for Voldemort's brand of psychotic. The Gaunts were evidently genetically predisposed to insanity in a way even the Blacks couldn't match. He lived his childhood in utter squalor, and at some point during his formative years, he was probably exposed to the horrors of the blitz. He was magically gifted in an unusually conspicuous way; any feelings of superiority he nurtured as a child were likely magnified by his apparent supernatural powers. He was sorted into Slytherin, a house known for its glorification of pureblood elitism, and was probably not well-treated until he carved out his own place there with his talents. The love potion, if there was one, which as you point out is not confirmed, could have played a part, but it just as easily might have not.

** Linkffn(The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie).

This isn't the main focus of the story, but people are slipped love potions in this fic and they get what is coming to them. It's a long complete fic (154 chapters I think) The ao3 version has some smutty scenes if you're into that sort of thing.

  In which a group of wizards' rights activists goes on the offensive after a prohibition against love potions, forcing the magical world to confront the horror of magic's role in sexual assault and the murky legal nature of consent. Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco are swept together to solve the case, and in the process they're made to confront their own love and lust---with and without potions.

JKR has confirmed that this was just meant as an allegory - normally children born to Love Potion parents would be able to form loving bonds. It's just that Voldemort was unable to form said connections, and oh, look, he never had a chance for a pair of functioning, loving parents in any case, because his dad was trapped and raped for however long that lasted.

That's why Harry's ability to love is a 'power he knows not' - Harry grew up emotionally neglected to a degree that would emotionally cripple many, but is very well-adjusted despite that.
