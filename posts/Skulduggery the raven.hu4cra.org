I read something a while ago, it's a Severitus and Snape has a pet raven called Skulduggery which has near human intelligence.

I cannot for the life of me remember the title. If anyone has read this and can link I would be eternally grateful.

I had a problem with this story because Skul was described as "twice the size of a normal raven." As normal ravens are about 2 feet tall with a 4-foot wingspan, that would have made the raven roughly Harry's size... but the rest of the story didn't reflect those proportions. (I think the author was thinking twice the size of a crow, which would basically make it a normal size raven.)

*** Firstly, thank you! I've been looking all over.

Secondly, damnit! Now I'm not going to be able to re read it without imagining a massive man sized raven following Snape around like some sort of terrifying childhood nightmare come to life!

**** Well, to be fair, all you have to do is gloss over the line "twice the size of a normal raven" when it first appears. The rest of the story is consistently normal-raven (huge crow) size.

But yeah, the thought of a Harry-sized raven riding around on Snape's shoulder definitely will pull you right out of the story.
