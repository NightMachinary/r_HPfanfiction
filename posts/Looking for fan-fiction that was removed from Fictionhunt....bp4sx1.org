Looking for Something Something, One Crazy Month, and several other stories by the author idontknowwhatever

These stories were removed from Fictionhunt in 4/30/2019. I never saved them hard copy style. Please for all that is holy. Help me!!!


** Were they actually removed? A recent update to the site now requires a login to see stories. Have you tried logging in?
