Authors can win... they just have to write at a speed faster than we readers can read... and outlive us all.

** Sacrifices Arc is amazing but it tries way too hard to get the message across sometimes. This causes a lot of unnecessary bits in an already crazy long series, and makes Harry incredibly annoying by the end.

** Not just my favorites but when the fic is longer than several of the books, a chapter sometimes is only part of the day. That's frustrating.

Delving into the characters is good. I appreciate that. But come on. Don't be on chapter 67 and at 800k words and still be in one year.

** EDIT: SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE REFINER's FIRE

This isn't really about my favourite fanfic, but it's a fav that I see a lot as being some people's favourite/pinnacle of fanfic writing. The Refiner's Fire. Now, horrible dialogue to narration elements aside, it's really hard to get anything from the fic other than how little respect the author has for women.

Every antagonist, be they "enchanted" or actually evil is a woman, forgetting Voldemort for a moment. Each time an "enchanted" character attempts to kill Harry, he and Ron basically go "OH WELL THEY'RE JUST GIRLS, YOU KNOW GIRLS, VAIN AND SHALLOW ARE GIRLS, HARRY MATE." and then they go on. At one point Ginny makes a weird out of character remark in a private conversation that Harry overhears, and we get treated to a chapter or two about how shallow and evil Ginny is, and how justified Harry is in his anger, but needs to forgive Ginny because she's JUST A GIRL.

A little earlier in the fic, there's a weird little aside where Malfoy transfigures Pansy to have some aspects of a Cow, and Harry and co. help her out and transfigure her back. This is never mentioned again until Pansy appears out of no where, tries to assassinate Harry, and then kills herself. THEN IT IS NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN. Sloppy writing by a weirdly woman hating writer, is all I get off the fic.

*** My own personal little grievance du jour comes from Lord Silvere's Delenda Est and by proxy Para Bellum.

I absolutely eat up the first 90% of Delenda Est, and then the last bit is this strange off-kilter rush to the end, where the rest of the fic is so interesting, the final couple of chapters fall short. It is still an incredible read imho, but that's what I've come to find after my third reading of it. Similarly, Parabellum is updating so slowly that I can't really get invested in it, and it feels listless when he does update. I'm still eagerly eating it up anyway, but it's not the same epic read that Delenda Est was.

****** Definitely don't blame you. I kept hearing how good it apparently was, but it's only original until the OC dies, pretty much. Nothing from the first half really seems to affect the second half, to the point where despite losing the great love of his life in the first half (Harry proceeds to literally rip the memories of her out of his head) barely another mention of her is made unless it is for man angst or the shedding of manly tears.

There was, by the point I stopped, literally 6 attempts made on Harry's life by year mates, all girls who bought make-up at this new store run by a polyjuiced Bellatrix Lestrange, after each one is the aforementioned Ron and Harry riff about how dumb teh girlz are and then reaffirm their masculine friendship and how girls are smelly and or dumb/vain/shallow.

I don't understand how it's so popular, when plenty of (subjective) better fics have so many less reviews despite being way better and way more interesting. Also six different attempts on Harry's life in relatively the same fashion with the same fall out each time is completely as boring as it sounds.

** That there isn't more to the story. It ends with my OTP finally getting together, but doesn't go beyond that. I want to read about how they make their relationship work! Also, the story is told entirely from Harry's POV, and while it's done quite well, because of the nature of the story I would totally love it if I could read it from Draco's POV too.
