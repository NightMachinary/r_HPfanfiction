Okay SO. I read this fic over two months ago and it's STILL stuck in my brain as being one of the most heartbreaking thing I've ever read. I stayed up till 7am finishing it with tears streaming down my face, no joke. Are there any other fics anyone knows of that are similar to this one? Any where Lily and James are alive and they are reunited with Harry again?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again]])

(Summary) Lily and James thought Harry was dead, but somehow he escaped Godrics Hollow that night, proceeds to live in foster homes and then on the street till Sirius finds him almost dead sleeping on a bench outside Grimmauld Place.

Its unfinished, but I didn't honestly care. Any recs would be appreciated, thanks!

** There was Best Served Cold from sakurademonalchemist. Harry is an audit and he resurrects his parents with necromancy. It is a bit light hearted and probably not the kind of thing you are looking for.

  All in all it's been a hugely successful sort of weekend: first James and Lily get their memories back, then their son, and now Moony. On the downside, all three of these marvels come with a war included free of charge in the packaging.
