what it says on the packet. Harry gets a role model in the form of George Carlin, and therefore takes Carlin's ideals and humour and adapts it to fit the Magical world. I expect they'll be lots of cussing, a fair bit of political commentary, and a very long list of people Harry comes across that he feels should be locked into portable toilets and set on fire. What will happen with a Harry who disregards authority, hates stuck-up pricks like Malfoy, and has no limits on stating his mind? What will happen to Voldemort? I don't know, but maybe you do.


** 10/10 would read this. George carlin was before my time, but God damn I find him funny. And him being a mentor to harry would make a really funny crack fic if it was written well

*** But would the Harry we know ever just walk up to someone and say "I hope your children turn out poorly.", or "You don't know how happy it would make me to one day pull up to a flaming auto wreck and see you."

Trelawney thinks he's a seer, mainly from the comment he made about how it'd be interesting if the only way you could die is if your head randomly blew up.
