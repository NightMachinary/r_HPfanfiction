** Make Ginny an interesting foil to Harry.

Or you could also just screw the entire concept of a pairing and write an interesting STORY that had a minor subplot of two characters coming together to eventually become a couple because screw pairings.

** I think you need to show through your story why they work so well together and really show their traits.

Ginny is kind of the only one who really gets Harry to open up. She does this by being unflinchingly loyal to him when others attack him yet can put him in his place when necessary. Because of this, I think Harry trusts her more than almost anyone else and thus feels like he can be open with her in ways he cant be open with even Ron and Hermione.

Harry works with Ginny because I imagine he lets her be free and maintain independence. Or at least I hope. Obviously he had no qualms with her playing professional Quidditch. And with the glaring exception of the battle of Hogwarts, he doesn't coddle her. Ginny's big personality trait is her desire to be independent and treated like an adult. It's why her patronus is a horse.

So an interesting Harry/Ginny fic explores this dynamic, especially if the fic is set post-war. If there is going to be conflict between them, which is necessary for the story to be interesting, I think it should be along the lines of figuring out how to be together while staying true to themselves. How do they manage a year apart at school when they haven't been able to properly be together? How does Ginny, who has experience in a relationship, deal with Harry as a partner when not only has he never been in a relationship, but also had never known love until he came into her family's lives?

Also, Harry probably wants to fast-track their relationship since he just survived a death sentence and his greatest desire is family. Ginny probably wants some independence in life, maybe live on her own for a bit and not get tied down with marriage and kids just yet. A fic that explores that would be interesting to me.

Basically, these are two damaged, complex people who would be very difficult for anyone else to date, yet they work together. A goof fic explores exactly how they make it work so well.

** This is my favorite pairing but I don't think writing it is much different from writing any other pairing.

Develop both characters, and make sure both of them can stand on their own. Wallflower or pushover Ginny ruins this pairing - she is actually a pretty fun and strong person from 4th year onwards in canon, just severely underutilized. She's also blunt and quick to anger. Harry is brave and selfless, but he has issues with guilt and anger himself. They're also likely the two sassiest characters in canon, so humor is a key element imo.

Give other characters some love too. I'm not a big fan of stories where Harry and Ginny (or any two paired characters) are amazing and overpowered and everyone else sucks. Harry loves Ginny's family, and she gets along well with Sirius (in my headcanon anyway, I can't remember the specifics from canon). In a lot of good H/G fics Ron is subtly awesome.

I think it's fine to make a pairing the focal point of your story, though if you can pair it with a great adventure story or mystery then even better. Fairy tales are boring, so you need a source of conflict - either put H/G in conflict with each other (misunderstandings are fun since they're both easily angered) or have an external conflict (the classics are dark lords, kidnapping, other love interests, forgotten memories, disapproving family, war, illness, death, etc).

Read some annerb, Deadwoodpecker, hgfan1111, Northumbrian.. it's a deep genre but their stories stand out.

** I love Harry and Ginny. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][So far, I've done 20 H/G stories]] and I have so many ideas for more.

To me, Harry is someone who needs to be grounded and reminded that he's not the end-all-be-all that he occasionally thinks he is. Ginny is able to see right through him and call him on his bullshit when needed. Ginny is the release valve, someone he can rely on completely and his equal in attitude and ability. She's not waiting to be rescued or waiting for permission and Harry can like it or lump it.

They're both very strong personalities, both being Leos which brings fierce loyalty (and great hair. I might be a Leo myself), intense feelings and a flair for the dramatic, so those are things that I keep in mind when writing them. They both have a tendency to want what they want and woe to the one that thwarts either one of them. This can easily make them seem like jerks, but it's a good thing they're very charming. :D

**** Aw, my hero! :D Harry/Ginny gets kind of a lot of hate on this sub, but I adore them. Maybe whoever downvoted is getting tired of me linking my stuff, but I got a lot of it, so there you are.

** The same way you make (virtually) any pairing good/interesting: Don't do a shit job of it.
