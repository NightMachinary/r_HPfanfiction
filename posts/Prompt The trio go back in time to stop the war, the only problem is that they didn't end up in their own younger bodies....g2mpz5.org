Hermione ends up as Pansy Parkinson, Ron as Theodore Nott, and Harry as Draco Malfoy. They must try to help their other selves without revealing their nature.

Bonus points if Crabbe and Goyle, despite being denser than a brick wall, are somehow fully aware of them and call them Hansy, Theoron, and Drarry.


** First year:

'Draco' "Weasley, despite being in Griffindor I've never seen a worse coward"

"You take that back you filthy snake"

"Ok I'll take it back if... Hmmm... You manage to convince McGonagal that your rat is a wizard pretending to be a rat."

"You're on"

2 hours later, RoR:

"I can't believe that worked"

The Time Traveling Trio crossed "save Sirius" off the list.

Second year:

"Dad, are you trying to unleash something that you don't know what it does in a place where I, your only son and heir, go to school?"

"Ye-no"

"Just checking"

Later, the secret headquarters of TTT and totally not just a random broom closet:

"He still hasn't realised the diary has been replaced with a copy of Pride and Prejudice?"

"Nope"

"Huh"

Btw Dobby totally knows what's going on and is thrilled at there being two Harrys

Specifically section 9, article 3 of the Child Protection Act, which reads that disciplining children by withholding food is grounds for investigation by proper legal authorities? Huh, Potter? What about that?"

Pansy: "Can you believe that we have to share a classroom with someone as ugly as Granger? With her massive teeth that Madame Pomfrey can cure with an easy and safe charm, and her rat's nest of a hairstyle, which I'll bet even Sleakeazy's hair tonic wouldn't help.

********** Most wizards /are/ idiots. It's the failing of being able to wave a wand to complete most daily tasks. It causes one to strive and struggle for little which leads to a less expansive and adaptable thought process. If one can't accomplish a task easily with a wand they often times just forget about the possibility --- Patronus charm capability is supposed to be far and few between, yet Harry Potter was able to teach and encourage all the /DA/ kids into being able to perform it. They didn't just need encouragement from Harry but the clear and very real immediate threat that the Dementors around the school had provided. They believed they /needed/ to be able to perform the Patronus charm even if it was an incorporeal Patronus. Most wizards will not have such a situation where they /must/ be able to perform a spell outside of school requirements.

Half-bloods have an interesting perspective in being able to see both worlds from a familiar perspective that makes adaptation to both easy enough to prevent the stagnation often seen in wizard development and thought process.

If think about how the most powerful wizards in the series: * * Harry Potter --- Half-blooded * Albus Dumbledore --- Half-blooded * Tom Riddle --- Half-blooded * Gellert Grindelwald --- unknown if he is a pure blood or half-blood. Considering his knowledge about muggle history and current events during his time it would make the most sense for him to be half-blooded, having lived his early life with a foot in the muggle world. * Severus Snape --- Half-blooded. Honorable mention. I am unsure if I would consider Severus Snape to be one of the most powerful but he's certainly one of the most cunning in utilizing what power he does possess. He was able to keep up the charade with an intensely paranoid Voldemort for so long. I'm not sure if the Elder Wand bonding debacle that lead to his death was due to a failing on Tom's part of to Snapes manipulations leading Voldemort into believing the Elder Wand saw him as it's master as opposed to Snape.

**** Oh that sounds like my favorite part. I'm going with the concept of Harry being Nott and Ron being Draco mentioned above:

Harry woke up and felt /different/. Smaller, lighter. It had worked! But where was he? He looked up and above him were green drapes around a four-poster bed. He didn't recognize this place. Cautiously, he peered between an opening in the fabric and saw stone walls and other green drapery. Across from him, a teenage boy still slept under silvery blankets.

Suddenly, a loud noise crashed behind him. He jerked around and whipped open the curtains, reaching for a wand - where on Earth was it? - as he saw ...Draco Malfoy?

For it was Malfoy, eleven years old and tangled in blankets on the stone floor, with his comb, mirror, and various other items having apparently spilled off of his dresser and onto the floor around him.

/His dresser./ Harry looked around again and it clicked. Making an educated guess based on his brief time in the Slytherin common room in second year, he was now in the Slytherin dormitory. His jaw dropped as he and Malfoy stared at each other for a moment.

"Er...sorry. Uh, bad dream."

This was not what Harry was expecting at all and his eyebrows shot to the sky. Malfoy disentangled himself from the blankets, glancing around nervously and taking slow steps toward the trunk at the foot of his bed. He quickly pulled on some robes and rushed out of the room.

That was when Harry felt a quite uncomfortable sensation in his stomach. Something was very, very off here. He looked down at his hands. They looked strange and unfamiliar. First year had been a very long time ago, but he did not think he would not recognize his own hands. With trepidation he rose out of the bed, and bent down to pick up the fallen mirror, which was still in one piece probably due to an anti-shatter spell. Fighting the dread that continued to gnaw in his stomach, he looked down.

Theodore Nott's eleven year old face looked back at him.

(This is really fun - I could actually keep going, but gonna go ahead and share this.)

**** Hm, in an alternate reality or not? I don't like the alternate reality version of time travel because it implies no one is really saved in the original timeline.

But it would be cool if the fic flashed forward to Pansy, Theo, and Draco waking up in the corresponding bodies (or mix it up, why not) and figuring out what the heck is going on. At first, somehow, due to wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff, they live in the reality the trio left. But as the trio changes things in the past, their reality starts to change as well, but they retain their memories.

I could come up with some contrived reason why their future isn't automatically changed, if necessary. Throw some math in there or something to do with the phase of the moon.

Or not. Just throw them into the final results of the trio's changes, but reveal it bit by bit, while going back and forth in time.

Then, when the /original/ trio grow up (the versions that didn't come from the future) their consciousnesses eventually merge with or are replaced by with Pansy, Draco, and Theo.

On top of that, said parents would be very unhappy if their children behaved like little blood traitors, so that limits how proactive they could be.

**** If you come from the future, it's usually pretty easy to think of broad trendlines and make some money off of it. Just as a relevant example to today, imagine going back in time 1 year. Knowing that the coronavirus is a thing, you could /easily/ make back a lot of money in the stock market.

As for trades to children, they're wizards - if they're competent, it's not going to be tough to manage to disguise themselves. Or they could conduct it by mail - it's not like they wouldn't have enough funds for it.

Preserving the timeline can be useful in terms of letting you predict what will happen, as a devil's advocate. If you know, say, that if you don't change anything that Voldemort will be on Quirrel's head, maybe it's worth not shaking the boat and trying to capture the soul fragment when it's where you know it is - instead of messing things up, scaring it away, and now you have to hunt from scratch.

** Ooh...yeah... Some points i would love to throw...

- Drarry experiencing Snape's fervent biasing towards Slytherins...And for he knows Snape's sacrifice he suddenly put his arms around him , hugging him tightly.. PS- snape behelding a tinge of lily's eyes in drarry's

- Real Hermione getting jealous of Hansy knowing answer to every question in and out .They both raising hands higher than each other.

- And in the quititch matches , Drarry catching more snitches than Harry..

- Well they would obviously become good friends later ,the new and the old trio, in order to mend the past... Imagine drarry getting jumpers from Mrs weasley on Christmas..

- what about the scar though , Drarry sneaking into Harry's dormitory watching him wriggle in pain grasping his forehead...And he goes to harry , consoling him ...like " It's alright pal ! Pain demands to be felt!"

- I just thought about hippogriff , drarry would never drag this issue forward. And also revealing scabbers beforehand will save Sirius.

- With wormtail behind bars and barty crouch's secret revealed , voldemort will never come back... PS- cedric would be ALIVE...and the winner...

- The trio would still go on and kill all the horcruxes to remove all possibilities of voldemort's return. And the worst fear would be the 7th one that is harry...

- What if Lucius gets a hint and spoils the game...

- What if the evil outpowers the good and the new trio turns bad...for they knew the loop holes , so voldemort comes into power earlier , by philosopher's stone itself...

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

Really my main issue is the choppiness of the sequel. It's hard to have a coherent plot in such short segments.

********* I can't make the SPOILERS work either so any future readers beware please!

I guess I was kinda hoping for a more utopically happy ending, or was sad how C was so disassociated from being H in the end, and how the rest of the trio would be devastated for a loss that wasn't actually a loss (or maybe a half-loss, with the dissociation). I see the "a relationship requires honesty" point of view, but really felt like Nott wasn't more deserving of the truth than the others, if that makes sense? It was also weird to see C caring so much about the pureblood part of the society, but after spending so much time with them maybe that was inevitable.

As for an alternate ending: I was actually rooting for a merge of memories/personalities on both sides, like having a clone of yourself, in two different bodies and conspiring together.

Agree with the sequel on the plot aspect. I also wish we could've seen more of the developing relationships between the characters as well!

********** C was seven years removed from H. Seven years of emotionally distancing herself from H to preserve the timeline as much as possible to be able to identify and prevent the instigating instability and seven years of being drawn increasingly closer to the viper's breast.

C had the corpus of a pure blood Slytherin and in manner ways had to /become/ a pure blood Slytherin in order to stay in position to prevent the Incident. Seven years on her own, surrounded by people with varying levels of animosity, having to be increasingly ruthless and calculating to survive, unsurprisingly turned her into a person H's friends would not recognize. I'm not even sure H would recognize C in the end.

Then again, you-of-now might not recognize you-seven-years-removed.

Not really what anyone asked for, but Snape is (reincarnated?) into Harry's body and Harry into Dudleys. Snape actually refers to Harry as Hudley.

Regardless it's actually really good, if I can recall correctly, and the author has a really intresting writing style.
