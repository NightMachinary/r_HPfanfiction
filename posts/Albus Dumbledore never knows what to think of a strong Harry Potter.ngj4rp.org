In almost all fanfics, this is perhaps the most common theme.

/Albus didn't know what to make of this Harry Potter./

Cue comparison with Voldemort. All the ways he's similar and all the ways he's different.


** I think one of the most accurate depictions of bad Dumbledore is that he is scared of powerful wizards due to him not knowing whether his wand killed his sister (he's scared of his own power most of all). It's fucked him up.

I think they also say he /desires/ power, and is attracted to power, or at least is scared that he is, because he fell in love with Grindelwald. there is a bunch of guilt and unhealthy feelings of self hate that have become something different over the years: controlling his environment, having quite a lot of authority to keep people in check but not power for himself (or at lest he tells himself that), and you have him thinking that if Harry is this powerful and/or using the social capital and economic power within his grasp then he must be leaning to far on this false dichotomy of ‘light' and ‘dark'.

And honestly, I think that it's believable in essentials. He really hasn't had too many people talking sense at him for a long time, because they're in awe so they let him think and do what he wants (except people like Lucius Malfoy and friends, but they aren't healthy disagreement and discussion, they're actually terrible people) and he probably hasn't had counselling for the ‘I fucked/fell in love with an aspiring genocidal dictator and I liked it, what does that make me?'

I think it would be refreshing to see something else, but unfortunately I see too much truth in this interpretation here so even if I tone down the megalomaniacal cartoon Dumbles, he's still going to have control issues. Because he really thinks he's the only thing between ‘power hungry' tiny arseholes (students) and the thirst for power or whatever

And, you know, kids aren't very good at making consistently good decisions all by themselves. That's just a fact. you need to help them with that, to develop those decision making skills and social understanding; but I still argue that Andromeda Tonks was /right there/ and could have taught him how to be a person better than Petunia Dursley.

  Furthermore, Dumbledore never wanted Harry to become powerful. Harry was not supposed to become stronger than Voldemort. He was not supposed to win. Harry's role was to be as Snape put it, "a pig for slaughter". He was meant to die.
#+end_quote

I fucking hate this argument because it's just wrong. If Dumbledore really wanted Harry to die because of the Horcrux, he could have killed him at any time after Voldemort's return (maybe even before).

But he rather decided to created a way too complicated plan, going as far as predicting Harry's moves month after his own death, just to give him a chance to live.

**** ...I think the convoluted plan really didn't do anything to help Harry live, it just helped the book last a year.

Now, I don't think Dumbledore wanted Harry to die, but I think the text does point to him thinking he had to die until Goblet of Fire - where its clear that he is thrilled that Harry now had a lifeline.

****** I'd disagree with you on that. His actions and inactions prior to that are far better at grooming a child soldier and/or martyr than they are at producing a healthy, well-adjusted individual. We know for a fact that he knew Harry was being neglected and abused at #4 (or, if one stretches for a charitable interpretation, that he was willfully ignorant). There is no way someone of his skill and knowledge couldn't find a way to improve things with minimal effort.

Even if Dumbledore didn't know about Horcruxes specifically, he had already determined back in '81 that Harry was going to have to die and built his plans and decisions around that.

******** Where does this idea come from that Tom was abused/bullied/neglected? We see exactly zero evidence of that, but rather that even as a primary-schooler it was /him/ doing the bullying. Snape's background is far closer to Harry's than Riddle's is to either of them.

I didn't say that Harry's upbringing was perfectly tailored towards a child soldier, just that it was better suited for that (ten years of constant reinforcement that Harry had no value, for example) than for producing a healthy adult. Harry's upbringing taught him that he was worthless and unloved, while also making the wizarding world seem like his salvation. Also, the lack of any special training or preparation (aside from memory-watching in book 6) argues against "child soldier" but for "child martyr" - after all, if you know already that it's going to come down to Harry vs. Tom, but don't bother trying to give Harry any prep beyond standard Hogwarts classes, that's a pretty strong sign that you're not intending/expecting Harry to win.

  There is no reason for Harry having to die other than horcruxes. You may not have heard, but there was this prophecy...

  The matron in Charge of his care hated and feared his strangeness
#+end_quote

"Strangeness" is an odd way of putting "torturing/traumatizing fellow orphans and killing another's pet".

Also, you're still conveniently not addressing the fact that Dumbledore knowingly placed and kept Harry in an abusive environment when he could almost certainly have found a solution. /He/ placed Harry in that environment, and in so doing took responsibility for his wellbeing. Between gambling on abuse producing the right sort of dysfunction or gambling on it somehow producing a loving and heroic person, the latter seems a far worse bet to me, even if the former isn't particularly smart either.

Further, who's to say that only one dysfunctional outcome was of use? He could have planned for several different ways Harry could turn out.

************ You sure showed that strawman who's boss!

Your original argument was "Dumbledore didn't start planning for Harry to die until the end of book 2." I have countered that his canonical actions and inactions are more consistent with him having decided Harry would have to die substantially earlier, at least if one presumes Dumbledore to be anywhere near as competent as he is portrayed in canon.

Simply put, the decisions Dumbledore made between 1981 and 1997 mean that he cannot be both as competent and as benevolent as Rowling intended to portray him unless he was operating under severe limitations not evidenced in canon.

He could have been incompetent in the "not intelligent" sense, incompetent in the "mentally ill and/or senile" sense, or seeking to sacrifice Harry for any reason from "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one" to "Once Harry's out of the way and Tom's mortal again, I can defeat Tom."

My personal take is that he saw Harry's sacrifice as the most expedient means of ending the war for good and minimizing the loss of innocent life, but was happy to see that Harry could possibly survive sacrificing himself. I also view him as having a bad case of hubris, not trusting anyone else with power or information even when they needed that information, being a bit of a control freak, and not really taking counsel from others (quite possibly because he still sees most of them as the children he remembers them being).

***** Of course Dumbledore only had speculation, since Canon doesn't have any case of (recorded) living Horcrux until Voldemort. It doesn't change the fact that the whole plan of having Harry sacrifice himself was to give him a chance to survive, and that the alternative was certain death.

Here's what Canon say about it:

#+begin_quote
  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his
#+end_quote

body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died

for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives,

so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

“And you knew this? You knew -- all along?”

“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore

happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the

creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble

​

I won't deny that Dumbledore took some discutable decisions in Canon, but he made it pretty clear that he wanted to protect Harry. So you can either believe what he say in Canon, or decide that he lied and build a whole foundation of Fanon just to make him a bad guy.

  No good man would ever fuck up someone's life like that and nurture them like a lamb for slaughter, hoping that maybe they would survive in the end based on mere guesses.
#+end_quote

Voldemort is the one who fucked Harry's life, Dumbledore was the guy who tried to mitigate the damages. Did he do a perfect job? No, but at least he tried.

- It's because Voldemort killed his parents that Harry is an orphan.
- It's because there were still free Death Eaters that he had to grow up with shitty relatives
- It's because he is on the top of Voldemort shit list that he was forced to take part in the war
- And it's because Voldemort made an Horcrux out of him that he had to sacrifice himself

Take Voldemort out of Canon and Harry has an happy life, take Dumbledore out and it would be impressive for him to even survive long enough to attend Hogwarts.

********* I'm someone who thinks Dumbledore could've intervened a little more, but the Fidelius Charm wouldn't have prevented Voldemort from touching Harry and Harry certainly would've died before he turned 18, so everything wouldn't have been 10x betters

Dumbledore doesn't know Harry is a horcrux until the 2nd book. He knows Harry has to die in CoS. 2 years later he's feeling triumphant that Harry has a chance to live. So "raised him as a pig for slaughter" is off the mark. "Kept him alive to die at the right moment" is a little more accurate, but not entirely.

#+begin_quote
  But if Harry had had a happy life do you think that he would accepted to let himself get killed by Voldemort?
#+end_quote

Let's see what Harry says...

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it.
#+end_quote

The answer to your question seems to be yes, Harry would still walk to his death if he hadn't grown with the Dursleys because not living with the Dursleys wouldn't have prevented his friends and famiy's murders.

*** I like the first part of this comment, but I disagree from "Furthermore" onward.

Dumbledore was trying to arrange things so that Harry would /live/. He was glad that Voldemort used Harry's blood, and he set him on the path of the Hallows, because he knew Harry would have to face the killing curse again, and he wanted him to have the chance, however slim, of surviving again. And the plan worked! Harry died and returned!
