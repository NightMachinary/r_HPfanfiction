Ron and Hermione can be together, but Harry break up with Ginny and begins to enjoy the "Joys of life" and make use of his Wealth, partially also his fame and reputation. So, i dont want him to be like "Hey, Baby, im Harry Potter, the Boy-who-lived and conquerer of Voldemort. Dont you want to have a piece of this "Boy wonder"?". No macho-like or Womanizer Behaviour (but he wouldnt say no, if a Woman would ask him for a Night Stand). He is more the "quiet-type" and no Playboy, atleast not for the Publicity. He can be with Ginny, if she tolerates his Behavior (pretty hard to bare, im imagining), but i prefer him to be alone. However Hermione dont like his new Lifestyle and is annoyed at first, then angry. I dont know about Ron, maybe a bit of angry, Annoyed and "envy"? But anyway, Hermione do criticsize Harrys Behavior (what is actually non of her business) and ask him to find a nice Girl, make a family and live to the end of his life (thats what he always wanted to).

It would be nice, but no requirement, if she gets so furious or penetrant, that it can be hinted that she might have feelings for Harry, even detected and confronted by Ron. And if im following this Route, maybe Harry has feelings for her (one-sided, whether he keeps them for himself because he knows, that Hermione has Ron already or he confessed it to her, but she dont reciprocate) and he compensates this loss by sleeping with other Woman.


** Well there isn't a war or anything, but in my total AU story, Fight For Rights, my adult female Harry likes healthy casual sex, and she does and will do that with a fair number of people over the course of the story.

** He is doing exactly that after defeating Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), but he is not really happy. Ron and Hermione are not together in this fic.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
