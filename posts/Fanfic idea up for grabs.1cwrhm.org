Hey guys I'm a shit writer but an out of box thinker who would love to see his ideas becom fics but I don't have the time or talent to see it through.

Pm me or reply if you would like to work on my first idea:

What if Remus took his Wolfsbane (cause honestly could you see him not have it in his office) the night sirus is revealed in POA? Dementors swarm As soon as they leave the willow Remus transforms and try's to drag harry away from dementors and ends biting harry.


** Being a shit writer doesn't stop 99% of the people on fanfiction.net

I say go for it! =)

*** I became a ff.net writer just because of the shit writers there. I may be bad, but there's always someone worse.

** I've seen this done on ff.net plenty of times. If you think you have something new to add, go for it! Or if you just want to write and don't care that it isn't too original, go for it!
