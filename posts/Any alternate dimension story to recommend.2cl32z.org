** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is the obvious one as far as I'm concerned. Includes dimension travel and extremely well written. A lot of humor (had me cackling like Bellatrix at times - it was very melodramatic), adventure, and a healthy sprinkle of angst and drama.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8444317/1/How-Crap-TV-Saved-the-World][How Crap TV Saved the World]] is hilarious and should also be counted as such. Some very, /very/ twisted humor.

*** Seconded for Stages of Hope. It has good humour but is also pretty dark. The characterisations are especially believable.

*** From your recommendation, I finished Stages of Hope last night and /loved/ it. So thanks for that! I had read When A Lioness Fights before, but probably ignored SoH since it wasn't SS/HG... just a little obsessed.

** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]]. It was mediocre as a Hermione fangirl; you might enjoy it more if you ship Ginny/Harry.
