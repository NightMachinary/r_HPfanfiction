** This was pretty good! I really liked the script. Great origins! Will we eventually see Rowena Ravenclaw in Koldovstoretz?

*** Thanks for reading! I'm sure some of the grammar is off since I don't usually write scripts and it was a quick project but I appreciate it.

So in the outline I made for the whole season, Rowena shows up later during the dueling tournament with Durmstrang It leads to her having a bigger role in the second season.
