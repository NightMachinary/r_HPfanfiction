So I was just going through the crossovers between LotRxHarry Potter with the mind to read some /Harry Potter/Legolas/ but to my great disappointment I found very little. And the ones I did find were more with Harry being childlike or elfling and therefore has to be submissive in the ship. Though I don't have any problem with submissive Harry (which doesn't equate to childlike or elfling, cause when Harry comes off age their dynamic in the relationship can be quite different) but /shrugs/.

So this prompt is straightforward: 1. LotR/Harry Potter crossover. "Which most already gathered by this point" ðŸ¤£ 2. Harry Potter/Legolas Greenleaf (exclusive relationship). No Threesome/anything. With Harry being Top Or Dom or if submissive have a strong personality (which is to be expected after he fought in a war.) 3. Harry as the sole survivor or transported from HP world. 4. Other relationships can be anything, I don't have any opinions either way.

I would love if some do take up this prompt.
