:END:
Read it once and can't seem to find it again. It's a fic where in the final battle Voldemort is distracted dueling Dumbledore, and Harry hits him in the back of the head with a reducto killing him. Dumbledore gets gobsmacked with how easy it was to kill Voldemort, all his years of complex plans were completely unnecessary in the end.

Memory it's a bit vague here, but I think it was one of those "Harry goes back in time" fics, that's how Harry knew what to do to end it all easy.


** Anyone?

** Sounds an awful lot like Wind Shear linkffn(12511998). I wonder if one inspired the other. Harry and Voldemort are squaring off for their final exchange when Voldemort's head explodes. Bellatrix is standing behind him with a smoking wand.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
