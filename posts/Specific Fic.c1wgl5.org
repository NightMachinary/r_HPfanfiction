:END:
Hello everyone,

â€‹

Trying to remember this fic I read before but didn't finish. It was a post Hogwarts dystopian fic where Hermionie agreed to marry Draco in order to pass information back to the Order. While she's there, Hermionie's loyalty slowly swings towards Draco when she realizes that Mrs. Weasley sees her as not as important as her kids, and Ron impregnates Gabrielle. Does anyone know what I am talking about?
