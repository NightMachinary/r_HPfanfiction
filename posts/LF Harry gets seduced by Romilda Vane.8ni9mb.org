I take the base that Harry is with Ginny, like Canon. But Romilda never loses her (sexual) interest in Harry. The Fact that he becomes more and more attractive over the Years strenghtens her Desire. So the Circumstances how she approaches on him doesnt matter. Whether Harry and Ginny have a downfall of their Marriage (or relationship) or Romilda dose him with Love Potion or whatever.

There are only 2 Fics that i know, which contain such a scenario, "Lust in Lift", which can be considered as a "Snack" (because Harry gives in way to fast) and "Harry Potter and the Purification Device", although the Fic has Harry/Hermione.

Its actually not important, who Harry is with, as long as my Request is accomplished.

So, are there more Fics with this Critics?


** Uh, there's the famous "Harry F***ing Potter" (renamed to Whatever Happened to Bromance for FFN). One of the funniest stories ever.

  Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** You don't know Amortentia? Jeez. It's one of the best romance fics out there, mostly because it's centered around Romilda. [[https://nofile.io/f/WbbjZG9qu7n/Amortentia.rtf]]

Just created the link, dunno how long it will last.

EDIT: I know it's not EXACT, but it fills the brief pretty well. Ginny is still possessive about Harry, they have an altercation etc. etc. The only thing that is different is that it all happens in 6th year.
