Hey y'all!

Recommend me the best Luna Lovegood fics for the wiki. She has to be the main character or at least a main character. Romances are allowed.

Make sure to link using [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] (see the sidebar), and write a line or two about the fic. Please list pairings and whether the fic is still being updated as well.

Thanks!

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly looses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane.

** I really enjoyed /I Know Not, and I Cannot Know---Yet I Live and I Love/ by billowsandsmoke. It's a one-shot that explores the relationship between Luna and our favorite Potions Master, Professor Snape from when she joins Hogwarts to when he dies. I think Luna's quirky characteristic is on-point without making her stupid or crazy as many fics do, and Snape's characterization makes sense too.

linkffn(11923164)

Also, it's not a romance, so don't worry about that.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** "Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection" is one of the first novel-length fics I ever read in Harry Potter. It's Complete. No pairings (Beyond Luna having a crush on Ron).

It's Luna's perspective of /Order of the Phoenix/ and it was actually published *before* /Half-Blood Prince./

Excellent pacing, with an emphasis on Luna's loneliness at Hogwarts. The development of her friendships with Ginny, as well as an OC-roomate, are simultaneously very sweet, and very tender. There's also heavy emphasis on /why/ Luna is the the way she is, though I dare not elaborate further. It's best to be read.

** *Ron/Luna*

Of Bare Feet and Blibbering Humdingers - linkffn(11462379) - Fluffy post-DH Ron/Luna romance, after R/Hr fails.

Dark Comedy - linkffn(2686871) - Ron and Luna are both imprisoned by Death Eaters and are waiting to be put to death. Oneshot.

Disbelieving in Trees - linkffn(2345437) - Rom-com. Set in the context of Harry and Ginny's wedding.

Hands - linkffn(3081952) - Another rom-com. I remember nothing about this.

[[http://rwll-ficathon.livejournal.com/3045.html][Drifting]] - Fluffy Ron/Luna oneshot. This one's from Luna's PoV.

Other Ron/Luna fics can be found at [[https://rwll-ficathon.livejournal.com/][Red Moon Writings and Art]].

*Ginny/Luna*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4579602/1/Girls-Own-Adventure][Girls' Own Adventure]] - Makes Luna some sort of strange being. The writing has an almost dream-like quality to it, which makes me recommend it.

Camelopard Dreams - linkffn(12217386) - Some sort of magical creature attacks Luna. Ginny investigates. Only multichapter among this lot.

Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow - linkao3(10231472) - Old age Ginny and Luna.

cor aut mors - linkao3(9084976) - soulmate!AU, which I generally don't read, but this one approaches the social issue of not having a bondmark in a world in which everyone has one in an interesting way.

stories we tell ourselves - linkao3(7763677) - World war II AU. Ginny's a soldier, fighting against her family's wishes. Ginny's characterisation is lovely.

*Others*

Twelve dark Moons - linkffn(3037156) - Arabian Nights-esque Voldemort/Luna tale. Every night Luna has to find a new way to keep the Dark Lord from killing her. Has a rather normalized Luna, but essential for a story this long, I think.

Firebird's son - linkffn(8629685) - Well known Harry/Luna, among others. Interesting worldbuilding, meh characterization.

Silver Ivy - linkffn(8444898) - Sherlock/Luna. It has Sherlock and Luna as preteens living side by side in a random town before Luna moved to Ottery St Catchpole and Sherlock to London.

Beltane Pt. 2 - linkffn(5905066) - Lucius/Luna. Like all of the author's other stories, the writing is immersive and there's plenty of smut.

[[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1][Back to the Garden]] - Harry/Ginny/Luna. Some of the war stuff is dumb, but the relationship aspect is fairly good. Smutty. Register to read.

  Non-epilogue compliant. Four years after the war ends, Ron quits the aurors and moves back in with his parents. Luna has returned from her world travels, older, wiser and now her owl has low self-esteem. Oh, and Harry finds the whole thing hilarious. A Ron/Luna fic because it's weirdly perfect.

  Sometimes your spells will go bad. She knew that.Luna mounted the thestral to the Department of Mysteries. She put her name down for Dumbledore's Army. When they called her brave she smiled like she knew things that they didn't.She knew what she was getting into. She knew what she was doing. She drifted because she'd decided to drift, because she thought the best way to live on this earth was to tread softly. No matter how much she liked wrapping herself in whimsy, this was not a whim. It was a choice.When Harry was grieving Sirius, she took his hand. "Things have a way of coming back to you," she said, with no blankets to hide under, with no skipping rocks to hold in cold hands, to hurl away when they felt like they were holding her down. Luna had loss living in the pit of her stomach, yes and always, but she was the only one who got to decide what to do with that. She went out to visit the thestrals with strips of steak in her bag and loved the way their sloping wings looked against the sky.

It is a post-war/post-Hogwarts story that places Luna and Hermione at a magical university and they slowly develop a friendship which turns into a slowburn romance. Written from Hermione's PoV it is a great portrayal of Luna tearing down walls with her unique charm.

** Luna/Theo

Colubrina has a few stories with Luna and Theo Nott that I like. Most are short one-shots with the exception of "The Ones Who Ran", which is longer.

The Ones Who Ran [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11173524/1/The-Ones-Who-Ran]]

When the impossible happens and the bad guys win, would-be-heroes are thrown together with terrified partners in a plan none of them really want. "I know I'm part of what must be the worst day of your life," he said. "I know I'm the enemy. But, I swear, I'm not going to hurt you." Theo/Luna. Draco/Hermione. Blaise/Ginny.

Sunshine and Tomatoes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11573650/1/Sunshine-and-Tomatoes]]

Theodore Nott had every intention of ignoring the Marriage Law - the very idea the government could force him to get married was absurd - until Luna Lovegood smiled at him in the dingy office, tomatoes in her hair.

Mermish [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11068803/1/Mermish]]

When Luna Lovegood and Theodore Nott use the same tree to read under during her fifth year they become friends but can romance survive when you're on different sides of a looming war?
