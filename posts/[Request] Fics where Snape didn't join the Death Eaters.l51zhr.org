...that are Snape-centric.


** My absolute favorite is

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13092314/1/The-Gates-of-Azkaban]]

It's a sequel so it's worth reading the first part first. This fic has some bad tropes, but it rises so far above them it's insane. Really worth giving a shot.

** I also wants to know of them. The only one that comes to mind that I know is linkffn(If Someone Cared Enough) and that fic has serious filler issues (a ton of stuff that doesn't really drive the plot at all).

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10784808]])

There's also 'a life of smoke and silvered glass'. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669]]). He joins the Death Eaters as a spy for the light from the very beginning so he's not really a Death Eater.

  HP AU. In a world where Tom Riddle was slaughtered, the wizarding wars did not occur, and Albus Dumbledore promoted peace in Hogwarts, Lily Evans and Severus Snape did the impossible: they remained lifelong friends. Snape meets his potential, and has a shot at happiness along the way.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)
