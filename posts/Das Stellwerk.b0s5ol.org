** Honestly, it sounds like a brothel, and I am saying that as a German. I get what implication you are trying to go for, but no club for respectable men would choose that kind of name. First of all, the name is way too short to work as anything but a "nickname". Second of all, I doubt that magical people are really into railroads that much to go for that analogy.

And perhaps most importantly, if you have a story set in Germany you have to come up with some history of magical central Europe and the corresponding border changes since it makes no sense that the magical government would have split up in east and west or even followed any change after the initial reunification under Bismarck. Which might not even have happened since the factors which broke up the HRE (Napoleon, the Reformation) are kinda irrelevant to the magical folk so that should still be around. Likewise, the expulsions from Prussia and Silesia would not have happened to those who had magic.

*** Well, I will have to say that I reserve my right to disagree. First of all it is going to be placed into magical Brittany.

It will have to do with a bit of history to get the German claims to be right but I do see reasons such as German being the language for science in the 19/20 century till the 2 WW. Also I intend to make the club old enough that the railway will have been important to the people. Even wizards as it is also to be supposed to be somewhat forward

Wizards have no need for trains. They can instantly blink across 500 miles, either through their own ability or through charmed items. Yes, the Hogwarts Express is a thing, but children cannot apparate and the Floo can be done wrong pretty easily. But adults, especially the elite?

***** The railway has been a most important part of the world for 200 years so I doubt that it will have gone past them. After all the could have found another solution for the express

Also I like to think that the backwardness of today's wizards is somewhat new. They might have been somewhat on paar with the muggle world up until the 1900. Anyhow there will have been business wizards that would have dealt with it. Also it could have been one wizard that created the place with the knowledge and the rest didn't care to change the name

That ties in nicely if you go for the "scientific language" part.

** Well, a couple of questions:

What services does the club offer? That decides what staff is on hand. Are there Escorts/Courtesans or just waiters? Some sort of "Concierge" organising all sorts of things? Is there a cook? Or a sommelier?

How does the club make money? Member dues? Or services? Entrance fees? Food and drinks?

Who owns the club? An individual, or an association? What kind of people are they? Do they use the club like Slughorn merely to socialise and network, and make deals, or is there a more sinister side to it? Information brokering? Or ties to criminals? Strictly "neutral ground", or biased? Did Germans fleeing Grindelwald found refuge at the Club? Or Grindelwald's followers fleeing Europe after his defeat?

What's the club's stance on blood bigotry?

What kind of security does the club have?

There are a number of ideas that wouldn't fit certain takes on the club.

*** Well first of all kind of services

Offices that you can work from if you wish, halls that you can dine in, cellars that you can taste sitting by the fire if you get the spin.

I am not sure about the money aspect but I might want to place it as a original set up of money that since here collected money by interest and giving. Owner of the club might be a bit unclear and for the story not important

For the people, it's famous people. A few politicians, some scientist as far as that goes in the wizard world. Some interlectualts. And old money which goes together with buissenes men.

It's all sort of place. For networking, deal making (there are extra rooms for that as it would be against the rules to do that out in the open club since it's neutral ground)

The club ist older than Grindelwald. But it is open not only to the English therefore some German wizard used the club to flee.

The club is for the forward thinking, a hub of new ideas but also mostly intended for people to not feel the attention as on the outside

The club isn't known outside the members and therefore has no storefront. Also it cherry pics all members for the benefit of the club. Therefore bigotry is not relevant

**** I would think the owner of the club is of utmost importance. Given the size of Wizarding Britain (pretty much a small town, not larger), this club pretty much is the heart and head of the country - everyone important will be meeting there. So, who controls who gets invited? Who listens to the deals? Who ensures there's no assassinating done? Who stocks the cellars? The club owner is incredibly powerful in the country. If you run afoul of him or her, you're pretty much finished it seems. So, yes, you should decide who runs it. And what Slughorn's relationship to them is - he's the quintessential networker, after all.

Also, at which time does Slughorn take Harry there? If it's after the war, Hermione and Ron should be with them - the trio pretty much saved the country. If it's during the war, you need to decide how the club reacted to Voldemort. If the club's powerful enough to keep Voldemort at bay and guarantee its neutrality, that's a huge change in the balance of power. If it isn't, what happened to it during Voldemort's reign? If bigotry isn't important, the club's an enemy to Death Eaters merely by not bowing to their bigotry (and, Hermione pretty much would get an invite any way as the brightest student of her generation and a war hero - anyone with a brain can see that she, far more than Harry, is the kind of witch the club is seeking: Smart, passionate, willing to work to change and reform things.)

***** It would not help the club if people knew who the boss is. And since it's not only England I think it would be possible for them to not know

Also most people do not know the club exist. Slughorn knows of it because he is such a great networker. He knows every one in magical brittan that has achieved something. And one might think that he knows people over the borders.

Also if the whole trio would be invited it would water it down. The idea is Harry gets the invitation also due to some inheritance from his parents. Altho not overly much, quite a modest amount.

As for the time it is when Hermione is in Australia with Ron to get her parents. Why without Harry i am working on

Hermione might get a invitation. Altho to a later achivment and not because of grades. If for that Tom would have been invited as well.

All in all no more than 200 People know of the club. And that is a small number if you over see the somewhat unrealistic and changing implications of numbers of wizards we get from the books and films

****** Why would people trust a club run by someone they don't know? Trust them with their secrets and plans, mayhap their secret desires? "Mysterious Patron, just trust him" is not how smart and powerful people run. Certainly not in a country that had two civil wars in 20 years.

200 people is huge in the Wizarding World, especially if focused on Britain.

If beating Voldemort is not enough to get an invitation for Hermione and Ron, but Quidditch Stars get an invite, then the club's obviously bigoted (or whoever makes the calls - you haven't answered that either - is stupid.)

Even if the secrecy works, Voldemort would have been told by one of his spies, and Dumbledore will have known about it for certain - he would have been a member or the entire club is a farce. And that would have had consequences during the first and second wizarding war.

******* They would not do that. I think you don't understand the kind of club. It's not like you sit there being served by someone that ist listening to what you say.

If the Diogenes Club tells you anything you'll understand.

And 200 is not a lot. Even for brittan. There are multiple parts in the books that indicate that there are a lot more wizards than one might think for some reason. Only think of the very first book in the beginning where we live a day with Vernon.

The amount of wizards that are mentioned and implicated alone would have to be more than a few thousand.

Remember he noticed wizards on the street and quite a lot of them. And that is in a town that we don't know a lot about but, it won't be a singular incident. Therefore in that town alone there would have to be a few hundred wizards

Then there is quidditch. Alone that there are a few teams mean that there are quite a lot of wizards there

******** You don't talk about secrets and deals in a place owned by someone you don't know. Certainly not after 2 civil wars in 20 years. You don't even meet in such a place when you're not sure if the owner wants you dead. I don't get why no one would know or care about the owner's identity.

And who decides who's trusted with the secret, aka gets an invitation?

Also, how is the secrecy ensured? Are members expected to lie to their families and sneak out for meetings? Or do they know that mum's in a club, but not which? Either way, the families will know something. And they'll talk to others.

Not to mention I don't get why the club would be a secret in the first place, if nothing embarrassing is done there. It's not a brothel, after all, just a private club. Such clubs are generally not secret like a cabal in the real world. There's no reason to hide it, or its members.
