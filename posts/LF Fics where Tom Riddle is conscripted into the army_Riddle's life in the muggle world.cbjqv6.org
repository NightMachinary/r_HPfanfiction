Just read "Letters to Walpurgis" by Megii of Mysteri OusStranger and I'm really in love with the idea of Riddle trying to avoid discovery and survive in the war effort and how his disappearance in the wizarding world might affect canon events.

I'd appreciate any recommendations for similar war-themed fics or any fics that go into detail on his life in the muggle world in the summers between Hogwarts. Thank you! :)


** Here's a Captain America crossover where Tom gets captured by Hydra and winds up fighting in the war: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]]

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380/chapters/39160087][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) deals a whole lot with Tom's muggle and war time trauma. It's pretty dark tho, it deals with some pretty heavy topics like sexual abuse, religion, and ptsd, so don't read if you find any of those too much to talk about.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.
