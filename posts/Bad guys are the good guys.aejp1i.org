Looking for fics where the death eaters are revolutionaries more then terrorists. This will likely involve a saner Voldemort, though he could have been driven insane by dark magic and let his original goal be changed. Pretty much any fic where harry decides to side with Voldemort, or even just his followers if Voldemort is dead or too insane to be saved.


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) fits this criteria. It's an AU where Voldemort won and is ruling wizarding Britain. He is still not a good person, but he is a good leader and builds a society that works well even if some things in it are somewhat unethical. The fic is from the perspective of the death eaters so they are the "good guys" even if they are not particularly good or light.

Dumbledore's order had flee to Europe after they lost the first war. The are the antagonists of the fic and sometimes end up in the role of "terrorists" who attack Hogwarts and surrounding area in opposition to Voldemort.

Harry's parents run away to Europe after the prophecy was made so Neville was targeted and killed instead. Harry ends up in Britain after his parents are killed in a burglary and becomes Voldemorts protege at Hogwarts. He doesn't fully support Voldemort and is still a good and righteous person at heart but he is on Voldemorts side throughout the fic.

*** A Black comedy is one I've always meant to read but kind of managed to fall to the bottom of my virtual pole of books. I'll dig it back up and give it a read.

Limpieza de sangre is probably one of my favorite fics. I remember having trouble getting into the sequel, but I'll give it another look and see if its improved in the past months.

Seventh Horcrux: I see this one recommended a lot and I read a good portion of it, but I usually prefer my fics to have a more serious tone to them.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and kidnaps Harry at the end of year 1. He returns to his original goal of revolution to improve the wizarding world. (Dumbledore antagonist) linkffn(11358664)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - In year 4 Harry discovers that Dumbledore has been using legilimency to control him. He begins to research the previous war and realizes that most of what he thought he knew was propaganda. (Heavy Dumbledore and Ron bashing, but some interesting world building.) linkffn(8163784)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL Slytherin!Harry fic that is currently midway through book 5. Harry starts out being against Voldemort and the Deatheaters, but he slowly realizes that their goals are more sensible than he has been lead to believe, and by the end of book four he knows that Voldemort is not the psychotic sadist the light portrays him as. First book in the series is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]. (Dumbledore and James Potter antagonists) linkao3(12608820)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] - Hermione is transported to an alternate universe in which Riddle and his pureblood allies are literally revolutionaries working against the cruel tyrannical regime lead by Dumbledore. (Almost everyone on the 'light' side in the original series is an antagonist in the alternate universe) linkffn(4025300)

And here are some in which Voldemort wins his revolution to reshape the world to his idealized vision:

  Voldemort wins and discovers his human horcrux. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, Harry deals with new Pureblood regulations, vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks and worst of all, Tom Riddle's mocking voice whispering inside his head. A story about two arch-enemies. AU dystopia. No slash. Minor het tensions.

  Voldemort found out about the Horcrux in Harry's head, leading to devastating consequences. A magical curtain cloaks itself over Europe, separating Riddle's empire from the rest of the world. But who actually rules it?

Voldemort isn't a blood purist, but is still a murderer/terrorist. Currently (midway through 5th year) Harry is neutral between Voldemort and Dumbledore.
