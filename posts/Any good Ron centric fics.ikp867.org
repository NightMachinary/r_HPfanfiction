** Have I got a /list/ for you! Some are ongoing while others are completed, and some are oneshots. I will put down which ones are oneshots and which are not. I'm linking them, since the fanfic bot is like, really bad at linking things, and has a limit which is very very sad. I will have to reply to this comment as well haha, since it won't allow me to link every single on of my recs on one comment. Anyway, here we go!

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21926938]]) is an 18000 word oneshot with an extremely interesting take on the "Ron is Dumbledore" theory. It's incredibly written.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20796065]]) is an adorable 1000 word oneshot where Ron is a Gryffindor dad and realizes none of his dorm mates have had a wizard father to teach them how to shave.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916]]) is a 10000 word oneshot which is Harry-centric, but Ron is an integral good boi in the story; the Trio are about 27 and it's after the War, but Harry gets de-aged back to 17 years old and his memories regress with his age.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24399721/chapters/58858189]]) is a completed four chapter muggle breakfast club AU. It's a fun read, and a definite interesting take on each of the characters.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20414137/chapters/48425305]]) is an ongoing fic centered which each of the Trio being a MC, and each of the Trio being one of the Founders reborn. It's only four chapters in, but proving to be extremely interesting.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403/chapters/60244423]]) is an ongoing time traveling Ron story, where he goes back in time after things go terribly wrong after the War.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) is an ongoing story where Hermione reaps what she sows; the aftermath of her assault on Ron in HBP and the proper consequences.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883/chapters/28127856]]) isn't so much Ron-centric is Trio-centric, but has them all as main characters and each has an important story arc. It is Dark Trio, where they do a dark ritual and end up in Tom Riddle's school days, and make a plan to overthrow him.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5002396/chapters/11493229]]) is an ongoing Slytherin Ron story, where Ron is Sorted into Slytherin and it changes a lot of things. Slytherin has a chance to redeem itself.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is a 16000 word oneshot where Ron, constantly overshadowed by his brothers, is Sorted into Slytherin due to his ambition and makes friends with Blaise and Tracey instead of Harry and Hermione.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20410870]]) is a 5000 word oneshot where a Slytherin Ron changes the Slytherin House for the better. Pansy and Ron friendship, something you didn't know you needed.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22321174]]) is a 2000 word oneshot where it isn't Ron-centric, but Weasley-centric; exploring if all of the Weasleys had been Sorted into Slytherin.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22625575]]) a 1000 word oneshot in which Ron is Sorted into Slytherin and remains friends with Harry.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003/chapters/37858082]]) an ongoing fic where, "Draco Malfoy's dying wish, or command really, had Ron traveling back in time to their first year at Hogwarts to rewrite their history and save lives. If he knew what Ron planned to change, however, Draco probably would have died with his secrets clamped behind his teeth."

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23781994]]) is yet another 2000 word oneshot in which Ron is a Slytherin and will not let his House go to the Dark side.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24003130/chapters/57742339]]) is an incredibly written ongoing fic where the summer before 6th year, Ron is Turned. Dealing with teenage insecurities and Voldemort isn't the only thing on his mind now that he's a vampire.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24135646/chapters/58112131]]) is an ongoing fic in which fem!Harry is Sorted into Slytherin and Ron, ever the loyal friend, follows.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23880769/chapters/57407875]]) is a completed work where it fills in the blank of where Ron went when he left Harry and Hermione during the Horcrux Hunt.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24737485]]) is a 3000 word oneshot in which Ron is very slightly a Seer and knows whenever Harry is in danger.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22002562/chapters/52504813]]) is a completed canon retelling...except Ron-centric, Harry/Ron, and with soulmate marks.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024/chapters/56143537]]) is a hilarious ongoing Draco/Ron romcom after the War. I'd give it a try even if you're not into the pairing; it's written so incredibly well.

*** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

*** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15978848/chapters/37274108]]) is a 3000 word two-shot; "This is the story of Ron Weasley, and his not so insignificant amount of brains."

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a 5000 word Ron whump oneshot, in which Ron returns to Hogwarts after something terrible has happened to him. Non-graphic sexual assault, but just a warning in case.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19072957]]) is a 4000 word oneshot where Ron discovers and consequently falls in love with the world of comic books.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6818956]]) is a short but sweet 600 word oneshot where Harry is Sorted into Slytherin and Ron argues with the Sorting Hat.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/849348/chapters/1623072]]) is an ongoing Slytherin Ron fic with Evil Weasleys trope and a fantastic friendship with Harry.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044/chapters/1859698]]) is an incredibly well written completed aftermath of the War fic, Ron-centric but with Draco redemption and Draco and Ron friendship.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is not all Ron-centric, but incredible with a series of "what-ifs" addressed in each work. Each work is about 8000+ words. Def a good read.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1047850]]) is a 9000 word oneshot in which Ron comes to a realization about himself after the War. Harry/Ron

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421695/chapters/12527003]]) is a completed three-shot in which Ron is a stubborn prat and when Harry is Sorted into Slytherin, Ron follows him into the snakepit.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5635036]]) is a 3000 word oneshot with Ron whump and an eating disorder.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a 7000 word oneshot with Ron whump. Incredible self hate and whump.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23036404/chapters/55089451]]) is completed and not Ron-centric; it's Harry-centric, a Drarry romcom, but Ron has incredibly funny and good moments in this story. I'd check it out even though it's not Ron-centric.

#+begin_quote
  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11768072/1/Rise-of-the-Weasley-Famiglia]]) is an ongoing story in which the premise is Ron becomes a crime boss. The first chapter is amazing, though sadly there is only one chapter and it was published in 2011.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia]]) is a completed fic where, "Ron grieves the loss of his brother and tries to figure out life after the war while trying to navigate his new relationship with Hermione." Very well-written. Incredible plot.

Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/Ginger-s-Second-Chance]]) is an ongoing, kind of crack-ish tale where Ron, jaded and tired from his terrible relationship with Hermione and Harry, goes back in time to alter things. 20,000 words and two chapters are up.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel]]) is an ongoing story that isn't Ron-centric, but Ron plays a major role. After an accident where Arthur is left comatose and Molly is left dead, Percy has to take care of the family. Incredibly written.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/Eternal-Sunshine-of-the-Scourgified-Mind]]) is a completed fic where, "The trio have defeated Voldemort but paid a devastating price.How can they cope without each other and without any magical memories?" As a note, Soltice Muse is amazing, especially as a Ron writer. I'd go through her many, many stories for good Ron-centric fics.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/Voleur-D-%C3%A2me]]) is a completed Ron fic. SI merged with Ron. It's actually incredible.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13568095/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrayal-of-Betraying-Betrayers]]) okay so this one is completely Harry-centric, but it's a hilarious oneshot. I really think it's worth a read.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9742543/1/Boys-Round-Here]]) this one is ongoing and extremely funny. "With Sirius Black on the loose, Harry and Ron arrive for their 3rd year as rambunctious, loud, obnoxious teenagers. Sounds normal. Why, then, is Albus Dumbledore so worried?

** Just going to put in my two cents, sorry if you don't care about it but I have a fic which is Ron-centric.

​

It's call Blood Child (Complete) With sequel

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20096458/chapters/47601373]]

When a rogue vampire turns Ron Weasley into a vampire the summer before his third year at Hogwarts, Ron finds himself stuck between his status as a vampire and as a wizard. He gains a mentor, an intimidating man named Donovan who expects more effort than he's ever had to put forth before. Donovan also has more to him than meets the eye.

He becomes caught between his new senses, learning vampire etiquette, and attempting to keep Harry from getting killed. As usual for the sidekick of the boy who lived (or maybe not?)
