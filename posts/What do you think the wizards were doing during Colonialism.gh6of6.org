/A "newly discovered" land somewhere in the world. A large wooden ship just anchored near the shore and a handful of explorers step of their boat./

EM: What's this? Witchcraft! Demons!

European wizard: Obliviate. Hey guys, you aren't allowed to use magic to defend yourself. You see, we've got this thing called Secrecy where those without magic aren't allowed to know it even exists.

NW: Unacceptable!

EW: It's better for everyone this way.

NW: Better for you, maybe. Your nonmagicals have fire sticks that go boom! Our people are dependent on their medicine man, they can't live without us!

EW: I wasn't asking. /Gets out wand./

Your whole village is forced to endure backbreaking chores only to die young from exhaustion, then comes a letter and a wizard that can simply confound the muggle colonist to free your and everyone you know. Do families/villages with Muggle-born get erased from the muggle colonist record and led a peaceful life apart from others, ignoring their friends and families elsewhere, or perhaps the kid got kidnapped on the first display of magic?

You're assuming that those figures are real wizards.

It could equally be the case that Native American wizards operate in secrecy, with there being plenty of Muggle spiritual leaders who profess to have supernatural powers without having magic.

To contrast with the European equivalent: I don't think anyone has suggested that in the HP universe, the Christian saints were wizards, or that their various supernatural feats were real magic.

****** Wizards in Europe lived in secrecy long before any kind of persecution of magic took place. As early as 1398, the British Wizard's Council was passing laws forbidding wizards from playing quidditch anywhere near Muggle settlements. Witch hunts didn't become a thing until 1450 - 1750, with the vast majority of them taking place towards the latter end of that era.

Persecution was not the primary motivation for secrecy (we know that very few wizards were actually caught by witch hunts, and in any event, could generally escape unharmed). Additionally, wizards practised informal secrecy long before the Statute of Secrecy came into effect. Per Hagrid in PS, the main reason for secrecy is that wizards don't want Muggles asking them to do magic.

On three other hand many fics go on about the horrible prosecution of wizards around the year 900 or whenever Hogwartswas founded and that's just really dumb. If ppl are going to add in history, they could at least have a general idea..

** I think the answer to this basically turns on 2 questions:

1. Do wizards engage in colonialism themselves, or is it just Muggles that are doing it? (joint colonialism/Muggle colonialism)

2. What is the relationship between the Muggle and magical state? (divergent/parallel)

This then gives you four different possible outcomes, depending on the answers.

*Joint colonialism + divergent states*

In this scenario, wizards and Muggles engage in colonialism together, with wizards assisting in Muggle conquests of the New World.

However, the magical societies established in the colonies are independent from the Muggle ones. Therefore, when Muggle empires fall, magical ones may continue (and vice versa).

This option gives you the most leeway to create some interesting magical political geography and to engage in all your neo-imperialistic wet dreams.

However, the biggest question it has to answer is: how were European wizards able to conquer the rest of the world so effectively? It also has to answer the question of why wizards waited to conquer the Americas, given that they knew of the Americas existence long before the Muggles did.

The other big question is how divergent political geography is dealt with. Over time, wizarding and Muggle populations would become so divergent that they might even be speaking different languages.

In terms of canon support, joint colonialism has mixed support. We know that there was a Quidditch World Cup where "New Spain" entered a team. It would be unusual for native Mexican wizards to refer to themselves as "New Spain", which implies some level of wizarding conquest of the Spanish main.

However, against that view, it seems that in the rest of North America things were quite different, with Native American wizards peacefully integrating into MACUSA.

*Joint Colonialism + parallel states*

In this view, joint colonialism happened as above, but when the Statute of Secrecy was signed, wizards collectively decided to put wizarding solidarity and cooperation to achieve secrecy above their nation.

In the name of secrecy, when Muggle borders changed, magical borders would follow suit. This is the basis by which wars between wizarding nations are put to an end: their borders are now dictated by parties over which they have no control. It is considered necessary because any large scale war between wizarding nations would surely be noticed by Muggles.

Thus, when Muggle empires expand, magical administrations expand with them. And when they fall, so too do their equivalent magical administrations withdraw from those territories. This ever-changing administrative geography is stabilised by international cooperation at the ICW-level, resulting in a fairly standardised approach to wizarding government around the world, with global freedom of movement and things like (after GoF) standard cauldron bottom thickness rules.

This approach delivers a wizarding political geography and demographics closest to the real world. It is also finds a reasonable amount of canon support in the fact that American and British wizards did not participate in the American Revolutionary War, with the respective governments agreeing to put kind over country.

The biggest question this approach has to answer is: would wizards really sit by and watch as their Muggle compatriots are conquered and oppressed? Would wizards really just calmly accept rule by foreign wizards in the name of secrecy?

To the extent that the answer to this is "no", however, that is not necessarily a problem: rather, it creates interesting tensions which can lead to conflict and thus good stories. And we know that on at least one occasion (World War 1), wizards were /not/ able to just sit and watch.

*Muggle colonialism + divergent states*

In this situation, only Muggles would have colonised. Wizards have independent states and therefore would completely ignore Muggle colonialism. Therefore in the present day, the magical geography of the Americas would be extremely different and would be dominated by Native American wizards.

The big question this has to answer is: would wizards really sit by and calmly watch the genocide of their Muggle compatriots and the complete destruction of their societies?

Besides that, the biggest problem for this position is that it doesn't really fit well with canon. From what we see of MACUSA, native Americans are far from dominant. Magical New Spain existed, as described above.

*Muggle colonialism + parallel states*

In this situation, only Muggles would have colonised, but in deference to wizarding secrecy, wizards would adjust their borders to match.

This would produce a situation where borders match the Muggle ones but demographics do not - Native American wizards, having never been conquered by European wizards, would still be the dominant demographic in North America. But they would exist within an administrative framework which mirrors the Muggle world's borders.

This scenario faces the same questions as Muggle colonialism + divergent states (namely, whether wizards would really sit by and watch as their Muggle cousins were wiped up and subjugated) but also asks an additional question: would those wizards not only watch the genocide of their cousins, but then follow up with the statement "Well, I guess you rule us too now" - without ever giving fight?

This, I think, stretches the Statute of Secrecy to breaking point, and I consider it the least plausible of the 4 scenarios.

*** Explorers knew most of the coasts by the late 1600s when SoS was created, but most inland areas where the native people lived were unexplored. Nobody (European) set foot on New Zealand until 1769. Wyoming wasn't discovered until 1807. The Australian Outback was still mostly unknown by the 1870s, 200 years post SoS. There's still a few uncontacted tribes in the Amazon rainforest today who hunt with bow and arrow.

There's also a huge variation of how people lived before contact with the rest of the world. There were plenty of pretty advanced civilizations around the world during the age of exploration, and when it comes to those I largely agree that their wizards probably already had some system to seperate themselves from the nonmagicals in place. Japan, China, India were pretty advanced. The Aztecs had a massive empire. But there were also plenty of people who lived in relatively small tribes, and there things would probably be different.

It should be noted that all religions have a concept and perspective on magic both positive and negative. Like the prompt said, some would be considered medicine men.

Firstly, if your basis for superiority and the classification of "savage" is brutality than it adds nothing to your initial position. Brutality is intertwined with humanity, and certainly doesn't undermine their ability to respond to wider threat as you weirdly implied. Secondly, cannabilism was practiced to a degree (agreed upon as not being significant for the most part) amongst the Aztecs, but not amongst the entirety of the Americas (and the rest of the colonised world either) and further Europe is no less brutal by any means (and has itself past history of cannabilism). Finally, the Aztecs is quite literally civilisation in the historical sense and is frankly fascinating.

Because you just know that a ton of them must have straight up refused to bend the knee.

I also headcanon that Magical nations don't (or at least very rarely) match their borders, culture, and even tongue with the Muggle counterpart existing on their territory. As such, I see Natives being much more dominant in Magical Americas than in the Muggle world. And Africa much more deeply rooted in their original cultures and unaffected by Colonialism than the real, Muggle one. So on and so forth.

** I don't buy that the SoS was somehow forced on the rest of the world by Europeans. In real life, Europe conquered the world, but I don't think there could be such a big disparity in military technology when both sides have magic. Wizards in the rest of the world probably had similar problems to the witch burnings and such in Europe, and voluntarily separated themselves from their muggles. Then colonialism just happened on the muggle side, and wizards weren't affected, since the muggle imperialists didn't know about them.

This /seems/ very wrong of the magical world to do, but maybe in the long run muggles were better off without wizards. Look at what the world was like before 1700--basically every agricultural society in the world had been some form of feudalism for thousands of years. There was no growth, no long-term improvement in the average persons' material quality of life, just grinding poverty for the masses and relative luxury for the parasitic ruling class. And in a world where magic exists, it seems likely that wizards and witches either were this ruling class, or were at least their enforcers. If 'native' wizards had happily cooperated with their muggle societies for their mutual benefit pre-SoS, the world before 1700 would have looked completely different.

** Personal headcanon (and canon for my current fic which I haven't abandoned):

Potterverse-style magic was invented about 1200 years ago in the hopes of withstanding the Saxon invasion. Magic exists elsewhere (and existed before), but it's a lot subtler.

Over the centuries, this style spread, but slowly. The closer a place was to England (both geographically and culturally), the more wand-magic it has. This is why England, France and /Africa/ have one magic school each.

Traditional magic stands outside the statute of secrecy. There are tons of websites telling you how to unlock your magical potential. Some of them are even accurate.

** Haha, that was a nice read. Though it would mean that European wizards would be a lot more powerful than others, how could that be explained?

We have enough plotholes in canon time and therefore bringing the history of the world into it is a little insane, I think. The most likely theory in my opinion would be that Nundus killed the entire wizarding population of Africa (at least), because I cannot even think that the wizards there would let something like the Colonialism happen as it did.

*** Well, considering that pretty much everyone we see uses wands even if they could probably do it without, it means that wands are simply really good. And if for example Native Americans didn't have wands it wouldn't be a very fair fight.

**** But wands are not some great technology. You need one person to male them from scratch and the art of wandmaking does not develop any further. There is no way that knowledge would have been this big of an advantage for longer than a generation or two.

** Seeing as how many Natives were torched and whole villages wiped out, and knowing that intense abuse can leave wizards unable to produce stable magic (if at all), it's safe to say many Magical Natives were left broken or at the very least had trouble with their powers.
