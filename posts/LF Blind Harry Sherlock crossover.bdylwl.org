I read a Sherlock/Hp Crossover story where Harry was blinded by Dudley then he's found by Sherlock and Watson and they take him with them and raise him. I think it was incomplete or abandoned but it was a great story and I want to read it again.


** I read one where Harry got "clue vision", which was a kind of minor gimmick (not abused, anyway). But I don't remember the name. And Harry had his sight.

  On the night his parents were murdered, a prophecy was invoked and Harry Potter's Fated Destiny was set in stone. Stone is not unbreakable though and a child's flesh and bones are far more delicate... It only takes a single accident to unravel Life's Tapestry when the stone dictating Harry's Destiny is shattered beyond repair. HP/LL
