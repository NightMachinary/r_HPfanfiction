No friendships with Weasleys or Hermione. Bashing allowed, perfer no slash


** Linkffn(3676590) this has Harry befriend Luna during his second year due to both Ron and Hermione getting petrified; it's sadly abandoned but I love the way Luna is presented in this story.

  Circumstance victimizes Harry one more time, as both Hermione and Ron are petrified during second year. Of course, coincidence just happens to pitch in as well. "Figglenorf got your tongue?"
