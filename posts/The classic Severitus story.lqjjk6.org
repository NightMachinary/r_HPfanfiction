I have checked other posts askinfg for similar stories but didn't quite find what I was looking for.

I am looking for a classic Severitus story in which changes start happening to Harry on his birthday and it goes from there.

Would prefer Voldemort to only play a minor role or none at all. (but doesn't have to)

Neither Severus nor Harry should end up dead at the end.

If Harry is paired with someone at some point I don't want the person to be Ron or Ginny.

No Harry being terminally ill.

No Harry runaway story.

Apart from that anything goes. (Note: I have read Blood Magic by Gatewaygirl)


** I may suggest (but I don't know if you already read them)

-Crime and Punishment by Melocatsi : First Severitus fan fiction I read and first hp fan fiction that I ever read- To me one of the best.

Snape being Snape -a little cruel sometimes Here Harry is GREAT. He's angry, desperate. It gradually becomes Severitus. Unfortunately, it's not finished, but IT'S GREAT. Trust me

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12951919/1/Crime-and-Punishment]]

-Swung by Seraphin This one isn't particularly Severitus but Snape and Harry get along together and the story is amazing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9821300]]

-Harry Potter and the problem with potions Everyone keeps suggesting it and they're right.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23973537#workskin]]

I've skimmed through a lot of fan fictions so I have to think...

*** I've read Crime and Punishment up to a certain point but have neglected it for a while. I also know of Harry Potter and the problem with Potions but I can't really bring myself to read further on this because of length. I forget what it's about halfway through the fic because I've let it sit still for a few days and then I have to start again

**** Crime and punishment is slow burn. Snape and Harry's relationship is improving, Harry is starting to trust Snape more and more, it has potential but the author doesn't upload since November.

Maybe read it later if you want

I think you can start them again and skim what you find boring. I mostly do that when a story has too much to do with other characters.

AH! Now I remember.

Resonance.

Snape here is not an asshole. Very lenient

** I know it's not a Severitus per se, but it's a mentor/student story that is probably the best in the genre of Severus mentors Harry. Snape is still Snape, he's sarcastic, caustic, unpleasant and utterly loathsome individual. Harry is canon Harry with a bit of cunning thrown in. He's not super, nor is he morally questionable. They are not father and son though... If you would be interested in this regardless of that fact. This is the link. Stronger than Hope.

linkffn(3389525)

These are more classic Severitus stories, maybe one will appeal to you:

linkffn(5428900)

linkffn(2027554)

linkffn(1795399)

EDIT:

Check out Potions and Snitches. TONS of Snape/Harry stories there, no romance. It's still active after all these years. [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]]

What type of Severitus do you want?

Do you want a fluffy Severus?

Angry, cruel Severus?

Some ff are just incoherent with Harry and Snape's characters. Sometimes Snape is too good and Harry acts like a child

** What's your Snape flavor? Do you like a bitter and kind of mean, slow to develop Snape as a guardian/father kind of fic? Or do you like to see Snape immediately have a turnaround and treat Harry differently? Lots of fluff or lots of angst? Biological or it doesn't matter as long as he becomes a parent?

I love Severitus- but I definitely lean more toward the Snape as a reluctant mentor/parent-figure who is initially cold and callous and takes time to warm up, but then has moments of fluff, however I definitely know others who like all of the fluff out of the gate. I like a slow burn transformation of Snape as he realizes he loves Harry and will do anything for him. Strict and loving at the same time, super protective.

But I've read them all- would love to know what you like and what your ideal Snape & Harry relationship is like in the fic, then I can recommend something good for you.

One of my favorites (which has been deleted but still exists in full on Wayback) is “Remembering Me”- in which Harry has a quidditch accident in his first year and he can't remember anything or anyone except Snape who then takes him into his care to helps him regain his memory and magic. It's SUPER in character, and a slow burn but really satisfying building to a father-son relationship. It is pure gold.

Links are here: Fic #1 in the series: “Remembering Me” [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120420033816/http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4615477/1/Remembering_Me]]

All together there's like 500K words and it's amazing. There are 3 parts- the author's Wayback profile on FFN lis here:

*** Oh I didn't expect an answer after a month. My flavour is more in between of both sides. I like a reluctant Snape that doesn't start out too cold. He shouldn't be all fluffy immediately but take some time, yet not start out as the cold and callous man that he is in the books. I like the snarky/sarcastic film Snape.

That said, I'm not a huge fan of Slow Burn most of the time because most that I've read only get to the point I'm the last few chapters. If I read a Slow Burn, 'the point' should be roughly halfway through the story.

I also don't like (too) sad endings. If I read a story that is mainly Severitus I don't want either Snape or Harry to die (and stay dead) at the end.

**** LOL- Oh HELL no, I will not abide by sad endings!!! I read to feel good. I think on this- there are a bunch I can think of but I'll make sure they aren't too slow or too mean out of the gate. Sorry- I'm always searching for new and interesting Severitus so I ran across your post a bit late ;) Have you ever read “Reading the Signs?”- I just re-read it recently and it was very good.

It's got some snark but definitely warms up without being overly fluffy. It's a good one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3341876/1/Reading-the-Signs]]

I also love Harry Potter's Second Chance (Revisited- it was updated/edited)- wherein after the war, Harry is super traumatized and really unhappy and decides to purposely wipe his memory and de-age himself to get a “second chance” to grow up. Adopted by Snape. Super good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10825905/1/Harry-Potter-s-Second-Chance-REVISED]]

Also one of the series I love the most- which has four parts to it- so it's over 500K if you want a long read is “A Time and Place to Grow” (it does have occasional CP which I know is a dealbreaker for some but this series is SO well-written)- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2801806/1/A-Time-and-Place-to-Grow]]
