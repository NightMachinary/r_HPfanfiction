"I'm new, what is it we do here?"

"Excellent question! For the last few weeks we've been collecting stories from those who have witnessed our Lord and His miracles for entry into our new Bible."

"Oh, brilliant! I was there when Harry caught the snitch against Slytherin in '93."

"Fantastic! We'll have you start then, what's your name for the record?"

"Ah, Cho. Cho Chang."

** "This isn't a cult, is it?" Neville asked, nervously.

"Of course not, Neville, it's a fun new religion that I started," Ginny spread her arms in a welcoming gesture, "we believe in the universal tenants of peace and siblinghood."

"Oh," said Neville, "that's good, then."

"And," interjected Luna, "we believe that Harry is the one true God!"

"Erm,"

"Indeeeeedd," drawled Snape, "we all love mistaaah Pottuuhh."

"One day," enthused Draco, "He'll return and carry all of our souls to the beyond on his firebolt!"

The door slammed shut as Neville sprinted down the corridor.

"Neville, wait!" called Luna, "We haven't told you about the dental plan yet!"

Neville paused in his retreat, "I'll think about it!" He shouted back.

** A lot of legends and folk lore point to early magic being about belief. If enough people believe in something it comes into existence. Once Harry kills Voldemort everyone starts believing he is something more than mortal because how could a mere mortal kill someone who can come back from the dead. When rumors start that Harry Potter has the death stick and is known to have an invisibility cloak people assume he united the hallows and became master of death. The deathly hallows themselves are just powerful tools but combine their legend with the fact that everyone believes Harry is not mortal and all of a sudden the wizarding world has a god (emphasis on the little g) of death. Needless to say Harry is not amused.

** Oh god I know one where this is the thing! I can't remember the name, and I'm pretty sure that the fic wasn't finished.. but SPOILERS;>! the plot was that Harry got captured by someone, and kept prisoner for a very very long time with torture and everything, so he used the last of his magic to perform a ritual that burned down the whole property and every bad guy in it, and himself. Everything that was found after the fire was an Egg, a Phoenix Egg. He was then hailed as the Saviour, and the Egg was kept at the feet of a statue of him near the entrance to Hogwarts, and every student would touch it on their way into the school, so he is remembered in every new generation, and praised and everything, and because of the Egg they are all waiting for him to come back, just like a phoenix !<and gah I need to find the fic.

*** I found it! Man, I looked everywhere, and it turns out I remember less from that fic than I thought. It's a Harry Potter x Avenger crossover fic, a creature fic, with Harry/Clint as the main pairing. It's name is Burning Bright by RazzleDazzle348 linkao3(14379909) and sadly its been on hiatus since October 2018...

How much the religion stuff affects the story I can't honestly remember, I have to re-read it, but it's there.

  Harry never wanted to be special, to be a freak, but when he awakens in the body of an infant phoenix, 16 years after being pronounced dead, he finds that he's even more different than ever. Unwilling to face the backlash that his resurrection would cause, he flees the wizarding world, only to come across some of the most unique individuals the world has ever seen. Maybe, just maybe, there's a place for Harry amongst the Avengers, and perhaps he can prove it by helping them defeat a villain hell-bent on consuming their very souls... (On Hiatus)
