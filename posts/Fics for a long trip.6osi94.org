** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): 626k words and nearing completion. A great war story with excellent fight scenes and political intrigues.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): 670k words long superb war epic. It's no longer a simple fanfiction, but an original fiction with HP characters and settings. This story is still in progress and now entering the endgame.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 660k words long Canon rewrite in a non-magic AU, but still with superpowers. It's one of the very few fanfics I enjoyed more than the Canon. The Trio are a lot more cunning and ruthless in this story. I also like how the Years are weighted. For example, Year 7 takes one third of the overall length, while Years 1-3 occupies less than 30%.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
