** I haven't seen any yet but I vaguely remember reading a fic where Harry (and maybe Hermione) attend a magic school somewhere in Africa. I'll try to find it but I have no recollection if it was a good fic.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione comes up with a contingency plan for Harry's Ministry hearing, and they decide their education can be better pursued elsewhere---at the largest and oldest school of magic in the world: Uagadou. Voldemort won't know what hit him. Harry/Hermione.

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches features Uagadou in the latter half of what's out. There's a "Grey Lord" hailing from Uagadou and some background on the culture there: that they focus on wand less magic, their reaction to Harry very briefly visiting Uagadou, a description of the school itself, etc. Not a whole lot, and not necessarily important to the plot (yet), but an interesting bit of world building for sure

** I've wanted to do this for the longest, but I'm already behind on everything. As an aside, a #BlackHogwarts-inspired fic is probably best set in Ilvermorny, or an AU where smaller schools exist in the US/UK.

EDIT: This is probably my [[https://twitter.com/ComedianKhairy/status/951604810595348485][fave]] among the tweets so far, lol.
