** I have a copy! After losing many a favourite to sudden deletions, I copied, pasted and formatted Clash into a pdf. Couldn't bare to see it go the same way as Match. (a stroke of luck, as it now has...)

Not sure how to get it to you though :(

#+begin_quote
  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

***** ATTENTION ATTENTION I found the full story!!! Just like you said, you copy and paste shenanigan's HPFF author page url into web.archive.org and then click into August 2014. But THEN you have to click on the link to Clash, then instead of clicking on a chapter title, just click 'Printer Friendly Version' and it takes you to a page with the full story. I'M SO HAPPY I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT AGAIN!

If anyone has a copy of No Matter What I would be v grateful if they could send it to me - this method didn't work for that story :(
