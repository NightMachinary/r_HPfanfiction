In all of dumbles bashing fics the second harry start acting out or thwarted his 'brilliant' scheme to use a harry as a lamb for the slaughter before taking his money , he simply becomes a toothless lion incapable of improvising or stopping a 14 y old for God sake.

Is there a fic like harry and the triwizard tournament where dumbles is shown to be what he is a genius wizard in a league of his own with great political power and acumen , who could defeat Voldemort in a one on one and destroy big players like malfoy on the political field , let alone a 14 y old hormonal teen going through his emo phase with no political backers and no access to his greatly diminished family wealth.
