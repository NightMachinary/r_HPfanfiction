I'm talking Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, everybody. I'm looking for any fic where the power levels of all the characters are increased drastically, and that includes the villains as well.

** Huh. I'm imagining a Dynasty Warriors style game written as a fic for some reason.

Harry Potter leaps into the crowd of Inferi, cutting several of them in half with kung fu strikes before sweeping the others around him with big blasts of conjured fire from his bare hands. Drawing his wand, he begins to bob and wave like conducting an invisible orchestra, summoning a massive dragon made of fire to fly through the undead ranks and decimate them.

** I think canon fits here. If you think about it wizards are absurdly powerful and capable.

But if everyone gets an increase then what is the point? Unless you bring some 3rd party in - muggles? Aliens? Some AU demons? To compare against it just doesn't add much to the story.
