This fic, man. It's beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous in the most awful of ways. It's like a special kind of bad that you never knew existed. It also contains the single best line of dialogue in any story in the known universe.

"If Ron knows Harry is a female, he'll join Voldemort!"

The writer's profile is equally phenomenal.

***** Hm. Jean was made canon by JKR in the 7th book or so, but she said in an interview a few years earlier that it was Jane. I tend to go with the earlier one, and besides, "Jane" feels a bit more normal and less unique than Jean, even though both are common names. I just think it serves to humanise Hermione more.

***** As Lockhart continued regaling the class with his battle against the Wagga Wagga Werewolf, Ron shook himself out of his shock and leaned over to an equally horrified looking Harry.

"Mate," he whispered, "now it could be I'm just seeing things, but from here I could swear it looks like..."

"He is," Harry interrupted. "I see it too. I'm waiting until his back is turned so I can hopefully make it out of the room and get help."

Ron nodded. "Good idea, you're faster than I am. If he notices anything I'll try and hold him off, maybe give some the others a chance to escape too."

Harry shot Ron a startled look. "Are you sure? There's no shame in running, you know. Just because you're a Gryffindor doesn't mean you have to sacrifice yourself like that."

Ron's eyes narrowed as he watched the defense professor begin acting out his climactic showdown with the fearsome werewolf who apparently spoke in a high, feminine shriek. "I know that, mate. But what kind of Gryffindor would I be if I left the rest of our friends to be taught by a man wearing that much body glitter?"

****** Oho, here we go.

"I don't see the problem," said Hermione, her eyes slightly unfocussed. Harry and Ron exchanged a look of deep concern.

"Hermione," said Harry. "I don't suppose you've noticed that our professor sparkles?"

"It's beautiful, isn't it?" said Hermione. Beside her, Lavender Brown nodded very quickly, her blonde pigtails bouncing.

"Have you /seen/ the pictures of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf in Professor Lockhart's books?" she said dreamily. "I didn't know muscles came like that. And that tattoo. /Woof/."

Harry and Ron choked. Behind them, Seamus Finnegan started laughing and intermittently letting out a bizarre, choked mimicry of Lavender's little /woof/. Dean Thomas paused for a long moment.

"Excuse me," he said, "But I know for a fact that none of you have ever read my mother's favourite books, so would someone please tell me what the bloody hell is going on?"

******* Harry quickly thumbed through his copy of /Wanderings with Werewolves/ until he found the picture that Lavender mentioned. As the color drained from his face, he wordlessly passed the open book over to Ron, calmly removed and folded his glasses, and slammed his head into his desk with a resounding crack. Fortunately for him, he narrowly avoided the attention of his classmates by Draco Malfoy loudly protesting being 'volunteered' to play the part of the werewolf in Lockhart's reenactment.

"Let go of me! Don't you know who I am? You wait until my father hears of this, then we'll see who's left wearing the leash!"

Miles away in his personal study, Lucius Malfoy had to stop polishing his cane long enough to remove his ascot and undo the top two buttons of his shirt, which had suddenly become uncomfortably tight for some reason.

After watching his best mate flop bonelessly to the floor, Ron visibly steeled himself before slowly turning to stare at the picture in front of him. /Why does he keep taking his shirt off?/ he wondered to himself.

Several seconds passed before Ron's eyes lit up with realization. "So this is why Percy loves this book so much! I've always wondered..." Noticing Dean trying to peer over his shoulder, Ron obligingly moved to give him a better view.

Dean took one look at the picture and reared back in shock.

"Get it now, mate?" Ron said. "There's no way that ponce could've beat this guy in a wrestling match, no matter how much mud he said there was! If you ask me, I figure we're dealing with some kinda succubus or something."

"Incubus," Hermione muttered absently before turning to the drooling blonde next to her. "Who knew that pelvic thrusting could be so useful against a werewolf!"

"It certainly seemed effective," Lavender replied as she watched a disheveled and shaking Draco Malfoy return to his seat. "I wonder if it'll be on the O.W.L.?"

Meanwhile, as he lay unconscious and bleeding on the floor, Harry Potter found himself in the middle of a very peculiar dream that would later have him wondering if he might actually love Hedwig a little /too/ much.
