maybe they realize that too many horcruxes destabilizes the soul and try to convince voldemort prime to feel remorse for fear of what would happen if his soul rips even more, the possesing horcrux and scarcrux merge, they fight, or something else happens?


** My fic sort of applies, in this case.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

Diary Riddle notices the horcrux in Harry's scar and decides that merging with it would be a cleaner course of action than absorbing Ginny's soul. Lily's protection is still in full force, though, preventing a total possession from being possible, so the two wind up sharing Harry's body

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

*** you are correct, i do like it and am already waiting for your next update, l but it seems to pretty similar to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), i want to specifically have the interaction of a possessing horcrux and the scar horcrux make something happen

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  “I'm Harry,” she finally offers when the silence in the cupboard feels like it's going to overwhelm her. “Harry Potter.” There's a warm sense of satisfaction resting in her stomach, not her own, and Harry doesn't know why Tom seems so smug. It's wonderful to meet you, Harry he practically purrs, sounding like he's whispering directly into her ear. Harry twitches, a small smile starting to grow on her face. “Are you going to help me, Tom?” If you'll let me. I'll take very good care of you, Harry. Tom Riddle starts talking to Harry when she's six.
