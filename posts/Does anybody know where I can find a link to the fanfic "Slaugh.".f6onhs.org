I could find one for "Dumbledore's Army and the year of Darkness" but the followup seems to have been deleted off the face of the internet. I can't seem to find it anywhere and all the links just lead me astray. Does anyone know where I can find this particular story?


** It is the biggest pile of shite i've ever read. It is beyond a joke to anyone Irish and is a plastic paddy's wikipedia inspired dream of a story set in Ireland.

** There was a followup, why did I never hear of it?

*** There was, I remember reading it. It was a while ago, but IIRC it was about Seamus becoming a murderer.

** Huh, I remember reading it. Can't find it anymore. Have you tried any of the old archives? They probably saved it somewhere.

** Ok, I spent a while looking into this. Just wanted to add that the author is a piece of human shit. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Thanfiction]]
