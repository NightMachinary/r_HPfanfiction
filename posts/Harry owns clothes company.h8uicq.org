I want to reread this one fanfic but all I can remember about it is Harry buys or works with people who make fashion clothes and stuff. It's not bolt. Not sure if that's enough for anyone to find it.


** Linkffn(Bolt fashion)

Edit: Sorry, didn't read entire post

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.

**** Does he have /Ahem/ relations with them, beyond the mutual business benefit?

If it's the one I'm thinking of, it might be /For the Love of Magic/ by Noodlehammer, but I can't link it here(violates rule 8). Just be aware that the author expresses opinions that some might very well consider problematic, or even downright offensive.
