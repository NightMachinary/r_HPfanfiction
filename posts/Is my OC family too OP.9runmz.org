** I haven't read any of the other responses, so this is my uncompromised impression of your OC family:

Not OP (there's no way to judge from what you've given us), but unrealistic. It comes off as a Hallmark Christmas Special, a Mary Sue family.

Every real family has scars, unhealed wounds that fester and nag, an undercurrent of tension that lurks beneath their interactions. You've only given us a glossy brochure of the family, as if they were selling themselves for a reality show on "Great Wizarding Families," and not the kind where there's hair-pulling and muttered imprecations. I just don't care about them, honestly, since I'm basically given a drug store's glossy advert of a happy, balanced family doing happy, balanced family things and being happy and, for the most part, balanced. Perhaps there's real tension in your story notes, perhaps not, but conflict, and how we deal with it, is essential to defining our identities. Our failures and foibles are more of what we are than our strengths. Your characters need them if you want them to have depth. If you haven't put this together, you need to if you want an interesting story.

What did Asher fail at? What is his secret fear?

To take some artistic liberties, did he have a weeks-long, torrid affair with Narcissa that he now wishes never happened (but holy shit, that was great sex!), but that she never lets him forget, that she holds over him, a wicked secret to extort for favors, political and otherwise? Does he hate her, yet crave her touch in a way that is almost painful and that dominates his dreams at night and his thoughts in the day as he wishes his increasingly distant wife were more like her.

Is Miriam truly "intelligent, ambitious, and beautiful," or is that her facade, the affectation she shows the world? Does she take potions to distract from otherwise unremarkable features? She's no Narcissa Malfoy, after all. Is the ambition she presents genuine or a product of her Slytherin background and familial expectations? Does she dread the day her husband, whose eye surreptitiously tracks the younger, prettier witches (though she'd never admit having caught him looking), decides to take a mistress? Would she care, truly, if he did, provided he continues, in his simple way, to provide for her and her family? Does she respect him?

She knows about Narcissa. Oh, hell, she's known since the start. Her feckless spouse was stupid to think that he could keep such a thing from her. She was Slytherin, dammit, not Hufflepuff, and she knew of the torch he was carrying for the coldest of the Black daughters. And yet he pretends to dote upon her, never noticing how she notices his insincerity and guilt, the chaste kisses on her brow blows that only temper her steel. She's silent now, but not forever. There will be a reckoning, one day. Perhaps when the children are away.

Anna's watched this dynamic play out for as long as she can remember and she feels in her bones that something isn't right with her family. She secretly thinks it has something to do with her, an important thing she did or didn't do, which is the source of her anxiety. She cries at night, sometimes, for her parents who don't really seem to love each other, even though they tell her earnestly that they do, for her brother, whom she thinks harbors suicidal thoughts, for herself, doomed to suffer it all. And sometimes she cries just because she feels like crying. And that's the truth.

Lucian's stoically endured all this, though he harbors a secret disgust for his father, yet is clever enough by half to never let anyone see this side of him. The man is weak in an unforgivable way, and if there's one thing he can't abide by, it's cravenness. Slytherin is right for him in this regard. Slytherin, like Gryffindor, is about strength and he has that in spades.

He's found he's a somewhat abusive lover, a bit on the rough side, a slight bit reckless in his passions, brash and cold, and that's fine by him. He cares for his sister, as he knows her pain. If an anonymous gift gives a moment's joy, it's worth it. He's bitter at having been cut out of his inheritance, though tradition demands it for one unable to provide an heir, and he's seen enough of tepid marriages to court fate with his overbearing and domineering mother arranging one for him. He's more bitter at the circumstances, though he, of all of them, has the pragmatism to survive, to endure, to thrive.

I'm not saying to use any of that, as it's undoubtedly complete rubbish at odds with your vision for the story, but I wished to illustrate that once you have the essential conflicts in place, you have the backdrop for a proper story.

**** You're of course welcome to any or all of it.

When I write, I find that I need this level (at least) of granularity of backstory and underlying conflicts among the principal characters to be able to tell a genuine story. Otherwise, my characters feel like cutouts and I find myself with scenes where nobody has anything to say.

To be clear, none of this backstory has to be overtly in the story, none of the seething conflict has to be resolved. It just has to be a churning batch of emotional preconditioning simmering beneath other events. The point is just to make your characters organic and human.

** My question with OC is always: Why should I care?

The problem is that /most/ people come to read HP Fanfiction to read about HP characters. Your OC will always have the disadvantage of not being a canon HP character. So how will you make me care? Whats their deal? /Why/ did you make them in the first place? What role do they fill that cannot be filled by any other HP characters?

From what you wrote you can't really judge the characters. One paragraph is not enough. I don't know how they talk, or react. The bit you did write here has me thinking that the parents are background characters with little screentime. The brother seems like prime material for /edgelord supreme/ and Annabelle feels like a Mary Sue to me. But again. Your characters aren't really judgeable. Its more that for now all you wrote lets me guess according to my experience in this fandom.

*** Right, and if you still rehash canon plot despite having such OP OCs, then there is zero merit to read your fic.

On the other hand, if you can develop a decent original plot due to their existence, then your story will of course attract great interest.

So the fundamental issue is really what you do with them and how they affect the story.

**** OP certainly has a Sue vibe with the mother, brother and MC. What's the point of pointing out how attractive a mother is if she is not getting banged by the MC or their "bro in arms"? Why mention that the brother is self-absorbed when that does not matter towards the MC? Shy female MC who "comes out of her shell in a time of need" is also pretty inconsequential since her flaws do not matter when shit hits the fan.

Protective dad with dad jokes feels like Tropy McTrope.

** People generally read Harry Potter because they want more from their favourite characters. Therefore it's very hard to successfully add a family of OCs that people would care about or read. You need a good hook.

1) Miriam and Asher are a little too close to Molly and Arthur. The only thing that makes them different to the Weasleys is that they don't seem to be poor and Asher is probably more respected in the ministry. I'd also challenge why Miriam is a housewife. You describe her as ambitious. What are her ambitions? Did she always want to be a housewife? Did she have career ambitions of her own but they took a backseat to support her husbands political career? Admittedly she reads like a replacement for Molly.

3) Anna's bio seems to be a mesh between Harry and Neville. She asked to be in Gryffindor and she has anxiety and is great at herbology.

*** OCs to complement the canon world are often a necessity. You won't find any canon character from most countries and if you move the plot outside of Britain, you will need OCs to fill the blanks. Or even to flesh out magical Britain. But just OC's feels weird nine times out of ten.

*** Yeah, if I'm reading a story with an OC, they have to have some characteristic that I want to see in a canon character that is hard to find. For example, I'm fond of the darkness, nobility, and madness that embodies the Blacks (at least in fanfiction), but there's no female Black (or any Black at all other than Draco if you push it) that isn't already or nearly an adult by the time Harry's started Hogwarts.

** I love OCs in the Harry Potter world. Have you published anything yet, and if so, can you link it? I can't say for sure if your characters are overpowered without seeing them in the context of their story. IMO, it's not a bad thing if a character is talented, but it is a bad thing if they're able to overcome all the conflicts in the story very easily. They still need to work, they still need to struggle, they still need to fail, and they still need to grow.

Your story has piqued my interest, and I'd love to read it!

** There's no such thing as inherently OP. See Yudkowsky's First Law of Fanfiction. You could give your character the power to control the Earth's orbit, anf that wouldn't count as OP as long as you gave Voldemort the ability to control the Sun. So ask yourself this: could your Fairwoods easily destroy your story's antagonists if you didn't choose to add convoluted plot reasons why they can't? Or do these antagonists pose a real threat?

The attractiveness of the mother is irrelevant +until+ unless the later plot involves her and seduction. It's Chekov's gun, people expect that something comes from it. I mean, I don't mind incest in fiction, but that's probably not the angle you are aiming for.

The father feels trope-y and lacks depth.

The "flaws" of the brother are irrelevant to the MC and therefore might as well not exist in the first place.

And "shy girl who saves the day because she isn't shy/anxious when something is actually at stake" is very Mary Sue-ish.

** Whether or not they are OP depends on your plot - especially on the challenges for the protagonists - and your OCs' role in it. If they are antagonists to Harry, then they don't seem OP, for example.
