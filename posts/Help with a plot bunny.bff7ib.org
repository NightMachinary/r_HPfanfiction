I guess I want a few opinions about an idea I had. Basically general impressions, points where the story could go wrong and the like. This is still an primary brainstorming, and there's a lot of room for development.

I have this bunny going on for some time - an AU in which Dumbledore found more 'benevolent' ways of feeding Tom Riddle's ego. Therefore, Voldemort never came to be, and Riddle became DADA professor. But even without Voldemort, pureblood society is still prejudiced, and are articulating a way of pushing their ideology little by little, until it becomes full on violence. A few people who don't agree with that fight off. Harry Potter, a fifth year student at Hogwarts, has his family killed on a terrorist attack perpetrated by the Black Sisters (I'm still thinking if Andromeda will be a villain in this, and if I'll have Narcissa go by Black, even though she still married Lucius. Bellatrix will remain unmarried, though.)

Tom Riddle is still selfish and unable to love anyone, and he basically hates how pureblood supremacy (which tells he, as a half-blood, is inferior) is taking over the world. He watches as Harry Potter begins to gather a few muggleborns, half-bloods and 'blood traitors' to fight against the pureblood supremacists, and how Harry becomes increasingly violent and extreme during his last school years (and beyond). Basically, since Harry does not threaten him, he very much enjoys watching the bloodshed.

Thoughts?


** This could be interesting, but I'm very skeptical of the idea that blood-purists could seriously have a shot at taking over Britain without Lord Voldemort to guide them. If you removed Dumbledore from the equation (and why not? perhaps Riddle's different path has a butterfly effect and Dumbledore dies in the process of defeating Grindelwald, or something), then... maybe. But realistically, Dumbledore would curbstomp through anything Death-Eater-shaped if the Dark Lord wasn't there to keep him at bay.

And that's if the Aurors aren't enough to take care of it; their whole point is that they are highly-trained Dark Wizard hunters, after all, and they did canonically manage to subdue all the Death Eaters as soon as Voldemort was gone, including Bellatrix. That most of the people they'd captured then proceeded to claim the Imperius doesn't change the basic fact that the War would have been over in a month without Voldemort.

*** I think you have a point. Nerfing Dumbledore is something I'd prefer not to do, and killing him off seems better, but I'd need to think about this.

I could always go for the pureblood population gaining political power (say, a blood purist with a high position in the Ministry and/or DMLE). Perhaps even someone who is reaching Hogwarts (which would give more reason for Tom Riddle to be wary of them)...

** With Voldemort out of the equation, you still need a leader for the Pureblood (at least if you want to go for violent terrorist group), something to nerf Dumbledore would also be appreaciated (as someone said before, him and Voldemort were basically countering each other).\\
Then some questions :\\
- What do you make of Riddle in this story : someone completely disinterested of the whole affair or does he give some kind of support to Harry? Like talking to him from time to time (maybe even pushing him to form a group and be violent when he is still emotionally hurt by the Death of his parents) and teaching him some curse.\\
- The Marrauders : Sirius would probably be in the full "Blood traitor category" but maybe some tensions because the Potter were killed by his "family" and even if he want justice, he doesn't want to kill them? Do you try to put the Werewolves with Blood Purist, with the blood traitors (because blood purist treat them as beast) or neutral? Is Lupin part of Harry life since his parents had lived? And Pettigrew, he betrayed the Potter because he feared for his life, but in this scenario there is no Voldemort to frighten him and even if he does end up a traitor, it would be way later when he had already played a part in Harry's life.\\
- Andromeda Black : if you make her a blood purist, how? Ted was killed by a muggle or a muggleborn and she is out for vengeance? Cursed by Bellatrix to change her mind or full OOC?

Still an interesting idea, the kind I would read as long as it's not Harry/ Hermione (I'm at a point I loathe this pairing).

*** - I think that Tom Riddle would definitely push Harry in a violent direction. Especially if I go on the route of having Hogwarts being threatened by blood purist ideology, which is something that just occurred to me.

- I can't see Sirius caring about the Blacks who just killed his best friend. I'd need to look more on the matter of the werewolves, but I'd probably have them against the pureblood.

- I also have to look more into what info exists about Andromeda and her reason for not being a blood purist to develop her character. But the idea of Bellatrix cursing her is not uninteresting, to be honest.

**** About the Blacks, it's mainly fanon, but there is a theory that no matter the ideology, family was sacred (in the sense that they could not kill each other). Which would explain why the blood traitor Andromeda was never attacked during the war despite being the sister of the most crazy Death Eater and, in a lesser mesure, Sirius.

This theory also say that the curse Bellatrix sent to Sirius in the DoM was not fatale (only movie used Avada Kedavra, from what I remember from OotP, it was "a red curse") and that Sirius only died by falling in the Death Arch.

Of course Canon never explicitly said it (and in a AU story, canon is not that important) and Bellatrix /may/ have killed Tonk during the Battle of Hogwarts (remember somothing about Dolohov killing Remus, but not sure for Tonk) so in this story Sirius can also just go on warpath to avenge his friends (and maybe dying or gravely injured to punish his lack of planing?).

** I think Hermione would be the secret mastermind behind the rebellion while Harry would be the official leader. Basically start as a more violent DA and end up as a terror group similar to the IRA.

** A thing that bothers me is that with people like Umbridge in positions of power in a supposedly "moderate" government, why did they death eaters think they needed a terrorist rebellion? If anything, being seen as violent thugs set their cause back and enough of the wizarding world basically already agreed with them that they could have gotten their way by 1991 by just playing the game, maybe with a few discreet, targeted assassinations. Maybe James Potter could be one of those? Maybe there's still a prophecy that Harry will lead the muggleborns to power and the secret violent wing of the right-wing wizards gets wind of it?

** Definitely plausible and maybe make it so without Voldemort they don't do things so stupidly. We see that the public are fickle and easy to lie to in the stories so maybe intelligent purebloods put muggle borns down a bit and engineer a situation where muggleborns are caught being essentially death eaters or sabotaging the ministry/ or attempting to breach the statute of secrecy. Basically making sure that the muggle borns aren't seen as oppressed simply for their births. This allows for more reception to laws taking away some rights. Obviously nothing huge because people would be angry about it but small steps. It always irritated me in canon that we see that many death eaters are well respected highly regarded people and Voldemort became a terrorist.

** I think that placating Riddle would need to start earlier than his application for the defense position. Without Riddle to lead I think it would be a long political war with the pureblood gaining steadily thanks to bribery and corruption. I don't think purebloods would attack the muggleborns. I think they would use the laws as their weapons. I think violence would come from the oppressed(muggleborn/halfbreeds/...) or from muggle baiting gone wrong. I think Tom would help Harry's cause indirectly as a way to get revenge by proxy and not risk himself.

** I like it, but with all good plot bunnies it needs an outline. I also have some questions.

When were the Potters killed? When does the story end? Does Dumbledore start to feed Tom's ego at the first meeting, end of xth year, when? How does Tom teach in a way that doesn't reveal his frustrations with society/politics?

Also as a side note, Bellatrix was married to a Lestrange in the series (I forget which one).

Not necessarily. There have been numerous threads about this, but outlines aren't for everyone; they can stifle the will to write as easily as guide it. An endgame /is/ necessary, but for some people outlining is a mistake.
