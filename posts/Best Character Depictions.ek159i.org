So, a thread today asked what characters were most difficult to write and it was a very interesting thought. Specifically, it made me wonder what people have gotten right. So, what fics do you think nailed a character? Please add what character the fic nailed and why they were so good.


** Forgot to add why as requested by the OP. I see Hermione as desperately smart as well as desperately lonely - and therefore clinging to her friendship with Harry and Ron even though they don't really have much in common. Both the Hermione POV fics that I listed show Hermione growing apart from the boys, and that is a character arc that makes sense to me. She is also more likely, IMHO, as she grows up to question Dumbledore's precepts, because she has such an inquiring mind that the blind faith that she displays in canon wouldn't persist into adulthood. Both 'Coven' and 'Manacled' depict this growing disillusionment. I know there are a lot of Hermione haters on this forum, and, to pre-empt the inevitable responses, I really don't care what you think of her, what I've described above is my head canon. You don't have to share it.

For the Remus story, the author says that they wrote 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' to make sense of the mess that is Remus' character in DH, and I think the fic succeeds in that.

** I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.

** Here are my recommendations, although just because they match my head canon does not of course mean they match that of others.

There are a couple of fics from Hermione's POV that IMHO have depicted her character perfectly. They are: linkao3(Coven by Naidhe) linkao3 (Manacled by SenLinYu)

Coven is a WIP.

Also this one of both Hermione and Remus ( his POV) linkao3(Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow by TheDivineComedian)

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve, to be bred and monitored until her mind can be cracked. COMPLETE.

** all i can add is that there hasn't been one fic i've read in the millions and millions of words hundreds-thousands of fics (think i've been reading fanfics for 17 years - with a few years gap in late teens) that has written an accurate to Rowling characterisation ginny/harry story that pics up on the subtle aspects of the relationship from cannon. tbh i've only read two reddit posts where people picked up on the subtleties of the relationship so i don't expect to ever find a fanfic hitting this point.

*** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Harry/Ginny. The pairing is extremely subtle, and without a keen eye for clues, will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's self-sacrificial outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Bible, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this pairing, to realise that it's not just romantic- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Harry/Ginny truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the phrase "monster in his chest", which itself is a cryptic reference to Dan O'Bannon's Alien. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as JKR's genius wit unfolds itself on their pages. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
