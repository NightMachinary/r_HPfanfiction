** My favorite that is solely about Ted and Andromeda is a one shot, The Blacker the Berry by Appello: linkffn(11843531)

surrogate by 17734 is primarily Bellatrix/Voldemort but there is a heavy focus on Andromeda & Bellatrix as well, and consequently many scenes of Andromeda and Ted in their school days: linkao3(11682174)

  “I,” her gaze slips down to his mouth, “want only to please you. Is there no way I might...” “You want to own me,” he lilts to her. He tucks a curling strand of hair behind her ear. “No, master,” she insists, plaintive words and sharp, devouring eyes. “I am your faithful servant. Nothing sustains me but to obey your will.”

  Andromeda was supposed to be the good one. The proper one, the one her parents never had to worry about. But Andromeda had a secret, and a penchant for scruffy, unkempt blonde boys with smiles that wouldn't quit and blue eyes that saw right into her soul. She was supposed to be the good one, but she really, really wasn't... One-shot, rated M.

** There are a couple of Harry back in time stories where Andromeda/Ted have somewhat important parts, although they aren't main characters.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
