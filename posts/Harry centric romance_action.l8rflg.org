  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Linkffn(The Merging; Black Luminary). The former definitely fits your prompt better, and it has the added benefit of being complete, but the latter is worth checking out, as well: it takes longer for it to get to the action, and it's a rare fic in which the endgame main pair is genuinely in question (personally, I'm rooting for Tracey, but I have a long and storied history of backing hopeless romantic candidates, so I don't think my opinion's worth much), but when the action does start, it's pretty damn good, and I remember thinking its relationship writing was on point.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
