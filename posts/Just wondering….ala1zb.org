** I'd repost it with a different title if I were you, nobody likes to click on a title that reveals nothing about a request. To answer your question, I sometimes bash her (not in fanfics, but in a discussion) using actual evidence. I sometimes point out that she attacked Ron for no reason with birds that tried their best to bite his skin off or the fact that she bullied an orphan and a poor kid into funding a cause they did not support. Keep in mind that Weasley family fortune amounted to a single galleon. So, the money she took from Ron likely was all the money he had ever saved. And he gave it all away so she would fuck off

  The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train\\
  tracks through the bank's underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the\\
  Weasleys' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.\\
  There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside , and just one gold Galleon.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
