This is something I never liked. Peter Pettigrew is a Gryffindor, yet his act of betrayal is said to be the result of cowardice and self-preservation -distinctly non-Gryffindor traits. So instead of showing that villains can come from any house, it shows us that Pettigrew wasn't a "true" Gryffindor and was displaying the /Slytherin/ trait of self-preservation.

I think it would be more interesting if Pettigrew was tired of being weak and got in over his head. (And also, I've never seen a fic make him more than snivelling, fearful, pathetic Wormtail aiming to please the Dark Lord)

Therefore: In Defence of a Rat (I put this under discussion because I want opinions on Pettigrew, not on my writing, but let me know if the narrative format means it should be under promotion)

Peter Pettigrew was a quiet, shy, fearful boy. But he was a Gryffindor. He loved his friends more than life itself, he loved Sirius and Remus and James and Lily and baby Harry.

But Dumbledore said there was a prophecy. Dumbledore said that Voldemort /needed/ to come after Harry in order to be defeated. The Order was being decimated, cut down one after another, the Ministry was crumbling, the war was being /lost/. Time was running OUT. He didn't want to betray them. But Dumbledore said everything would work out. Dumbledore said he NEEDED Peter to do this. Peter had never been needed before. He offered to James and Lily to babysit that night, while they went to an Order Halloween party. Safe, protected by their friends and allies, to prevent from going stir-crazy in that house. But then Lily wasn't feeling well. But it was too late. He'd already told. So in the end he betrayed the Potters, his dearest friends, to Voldemort, because Dumbledore said He needed to try and kill Harry to be defeated. But he was in too deep now. Dumbledore couldn't keep him out of prison. Dumbledore needed him to hide. So he faked his death and framed Sirius, because he /knew/ that Sirius could never go to jail. Sirius was /innocent/, after all. Dumbledore knew Sirius was innocent. Three little drops of Veritaserum, a check of Siri's wand, pensieve memories, legilimancy, anything! There wasn't one drop of proof that Sirius had done anything wrong, except his finger. The twelve muggles were an accident, he didn't mean to hit a gas line. He ran off without looking back and met up with Dumbledore, who brought him and deposited him a few feet from the Burrow, where he would be kept safe and cared for by the Weasleys until the remaining Death Eaters were caught and everything would go back to normal again. But Sirius was sent to prison despite being innocent, and he could do nothing. The Death Eaters got away, bribing their way out and begging imperius. It seemed as though his plans had crumbled. He escaped for a while, turned into a human, apparated to the shrieking shack, turned back into a rat and went to Dumbledore. Dumbledore said that it was a shame James and Lily had died, but they died like heroes and their sacrifice rid the world of Voldemort. He said he couldn't do anything about Sirius.

Peter was lost and afraid. He'd had his moment of bravery, he'd tried to do what was right over that which was easy, he'd given up everything for the Greater Good, and now he was in so far over his head. It seemed everything had gone wrong. Voldemort was dead, yes, not even a body remained, but so were James and Lily! And Sirius was in Azkaban, and the Death Eaters were going free left and right, and it seemed truly a Pyrrhic victory. What could he do to make things right? Was it possible he had put his trust in the wrong man? He didn't know what to do. None of the plans thus far had been his. Dumbledore had made the plans. He had told him what to do. Dumbledore's plans hadn't worked, but then, at least Dumbledore had plans. Peter had nothing. Peter had no one else to turn to. What could he do? He couldn't bring back the dead. James and Lily were gone no matter his regret. But he could still save Sirius. There was no way he could break him out of Azkaban, not that place. He was no Dark Lord, he had never been a powerful wizard. But he could save Sirius by telling the truth. By turning himself in, he could get his friend out of that hellhole.

Dumbledore had tears in his eyes. Dumbledore told him he was a brave, wonderful boy, so noble, so kind, but that it would never work. He said Minister Bagnold would not appreciate being told of her mistake. He said the approval rating of the government would nosedive if it turned out they had sent an innocent man to prison. That Crouch would see Peter as a problem, and make him /disappear/ sooner than admitting to a mistake with Sirius. He said Peter would be dead and Sirius would still be in prison. Peter said 'what can we do?' Dumbledore said "only wait." Peter asked how waiting would help. Dumbledore said when things settled down, Sirius would be found innocent without revealing that Peter was still alive. Peter just had to /wait/.

Peter waited for six years, got lost in the drudgery of daily life as a rat, as each day seemed just like the last, until Percy took him to Hogwarts. He asked Dumbledore on the first night back whether his waiting was done yet. He asked when things could go back to normal? When could everything be revealed? It was the first time he had been human in six years. He was unused to it. It was very odd. His hair and nails had grown longer. He cut them with a spell to feel more human, but he didn't feel very human at all. Dumbledore said no, said Crouch was campaigning to be Minister in 1990, said that he would kill Peter as soon as he saw him rather than allow that ambiguity to shadow his campaign. He told Peter to wait, and to stop coming, because the Weasleys would be suspicious if their rat kept disappearing. But Peter came once more, when he had been given to the youngest boy, in 1991, after Crouch's campaign was destroyed he came to Dumbledore to ask if now, ten years later, they could finally save Sirius from Azkaban. He didn't feel human at all. He had trouble walking. He had grown fat, his clothes were ten years out of style. The last time he had been human was that visit in 1987, and he had felt odd even then. Now he felt downright alien in his own body. His hair and nails had grown long again. He didn't bother to cut them. Dumbledore said wait, Peter said he was tired of waiting. Dumbledore grew angry, his presence towering over Peter. Peter felt fear. Dumbledore told him to go back to Ron, so he did. What could he do? He begins to despair. He realises he did put his faith in the wrong wizard. That Dumbledore doesn't care about James, or Lily, or Sirius, or even him. For him, the ends justify the means, and they are all means to an end. And baby Harry.... The boy may look like James, but he acted so different. That's not how a baby Harry raised by James would act. He didn't act like Lily either, though. He acted almost like Peter, only braver. As though the love and acceptance of his friends was the most important thing in the world to him, something he'd never had before, something he would change himself to do. Peter wonders, if baby Harry were told what Peter had been told, about Ron and Hermione, would he give them up? He seemed the type who would die for them. Peter wished he had been given the duty to die for his cause, rather than betray for it. It was so much easier to be a martyr than a traitor, even if he had been working for the Greater Good. And had he really? Had the plan really been for the Greater Good? It seemed so easy. James and Lily would be safe, Sirius would be safe, Harry would be safe, and Voldemort would be dead. He could deal with losing their trust to get rid of that monster. He knew he would never be truly forgiven for endangering baby Harry, but even if he /knew/ nothing would make things go back to the way they were.... He could deal with that, because they would all be safe and happy and the danger would be gone.... But it hadn't worked. Why hadn't it worked!

Considering how quickly the last ten years had gone, the two years until 1993 pass in the blink of an eye. And suddenly, Sirius has escaped!

Peter is frozen with indecision. Should he go to Sirius? Apologise? Explain himself? Should he turn himself in now? Should he run? Sirius, after all, didn't know the plan. Sirius had been steamrolled by the plan. And Peter had allowed Dumbledore to tell him to /wait/ for twelve years.... He hadn't even tried to get Sirius, hadn't turned himself in, hadn't tried anything. What could he say to Sirius?

He tries to run.

Sirius catches him. Remus is there. So is baby Harry. So is dear Ron, and that girl Hermione. Peter breaks down in tears. Sirius is going to kill him. Harry thinks he is filthy. They force him into human form with a spell and he cannot even stand straight on two legs. His clothes are the same he was wearing on the day he framed Sirius. A bitter reminder. But he is no longer the same. He was nineteen then, idealistic, scared, over his head, praying for things to work out, watching as everything spun further and further out of his control. Now he is thirty-one, fat and old and awkward, snivelling on the floor as his old friend, who is emaciated and old and awkward, points his wand at him with the killing curse just behind his lips.

"They took you without a trial," he wails, falling to his knees, giving up on standing. "They weren't supposed to do that," he bows his head by Sirius's feet. "Nothing happened as it was supposed to!"

Sirius knows what it is to be taken without a trial.

"What?! What do you mean, supposed to?!"

So Peter tells him. He sobs and wails and grovels as he recounts the wretchedness of years past.

"Nobody was supposed to die except You-Know-Who!" He has spent many years with the Weasleys, has gained a fear of saying Voldemort even as a rat.


** Editorial note- he's 33-34 when caught in the Shrieking Shack.

I like to think that Peter valued courage and honour and all that, but that he had 'a different kind of courage'; he would've been frustrated with being sidelined after leaving school, when his friends were in the Order with him but no one thought enough of him to send him on dangerous missions. /Wasn't I the one sneaking everywhere to make our map? Wasn't I the one sent in to deliver our pranks while my friends sat publicly elsewhere to make an alibi?/

It's this frustration that might lead him to take on his own spying mission, to finally get one of them into the enemy's camp. After all, that's what he'd done during school. How much different could it be with adults who aren't as crafty as Hogwarts Professors?

Peter hadn't accounted for the Dark Lord's powers over the mind. Caught, with no other possible avenue of survival, he played out his intended backup story; "I'm not valued by the Order!" (which was true).

Peter may even have known a bit of Occlumency, but once he had taken the Dark Mark his mind was to Voldemort an open book.

That's my take on it. Call it tragic misjudgement or hubris, but I don't see it being better to blame Dumbledore for Peter's fate. He chose it- like a Gryffindor.

** Peter betraying the order wasn't necessarily an act of cowardice. All his life he'd followed James, Sirius and Remus, doing what they wanted because he wanted friends. Stepping away from that to find a place in life where he felt truly valued would have taken courage as leaving your comfort zone is always scary. If he truly held the same beliefs as the death eaters then what he was actually doing was turning away from a life where he was secure and protected in order to follow his beliefs. You don't necessarily have to be "good" in order to be brave.

On both sides of every war are people fighting for what they believe is right. The people on the losing side are no less brave just because their views on the world are different, they're still putting their lives at risk to stand up for their beliefs.

Peter then decided to live as a rat rather than face the punishment for his actions. It's pretty hard to argue that it's not brave, but nowhere in canon does it say that Gryffindors always have to be brave. There are examples in the books of Harry running away rather than doing the brave thing. For example, when he inflates Aunt Marge he chooses to try to run from the ministry and hide rather than accept the punishment for performing magic outside of school. This is exactly what Peter did, albeit for a much lesser crime.

Peter is one of my favourite characters in the series because of the complexity of his character, despite the fact it's not really explored in canon. I also hate that he's always portrayed as a snivelling coward since I find it very unlikely that James and Sirius would've put up with him if he was like that.

*** If Peter betrayed the Order because he was more sympathetic towards the cause of the Death Eaters, then good lord, more power to him. But I'm just really tired of seeing him being kicked around in fanfic. He's the disposable Death Eater, the moving target practice, the snivelling rat who valued his own skin so much he betrayed his best friends to get it. I mean, agree on Gryffindors not always being brave, but this is kinda, like, one of the defining moments of his character, and we're told at the Shrieking Shack "he would have killed me!" "Then you should have died!"

Please give me your opinions on Peter's complexity :)

Acutally doesn't Dumbledore say something on the lines of "We sort too soon" in regards to Snape? I guess while the hat can see your potential, only you can actually make that potential become something more?

*** I guess. I mean, it did pretty okay with regards to a lot of the other characters. I think of course most people will have a mix of all the house traits, and also I personally think (and have heard) that the hat takes values into account. So I could be sorted into Slytherin if I value ambition and subtlety and cunning, even if inside I'm a fluffy loyal Hufflepuff who can't stand to see people hurt.

I guess I just wanted to see other possible motivations for Pettigrew's betrayal. The "he would have killed me" explanation always seemed a little stupid to me. Why would Voldemort bother with a weak wizard like Pettigrew? Pettigrew would have flown so far under the radar he could have been in the middle of a battlefield and Voldemort wouldn't care one bit about him. By turning coat, he brought himself to the Dark Lord's attention - a stupid move if his motivations were to save his skin. So yeah, I wanted to see a headcanon where he really did love his friends.

*** And it's true Dumbledore was looking pretty scapegoat-y, but you see it in movies and other books all the time. The general of the war has to think about the overall outcome, not about the individual soldiers. If a brigade (Has anyone read Brigade's stories I love them so much not that that's relevant to this discussion at all) has to be sacrificed to win the war, then that's what he'll do, because countless other lives will be saved. Dumbledore tried to get them out, but he couldn't halt the plan just because they refused to go along with it (unknowingly). It's Sirius he really threw under the bus, but I guess that comes from reading so many fics where Dumbledore needed Harry with the Dursleys that it's become headcanon.
