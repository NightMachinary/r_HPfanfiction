Hey I'm writing a fanfic of my own and there are some parts where I just copy and paste from the original with barely any change. How do we feel about this? To be clear I only do this when I think it's necessary. Such as the memory scene in the second book where Diary Riddle shows the memory to Harry.


** It's generally disapproved of. Most people here have read the books, so copy-pasting scenes directly from it (especially more notable scenes like the memory one) will usually get some bad reactions from your readers. If you've seen fics that copy-paste the sorting hat song, reactions to that are a good example of what I mean.

I'd recommend one of two options. Either skip it and summarise ('The diary pulled him in and showed him this terrible scene. Hagrid! Hagrid was the killer!') or rewrite it in your own words (and maybe add in a twist to make it different).

*** Ok thank you, I think I might turn it into a small summary after reading all the comments.

** Most of the authors either rewrite the scene or they just mention it since, presumably, most people that read HP fanfiction have read the books already and know what the scene is about. I've also read a few fics where the dialog is indeed repeated word for word but a different mental perspective is included. Say for example, the whole situation either happens from Tom's or Hagrid's POV. In that case the words would still be the same but the thought process behind them would be different than what we get from Harry's POV.

*** I sort of went with the second option where the dialogue is the same but the perspective is different since he's different from canon Harry.

** 1. Give proper citation (I prefer a chapter number, to a page number).

2. Don't do it. All your readers already read the books (or at least saw the films), so many of them (me included) get pissed off when reading wades of text they already know (I scream anytime I have to read McGonagalls' speech on four houses of Hogwarts again). Just summarize it for readers to know what you mean, and possible add any differences. If your story plot turns around The Prophecy having “kill” instead of “vanquish”, you've got a problem, because nobody will do diff on your text versus the original one.

*** For copyright? Is that really necessary? Also I was more asking about how people felt about it in terms of writing but thank you for bringing this up.

**** Eh I don't mind as long as it's a small section copied but a few hundred words at a time is lazy writing

***** But I feel like the memory scene is necessary for the plot and I can't exactly change it... should I just make it into like a paragraph explaining what happened instead? I feel like that might ruin the flow. Thoughts?

****** Then re-write the scene in your own words. You can paraphrase it, summarize it, or put your own twist on the scene if you have to. Just make sure you use your own words.

** It's kind of lazy. I usually stop reading fics that do this. At least put the scenes in your own words.

** don't do that. we all read the books. just skip the scene entirely. we know what happens. summarize maybe, in a couple of sentences if you absolutely must. if you want to include the scene, then change it.

** Well, re-write that scene if the plot is different. If it's not (are you writing a canon rehash?) then just summarise it. But please don't copy and paste it.
