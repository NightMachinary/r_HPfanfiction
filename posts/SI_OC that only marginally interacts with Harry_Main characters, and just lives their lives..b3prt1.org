Would like to see more SI/OC stories in the HP fandom which arent just fix-it or wish fullfillment, Personally my idea would be an OC muggleborn who is 2 years older than HP, and upon attending Hogwarts, dealing with blood purists and learning of the previous war decides to dedicate their learning to skills that would be useful for living through another possible war.

** Sounds like linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes) The SI gets deaged to 11 years old and ends up in the Harry Potter world in Harry's first year. She gets sorted into Hufflepuff (much to her surprise and displeasure) and befriends a bunch of side characters. The only main character the SI interacts with is Hermione.

She does attempt to change the timeline for the better, but the changes don't always work out the way she thinks they will so she mostly focuses on learning magic.

*** Nice to see it starts in Hogwarts. A fair portion of SI fics spend so much time on the first few years as a kid that they never even get to the start of canon.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2748992]])

An SI/OC who doesn't interact with the characters or story at all. One shot.

  I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor.(A realistic attempt at an SI fic, with absolutely zero Mary-Sue-ishness).

** I wish the Harry Potter universe encouraged si/OC more. Since the story largely follows the golden trio in the early years to the exclusion all others, feels like there's no nice way to insert into that group early in.

*** Could always have a SI in the body of either Ron or Hermione. Would be interesting to see how the story would diverge if their talents were different as a result of this.
