:END:
I am looking for a story, but I can only remember that Hermione went back in time to the Marauders era and got together with Snape and things change for the better a lot of people who died survived. In the end they have a daughter and she is a seer and she can see auras I think and the people who died or were not born in the original time line look different to her including herself. I also think at the end they were getting her a wand.
