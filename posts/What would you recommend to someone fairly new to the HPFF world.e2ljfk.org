I have only been in the FF world for about a year, and I feel like I got spoiled early. I started on FloreatCastellum and then I moved on to White Squirrel - I haven't read anything by those two that I haven't liked if not loved. I went through their favorites and picked up some random stories that I really liked including: Strange Bedfellows, The Pranksters Apprentice, Thresholds, Browncoat / Green Eyes, and Lessons for Life. Some of the ones I've got and enjoyed from this sub: Starnlicht, Strange Visitors From Another Century, and Yule Ball Panic (and the sequels).

Stuff I couldn't get into: HPMOR (bailed out before the 3rd chapter), Harry McGonagall (Uffda, I didn't make it much past "wand locker"), I've read some of the Northumbrian and it's pretty hit or miss for me (hits: The Mind of Arthur Weasley - miss: Strangers from Drakeshaugh - though I'm determined to get through the first few chapters and see if it gets better).

​

Decent prose and solid story/relationship development are important. Beyond that, it's a bit up in the air. I prefer longer stuff to one-shots though that's obviously not necessary. I don't have a strong feeling on pairings so long as it's done well - so no need to tell me what the pairing is - I'd hate to be turned off because I don't like the idea of a pairing and miss out on a great story.


** It seems we have very similar taste, except I have apparently way bigger resistance to too long stories. Yes, 90%+ of all fanfic stories are in the desperate need of cutting. Most of them at least to the half, many even more. So, yes, although I like Strangers in Drakeshaugh (and its sequel James and Me) and I think Northumbrian is one of the best fanfic authors of all of them, the first five or so chapters are mostly about drinking tea, and they could be cut to one easily.

**** linkao3(1615616) and linkao3(3301733) are great, and I really like linkao3(1857084) from the big ones (unfortunately, its sequel linkao3(3068435) is unfinished and it has horribly long start, basically first four chapters should be cut out as a separate unrelated story, the detective story which follows is lovely, everybody must love Bobby Beadle!). Otherwise, Northumbrian is a true master of one-shots, the best ones are post-war and his main heroes (and heroines! his Lavender Brown is the best!) waking up with a terrible hangover are so real that I am afraid for his liver.

** My Top 5 Fics: copied from a comment I made a week ago.

1. Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now. But I have to preface that the story looks to be abandoned after 600k words and two complete Hogwarts years.
2. Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.
3. Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.
4. This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.
5. I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

*** You get an upvote for NoFP :). It's still a strong competitor for my favourite, with the only real drawback being that it's unfinished (not abandoned, but extremely slowly updating due to author health).

Sadly, fanfiction.net deleted it and wouldn't respond to inquiries about why or appeals to reinstate it :(. As far as I know, the only up-to-date version is the eBook (including a PDF version) at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest]]

I couldn't get into Meaning of One, though; Harry and Ginny's initial meeting didn't feel like it jelled. Maybe I'll try it again sometime.

Weird thing about FFN, I'm for some bizarre reason still able to read it on the iOS app up to chapter 43. (Though it's the only thing I can do with it, no favouriting or following.)

Yeah, that's probably the one thing I can agree being a lacklustre thing about the fic, though I'm able to take in stride while I know not everyone can. It's once the capabilities of the bond are revealed and explained that it begins to /really/ pick up.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/][Grow Young With Me:]] Harry likes coffee, a waitress likes Harry, chaos ensues. It's one of this sub's favourite stories, and for good reason. It's ongoing, and seems to be getting to the end, but it only updates once or twice a year, so that's a thing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/][Renascentia:]] Regulus Black survived the cave incident and fucked off to France, but returns to England after the events of Goblet of Fire to try and help stop Voldemort. He spends a lot of time bickering with Sirius. It's complete with an ongoing sequel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/][Black Luminary:]] The war with Voldemort never happened, magical British politics are fucked up, Harry was adopted by the Blacks and just wants to be a quiet nerd, but nobody will leave him alone. It's ongoing, but updates are getting fewer and further between.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux:]] The Horcrux in Harry's scar attains sentience and everybody is worse off for it. Spotty writing and a bad habit of sticking too closely to canon events, but it makes up for it with wonderful characterisations of pretty much everybody. It's complete with a recently abandoned sequel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/][The Merging:]] Harry's encounter with the dementors in OotP goes differently, leading to an AU take on years five and six that might just be the best I've ever read, despite some pretty big problems I have with it. It's one chapter, plus two epilogues, away from being finished, but it hasn't updated in over a year, and as far as I know, the author hasn't given any sort of time frame for when to expect the conclusion.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom:]] A massive AU in which Voldemort won the war and Britain looks /very/ different as a result. Sadly abandoned, but well worth the read, regardless.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9666689/1/][A Beautiful Collision]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/][Departure from the Diary]] (I'm putting these together because of their similar premises): Harry/fem!diary!Riddle starting at the end of second year. Both are solid, though the ABC focuses more on characterisation while the Departure places a lot of emphasis on explaining how magic works. The former is on a /very/ long hiatus, the latter is actively updating.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10639968/1/Negligentia][Negligentia:]] Harry's brother is the Boy-Who-Lived, their parents survive, Voldemort (seemingly; it's never really made clear) actually dies in the attack. Years later, an adult Harry reflects on how badly his parents neglected him and how he managed to get past it. It's complete with two sequels, but I personally don't think they add much.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356003/1/A-Most-Peculiar-Girl][A Most Peculiar Girl:]] I belatedly realised that a lot of these recs are pretty heavy, so here's a (mostly) fluffy one shot to round things out. Daphne Greengrass very much does not want to have friends, and Harry annoys her until she rethinks her stance on the issue.

** Blood Magic by GatewayGirl - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

It is an old story, it was written before HBP came out and IMO it is still one of the best "Snape is Harry's father" fics around.

And if you are up for a challenge pairing-wise, consider [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422/chapters/9661617][Fate is a four letter word by Philo]]. Note that many people are turned off by the pairing (I was too and refused to read it for years), but the writing is really good and it is an excellent "who-dune-it" spy/conspiracy fic.

**** Yeah, it is also one of my least favourite parts of the fic. But Harry no longer being angry at Snape is a pre-requisite for the rest of the fic to happen, which is a bond between Harry and Snape.

Being a typical moody and angry teenager Harry blames Snape for not teaching him. Harry accepting some responsibility (he did not do his homework and basically refused to learn) is a sign of growing up. Yes, Snape is no angel either - and this is one of the reasons why I love this fic so much. He is still ambigous and grey, he talks openly with Harry about nasty stuff he is done, yet he cares for Harry and would go to great lengths to protect him.

** I'll second Pureblood Pretense, and Harry Potter And The Prince of Slytherin. Note that the latter gets better in the second year imo. I agree some stuff in Harry McGonagall irked me though, if it's the fic I'm thinking of, unlike the person whom initially recommend those two. I'll also second Lily and the art of being Sisyphus.

Some others

Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by Santi, a classic, but sadly abandoned. Gets pretty far though.

Backwards with Purpose - second most popular time travel fic after nightmares.

What's Her Name In Hufflepuff - best HP si fic imo

Harry Potter Et Al and the Keystone Council - really interesting concept

Alexandra Quick series - completely original plot and lots of interesting world building

linkffn(12979337;5353809;13041698;4101650;3964606)

Your loss. It's a good fic. I honestly don't know what possible problem you could have with the words "wand" and "locker". Prince of Slytherin gets recommended here all the time. The Pureblood Pretense is also awesome. Since you don't have a lot of requirements you can also check out the accounts of LeQuin, Bobmin and kb0 and see if any of the summaries catch your eye.

*** It wasn't the word "wand" and "locker" it was "wand locker", like foot locker - as though the American Wizarding World got started in the 90s. I got to the first meeting of Harry and Hermione and it was just a bit much. Immediately they're planning the freeing house elves and they both happen to agree on everything. Plus 5 year old Harry getting his wand and the woman behind the counter being cute and him being embarrassed by it and teased about it by his sister who's 4 - it was a lot of kids talking several years above where they actually are and the it was all a bit cutesy.

It's a shame because I wanted to like it, if for no other reason than the writer is from the same area that I grew up.
