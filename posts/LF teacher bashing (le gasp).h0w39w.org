I have recently read a few fics where all the teachers bad traits were amplified, yet they were never punished for their bad behaviour. So now im looking for fics where there are consequenses!

Mcgonagall sends first years to the forbidden forest at night to find what is killing unicorns? -endangerment of children! Tell the prophet

Snape bullies children? Let the parents/prophet know.

Dumbledore sends the students to tge commonrooms when there is a troll on the loose? !panic!

All sorts of fics where the teachers bad decisions that out the students in danger/bullies them are reported to parents/the prophet/whatever and their actions have consequenses of some sort.


** The Centaur Was Late linkao3(981393) What if, during that detention looking for a unicorn killer, Firenze arrived just a few minutes later?

It's unfinished and the later chapters fall into some cartoon villainy pitfalls, but stop reading at the end of chapter 5 and you'll be right.

** There's some of that in the Accidental Animagus.

Also in the Yule Ball Panic series McGonagall gets called out and ends up siding with the students against Fumbles.
