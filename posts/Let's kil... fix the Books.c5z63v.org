This post is inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byzpj7/the_older_i_get_the_more_im_bothered_by_just_how/][another one]] that highlights plot holes in the Books.

‚Äã

Let's have some fun and try to fix them. As a consequence, I think, it'll also demonstrate that fixing those holes will destroy the Series as we know it.

‚Äã

Let's begin :-)

‚Äã

My part (each point is a different scenario):

- Let's start with many years before the main story: death of Myrtle Warren was property investigated, Tom Riddle Jr. was caught, found guilty and was thrown into Azkaban;
- Dumbledore was active in the First War from the beginning. After several confrontations either Riddle killed him and won (Lily didn't attended Hogwarts or was persecuted as muggleborn) or lost (got killed or captured) long before Harry was born;
- Dumbledore interviewed Trelawney in his office in Hogwarts. No prophesy, because there's no trigger (Snape couldn't listen it). James didn't survived the 4th meeting with Riddle, after his death Lily took Harry and left the country;
- Weasley twins found the Marauder's map, but couldn't activate it (Snape couldn't do it);
- Ok, they activated it and saw Pettigrew. There are different scenarios including Pettigrew killing them during confrontation, escaping or being captured. In any case the Third year didn't happen.
- Let's move in the story. Dumbledore didn't hide the Stone in the school. There was no need for a troll in the dungeons and therefore Hermione didn't become friends with Harry and Ron;
- Dumbledore properly investigated the first attack in the Second year (searched students for dark artefacts?) and found the Diary.

‚Äã

Your turn ;-)


** Three years after Voldemort's defeat in Halloween 1981, Dumbledore decided that the Ministry couldn't be trusted to carry out justice against Death Eaters and dismantle Voldemort's sadistic genocidal terrorist network.

As the first step, he riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault, as the Longbottoms found ample sympathy among the public and in the Wizengamot. In addition to gold, Dumbledore also obtained the Cup, and could start the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, since Lucius Malfoy didn't have the time to corrupt nearly as many in the Ministry as in canon. Lucius was found guilty of possessing many dark artifacts, including the forbidden Death Eater regalia, and received 20 years in Azkaban. Most of Malfoy fortune ended in Dumbledore's and Minister Bagnold's coffers. Dumbledore further obtained the Diary.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, and Remus could definitely use more gold to hire some werewolves, and send the pack after Greyback? *Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective.*

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM mean. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‚Äòdonate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

‚ÄúAh dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned ones like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, to allow arrests of more escaped Death Eaters, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Wizengamot thereby has sentenced Gaius Avery, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Walden MacNair, Adolphus Travers, Markus Selwyn, and Corban Yaxley to death through the Veil for mass murders, mass tortures, multiple counts of rapes, conspiracy to overthrow the Ministry, reckless endangerment of the Statute of Secrecy, and high treason. The Wizengamot has further judged, given the heinous nature of their atrocities and crimes, that ALL their assets, including gold, properties, businesses, among others, shall be seized and their victims shall be compensated.‚Äù

** I don't think "characters are more passive than I would like" is really a plot hole, but glossing over that point...

What I would really like to see is a fanfic which doesn't come down on either side of "the Order should be passive" vs. "the Order should be more proactive", but rather depicts this problem with all its real-world complexity.

Just taking three examples from modern times:

- Iraq/Afghanistan. Western powers entered these wars with an liberal interventionist mindset: "These countries are shit, we're going to use force to make them better." Everything went to shit.

- Libya. Western powers entered this war with semi-interventionist mindset: "This country is shit, but we won't repeat the mistakes of Iraq. We'll just provide support for local revolutionary forces." Everything went to shit.

- Syria. Western powers approached this conflict with an isolationist mindset: "This country is shit, but we've learnt that intervening just makes things worse." Everything went to shit.

In short: the world is shit, and it's naive to think that making it better is simply a matter of being more proactive or passive. When it comes to war, no matter what option you choose, probably the result is going to be chaos and instability.

**** Well, Iraq and Afghanistan quickly became guerrilla warfare rather than conventional wars, and both Libya and Syria were/are civil wars, so I think there's definitely some useful lessons to be learnt.

My referencing those particular wars was really just as illustrative examples, however. The more general point I was making is that intervening more does not always result in a better outcome. There is such a thing as a no-win scenario.

In wizarding terms, for example, one can easily imagine a scenario where Dumbledore is convinced to take a more proactive approach, increasingly acting as a law to himself in order to defeat Voldemort... which promptly results in large numbers of wizards flocking to Voldemort to defend them from the would-be tyrant Dumbledore. The average wizard's view becomes some variation of "they're all just as bad as each other" - a false equivalency that should be familiar to anyone who has been following recent American political discourse.

***** In HP world as we know it the wars aren't between orgatizations, but between individuals. The war with Grindelwald, both wars with Riddle - all of them ended with a demise of the single person.

Dumbledore didn't need to become the Law, he needed just to take care of Riddle.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Tom wouldn't have been caught. There was no way to catch him and no one would suspect him. Hagrid might be absolved, but that does little to change the story.

The map was charmed not to work for Snape and the twins 100% die if they go after him.

Voldemort didn't start his war until the early 70s. At least at the beginning, Lily would attend Hogwarts.

As for the attack, well wands would be checked and when they found nothing Riddle would place his diary in the Room of Hidden Things. There's nothing to suggest an artifact can petrify either.

Now /cracks knuckles/ I like the idea of the twins finding Peter. They go to Dumbledore, who remembers the nicknames. He goes to Lupin, who confesses. Sirius' is questioned, they check his wand, he gets a trial. He's free. 1st and 2nd year happen. 3rd and 4th year don't. Time skip. BCJ wakes up, kills his father, and go finds his master. Triwizard tourney at Durmstrang/Beauxbatons year 7. Harry goes. Karkaroff is imperiused. Voldemort returns. Big boy Harry, his gf Fleur, and Sirius against Voldemort.

Really all you have to do is make canon characters more gray and proactive after GOF. Harry used Dark magic in anger. Imagine a Harry mentored by Crouch, Bones, Slughorn, or Moody.

Why? There's also ghost of Myrtle herself. Her testimony points to a male student of 5-6th year. Then with help of portraits all with alibi are dismissed, those without it are investigated in details.

It wouldn't be an easy work, but it's doable. Especially when a student died in the school.

**** Her testimony points to a male. "5-6th year" and "student" is what we know. And if Tom Riddle was skilled enough to modify his uncle's memory mere days to weeks later, I doubt he'd be so careless as to be seen entering and exiting the bathroom. Furthermore, he was a prefect, beloved by the headmaster and head of house, and I don't think his gang of friends wouldn't provide a necessary alibi.
