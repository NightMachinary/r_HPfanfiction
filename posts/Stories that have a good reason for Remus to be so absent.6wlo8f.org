Remus perhaps couldn't have raised Harry properly -- at least not alone -- but he could have visited. He didn't.

What fics have an actual, non-crud reason for him to be absent from Harry's childhood? Bonus points if it doesn't include Dumbledore plying loyalty charms / compulsions; bonus points if it either explains or fixes him not talking to Harry much during or after second year.


** I don't have a recommendation for you, but I always assumed he was just so done with life. From his perspective, three of his best friends were killed and one turned out to be a Death Eater all on the same night. That would probably turn me into an alcoholic.

*** I believe I've read at least one fic where he admits he spent a year or two in a bottle and then couldn't find Harry. Unfortunately, the reason behind that was Dumbledore being manipulative.

*** Not to mention he was probably homeless for a good amount of that time, moving from one job to the next. Really not a good environment for a kid if he did end up taking Harry in.

** I usually assume that JKR simply wanted the "old friend of your dead parents shows up" trope, and didn't think it through. On the other hand, Remus is willing to abandon his pregnant wife to join the trio on the Horcrux hunt, so maybe he has some issues with responsibility.

As a potential reason, one can assume that the blood protection kept dangerous creatures like werewolves out and away.
