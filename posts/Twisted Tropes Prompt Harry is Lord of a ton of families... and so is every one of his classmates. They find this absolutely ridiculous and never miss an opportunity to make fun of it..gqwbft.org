With the dedication to stupidity only possible for bored teenagers, they always call each other "Your Lordship" or "My Lady" alongside their plethora of titles. When they're dating, they announce courtships and "marriage contracts", while breakups are followed by declaring their new "blood feuds". Bonus points if it's from the perspective of their irritated teachers. Extra bonus points if, when some students take it too seriously, the rest form an *actual* corrupt aristocracy dealing in candy bribes and prank "assassinations" to take the joke even further.

** (Well, this got longer than I intended)

.

At age 15, a witch or wizard would receive their Lordship or Ladyship, should they be the heir to a prominent House. For a long time, that had been synonym with being the firstborn of the primary branch of a well-established family.

But the war against Voldemort had taken its toll. Harry Potter, the Boy-who-lived, had brought peace to the wizarding world, but not even a miracle child could bring back the dead. Entire families had been decimated in the span of a single generation, their political power gone.

But nothing is ever truly lost.

.

It started with Malfoy. The little ferret had been smug for months, knowing his next birthday present would be a Malfoy Lord ring. When the day finally came, the golden trio had considered skipping breakfast, but Ron's stomach disagreed, so Harry and Hermione made the sacrifice.

Aside from obviously-packaged birthday presents, they were expecting a single letter. Something simple, but elegant, big enough to contain the Malfoy Heir Ring that Malfoy would rub in everyone's faces for months to come. The were not expecting the veritable /mountain/ of letters that fell into his head with the sound of clattering metal. Even Malfoy looked confused, as he started opening them one by one. It was hard to tell from where they were, but it seemed like each letter contained a small metallic object.

A few days later, it happened again. A Hufflepuff girl their age was drowned in clinking letters and exited breakfast with more rings than she had fingers.

It happened again the next week to a Ravenclaw, and a few days after that to another Slytherin, and they finally got their answer to this mystery on Hermione's birthday.

Once again the trio had been expecting letters and birthday packages, and once again they had been surprised by the mountain of unexpected letters. She opened one, an ornate bronze ring with a blue gemstone fell out, and she read out loud.

"'Lady Hermione Granger, congratulations on your fifteenth birthday. You have been found to be the last surviving heiress of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Ravenclaw', wait, what?? 'Enclosed is a ring passed down through generations and enchanted originally by Rowena Ravenclaw herself. Please wear it at all times, as it is one of the duties of the Ravenclaw heiress, as well as an ancient contract establishing a marriage to the heir of house Pendragon' okay, what the bloody hell-"

Harry and Ron opened the other letters, each containing a similarly unique ring, establishing Hermione as a last surviving heiress to an ancient house, instructions on how to behave as an heiress, and a marriage contract or two.

Harry scratched his head at one of them. "Isn't there a Selwyn in our class? Why are you the heiress to house Selwyn and not her?"

She pointed out a passage, "because three generations ago the Matron stipulated the heiress needed to have brown hair."

"Oh, is that why you also own the Greengrass Summer Mansion?"

"No, see here, the Greengrass Summer Mansion goes to the nearest Gryffindor-sorted heiress of Ravenclaw who can do a pirouette."

Ron suddenly burst into laughter. "Merlin's beard! Hermione, this one says you're the heir of house Pendragon! You're married to yourself!"

She stuffed a pumpkin tart into his mouth, but couldn't contain her own giggles.

And so the weeks continued, with once every few days a new kid from their class being showered in Lordships and rings and long-forgotten estates.

Even Ron, despite his many older brothers, became Lord Knight, after Adrianus Knight had established in 1642 that his heir needed to be a ginger who could beat the miniature chess game embedded in his Heir Ring.

By the time Harry Potter had been declared heir to the Potter, Black, Slytherin, Peverell, Gryffindor, Emrys and LeFay, it was barely news anymore.

*** Maybe it's the resurrecting of extinct titles that they find ridiculous. In canon, Zacharius Smith is gently mocked for making such a big deal out of being descended from Helga Hufflepuff. The purebloods have grown up knowing what the major families are, probably knowing what major families used to be before dying out.

So Harry being Lord Peverell could be funny to them, because "everyone knows" the Potters are the Peverell heirs and it's pretentious to insist on an outdated title. The equivalent of Smith's boasting about nine generations of pureblood ancestry: everyone of "good breeding" already knows that.

***** Actually there wouldn't be equal claims, as in Britain (when HP took place and talking about nobility titles, how royalty goes is different (as back then and before 2011 females could become Queens if they didn't have brothers), but only males can have nobility titles that are inherited) it would always go to oldest son, if those men didn't have sons, it would go to their brother (if no brothers then uncles and so on untill the next direct male decendant from the first person to have the title had straight male line, if brothers where death but they had sons it would go to those sons, same with any other one, it would go to the next in line, if htey where dead it would go to their son, or grandson etc).

If the man had a daughter instead of a son, it would also go to same way to the closest male relatives, if there where no more direct male lines left only females (who can have sons), it would go abeyand, untill all other lines that ended because of females being last ones (once again they themselves can have sons, just that it isn't straight male line anymore) died out and then the one left, if they or their decendants had a boy, that boy would inherit the title, female's couldn't inherit them, so it could have to wait for really long time, as all other lines have to die out...

So in this case Neville and Ron would never had same claim to title, as they are not the most senior male line of the family, as Potter's would be from Preverells (though as Voldemorts mom's fmaily is decended from the second brother, Voldy's grandfather might be more direct, if there is a full line of males before him and it didn't go though from say 2nd Prevell brothers granddaughter, though Harry would still be before Voldy as he has propably straight male line, unlike Voldy whose is related through his mother). And even with Ron, he could never inherit the title himself, as all his brothers would be in line before him.

*** I think there's a way to make it work - one that readily comes to mind for me would be in a scenario where Voldemort/Riddle takes a /bit/ more political power, and wanting to make himself more officially descended from Slytherin, passes a law relaxing inheritance standards /just/ enough to make the Slytherin title descend down rightfully to him.

And, in the process, forgets that the same law would apply to everyone - suddenly inundating the WW with all these formally deceased titles getting new rules for inheritance.
