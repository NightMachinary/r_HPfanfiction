But Percy's letters for back up to deal with their mother led to Some thing a little bit different after his eldest brothers flew the coop. Bill worked full-time in Egypt and Charlie was out in the backwoods of Romania but With their combined wages they manage to purchase a small apartment in Magical Paris. Just large enough to accommodate beds for seven children and a wreck room that was the perfect place to relax After dealing with Molly Weasley all day. A bag of floo powder Appeared by owl every week over the summer delivered directly to Percy when he was running errands for the village apothecary just to keep their mother unaware of the deliveries. Percy gave a small bag of the powder every one of his siblings even little Ginny. Once she was old enough to safely use the fireplace solo that is.Your mother Molly Thankfully assumed they were just out in the shed or flying whenever they made their escape in the evening. The escape route To the apartment in Paris was used so frequently That they just started saying “see you in Paris to each other in the evenings”. Things got a bit more complicated when their mother started asking questions as to why ginny and Ron were suddenly fluent in French. Percy Had managed to come up with a convincing lie about having a penpal in Leon And asking Ron and Ginny to right to them For him when he was preoccupied with exams so they were learning French writing to his friend. His mother had been a bit skeptical but eventually bought the story after Percy bribed Penelope Clearwater to write a few letters and send them to him over the summer imperfect French not that his mother would know the difference she didn't know a word of the language of romance.

The twins eventually convinced Bill to purchase the apartment adjacent to their escape roo, To establish a potions lab as the underage magic laws and magical Paris we're a bit different Then In London. By the time Percy graduated his ambitions were no longer bound to The British ministry and no Weasley was surprised besides their mother When he took a clerkship With the ICW International magical legal division. Percy was a bureaucrat through and through but he had Developed a taste for international law. Charlie had caused up a storm when He next tried to transport dragon eggs across the French German border, The four new forms in triplicate that were required by customs glowed with the red tape attached to them and The language screamed Percy like nothing he had seen before. Charlie couldn't decide between being proud or annoyed with his brother as he filled out the forms the customs clerk would remember even years later at the mad redhead that was grinning with pride but had eyes glowing With familial irritation When he was informed about the new dragon handling custom forms within the European Union. Percy got a howler that same evening along with a new quill set With a pot of red ink, And a note of congratulations from his brothers.

As the years passed little surprise was shown when the twins established their joke shop in France instead of Britain the international arm of Weasley's wizard wheezes Was greeted with international acclaim though the students at Hogwarts had to settle for Owl post orders from the joke shop Which was a bittersweet Moment for the younger Weasley's .

​

when all hell broke loose And war erupted in Britain, With Ron and his friends on the run there wasn't just a homegrown rebellion from The Weasley's living in Magical Britain, Ron Manage to get a letter to Bill at his home in Paris with his new wife Fleur, And the older Weasley brothers came home But Brought an Army with them. Percys Connections with the international community came and handy And so did a few of the dragons Charlie smuggled in that the bureaucrats in the European Union conveniently missed. Thanks to anything with the name Weasley attached Was Automatically filed in the” T “cabinet , Right next to the bins.

​

This time round Harry did slay Voldemort on the Hogwarts grounds but they had the death eaters outnumbered 10 to one and the Predominant language being spoken among the victors was an irate French as Hitwizards and Aurors. Along with the order of the Phoenix went into battle. Lead in part by a host of angry gingers. Molly Weasley finally stopped complaining about the French after one of the hitwizards stopped a wall from Collapsing on Fred. But no one ever mentions the Parisian escape room to their mother.

​

Though the fact that half the Weasley clan stayed in france after the war was an indication That the room still exists. When Ginny joined the Holy head harpies after her seventh year their mother finally threaten To move to France if another one of her children relocated there,

Ginny The dutiful daughter that she was obliged her mothers request and Bought an apartment in Oslo Norway instead. Ron stayed in Britain with Hermione and Harry but only because the Continent couldn't contend with another Weasley.


** Ah yes, running away from home with your siblings. Lying to your parents. What a reasonable way to deal with an overbearing and loving mother.

**** We had some "Death Eater Ron", "Love Potion Queen Ginny" and "Violent husband Bill", I'm sure someone can tweak Arthur and Molly enough to make them abusive.

***** Why would Molly and Arthur need to be abusive? Helicopter moms exist. Sometimes kids need a break from overbearing parents So setting up was is effectively a treehouse game room for the Weasleys doesn't seem like much of a stretch. Canon Molly and Arthur are good loving parents but Molly does complain and nag her kids a lot about their life choices so it natural for the character in the prompt to need a little break from their mom.
