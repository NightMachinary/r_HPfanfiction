The ships I most want to read are 1. Hermione/Ginny/Luna, 2. Hermione/Ginny, 3. Hermione/Luna, 4. Ginny/Luna

Most of what I can find is just PWP and I'd really like to see if there's a developed story I'm missing with any of these. I feel like they'd have a great dynamic as a triad, but I can't find anything plot based.


** linka03([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) i really enjoy this Luna/Hermione fic longest fic with them i can fin at almost 200k there is a few scenes of smut in there im afraid buts it not all sweary and pronograhic if that helps? its petty light and humour with everything and the foucs is really cute fluffy nonsense with luna and hermione mainly...though its has gotten darker recently with bellatrix lestrange being added.

*** That sounds great. The reason I dont want smut is bc so many rarepair fics are just "what would happen if they had (badly written) sex?" So as long as smut isn't the main focus, I'll definitely give it a try. Thanks so much

**** There are maybe 4 or 5 chapters out of the 31 atm which have smut and even then the scenes are pretty short and tame with very little swearing or graphic descrptions. The main focus is Luna and Hermione being really cute girlfriends haha i wish there were more really long Luna/Hermione but theres really only this and crazy little things :( linka03([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990/chapters/5726924]])

  Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

**** In that case:

Linkffn(13053403; 10798339)

The first is a light hearted oneshot I wrote after reading the second story. Not an epic tale of interwoven arcs, but a simple get-together story. Some humour and my attempt at writing Hermione as a more realistic character as opposed to the rather shallow characterisation found in books 1,2,6 and 7.

As for Dignity in Fear, I love that story but I also hate it. The author has a superb depiction of emotions, second to none. Honestly, I haven't seen anything even remotely close to it. But she also inserts her own views, which makes chapters 24-27 utter garbage. It's a not even disguised insert on LGBT solidarity which feels utterly out of place. Harry is practically non existent and while it makes sense in the first few chapters, it does not after 22. Nonetheless, the last one was a step back in the right direction and if nothing else, you can read chapters 1-23 and consider it a completed OOTP story.

  If anybody would have told Hermione a week ago that she'd find herself enamoured after a shared kebab, she would have pointed the person towards St. Mungos' ward for permanent spell damage.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
