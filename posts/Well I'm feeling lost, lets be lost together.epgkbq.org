Well another fic read and another reason for feeling broken by it being not updated in over 2 years. I was reading Son of Potter, Daughter of Black [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653847/1/Son-of-Potter-Daughter-of-Black]] and it is honestly such a good read but unfortunately not completed. Its got great characterisation and well written, and some pairings that you don't always see.

So in my misery what are some fics you guys have read that are really good but not been completed and why do you love them so much?


** I am a big fan of the of the idea of Petunia's redemption and reconciliation with Harry. There is NONE well written fiction which would do that well (also, there are no well written Snape redemption stories, but that's another issue and the one I am not that much interested in), and there are really few of them which would have at least half-decent portrayal of Petunia.

So, I was really excited when I found about the story “Terms of Matrimony” by Galad Estel (this is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][review of it]] on my blog, because finding the text itself is a bit difficult and I have links there). I really liked the setup, the development of the story, and then suddenly in the last two chapters the story went completely 180° to other direction, and ended up suddenly.

Otherwise, of course, we all have a long list of stories which we liked only to find that they are unfinished (sometimes even grotesquely so, when many, e.g., linkffn(8429437) end with promise that next chapters are already written and will certainly be published).

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** !linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation) is an absolutely amazing mentor!Voldemort fic where he kidnaps Harry at the end of first year and resurrects himself. It puts a lot more complexity onto Voldemort's motivations and actually makes the Order and Flamel into extremely competent antagonists

!linkffn(Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance) is one of the only good soul bond fics out there, and it was abandoned two-thirds of the way through.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
