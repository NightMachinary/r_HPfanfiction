** And make her completely invisible and unnoticeable? No thank you.

It would be much safer to just put her office under a fidelius. Or the Great Hall, if they could manage to get the secret to everyone else. Or the RoR, if they wanted to be practical.

**** Oh, that's okay then. As long as someone is watching to remove it if she gets past the existential crisis and starts being sneaky.

*** That brings up the question, what would happen if she was inside her office when the fidelius is cast, but isn't told the secret? Would she be unable to perceive the room in anyway and thus be forever trapped inside it?

***** The trick is to have someone knock her unconscious, then the secret keeper goes on the Wizarding Wireless and reveals to everyone that she does, in fact, have limbs.

Now she wriggles around everywhere while people try, and fail, to convince her she could just get up and walk.

** Or maybe the fact that she is a person, and then after fidelius-ing the fact that she is a person, convince her she is a frog. And then, cause her to become deaf for a short amount of time. During that time, announce to everyone that she is a person. Or fidelius her name, her titles, and her position, except for her position as a defense teacher. Also, fidelius the fact that she is able to assign detentions. Announce to everyone in Hogwarts the secret, as only the secret keeper can share it. Then just watch Umbridge move around not knowing her name. Then you could tell her that her name is "Toady Awful Toad" and she would believe you. Then, send her to class, and she would introduce herself as Professor Awful Toad, and no one would be able to tell her that her name is actually Umbridge, as it is under the Fidelius. Oh, and fidelius the subject she teaches, so she just knows she is a teacher, and fidelius the fact that she hates all houses except for Slytherin. Then tell her that her subject is how to be a proper toad. Then, when she introduces herself, she would say, " I am professor Awful Toad, and I teach how to be a proper toad at Hogwarts, but you can call me Toady." Of course this is more complicated than necessary..
