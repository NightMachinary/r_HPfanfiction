Even if it's a mega weird fic to begin with that just suddenly did a 180 on you.


** I can't recall the name of the fic but Snape and Dumbledore are talking in the headmaster's office and all of a sudden Dumbledore goes over to his computer to contact someone.

I kid you not.

I was completely lost. I remember going back and rereading the whole thing, checking the tags, rubbing out my eyes to be sure they weren't playing tricks on me. Otherwise normal Hogwarts fic, just with a casually brought up and never again mentioned computer in Dumbledore's office.

*** That reminds me of linkffn(A Promise to Be Better by Raven Dancer). That story was weird anyway, but the fact that there were computers, emails and doctors was more than a little weird.

Then you've got the fact that it starts out rather reasonable, with Dumbledore requesting that Snape maybe try to be a better teacher, only to veer off into cuddling, sharing a bed (oddly not in an explicitly sexual way), and Snape playing with a rubber ducky.... I read the whole thing from sheer fascination, and I'm still not quite sure how I feel about it.

There were some weird vibes at times, but then suddenly about 300k words into a (what is now) 900k story, Voldemort is pulling down Harry's pants and blowing him. Noped out so fast. Of course after I wasted several days reading it, the author changes the summary to reflect that it was slash.

1) normal story. Harry decides to take charge of his life. This goes on for many chapters. Decides to go to bank to see if the goblins can help. He is in the office, his account manager realizes that he is going to lose control of the money. Kills harry. No backlash from the other goblins because it was just a wizard after all. Story ends. .\\
2) I don't even remember the plot. Ends with dumbledore substituting for a teacher. Discussion turns to why muggles have to change and why wizards don't. Dumbledore replies, it is magic. Then the story ends with an abstinence like talk about how magic doesn't like and punishes premarital sex, sexual infidelity, and how magic real hates homosexuality. Seamus gets real pale on the last part.

There is literally a scene where Harry is forcefully strapped to a bed and raped for /hours/ by /dozens/ of witches, mostly his age! Hermione ends up saving him and Harry is pretty much completely comatose, but literally four lines later he's right as rain and it's never mentioned again.

  Many people think that I may have gone over the top with how the girls have acted. I have read many accounts of real life teenage idols and rock stars who have to have a large guard force to protect them from screaming frantic fans. Many former teenage idols have published memoirs of being stripped, groped and assaulted by wild uncontrollable teenage girls.

  In my story, Harry is famous, rich and good looking. He is even more famous because of his pictures, and viewed as even more rich because he is viewed with gold, and his good looks are enhanced by his nudity. Add in the "bad boy" nudity and you have all the elements there for a major teenage idol. Hogwarts is full of girls the right age to be teeny boppers and groupies. It seems to be a natural situation to me.

******* I think it might have been the catalyst do to speak. This fic is what immediately came to mind when I read your title. Just so bizarre and out of nowhere.

I had this feeling with jbern's The Lie I've Lived. It's a good story no doubt, and the scene in question isn't nearly as out there as Harry's Golden Nuggets, but it definitely left a lasting impression on me, and he never went back to it and it was never really resolved.

The scene I'm talking about is where it talks about how Snape was polyjuicing himself as Sirius to have sex with his girlfriend(s) and actually ends up getting one pregnant. Something about the entire situation just makes my blood cold, and it was never actually resolved in the story, as if it wasn't this massive invasion of privacy or even rape really.

It sort of struck me as odd because it's a rather dark plot point in an otherwise /fairly/ lightish story.

I vaguely remember reading The Lie I've Lived and not ever wanting to reread it and I think that might have been why. Seems to happen a lot in fics and it's probably due to the way they're written. Like i've definitely thought "I wonder how often people abuse polyjuice for sex/turn into their SO for a bit of fun" when reading the books/fanfiction and I can see why you might write a scene like that if you're a writer and it popped into your head whilst writing a fic about polyjuice.

** linkffn(Nightmare by Provocative Envy).

This fanfiction is particularly infamous in the sub-community that happens to ship Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger together. However, to me, this story's plot and pacing are all over the place.

It starts off as your standard "Hermione goes back in time" trope or cliché, and, as expected, Tom Riddle isn't exactly attracted to her [at first]. The author, in fact, writes Riddle as being "completely disinterested in girls", and practically asexual, even after he meets Hermione. However, over a relatively quick period of time, Riddle does a complete 180-degree-Heel-Face-Turn, and goes from "not attracted to Hermione at all", to "I want to screw her brains out".

On top of that, after he sleeps with Hermione for the first time, Riddle immediately does /another/ 180-degree-Heel-Face-Turn from "oh my God, we didn't use protection, cue panic mode" to "I should knock Hermione up, it would make her stay in my time if I use reproductive coercion". One of the lines Riddle writes into his Diary in the story is all but identical from the Wikipedia page on forms of said coercion: "If you have a baby, you will never have to worry about me leaving you. I will always be around."

**** I absolutely agree, and I feel the same about /Nightmare/. I think the smut is well-written, barring the use of profanity every few words, but as soon as the pregnancy plot commences, the story falls to pieces for me. I also refuse believe that Hermione would be dumb enough to /not use any sort of protection/, and I found that aspect not only incredibly OOC for Hermione, used by the author to shoehorn in the pregnancy plot, but it also broke my suspension of disbelief as a reader.

Not to mention, it's not like contraception was completely unheard of in the 1940's. Even in the Muggle world, there were condoms, spermacides and cervical caps (exact name of which I forget). All those were still available when the pill and IUD became available. You can read more about such historical methods [[http://absolutewrite.com/forums/showthread.php?266911-Birth-control-in-1940s][here]].

** Gotta be when Partially Kissed Hero just randomly becomes an Alice In Wonderland crossover. I didn't mind it, but that's a good example of a fic that starts out normal during the first chapter, and then just piles on the weirdness. Eventually I think it even gets too strange for the author and just ends without explanation after over 400000 words. I wouldn't call it a bad fic particularly, it's just...really really eccentric.

** Probably linkffn(Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987). The story begins as a pretty bog-standard "Voldemort's possession makes Harry badass, Ron and Hermione betray him, he finds new friends, starts dating Daphne, and becomes made of win," sort of thing that was a staple of the Indy!Harry tics of old. Sure, it got a bit weird with [[/spoiler][Harry and Draco becoming allies, with unbreakable vows to help one another off Voldemort and Dumbledore]], but it was semi-plausible for the (flawed) story.

After Harry wins, it devolves into an incredibly bland, 100k-word curb-stomp with Harry crowning himself Emperor of the magical world.
