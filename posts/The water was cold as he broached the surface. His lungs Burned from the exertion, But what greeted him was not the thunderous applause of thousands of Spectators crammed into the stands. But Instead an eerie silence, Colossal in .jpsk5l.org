#+TITLE: The water was cold as he broached the surface. His lungs Burned from the exertion, But what greeted him was not the thunderous applause of thousands of Spectators crammed into the stands. But Instead an eerie silence, Colossal in its vast emptiness Without even it whisper To Perforate it.

The forbidden forest seemed to have encroached onto the pebbles and grass that bordered the Lake, Harry looked left and right Hermione and Ron were nowhere in sight, Gabrielle Delacour Was also conspicuously absent.

The strange vastness around him seemed to pulse with light, aS he caught a shadow Flickering along the bank to his right. A swishing of cloak And a whisper of a giggle. He started swimming towards the noise his legs aching with the effort, He had been in this water for what felt like centuries but what he knew was only an hour.

As he reached the shore and pebbles cut into his feet he saw a woman just before him . Leaning against one of the trees, Smiling conspiratorially at him. Her silver hair complimented The Violet of her irises, the woman just shook her Head at him and tutted in his direction.

As Harry opened his mouth," Where the bloody hell are we ?"

The woman just Chuckled and looked at her wrist watch before responding ," Nowhere Harry, we are just waiting for a decision. As you can't go back to where you were originally. "

Harry barely go the word," What " passed his lip when the world around him began to shift, And he fell to his knees in agony his scar pounding.

The woman just smiled Reassuringly clearly amused and mildly relieved to not have to babysit the boy in front of her much longer. She Offered no answers or explanation just a parting," Have fun Mr. Potter. And do mind your head. The body you will be inhabiting Is a Tad bit taller than you're used to, Proper nutrition as a child you understand."

Harry only got a grunt in , Before the Earth swallowed him whole, And he woke up a few moments later. With a girl standing over him holding a bucket of ice water, Her emerald eyes a mirror image of his own. The girl about 11 cried over her shoulder , " Dad I got him! I won this time."

And a much older man with Harry's messy hair and Mischievous Hazel eyes Emerged from a Hawthorn Bush just behind them.

A look of relief clear in his eyes.

The bucket that had once had ice water in it was empty and there was an Electrical socket barely an inch from where Harry had stood before he had stumbled forward . Wherever he was whoever he was it looked like whoever was in this body had died, In an instant when he was drenched in water. Before Harry entered into this life.


** Oh god the random capitalized letters, odd random lack of commas.. it hurt my brain trying to parse this randomness.

** So essentially Harry dies during the second task and reincarnated as the one who died electrocuted? Does this mean that the Harry of that dimension is now in the original's place during the TWT while everyone already thinks he is an attention-seeking liar even before he starts talking about a sister and his parents being alive with Voldemort gunning for his head while he is a world away of his family after being accidentally killed by his own sister? Poor boy.

*** inwas thinking more a long the line of other time line Harry with the sister and parents choosing to move on to the afterlife and Harry not being able to go back because that would also mean death would be sending the VD soul fragment [[https://back.So][back.So]] harry ends up in the weird waiting from creepy Forrest limbo until they decide where to put him because multiverse bullshit and one of his alternate universe counterparts decides to move on so Harry gets put in his body because they can't send him back to his original world, and his spirit doesn't want to move on so they put him in another harry's body.

**** Huh, sounds cool, I've seen some stories where Harry is sent to the body of another dead counterpart, some of them actually pretty good, though can't remember of any single specific one at the momentðŸ˜…

** This was really good, thanks for sharing it. Was it perfect? No. It did have a couple of punctuation issues, but so what. You wrote something and shared with the group, and to me, that is more important that a couple of punctuation issues. I wouldn't have even mentioned the punctuation issues, if they had not already been brought up.
