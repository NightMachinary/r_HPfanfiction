I have read many fics where being "Master of Death" is used as a plot device to make Harry able to travel through time, universes, etc or just simply make him powerful. I want a fic which explores what it means to be the "Master of Death". It could be anything (even allow him to be powerful or time travel) but it should be the focus of the story and not mentioned once and forgotten about.

Preferably non romance with canon pairings, but I wouldn't mind non canon pairings as well.
