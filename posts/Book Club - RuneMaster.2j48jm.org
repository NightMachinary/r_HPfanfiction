The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]].

Would y'all like me to post another recommendation thread or is the submission form in the sidebar good enough?

What did everyone think of /The Unwinding of Percy Weasley/?


** I thought that it left a lot to be desired from a technical standpoint. There was an awful lot of misspelling, awkward phrasing, odd word choices, etc. However, the story was engaging enough for me to look past it.

I liked the characterization of Percy: aware of the mistakes he'd made, still burdened by them but moving on with his life, and above all not a cardboard cutout bewitched to recite Ministry regulations. So many fics do him a disservice, I think.

*** Most fics do him a disservice but I also think most people don't like his character. I wish more people would explore him like this one does. But for me the flaws you mentioned I agree with and they ultimately got me.

*** I think I may have mentioned this when I rec'd the story, but Tigerman is French Canadian and English is not his first language, thus a lot of errors pop up (just look at his new one, After Dark, if you need confirmation) though his beta did a hell of a good job for Runemaster (I've seen the original unbeta'd version of chapter 17, and it was a doozy.) And the story is definitely engaging.

As for Percy, I'm just not interested in a canon Percy and never gave myself the time or energy to read it. I thought I could, but I didn't.

A book having a title of /The Quadrant Bond, first edition?/ did strike me as odd.

** Regarding the Percy fic:

I liked the characterization of Percy and Audrey, especially Audrey's background. Fits it with canon pretty well.

I did not like the 'crisis moment' plot point though - I found it too contrived! Percy hears that Audrey must be stealing it and believes it immediately??

Also, the misspellings really did me in. "Chalk full of" was really the worst... But I'm picky about proper writing like that!

Overall, not a bad read but certainly not going on my favourites list!

Edit: oh dear, the RuneMaster fic is really full of errors... I don't think I can finish it.

Percy's confidence and self-image are shot from the events of canon as well as his previous extremely unhealthy relationship. The ex (I can't remember her name) knew how to push those buttons and make him think that he doesn't deserve Audrey, she's too good to be true so she must be using him.
