#+TITLE: In sympathetic magic, a piece of the whole is enough to affect the whole (i.e., a drop of blood on a voodoo doll allows the wielder to hurt the blood's owner). Following this logic, Do you think unicorns would feel the magic a wand cast?

** Yeah, HP magic doesn't generally use the principles of sympathy. It's an extremely localised magical system, where it's quite rare for magic to be able to affect things far away from the caster. When it does do so, it generally does it via the medium of affecting an abstract object with no location like a word (the Taboo) rather than by directly casting magic across a wide geographical area.

Just consider horcruxes - Voldemort didn't feel their destruction despite them being part of his very essence/being. If a piece of your soul is insufficient to form some kind of sympathetic link I have no idea what would be.

*** You're ignoring the fact that Harry seems to have a very intimate connection with Voldemort through the Horcrux though: Going as far as having actual clear visions like watching a movie. It doesn't get any more sympathetic than that.

IMHO the reason why Voldemort doesn't feel the destruction of his Horcruxes is author fiat, a pure plot contrivance. (And people like you always go on about how superior magic is, so even if 'feeling the destruction' isn't innate to the Horcruxes I'd expect a super wizard like Voldemort, who creates a Magical Homunculus to house his soul in, to come up with some kind of additional enchantment for that purpose)

**** Regarding Harry having the connection, one could posit that it's due to the blood connection they share as living creatures. The Horcruxes, on the other hand, are inanimate objects that have no life beyond the bit of soul stored in them. I do confess that I have felt it strange that Voldemort wasn't sensitive to the destruction of the devices, especially given how the locket was portrayed.

** IMO I don't think so. Unicorns in cannon are light footed and hard to catch by humans so getting the hair for a wand core is I think hard for the wand makers and apparently while getting the hair they're treated with the utmost respect so I think in that sense it's more that the unicorn willingly gives up a hair I don't think they'd feel any attachment to it or in your questions feel the magic of the wand.

Also, there's unicorn blood, hair and horn used in potions... following your logic they'd feel that too?
