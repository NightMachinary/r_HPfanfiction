What I want to know is if there are any fanfictions where the main character from the start of the fanfiction is godlike, a god(and I mean just completely able to obliterate everyone) but the fanfiction is somehow still fun to read. Like, uhhh, a lazy overpowered god or something like that. So what this entails is a godlike/godly main character who's character is not based off blatant wish fulfillment.

​

Also, if you can't find that, while I would like to encourage you to keep looking, you really don't have to and can just link fanfictions where the main character has at least a good chunk of control over time or whatever fanfiction you fancy with a main character that is just so absurdly powerful that if the author wanted to, they could turn everything around and make the whole thing a crackfic.

​

These are sort of hard things to actually find due to the amount of garbage there is but if you want, you can use link whatever site you want that has a fanfiction to fit one of the requirements. Hell, you could even send me links to Wattpad of all things if I have earned your ire for even posting this damned post. But I have an interest at the moment in the question of whether or not there are more than the few gems in the dung pile like Hero Or Monster, but that's just a basis and the actual fanfiction you link can be completely fucking different if you wanted to. So good luck, and I hope I can satiate my boredom that I try so desperately to fulfill, even when it tears my life apart... *wipes tear* *nudges you with elbow and asks how terrible his acting was*

​

Also, male main character because it's not that I'm sexist or anything, but it's because I always put myself in the place of the main character and it's hard for me to imagine myself as female so I can never really enjoy those stories.


** Linkffn(On a pale horse)?

It has a godlike character while still managing to make the story enjoyable.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** Linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin)

Unfinished, but still (slowly) being worked on. Slight slash, but not the main focus. Told from Tom Riddle's perspective.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lilly and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by the same author is also a good example. In both fics the 'Chosen One' of the AU universe (Harry Potter in "October"; Eleanor Potter in the other) is Death personified, with powers bordering on omniscient but with little inclination to use them.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
