The latest chapter, "A Fine Line," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/68499257][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** So the Longbottoms, the Weasleys, and the Malfoys are all doing fine. Riddle is obviously kidnapping Muggleborns to have them raised by magical families. But why must Kingsley be renamed?

And Dora seems like a top Death Eater

  But why must Kingsley be renamed?
#+end_quote

Kingsley's father was part of Dumbledore's faction and, what's worse, "Shackebolt" is a very pure-blood name (they were listed as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight).

One of those might have been okay, but not both, so Kingsley took his husband's name because it was politically safer to be a Crabcatch than to be a Shacklebolt.

This is the same reason why Draco is a Hufflepuff---His parents (especially Lucius) impressed upon him how important it was that he go anywhere other than Slytherin, because Slytherin was associated with blood supremacy and the Malfoys didn't want to send the wrong signal (Lucius in particular is /terrified/ of Riddle. He knows that Riddle knows that he only changed sides because it was prudent, so he's desperate to avoid giving Riddle any reason to tie up loose ends).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah. She's got strong family connections to Riddle's camp, and her metamorphmagus talent /really/ made her pop up on Riddle's radar. Besides the obvious practical value of her talent, it's also a kind of a literal instantiation of Riddle's "if you fully become the mask, then anyone who wears the mask becomes you too, and so, as long as the mask remains and someone can pick it up, you will never die" philosophy (I almost wrote "theology," which...may be appropriate as well, lol). Ordinary people need to wear a mask in order to shed their normal face, but Tonks can become somebody else at will.

Riddle was Tonks' mentor through all of Hogwarts, and she remains very close to him. She's also dissociating a bit, because Riddle encourages her to think of "Nymphadora Tonks" as no more real than any other face that she might wear, but this isn't easy to pick up on from the outside.

***** In a lot of ways, yes, though it might be good for me to clarify that there's no romantic or sexual relationship between Riddle and Dora.

******* They're /alive/, but they're not doing extraordinarily well. Riddle chose to make examples of just a few people, and the Weasleys were too poor and too political irrelevant to be useful for this purpose.

Most people who opposed Riddle were let off. This had a lot to do with presenting a magnanimous face (look at how decent Riddle is, letting bygones be bygones and offering absolution to former enemies so long as they accepted the new order), but also with practical realities:

1. Wizarding Britain is smaller than some civil parishes, so Riddle doesn't have the buffer to just slaughter his way through everybody who didn't side with him.

2. Purging the government in particular would also destroy a lot of institutional knowledge.

**** Yeah, I definitely got the feeling that Draco is a Hufflepuff because his parents would not want him in Slytherin.

Lucius might not be this far gone yet but it wouldn't entirely surprise me either if they've made it clear to (or will make it clear when it becomes a real concern) Draco that when he marries, it'd be unwise if that person was from one of the traditionally pureblood families. Maybe they're not so far gone* as to say muggleborn but a halfblood wife could be in Draco's future.

*far gone here not meaning that marrying a muggleborn would be bad, but from the vantage point of where they started...

***** Oh, yeah, that's absolutely on their minds. It helps that, canonically, the Malfoy family wasn't totally against marrying the occasional half-blood, but now it isn't just okay but /imperative/ that Draco settle down with a nice half-blood.
