Maybe this is addressed in canon and I just missed it, but how old are all of the older Order members and when were they at Hogwarts? Lately I have been reading a fair amount of MWPP fics and it seems like authors just put EVERYONE at school at the same time (except for Arthur and Molly) and it makes no sense to me.

For example, right now I am reading the Debt of Time, and Alice and Frank Longbottom, Amos Diggory and Luna's mom are in the same year as James, Lily, Sirius etc. Wouldn't that mean that Amos would have had to have Cedric at 18 years old? And Alice and Frank and Luna's mom would have been 20/21 when having kids as well? Maybe this seems realistic to other readers, but I just feel like that is extremely young to be having kids - especially if it is normal to live into your 100s.

*** (Applause) - THIS x1000! You very clearly laid out why it's lazy writing to group all of them into the same age group as the Marauders - which was really my gripe.

*** Add to that Dorcas Meadows, who is killed by Voldemort himself: either she has a lot of political pull or is magically quite powerfull (Voldemort is not seen killing that much himself, he mainly sicks his DE when the target death do not have a huge meaning for him) ; either would point to an older witch.

** There is nothing in canon stating their ages, so everyone likes to group them together. It's easier than making up an entire year's worth of characters for a fanfic, and the possibilities for emotionally impactful scenes increases.

Personally, I thought Frank and Alice were a couple of years older than MWPP, Amos Diggory was closer to Molly and Arthur (maybe even older).

** Young adults having children have been a thing since the dawn of humanity. Dunno why you seem to think it's at all unusual.

*** I dont think it is unusual that some people would do it. I just find it unusual that all of the characters whose ages we do not know, are assumed to be the same age as the Marauders (often making them very young parents as well).
