This literally just occurred to me due to PotatoFan6's recent thread on Ron's Wand and now I'm very curious and moderately baffled.

Basically - if it's Charlie's wand that Ron 'inherited', then what the heck is Charlie using? He's not dead or out of commission, and he is working in the magical world, so he needs a wand, so what the heck is he using? Did he get a new wand while his old one was still existing? Is that a thing? The wand chooses the wizard, but can the wizard choose to get another wand?


** I assumed that the wand was already a hand-me-down when Charlie got it. Maybe it belonged to a deceased relative or was picked up second-hand. It worked fine for Charlie while he was in school, but when he started to make his own money he bought himself a perfect match. Ron never knew the original owner, so he thought of it as "Charlie's old wand," no different from Bill's old robes or Percy's old rat.

*** That makes sense. I didn't think about the possessive being from purely Ron's perspective. Rowling's semi-knowledgeable narrator thing always did throw me off.

** If I remember correctly the wand is described as scratched up, with the unicorn hair poking out at the tip and fraying in PS. So either Charlie already used an old wand during his time at hogwart or he did not take care of it very well. He most likely bought himself a new one to replace it when he started to earn money, which would fit time wise, as he should have graduated in the year directly before Ron started school or the one before that.

*** Very good point on the timeframe thing. That definitely makes the replacement idea make far more sense.

This seems more likely. I mean, a new wand wearing down /that/ badly after 7 or so years?

([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Weasley][Charlie was born December 1972]] according to the fandom wiki, so he got it between December 1983 to Summer 1984.)
