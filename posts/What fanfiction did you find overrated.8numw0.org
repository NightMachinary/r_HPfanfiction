People keep linking The Black Comedy and The Natural 20. I think both of them are overrated and get repetitive fast. Natural 20 gets too stale in the second year, and The Black Comedy overuses sex 'jokes' amongst other things.

Link your overrated fanfictions below.

Be prepared for massive downvotes from butthurt fans.

** Blindness linkffn(Blindness).

At first I felt the fic was going somewhere unique with a blind scientist storyline. Then a third of the way through he had become more than a little OP (at fifteen he is putting down an army of inferi, killing dementors, and repeatedly killing and reviving various living creatures). The story was interesting because it was about him overcoming his weakness, not that his weakness turns him into Merlin crossed with Hannibal Lecter.

By the last third it pretty much devolves into politicking and fighting for minority rights.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I'm so torn about this fic.

On the one hand, it does what I imagine we all think of during time travel stories: screw the rules, forget the past timeline, take every shortcut , cut every corner and cheat your way to victory. It almost seems like entire theme, at least in the beginning. Its almost cathartic really.

On the other hand, there are weird story elements in play that seem to have been a key point for the author to include. A harem of pre-teen girls, most of whom are aware of and hoping for a relationship with a time-traveling political mastermind. Voldemort became more competent, while Dumbledore became less, and for the same reason. Magic is treated as energy, but unlike in other fics where its used to easily place limits on characters, its just this thing thats mentioned and isn't really important at any other point in this story. Thats actually a good description of a LOT of the story elements and world-building in this fic: filler info dumps about interesting stuff the author came up with but never had any plan for them in the long term.

I think hair length does equal power, too; we could assume that +Lucius+Luscious had very long hair before he joined Voldemort but then he had to cut it because Tom saw his locks of power as an insult directed at him and his bald head, and when it was off it was too late for him to back off (and Draco isn't allowed to grow his hair out because Luscious saw that he supports Voldemort).

But beyond that, there's an irritating way that he frames the whole thing, where he'll write one of the main characters contemplating doing something wrong, or hot-headed, or rash and then in the next sentence the character will rationalize why it's the wrong choice.

*** Oh God Not Again! is the worst fic that gets a lot of recommendations.

It's a time travel story that is insanely tied to the stations of canon that any changes that are made, vis-à-vis the time travel, become plot holes that have to be explained away by the author later on.

The characters are all awful, except Gilderoy Lockhart oddly enough. They also become mouthpieces for the author at various points when he wants to make a point about something, or when he wants to patch the holes that he made earlier.

This is a rant I like to go on from time to time because I see it recommended pretty regularly.

***** Rowling introduces plot points and story elements with either very specific reasons to solve problems relevant to each book (Veritaserum was invented in the story to just force Crouch to tell the truth, Thestrals suddenly appeared to have a cheap way to get Harry to London overnight, etc.)

The problem with that is, she does not seem consider the impact of these story elements on both her past/future plot, and the greater world she has developed. As an example, if the Ministry has this magic truth potion that they strictly regulate, why didn't they use this on the people who claimed to be under the Imperius? The fact that they DID NOT use it on Harry when he claimed to have witnessed Voldemort's return should be a clue to what the Ministry actually believed him, but did not want too. The last three books are rife with a lot of these "world-breaking" story points, and the answer usually devolves into some variant of the Ministry/Wizards/Witches/Teachers/Adults are idiots.

I personally liked the Denarian Renegade trilogy. The plot was unique (at that time), Harry kept some of his canon sarcasm, he seemed somewhat realistic (also a bit of a dick). Humor certainly was not it's strong point. Plot-twists were interesting and unexpected. He did have character growth. While at the start he was just a kid he then grew into a remorseless, dark killer, with no morals. But from that, he grew to love both his girlfriend and his child. He also showed some morality (He refused to kidnap orphans (for use in bad purposes) and refused to have sex with his child, something that may not have concerned him at the start of the first 'book')

The actual plot, the morsels it was, was actually extremely railroaded and very frail to begin with. Although it had some great ideas, those ideas never amounted to anything. It almost felt like the fic was constrained by HP canon and terrible DF ideas and laws. In this case Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain was better and more consistent.

To give the author credit, the first fic (Bungle In The Jungle) had some amazing moments and launched an all-too-brief surge in popularity for the woefully underutilized Cursebreaker!Harry subgenre. Unfortunately, everyone in the fic acted completely out of character, and it also featured some of the most obnoxious character bashing I've ever read.

Any time Hogwarts, Dumbledore or Harry's friends popped up in the story, Harry instantly transformed into an irrational, insufferably smug /douchebag/ (well, moreso than usual - it's a jbern fic, so Harry's pretty unlikable even at his best) who treated everyone like crap, and due to the story's POV is treated as 100% in the right no matter how awful he acted.

Oh, right, it's also second-person POV. I probably should have lead with that, since that right there would likely turn off most potential readers.

The sequel, Turn Me Loose, is even worse, and is one of the few fics I regret reading. Bringing Harry back to Hogwarts revealed the ugliness that had been festering under the surface throughout the first story, and it turned all of Harry's already unbearable flaws up to 11 and left them there. It's not a good sign that as I read it I was hoping Hermione would finally snap and murder the story's protagonist.

HPMOR shows that when your family friends are rapey people, you grow up rapey.

It made me remember and reflect on my own upbringing, on the ways in which I assumed I was normal, but was actually tremendously gauche. (Mostly racist stuff that I didn't know was racist, like calling Asian people "Oriental"). I still wonder what I'm doing that is bad that I simply take for granted.

**** Uh, why? In canon, that's exactly the kind of thing Death Eaters do. And Draco is a Death Eater.

I like HPMOR because, even though Harry is consistently spewing what /seems/ like the author's philosophical views, a closer inspection reveals that...he's not! Because while some of it is what the author thinks, other parts aren't, and many, many times he's straight up /wrong/ (like with the DNA), which is normal. And most people dislike Harry because he's smug, snarky and unsociable, but are forced to respect him due to his immense intelligence- and, frankly, that's how a lot of real geniuses behave at the age of 11.

He isn't meant to be a perfect character at all. That would be Hermione. (Who I find the weakest part of the fic because she's /far/ more insufferable than Harry, IMO, but I doubt literally anyone else agrees with me on this one.)

Really? What is the "this" that they do better?

If you mean that there are better "what would smart Harry do" stories, that's actually almost incidental. HPMoR is, first and foremost, a review of how people think and a tutorial in avoiding some of the common pitfalls. Even the fact that it's set in the Harry Potter universe is secondary.

And objectively, its quality is above average: it's long, complete, has a complex plot, lots of humor (YMMV with humor, of course, but lots of people appreciate this brand), has few typos...love or hate it, it shows a substantial level of effort and writing talent.

But if you can recommend stories that do something similar, only better, then like [[/u/TheVoteMote]] I'm interested.

This is a big deal. Abandonment is, in my experience, the biggest single obstacle to good fanfic. It's possible for a story to be awesome /despite/ being incomplete, but if it's that good, the lack of completion is that much more of a pity.

See above; you should laugh every day :). HPMoR isn't crackfic, and it has long stretches of more serious material, but it's healthy to have a giggle along the way.

Now, I'm sure that there could be literary value in a short, simple, serious, unfinished piece. But if you trawl through the hundreds of thousands of ff.net stories, most of those meeting that description aren't great reads.

The first time was when I couldn't understand how the trio so simply decided that becoming a Dark Lord was even remotely ok, but the second time I thought I would overlook that and try again.

Then I got to the break up scene between Harry and Ginny and I couldn't believe what I was reading. Im perfectly fine with other pairings, but if you're going to claim that your fic is canon compliant and just have Harry and Ginny not even talk to each other throughout the summer after the war then it's not canon compliant anymore. There's no justification for their characters not talking to each other at all.

I'm sure the rest of the fic is actually really good, and the two issues I just mentioned are just examples of the author trying to setup the story so it's not really a big deal, but I honestly couldn't keep reading after seeing that for the first time.

** Agreed, to an extent. Black Comedy is funny, but it's so trope heavy that's it a fic I have never, ever re-read. Which tells a lot. The jokes are jarring and only funny once, if ever. It's a good fic, though.

As to Natural 20, I never could get into it. I tried to read it several times, but I found it dry and not funny at all. Perhaps it's just me.

If I can add some other fics to that list: anything by robst, and unfortunately the late bobmin (may he rest in peace, I will miss him), Cadmean Victory, Deprived, Lie I've Lived (basically anything by jbern), The Well Groomed Mind is also not as good as people think....

There are others as well, but those are the most prominent I can think of.

EDIT: Also the Denarian Renegade series are not as good as people assume they are. They are fine at first but the humour and plot points are just repetitive and the dialogue gets boring after the first book. I just find them disappointing, and some of you Shezza fans need to face it as well.

EDIT2: I also think that people are TOO critical of Wind Shear. It's a way better fic, with way better world building than any I've ever mentioned in this post. It may not have filled all the expectations, but in terms of good writing and plot, I believe it delivered.

*** I agree with everything you said except Wind Shear being better than all the other fics you mentioned. I think A Black Comedy and The Denarian Renegade series are easily better than Wind Shear. Their plots are more interesting and the characters have more depth to them. Wind Shear's dialogue is just terrible.

I can't think of a single thing I liked about Wind Shear other than the premise.

Edit: Due to how popular Wind Shear is, I suppose it could be considered my answer to OP's post.

I respectfully disagree with you, and I can see your point.

I personally liked the Denarian Renegade trilogy. The plot was unique (at that time), Harry kept some of his canon sarcasm, he seemed somewhat realistic (also a bit of a dick). Humor certainly was not it's strong point. Plot-twists were interesting and unexpected.

But IDK, maybe it's my nostalgia.

I'm writing a couple of those (one unreleased though). The other is out, but the romance will take place down the road. Me aside, linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) might be what you're looking for.

I'm currently writing a couple of them with that pairing in mind (no bashing of anyone) and in my unreleased one I'm aiming for something like what Definitions of Romance did (neither is exactly romantic in the traditional sense, they're confident about their feelings even if they prefer not to make overt public gestures, etc.).

**** I haven't read Hermione Granger is Stupid, I will look into that one.

For me, Harry and Hermione should be a supportive relationship, it seems in a lot of these stories Harry/Hermione don't really have any friends outside of each other. In a lot of those cases I don't think it's a healthy relationship, so it's not really romantic to me. I don't have anything against them being isolated from everyone else during the war, but stories set in Hogwarts/not during the war I don't think are particularly romantic. What I liked about Definitions of Romance is that it felt like a believable and healthy version of their relationship-it doesn't have to be unromantic (although I found that aspect quite sweet) but it should be a logical progression on their friendship (they should definitetly not be Ron/Lavender style basically) with them working together and supporting each other.

Most important to me though is the characterisation-a lot of these stories have Harry and Hermione (in particular) being so completely out of character that they might as well not be called Harry and Hermione which sort of ruins it for me. I feel a romantic angle between Harry and Hermione would be really interesting, so there's no point writing a story to me with basically not Harry or Hermione. Harry and Hermione should be flawed both as characters and as a relationship (at least over a longer story).

Some of the stories I read had a perfectly good Harry/Hermione relationship, but everything else about the story was the problem-bashing, uninteresting storytelling, poor writing and so forth.

"The Augurey" is also pretty good, but has a few sex scenes later on once their relationship progresses.

I like your points about how their relationship ought to be. Well said, I'll definitely try to stay true to that. All my favorite HHR stories are like that (The Augurey has some nice moments like that).

** /Death Shall Have No Dominion/ by Morta's Priest - linkffn(7060807). It had one good subplot (Harry pretending to be Regulus), and that only showed up a few chapters before the fic was dropped. Other than that it's just completely forgettable OCs being vague at one another.

Also, almost everything by Sarah1281. The first fic or two of hers you read you'll probably enjoy, but the more of them you read, the more you realize how formulaic her humor is. She has maybe two jokes in her repertoire that she rephrases ad nauseam, while the "plot" meanders randomly until the wordcount quota is met and it finally stumbles across the finish line.

** The Arithmancer and Lady Archimedes.

"Hermione solves everything with math" isn't an interesting read.

I guess the Denarian stuff qualifies too, since, well, it gets quite repetitive, but fuck, it's AWESOME.

I agree that it's a tad repetitive, but it's still cool.

Glad you like it as well.
