:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this one fic that I can't find, and it's really bothering me. It's about an OC who becomes the DADA professor instead of Umbridge during Harry's 5th year. She was an auror before she took the job, and she has a talent for Divination (there's this one scene where she reads tea leaves to predict an auror colleague coming to visit her during breakfast in the great hall). She might have been reincarnated SI-style, but I honestly don't remember (if she is, it isn't tagged like that on ao3); I'm pretty sure it was on ao3, but it might have been on ffn too (again, I don't quite remember). Does anyone know this fic? If not, if anyone has recs for fics where a character, OC or not, becomes a Hogwarts teacher, I'd be happy to check those out too. Thanks!

  A self-insert decides her previous plan wasn't good enough -- she takes more decisive action.
