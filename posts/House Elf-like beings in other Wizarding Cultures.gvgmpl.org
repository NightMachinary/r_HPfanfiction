What do you think? Would other magical cultures have beings equivalent to House-Elves but with their own differences? How likely would it be, for example, to have kitsune working for royalty or other important japanese households? What about djinns in Arabian zones?


** In Thailand (or most of SE Asia I think), there are these mythical human-children-like creatures that will help your household if you are nice to them and give them food. They are dressed in traditional Thai clothing, have golden bracelets and anklets, and they like watered-down syrup or fizzy drinks. The girl creatures are called ‚Äòhongprai' (‡πÇ‡∏´‡∏á‡∏û‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢ girl spirit) and the boy creatures are called ‚Äòkumantong' (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á golden child). Most witch doctors keep a pair at their house to guard against intruders or bad fortune and maybe go on magical errands, but I think it's disrespectful to ask them to do the dishes. You can summon the creatures by going through magical rituals and eventually creating a statue of the creature, then you would put snacks/drinks in front of them.

Then there's the house spirit (‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á) who will not do the laundry for you but would help keep the house safe, clean, and free from tragedy. House spirits are worshipped with flowers and incense. They maintain the wards and bless the people in the household.

There are also crossroad spirits and other type of building spirits too.

*** Damn... However, you do have a point. From what I've seen from the MACUSA in the films, they are pretty bad. I wouldn't be surprised if their Death Eater equivalents had their hands in that.

** Is there a reason why other wizarding cultures wouldn't have house elves as well?

*** I guess not, after all brownies are spirits known almost worldwide, however I was wondering about there are different helpful spirits and magic beings across the world and I was what wondering what different variations of the idea could there be. Besides, wouldn't it be a bit boring if there were JUST house elf.
