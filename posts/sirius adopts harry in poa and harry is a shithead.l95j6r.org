most of the fics i find of this have harry being nervous and shy which i get and everything, but does anybody know any fics that are more humor based and harry is just a normal crappy 13 year old sirius has to try and be responsible for?


** linkffn(Weeb by Andrius) kind of does this. I know Harry moves in with Sirius, but I'm pretty sure it's a pretty minor part of the story.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** I think that, if anything, Sirius would be a bad influence on a teenager who is a celebrity because he would try to reshape Harry in the image of James (who was himself quite shitty as a teenager) and also spoil him to make up for all the years while he was absent. Sirius might have good intentions but he never really had the chance to mature like a normal adult and still maintains that rebellious teenager attitude even after he gets out of prison. He is still very reckless and cruel to those that he deems inferior to him morally (Wormtail, Snape, Kreacher, his family).

*** I agree with all of this. I personally believe Dumbles let Sirius go to prison and it was because of

1. Blood protection

2. Sirius would raise Harry to be like James and that is, in Dumbey's mind, not what Harry needs to grow up to become

**** regardless of the way sirius would have raised harry, dumbledore didnt have any kind of right to interfere with sirius's trial for that reason, considering that sirius would've been harry's legal guardian. he could make a case for the blood wards, but i'm pretty sure the dursleys wouldve said lol nope if they were given any actual choice in taking in harry.

not sure if i really buy into the theory dumbledore has been pulling the strings of harrys whole life, but if he did intentionally let sirius go to prison just on the offchance so harry wouldn't end up being spoiled, thats a big dickhead move.

******* I can support my case yes. Dumbles cast the secret keeper spell for the Potters which brings me to the conclusion that he knew Sirius was not the secret keeper. And if he knew Sirius was innocent than why didn't he defend him? The only reason I can think of is that he needed Sirius out of the way because Sirius would interfere with what he was doing, which was to both protect Harry with the blood magic and to make sure Harry doesn't become like James

******** also to add on if you dont mind, dumbledore had multiple devices used specifically to monitor harry's wellbeing and the blood wards at the dursley's house, which means he would've had some general idea of how harry was treated there. add it onto the fact its not clear if he actually read harry's letter was addressed to 'cupboard under the stairs', theres enough reasonable doubt to make a case.

there's nothing in canon to indicate dumbledore had any idea Sirius was innocent.

************* This is Sirius explaining the situation:

#+begin_quote
  “Harry... I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me... I'm to blame, I know it... The night they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done...”
#+end_quote

Notice the conspicuous lack of mention that Dumbledore knew? In fact, Sirius never tells anyone that Dumbledore sent him to Azkaban. He strangely enough seems to trust Dumbledore, enough to join the Order and let them operate out of his house. Because he knows that Dumbledore didn't know - they didn't tell him.

Add to this that Dumbledore then decides to help Harry save Sirius from being kissed, upon discovering the truth. Strange behaviour from a man that supposedly wants to keep them apart. He then proceeds to enable their getting to know each other.

I'd warmly recommend a re-read of PoA. Delightful book.
