I am looking for the full and complete version of this fic since it was lost on GE. I know it's floating out there somewhere because there was a post on LiveJournal where someone had been e-mailed it, but I haven't gotten a response from anyone over there, so I'm hoping someone here can direct me to someone who might have it!

It's a Hermione/James time travel fic where Badass!Hermione is sent back in time to the Marauders era where she becomes the Defense Prof for the last few months of the Marauders 7th year and subsequently falls in love with James but then things happen and well.. Spoilers! It's been partially posted on ff.net, but it's not even halfway completed over there.

Please help!
