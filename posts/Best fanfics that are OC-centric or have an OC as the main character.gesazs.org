** I will never stop recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][this fic]]. I know the "Harry has a twin sister" trope has an awful reputation (partially deserved, as most are not great), but this fic surprised me. I really enjoyed it. It's quite long, over a million words, but it's a fun read!

**** It's about her first year then, it timeskips to her fourth. She's basically Snape's Apprentice, but also his redemption.

Riddle "marked" her, but in a different way that Harry (this is one of the principal subplot of the story).

There is a bit of "bashing" toward the Gryffindor (especially the Golden Trio) because from her point of view, her brother's actions seem quite reckless.

Until the end of HBP she doesn't really influence that much the Canon Timeline, because she is never with the Golden Trio when it matters,(on the occasion where she's with them, the story follows the same path as Canon), after this point it diverges from Canon.

There might be a bit of Mary Sue-ing, but I read it twice and honestly it's not so bad. Anyway if you want to story about Slytherin politics, making Potions, Riddle's past and a bit of good old "Dumbledore your meddling is not appreciated", read it.

** I've always liked The Family Clock. linkffn(The Family Clock). It centers around a young watchmaker who runs her family's Diagon Alley shop. It takes an interesting perspective to the war, and Diagon (and Knocturn) Alley in general. She makes fast friends with the twins (their shop is across the way) and later Charile.\\
It's first person, and the only major downside to it is that later the author will switch perspectives, and it's not immediately evident. Takes a minute to figure out a)they did it and b) who they're speaking through now.\\
Hasn't seen an update in five years though. :(\\

** It's technically a D&D crossover and a gamer!fic (idk if you're into that), but when I read it a few years back I had zero experience with tabletop RPGs and loved it. The MC is an OC named Milo who, while a wizard himself, has no understand of how HP universe magic works. He gets plopped down in the canon-universe and navigates Hogwarts (in the same year as the Golden Trio, but it's not Harry-centric). It's super hilarious and has several great subplots which include muggle OCs and major divergences from canon. I don't remember where they left off, but I think it's somewhere in Book 3.

** I know this isn't much help, but I'm writing a story that takes place in 2015 and centers around pretty much /only/ OCs. New plot, new arcs, etc, pretty much no reused characters. Think Harry Potter but the only resemblance to HP is it's the same world and they're at Hogwarts.

** I love all-OC stories and those focusing on non-mainstream characters in particular.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) - absolutely incredible series set in an AU version of Wizarding America circa 2007-2011. Five fairly lengthy books are complete, with a sixth in progress right now (although the author finishes his books before beginning to upload them.) It's an all-OC fic, and whether it's fanfiction is debatable - while the magic system is the same as in canon, pretty much everything else is different, and the only connections to canon are a couple mentions of Lord Voldemort. Easily the best overall storytelling I've seen in the fandom.

Underneath Inverarity, there are a couple uncut gems - there's linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) which is a quite fluffy, wholesome story about Slytherin's first post-war muggleborn, and is mostly OCs. There is also linkffn(The Divide by Beedle) and linkffn(The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins) which are more slow-burning, character-centric next-gen fics that have OCs as point-of-view characters. I thought linkffn(The Guardian of Azkaban) was pretty well done, but YMMV.

There are more I could list, but these seem to be on the lines of what you're looking for. Hope you enjoy!

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year.

He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound-With-Silver-Threads][Bound with Silver Threads]] technically has a canon character as a main character however it was finished before Cursed Child was released so she was essentially a blank slate, not that that gave her much depth, and their is a well-developed OC as the other main character.

(sadly none of them are complete and two are seemingly abandoned forever but they're still really good, or at least, they're my favorite fics in recent memory)

  Sophie McConnell wants to start over and forget her past. Putting enough distance between herself and her old life seems like the perfect solution. But even miles away from home, Sophie can't shake the feeling that her past is following her, bringing with it ancient family secrets that even she didn't know about. Will the past destroy her or can Sophie find the courage to face it?

  I'm a victim. I never wanted any of this. It isn't my fault. At least, that's the line I'm sticking with. But the truth is that evil can spark from the smallest things, and it grows without you even knowing it. Mine starts here, with a secret and a lie. HP/OC/BZ follows THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SIRIUS BLACK. Read and Review!
