Hiiii.

Are there any good Harry-centric fics out there. I don't mind character bashing at all, but no Harry-bashing. Please give long ones, so over 20 chapters at least...

This can include WBWL, Lord Harry, Slytherin Harry, Sarcastic Harry, Wrong Azkaban, etc. Cliches are fine.

â€‹

Thank you!

Five years after the battle of Hogwarts the war is still raging. The Order under the leadership of Harry is going toe to toe against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Diversion from Half blood prince onward.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Most of them! The good ones are on Archive of our Own. Anything with a high word count and a lot of Harry based tags. If you have a more specific taste for what you want to read let me know and I'll help you find some!
