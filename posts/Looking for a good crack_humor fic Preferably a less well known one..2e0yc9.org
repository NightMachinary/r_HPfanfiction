  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

#+begin_quote
  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** Biting the Hand that Feeds You by Andrew Joshua Talon is pretty amazing. The summery does nothing that made me want to read it. I thought I had clicked on a different story and ended up in that one and was hooked. To appease Voldemort the Ministry breaks off all dealings with the muggle world, which leads to hilarity.
