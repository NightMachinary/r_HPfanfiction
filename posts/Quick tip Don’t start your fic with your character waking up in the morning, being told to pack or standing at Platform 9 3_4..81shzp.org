** I must say I disagree. It's all in the way one writes it, of course --- if it's just a boring retread of canon it's not worth it --- but I'd rather start a character's story from the beginning. That's just my taste though.

*** Yes, like most rules in writing, you can pull it off and do it well if you're good enough and have a valid reason for doing so.

/But/, even if it's not a boring retread of canon, there should be a reason /why/ you're starting in such a cliche way--and for it to be actually worth it. Waking up in the morning or packing is hardly the "beginning" and, most of the time, it's only done because it's so damn common.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone gets away with much of this because it's the original and middle grade fiction; the latter gives you much leeway, especially because many MG readers are not aware of the tropes/cliches just yet.

"Don't assume I'm going to read a whole chapter before anything interesting happens. You don't have to start with an explosion, but please, write sentences that make me want to read the next paragraph." This is hardly bad advice. And this is without even mentioning that avoiding the cliche of the protagonist waking up is recommended to most new writers (in original fiction). Why so many people in this thread are so sensitive for the opinion of one reader is actually surprising.

**** I suppose so... I mean, waking up in the morning and detailing the breakfast is probably going too far. But what I meant is that, as a reader (of fanfiction), I don't really like stories that start several months into the year and give you quick flashbacks as you go to explain that, oh, by the way, this is a Fem!Harry, and she's friends with Neville but not Ron, and blah blah blah. I prefer to start slow but steady from the beginning, and not be confused.

*** The original books have the benefit of being original. You follow this dude around and don't know why you're doing it really yet. There's lots of little details that are dropped. The end of the chapter is a bit of an oh moment.

That being said, when re-reading the books, I almost always ended up skipping / skimming Rowling's first chapters, because her hooks only really work the first couple times you read them.

**** So it seems to me more that the argument should be to not unnecessarily repeat canon (as in being unoriginal). I get just as irritated by unoriginal fast action scenes, like the Sirius/Remus confrontation, when they are being repeated from canon without significant changes.

There's plenty of good ways to do a slow start through a prologue or just a normal first chapter, which is more focused on setting the scene and characters. Not every story has to start in media res.

*** The first book starts with a mystery of what these oddly dressed people do on the street and the odd happenings of the news.

We get some hints during the first chapter until at the end it is revealed that wizards exist. It's a magical mini-mystery that sets not only the scene but also sets the pacing for the next few chapters, does exposition and tells you what kind of story to expect (namely: mystery).

That's not the same as a 'Janita woke up, got out of the bed, grabbed her toothbrush'-chapter which is what some fanfic does.

*** Haha, I didn't check Reddit for a while after posting this, and I feel a bit like this: [[https://i.imgur.com/Zki6LEk.gif]]

Just kidding. It's really not that bad.

So, let me explain something. Here's how my fic starts: "It was the night before their Easter holidays, and the Ravenclaw common room was unusually jovial." That's a pretty low-key opening. Many people might even call it boring. I don't at all mind a low-key opening. I thought I was getting that point across when I said "I actually don't mind a slow start to a fic," but I'm not sure everyone caught that.

I just wanted to let people know that, when I'm scrolling through FFnet, and I read yet another fic that begins, "Lily dear, time to wake up, we've got to be at King's Cross in two hours!" I just can't power through that opening for the twelfth time in one sitting. I just can't.

The same goes for an OC-centric story begins with, "So-and-so looked around in fascination at Platform 9 and 3/4. She was very excited about going to Hogwarts."

Reading through this thread, though, I'm realizing that's more of a personal preference than I thought. And that's perfectly fine. I shouldn't have tried to police people's writing styles.

** Well there go all 5 of my stories I am writing...lol. I'd say because there are so many HP fanfics that yes, you can skip over these beginning intros because anyone reading is most likely going to know everything you are telling (if you are just summarizing points from the book). However, I'd also say if you can't push through, just skip to the next chapter. I have skipped the first chapter of many fics that turned out to be quite interesting. Sometimes I have to go back if I miss something but I feel like that rarely happens.

** Wake-up scenes can provide a convenient way to introduce one's primary AU elements - in particular for HP, presenting one's Dursleys or Not!Dursleys.

In that which I am working on, aside from a possible prologue (it might end ip as an interlude), the first chapter has HP waking up in the cupboard, but in a manner which shows primary elements of my AU's HP.
