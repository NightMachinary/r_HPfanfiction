I won't get into too many details about it, but there's a subplot I've been considering as I outline my fanfic. It involves the idea that Riddle, instead of outright killing the Riddle family, manipulated them (maybe via Imperius, not sure, will determine later) into leaving all their wealth to him when they died. Would probably involve increasing how wealthy the Riddles were (I don't think it was made explicit in canon, but I'll just fudge it to the millions).

Part of the reason for this is that I find the portrayal of Voldemort (more so in FFs) as being so against the Muggle world that he wouldn't take the opportunity to gain a bunch of money rather unpragmatic. I've seen some FFs where it seems Voldemort's anti-Muggleness is so extreme that he gets killed when trying to take over their world because for some reason he didn't know (or forgot despite growing up there) that the Shield Charm wouldn't stop bullets.

Now there are two reasons for this. I thought it'd be interesting if instead of leaving his first Horcrux to Lucius, he allowed it to gain a solid body (like it tried to in CoS) and sent it (him?) out into the world to set himself up for future conquests in both the Muggle world and distant, foreign wizarding communities (essentially the reason for him getting the Riddle money, in addition to looking the part of a wealthy pureblood trying to win hearts for the cause).

The other reason for this is that in my story, it'll be explained why Dumbledore didn't just tell everyone who Voldemort was. That's not to say he'd lose all his followers if they learned he was a half-blood (some, maybe, but it's silly to think all or most would leave). Basically, Voldemort would fake the death of Tom (who is the first Horcrux) by having him be one of the earlier people to challenge him and seemingly be vaporized by Voldemort publicly, allowing him (the Horcrux) to move around more easily and leave Voldemort's origin unknown.

Sorry for all that prelude. I basically want to ask: What, exactly, do you think Tom would be doing while out there? What sorts of actions would he do to further his future endeavors? How would he recruit and extend his influence, and would this be all he was interested in doing? As much as I kind of like this idea, I wonder if it would be too unbelievable since wouldn't he try to come back and kill Harry after learning his original self was apparently defeated? I'd like to think Horcrux Tom would be super practical and understand his original self would find a way to come back by himself, but he does seem to love revenge so I'm having trouble making a coherent motivation for the second Tom to have if I do this.

(Note: in my fanfic, many wizards are embedded within Muggle institutions to have their early to the ground so they can catch violations of the SoS more quickly)

Ideas and suggestions would be appreciated~


** I love this wonderful idea! As for why Horcrux Tom might not flock back to England to kill Harry, what if he's kinda happy to be rid of his bossman of an older self and would rather enjoy a life of freedom as the tyrant of Magical New Zealand than go back to England and risk being recognized, all for the sake of getting his old master back?

*** Hm, maybe. I somewhat want to stick to the canon characterization where the Horcruxes seem to have no issue doing as they think their original self would want.

Maybe he'd have a crude Darwinian "survival of the fittest" attitude, as in "whichever Tom is still active gets to be Voldemort and if you lose then that's your problem"? Hm, I might just stick with him assuming his old self would find a way without him, or maybe that he's too embedded in whatever works he's doing to help the wraith Voldemort at the time. And seeing as Dumbledore knew what country Voldemort was at in CoS, maybe he'd not want to risk a run-in.

That does seem likely. The canon Diarymort doesn't say that much in that direction, but he definitely acts like he intends to /be/ Voldemort once he's got a body, not go seek out the Albanian wraith and then defer to him: “Voldemort is my past... present... and /future/.”

***** Ah, good point. I'd always interpreted that as a remnant of the whole "Tom put a memory of his school self in the diary" in the pre-Horcrux days. But either way, I think I'll go with this. Thanks for your response! :)

Now I just need to think about what country he'd set up shop in...

** I read a oneshot before where the Minister of Magic meets with the new Muggle Prime Minister who turns out to be Tom.

It was quite short so there were no details about his rise in muggle politics... Can't remember the title right now but I will look for it.

Yeah, I agree about this point. I'm planning on having my Voldemort just Imperius the shit out of numerous drug dealers to get money. Maybe just rich people in general, but I do wonder if there is a department in the magical Ministry to stop that sort of thing from happening, so that magicals don't just rob muggle banks and then trade that money for galleons.

*** While it's absolutely trivial for even a moral wizard to make heaps of muggle money it would likely have to stay as muggle money for the most part as the Goblins would probably have some sort of limit on how much you could exchange for Galleons in order to maintain economic stability in the wizarding economy.

*** Might have a way to detect stolen money, or at least locating where it came from so they could investigate. Though I suspect Voldemort is so magically gifted he could probably fool whatever detection spell they might use for this.

Maybe you could have Voldemort just put a bunch of rich people under Imperius and have them routinely wire money to a particular account. Small enough from each individual that it doesn't look too suspicious but all together amounting to a substantial sum.
