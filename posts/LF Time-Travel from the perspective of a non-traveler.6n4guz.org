This is a rare kind of story that I enjoy very much, I'd like to track more of them down. The effects a time-traveller would have on normal people have always interested me more than their own experience.

Examples include: Sine Qua Non linkffn(11244373) and Many Thanks linkffn(4692717)

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

** linkffn(the Unwinding Golden Thread by the Carnivorous Muffin)

linkao3(A Good Teacher by Nia_River)

The second one is actually a bit similar to Sine Qua Non in that both travellers end up Harry's teacher.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Chemistry and Timing has this. Hermione is the traveler and Remus stays put in time (st least for 99% of the fic. The chapters switch off between his and her POVs. Also, this fic is one of the BEST time travel fics from a pure world building and magic standpoints that I've read. So good! Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing]])

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!
