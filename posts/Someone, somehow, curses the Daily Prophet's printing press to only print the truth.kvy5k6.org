I leave it up to the writers to say how that works in practice.


** Seamus rushed into the common room and headed straight for where Harry was sitting.

Harry didn't miss the paper on his hands. "What? Are you here to spread more lies?" Harry told him.

Seamus showed him the paper, where there was a detailed account of what happened at the graveyard, a completely accurate version.

Harry was stunned "But-- how--?"

It didn't matter really, what it mattered was that everyone was going to talk about the truth now, finally.

Cormac McLaggen then came in and took the paper from Seamus, but he didn't saw the page Seamus has opened. He went right to the headline, which Harry had missed, "What's this? Dumbledore is gay?!"

Harry was startled. But his eyes found the headline sure enough. Big and in all caps... There was a detailed story of Dumbledore being gay with Gellert Grindelwald.

To his eternal annoyance, no one seemed to read about Voldemort and instead the real talk in the halls were the raunchy tales of the headmaster youth.

*** It was unbelievable, but Harry couldn't take the truth anymore. A couple of weeks before he had wanted nothing more but the Prophet to stop lying, now he felt as if he had enough of truthful articles.

The Ministry had recognized the return from Voldemort, but that wasn't all there was. Once the sexual orientation of the headmaster stopped being the topic around, new ones followed.

Umbridge was sacked and Sirius, who was a free man now, was teaching DADA. However, everyone was talking of Harry's life at the Dursleys, as it had been front page on Monday. Somehow the Prophet had a picture of the cupboard there. He wished he could stop the pity stares and the sniggers from the Slytherins. McGonagall's look was especially bad, as she appeared to look at Harry as if he was about to break down at any moment. It was said Dumbledore got to hear some nasty words from her. Nevertheless, Dumbledore had other things to fear, since the war effort had been compromised when a Prophecy he was trying to hide from Voldemort became quite public. Harry was glad to know what was going on now, but he knew it was bad that Voldemort knew about it too.

Snape was useless as a spy now, for it was revealed he truly was Dumbledore's man. But that had a cost, since the whole school was sending drawings to Harry of Snape and his dead mother kissing.

School was mad. Neville got sad looks whenever he went, and so did Dean, who had recently found about his father. Draco got like 7 detentions and Harry had lost track of the reasons why. A couple of Ravenclaw girls were in detention as well, mostly for hiding Luna Lovegood's shoes. Ernie Macmillan was quite popular in Hufflepuff since it was known fact he could produce a boar Patronus. People were looking oddly at Professor Trelawney as well, for the Prophet revealed she only washed her clothes during a solstice. There was also this weird article of Goyle having a passion for Muggle knitting that was doing the rounds.

Unfortunately, Harry couldn't count with his friends as much, for Ron and Hermione were somewhere around the castle snogging themselves senseless. There was a note the other day that said: "Hermione Granger is not actually into Harry Potter, for she fancies her redhead friend". As unbelievable as it sounded, even after that it took Harry's friends 4 days to confess their feelings to each other, and it only happened after a weird Prophet piece on "Ronald Weasley wanked yesterday thinking on Granger". Ron was hidden most of that day, but at the end, Hermione found him and things turned out on their favour.

"Come on, it can't be that bad," Ginny said " Mum doesn't care you think she's plump"

Harry had almost forgotten the embarrassment of that. He looked at Ginny and lowered his sight, blushing. "It's not that. Cho knows I fancy her"

Ginny turned red herself, "And what? That other article told everyone I fancy you, not that you didn't know that already." she said, wistfully.

"Err, sorry, I---"

"You don't fancy me, I know. Nothing to feel sorry about that. Forget it, nothing bad happened. Though Michael didn't take it well" Ginny said, faking a smile. "Just go and talk to Cho. Heard she's interested."

Harry looked at her surprised. Ginny had turned away sadly. Before he could say anything to her, the twins arrived though, putting their arms over Harry's shoulders.

"Why, hello there..." Fred said, "Good to see you."

"What's going on?" Harry asked.

"Oh nothing really, the usual article stuff. But you know that already. Can't we just take a moment off our tight detention schedule to say hello to our sister and the object of her affections."

"Oh knock it off," Ginny said.

"Calm down. We just wanted to make sure our Harrykins here was not leading you on, after all, we know he has it bad for Chang."

Harry almost let his head hit the table with a thud.

"He's my friend, you prats. Don't you have floors to scrub?" Ginny told them.

"Not anymore. You know about the money Harry gave us, we won't be here long." George said.

His twin nodded, "Yeah, before mum can send another Howler. Don't have to worry, Harry. Mum won't blame you. She's still trying to knit as many sweaters for you as she can. So you stop using your cousins handowns."

Harry wished he could just go and hide on Hagrid's hut. But he was away. The Ministry had recognized their error and allowed him to purchase a wand again.

"By the way," Fred told Harry, "If you're looking for Ronnie and his lovely girlfriend, they're in detention. Snape found they were late for class because they were snogging somewhere. A first for Hermione, I'm sure. I imagine Ron is going to be denied his usual snogging sessions for some days."

Harry couldn't suppress a grin.

"Is everyone in detention now?" asked Ginny.

"Something like it. Professors are running out of detention ideas, I reckon," said George.

Then Seamus stormed into the common room, "Hey, have you seen Neville? I have to warn him. There's a new article."

"Another?" Harry asked annoyed.

"What happened?" Ginny asked.

"There's a picture of Snape in Neville grandma's clothes"

  *Ministry Denounces Boy-Who-Lived*

  In a press conference yesterday, Minister Fudge declared that Harry Potter's claims that You-Know-Who has returned are false, dangerous, and treasonous. This was prompted by Potter ending the Triwizard Tournament by retrieving both the Triwizard Cup and the dead body of fellow student and competitor Cedric Diggory. Potter claimed that Diggory was killed by posthumous Order of Merlin recipient Peter Pettigrew, who then revived You-Know-Who. Potter than named several more people as Death Eaters, all of whom were previously declared innocent for crimes committed under the Imperious Curse. Potter was unable to provide any further evidence of his claims.

  But why would Potter make such a claim if it is not true? Minister Fudge says that these allegations are an attempt by Potter and Dumbledore to acquire more fame and to undermine the Ministry to gain more power for themselves. Dumbledore already holds several important positions in society and the government, and is a known opponent of the Minister and his advisors. If the people lost trust in the Minister, Dumbledore would stand to become more powerful and influential, and would likely be able to get a new minister elected who is under his influence.

  As for Potter, he has been described by fellow students and his teachers as "attention-seeking" and "a troublemaker." Furthermore, he was chosen as a fourth contender in the Triwizard Tournament under suspicious circumstances.

I'm sure a better writer could do abetter job than I did, but I think I made my point. Everything I wrote was completely true (other than maybe the details of what Fudge said, but he definitely would have made some statements that could be used), and yet it's completely misleading. Tabloids are known for using the same sorts of tactics to avoid libel lawsuits.

In fact, I can imagine the Daily Prophet advertising the fact that their stories are magically compelled to be true, while still using tactics like this to push whatever narrative they want.

** What does 'to only print the truth' mean? It will be blank when lies are fed to it? it will magically alter it into truth? if former, the first edition with this press will be blank and it taken them some time to get used to it and as others mentioned here, they will use tabloid tactics to print truth but in a misleading tone .. all they have to print is he said, she said in a slant towards what they want readers to believe and if it's later, that's a great piece of magic, so many secrets to unravel .. it has no place being a printing press anymore.

**** One version is from the one-shot suggested in the comments .. the press replaces the lies fed to it with what the user believes to be the truth.

Another would be to not print any lies, what user knows as lies .. so there will be blocks of text and then empty spaces in there.

Another is to print nothing if the user knows a lies is fed to it, so force the user to give it what he believes to be truth .. easy to workaround, confound your employee to believe everything he is feeding the press is truth before he does it.

Another is that press knows what is universally true & false and decides for itself .. awesome magic, someone will steal the thing to get everyone's secrets and may be secrets to lost magics.

** As someone else pointed out, the truth can be twisted to lead readers towards a certain conclusion. Newspapers do it all the time. Rita Skeeter's only lie in the articles from which we see excerpts in the books is that Harry started tearing when she mentioned his parents. Other than that we have facts and opinions of actual people (even if those people don't like the targets of the article). For a spell like that to work, the printing press would have to present an objective truth without any opinions included and not Harry's truth, nor Fudge's truth, in which case the article would still sound something like: "Harry Potter has been known to seek attention in the past. He also claims that Voldemort has returned." which is also not helping Harry's case very much.
