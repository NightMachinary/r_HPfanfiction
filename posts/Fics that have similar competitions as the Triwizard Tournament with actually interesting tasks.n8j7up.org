It doesn't have to be an actual Triwizard Tournament... it can be something along the lines of the All-Wizard Cup too. I just want to read about an engaging competition where contestants get to prove their magical prowess and the crowd actually gets to see them in action. I've seen a few attempts but most of the times the tasks are boring (the Runestone Path had some cool ideas but too bad the rest of the story is crap) and I would like not to read a canon rehash either. Also no OP MC who just breezes through the tasks while leading with a hundred points above the next competitor.

If you know of such fics, I'd appreciate your recommendations. Thanks in advance!


** The fourth fic in The Pureblood Pretense series has a nine person tournament with a variety of tasks, though you'd need to read the earlier fics for it to make any sense.

*** Also, I love the way the Triwizard Cup is handled, double-subverting the reader's expectations about it being tampered with. It's a Portkey! But it does exactly what it was supposed to! But Harry gets ambushed by Voldemort anyway!

The Forest was a much more interesting task than the canonical dragons, and the politics between champions was a nice twist.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
