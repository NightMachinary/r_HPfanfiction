Looking for anything similar to the way it's portrayed in /Coven/ by Naidhe linkffn(12574292) , /Timeless/ by damnedscribblingwoman linkffn(12531858) , /One Step Left/ by Cysteine Snape linkffn(9426206) , or /Eventual Envelopment/ by LJlashlaure linkffn(8112955)

Can be slash between the two, but not necessary. I'm mainly looking for good banter and tension, and not miscommunication and drama (as in: you dare have secrets from me after we've been shagging for a week! I can't see you anymore!).

Appreciate any help! Cheers!


** You might know it already, and it's not focused on a Pansy-Hermione relationship (more like the whole group of people with everyone else), but it does have a very nice depiction of Pansy. Since you have no other recs, it might be better than nothing... I know what you want is not easy to find at all.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.

*** Yeah, it's a tough find, I might have listed all the existing ones already. I have read Rebuilding, but I was't focused on Pansy that time, so it might be nice to revisit. Thanks for the idea!

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

  Hermione would like to think that she was old enough and mature enough to have a handle on her temper, only clearly she didn't, because it was 1991 and she was eleven. Again. Over a stupid slur and Pansy Parkinson being her predictably spiteful self.

  What would have happened if Dobby had flinched and taken one step to the left, leaving Hermione behind to fend for herself and thus causing a terribly different outcome of the war. "You defeated my husband on his own land in a duel. Pureblood tradition states that you claim all that was his...including his wife." (Image by NeraLuna on DeviantArt. Used with permission.)

  The war is over, and Hermione has reached the end of her rope and let go. Pansy is there when she hits bottom, and together they try and build something new,eventually. Read the chapter warnings, this is sometimes dark and disturbing. Psychodrama.
