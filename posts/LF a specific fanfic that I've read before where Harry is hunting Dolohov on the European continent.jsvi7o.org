:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it was on archive of our own but I can't find it now. Some plot points that I remember (Spoilers below! hopefully I used the markdown correctly) If any of you remember or know what this fanfic is it would be greatly appreciated! I read it in early 2019 but I don't know when it was originally uploaded and I think I remember it having >50 chapters. Thanks in advance!

- >! Ginny can't commit to relationship with Harry originally, I think because of trauma from Harry always putting himself in danger and so Harry throws himself into being an auror !<
- >! Harry learns how to do magic with his hand and with silent incantations. He works to track down Dolohov who is building a criminal network of dark wizards. Dolohov forces Draco Malfoy to help him by holding his mom captive. Harry encounters Draco and helps him rescue his mom and then they sort of work together to track Dolohov and try and bring him down. Harry also meets Sofia? or some other original female char at a different ministry of magic to try and track down info on Dolohov from his hometown. !<
- >! Harry also helps fund an orphanage and originally that's his only real trips back to England. He encounters Ginny there one time when he's in disguise !<
- >! Ginny meanwhile plays for the Hollyhead harpies and has a successful quidditch career. At one point somehow Harry gets challenged to play quidditch against her except the quidditch match gets interrupted !<
- >! Ron and Hermione aren't very central to the story but our aurors/employed by the ministry of magic that help Harry but largely stay in England. They are together in this fanfic !<


** “Inner Demons by serendipity_50“ linkao3(601124) ... the first fanfiction story I read which persuaded me that it is possible for amateur writers to write literature worthy of reading.

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
