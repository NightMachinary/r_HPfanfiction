I'd love a well written in character fic from dracos point of view. It doesn't have to be from beginning and it doesn't have to be super long. I'm just interested in what certain parts of the story would be like for Draco from a really thoughtful writer. I think he's an interesting dynamic character that I'd like to explore!
