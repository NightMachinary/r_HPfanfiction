Are there any fanfic that has a similar plot like "Forever and a Day"? I wish to see Severus Snape and Harry.Co reach some sort of reconciliation. Setting could be post DH or time travel. I have been imagining Harry being in his 8th year and still taking Snape's potion class in order to become an auror. The two of them can in some ways mend their relationship a bit. Hope to follow the canon, NOT Severus as Harry's father/lover. Any recommendations? Thanks in advance!
