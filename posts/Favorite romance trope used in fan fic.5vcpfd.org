(Please try to keep posts silly and positive; I'm sick in bed so have some mercy 😄)

Valentine's Day has since passed, and now I get to muddle through the dozens of fantastic and fantastically bad romance fic fest submissions. I'm a sucker for a good, well thought out love story and there are some tropes that I see over and over, but can't get enough of them. Favorites include:

- Oh no! It's a snowstorm and we have to take shelter in a cave, but we've lost our wands and must huddle together for warmth....and maybe more
- Who is that sexy man/woman in the mask? I've never been more in lust/love and we must be together this instant!
- I'm stuck with this jerk as a potions partner. I didn't realize they were so smart....or so shagable.

What are yours?


** Even though it's used in almost every fic that has Harry in school (HBP redo, 8th year fic) and is never as good as I imagine it could be, I still love when they have another Yule Ball.

***** I know they mention social clubs like Gobstone Club and stuff, but my head canon has always expanded on that and added Latin, Deulling, Potions, etc Clubs for students to socialize and interact with others who are interested in their favorite subjects. It makes sense that so many extracurricular activities were cancelled bc of dangerous events, but I wish she would have mentioned them more. I can definitely see an emphasis on interhouse stuff like school dances being more important post-Voldemort.

** Oh boy. I'm a sucker for enemies who keep noticing that the other person is attractive but being like WHAT WHY DID I JUST THINK THAT - extra points if it's a slash or femslash pairing because then you get some good "ALSO THAT PERSON IS MY GENDER" panic as well (which I just relate real hard to).

I love fake dating tropes, especially if they have to kiss for some reason (to prove it's not "fake" even when it is??) and end up liking it way too much.

Forced bed sharing is another great one. Whatever the circumstances it's great.

Also, soulmate AUs. Ahhhh, I love a good soulmate au.

*** I'm curious, what's there to like about the soulmate thing? To me it always just felt like very lazy writing that skips a ton of character/relationship development and just goes to "Huh, we are soulmates, guess we have to love/fuck each other now". I can sooort of tolerate it as a veela thing, but that's about it.

**** Hmm this is a big question!

My favourite soulmate fics are ones where a) the 'soulmate' thing is discovered in an interesting way (names or symbols or important words appearing on your body, one where anything that happened to your skin happened to theirs (bruises, drawing, etc), stuff like that), and then b) the characters are resistant to it - though I read a lot of Dramione and Flintwood and other rare pairs where they don't like each other.

Then it's kind of this process of, why is it you, why are we compatible, do we have to follow along with fate, can we ignore this, and THEN you get to the good character/relationship building stuff! I agree, it can definitely be a case of "oh okay well guess we're in love now" but I much prefer when it explores the situation more fully and develops the characters to a point where they DO like each other and ARE happy with it. Does that make sense?

Like, I like them for the same reason I like (some) marriage law fics or soul bond fics and stuff like that - I like the idea of two people who are determined by the "fates" or the powers that be to be together but they aren't necessarily buying it, and they have to learn about each other and then they realize it was good all along.

Not for everyone, for sure!

***** I think this trope would be infinitely more interesting if it was subverted, and the couple that ended up together were not soulmates - the only one I've seen do that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8857564][this]] BBC Merlin (Merlin/Arthur) fic. I also don't usually like soulmate AUs because they place romance as the Most Important Relationship Ever - I've only seen one give as much focus to platonic relationships as romantic ones - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9237575/chapters/20949500][this]] Voltron fic.

Do you know of any fics that subvert the trope, or that have platonic soulmates as well?

**** I don't mind if the soul bond is basically the central part of the story. But I hate when I'm reading a story and they've well established the relationship and then the author throws in the soul bond when it wasn't needed at all. I sometimes check out here because it signifies there will be no relationship drama to come and the couple will be perfect here on out. I like when relationships have drama.

*** It's not HP, but if you like the MCU there's a short Darcy/Loki fake dating fic that you'll love, I can find it for you when I'm home if you want. It's seriously the hottest fic of that trop I have ever read, I read it every few months and I'm still in love with it.

Otherwise, excellent choice of tropes ! Especially the enemies things (but no slash for me).

I also have a Lucius/Hermione where he keeps noticing her, but he wants to make her date Snape (AU 20+ years post war). Hilarious and hot, IIRC.

***** Here's the one I was talking about : [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3928408/chapters/8798995]] (now that I have it open in a tab, I'll read it again... I seriously can't get enough of it)

From the same author I also liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/267259]] , it's mostly smut and funny situations.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2369780/chapters/5233052]] That one was great too, no magic/no avengers AU, with a rock star Loki.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1929780/chapters/4167267]] That one too !

Other author, [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/409695]] The second part is unfinished, unfortunately, but the first one is the best and I hoped the 2nd one would go in a different direction so it's not such a big loss for me (I read it when the second part wasn't out, IIRC).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2111391/chapters/4605813]] This one I only read about half, but I like the trope, it's basically "Loki is on probation on earth and Darcy has to teach him how to act human". I can't recall the titles of the others of that trope I read, but I like it, although I find that the fics are often too long (or more exactly, they get together too fast, and the rest is a bit boring).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3203834/chapters/6967478]] That one is great, the second part I didn't finish yet. AU no magic, very hot :)

You'll have realized that I don't care that much for the Marvel stories, just their characters. I'm not a huge fan of the MCU, I don't remember all the details from the movies and never read the comics, so it reflects in what I read. But I really love that pairing, I love Loki (when he's mostly good, but conflicted, perfect for nice hurt/comfort/mischief stories), and I hate to break already well established couples/don't want him to be paired with Sif or another asgardian, so Darcy's perfect for the job. Plus she can be hilarious and super bossy, great for that pairing !

(I also gave you more than just the one I was talking about, since you're interested :) )

Until a frozen corpse shows up on the front porch. Casting herself as amateur sleuth, she embarks on a journey that will challenge her definitions of good, evil, love and what it is to be human.

****** Lol, ok then :-)

linkffn(5706309) The Fifth Act, very cute fic, though the relationship moved a little fast, I felt. Still one of my favourites.

linkffn(4014370) Speechless, one of the, in my opinion, most realistic portrayals.

linkffn(2625870) The Cinderman's Kiss. It's been a while since I read this one, but I remember liking it. It's a bit different in that it doesn't take place immediately after the war, but several years later, but still the same premise.

linkao3(2457953) The Most Powerful Magic. Hope I got the link right, this one isn't on ffn. I love this fic. It's actually Epilogue Compliant, and the kids play a part, which I think really adds something to the fic. Basically, Severus is in a coma for like 20 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's a bit sappy, but in a canon sort of way? Power of love and all that rot. I'm not really describing it well, because it's kinda one of those fics that sounds really dumb when you try to describe it, but ends up being really good...

Anyways, these are my top four. I'd love to hear what you think, especially from a more academic standpoint. I may be totally biased because it's my favourite pairing, but I thought all of these (well, at least three, like I said, I don't remember much about the Cinderman's Kiss) were really well done. So, yeah, let me know :-)

  Regency-era AU. Physician's daughter Hermione Granger finds herself in need of a way to pay off her father's debts after his death. Draco Malfoy, retired from the politics of the Isolationists, a group of pure-bloods bent on separating 'true' magic from lesser folk, finds himself in need of a tutor for his son, Scorpius, who appears to be incapable of magic and must learn to survive in a world without it. Draco also needs a wife and mother for Scorpius, to satisfy a promise to his unwell father. After she saves his son from an attack by Isolationists, Draco hires the Muggle-born Miss Granger for the former, and after a riot in Vauxhall Gardens and a scandalous discovery made by his mother, weds that selfsame Muggle-born for the latter. While making the best of her marriage of (in)convenience, Hermione discovers that Scorpius' history of wild imaginings and dreams is more than just imagination. As she attempts to teach him about magical abilities no one expected he would ever have, she and Draco work together to raise Scorpius and learn to trust each other.

  That one-night stand with Draco Malfoy was a mistake. Hermione doesn't make mistakes, or at least she isn't supposed to. She's working hard at her Ministry career, however frustrating and pointless her job may be, and she's also got to live up to everyone's expectations as Hogwarts's most famous Muggle-born and a top-tier War Hero. So, why is she still sleeping with Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and infamous pureblood? And why isn't she certain that she wants to stop?

** My most favorite romance trope is the Bonnie and Clyde one; that is, two people notice each other, then do something bad together (or vice-versa). Then they grow even closer because (gasp!) they are criminals now and they only have each other to depend on! So that naturally leads to more crime and more closeness, until it's the two of them versus the world.

Two good examples are linkffn(renegade cause) and linkffn(hail odysseus).

- Forced bed sharing/cuddling for warmth - Physical intimacy!
- Secret identities - When characters don't know who each other are, so they share information that they wouldn't typically share un-anonymously.
- Enemies to Friends to Lovers - But I don't usually like the characters being attracted to each other when they don't like each other [and especially when they don't respect each other] on an emotional level? I think it's a lot more interesting to see characters from complete disgust with each other to establishing an emotional connection to attraction.

** I like the mutual respect, especially with a mutual dose of "oh, my skills are normal, /you're/ the special one".

Soul bonds are pretty convenient, and they can be enjoyable.

** The Beauty and the Beast/damaged hero trope every time.

I don't see that much of it in fanfiction (maybe there is some but not with characters I like). But it's what I look for when I want to read a romance and tends to be what I write.

** This thread gives me the giggles ...! The cozy in a cave is one of my faves too!

I like enemies to lovers where at some point the pairing figures out that each the enemy is not as he/she appears. accidentally being able to read minds? Forced interaction via tutoring or something?? Accidentally stumbling on knowledge about someone's secret past?

Also slash when a character originally identifies as straight ..

** I guess my romantic trope is a couple in a long distance relationship who haven't seen each other in a long time finally meet again and run up to each other and kiss and aaaah

So... it's not really a trope, but more of my favorite romantic scenerio, you feel me?

This happens a lot in Older!Harry/Fleur stories where Harry and Fleur are dating pre- Goblet of Fire, so when Beubaxtons arrives at Hogwarts there's this big romantic scene between the two.
