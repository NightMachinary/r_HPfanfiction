/Out of the Night/ by Raining Ink is one of my all time favourite stories.

It's been deleted from FFN.net (although the author links to some places to download a copy) but I still read it every once in a while.

One of the reasons I love it so much is the path Harry takes to become a 'Dark Wizard'.

It's more than just an insult, or an arbitrary title. It's an embracing of /magic/ and magical heritage. Not just 'Light' magic.

I love how it isn't some thing he decides to do over night because Dumbledore pissed him off or whatever. I love the slow accumulation of knowledge, the informed decision, on what it means to be a Dark Wizard, and the eventual realization that it would make himself happy to become one, because it makes him feel like he /belongs./

Anyways, are there any stories that have similar process like this? It doesn't have to be exactly like /Out of the Night/ or anything, as long as it isn't some random, out of the blue split second decision to become 'Dark' or evil.

Harry doesn't have to become evil either, just embracing Dark Magic, but evil Harry is fine too. Neat magical theory building is a plus as well.

Bonus points if the story mentions magic having a 'feel' to it, and Dark Magic makes Harry feel warm/safe etc.

** Although this fic is often recommended, so you've probably already heard mention of it, Saving Connor is very much what you're looking for -- and if you're not fond of slash, it's a small plot point that doesn't come up at all in the first few books. Lightning on the Wave made a very complex, diverse magic system, and the differences of Light, Neutral, and Dark are fascinating.
