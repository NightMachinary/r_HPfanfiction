***** I can forgive older teenagers because some twelve-to-thirteen year olds would fantasize about something like that (prince on a white horse sort of trope) but once you're an adult you should be able to go "Yeah, no, I know teens read this, let's not encourage this kind of wishful thinking on a grand scale, what if they think it's plausible."

I mean, not that fanfiction is PLAUSIBLE but I do think people internalize a surprising amount of behavioral/social cues through fiction and (now) fanfiction.

** Oh God Not Again!

It had a few funny moments. Otherwise it was a complete 'do over' fic with almost zero deviation from canon. Some stories that stick to canon can be pretty good, but when it has to bend itself in loops to avoid its own deviations, then it's a bad story (Umbridge just happening to send dementors to the Hufflepuff quidditch game in third year).

The characters weren't likeable, except Gilderoy.

The worst is how Harry's thoughts often broke the 4th wall, were used to address reviews, and acted as authors notes. Especially when it was to fill plot holes that came about because they were trying to stick to canon so closely.

**** I haven't finished the story, but here's a few things that bugged me.

*SPOILERS BELOW*, I don't think there's a spoiler tag in this sub, so collapse this comment if you don't want to read them.

Keep in mind that what I expected after reading the summary for the story, was that it would follow canon as closely as possible, and it would only be filling the gaps.

Students outfoxing Snape. I mean, one thing was with Sirius where he was emotionally involved, another is during a duel against students.

Neville presuming way too much about the prophecy, often correctly.

Harsh punishments way too fast, one day they're all happily having classes, the next they're hanged in the great hall for days literally bleeding to death.

Thinking with portals.

The last straw for me was when they were sent to the forbidden forest at night on a full moon, where you had werewolf's happily talking to the kids. Not too mention when Lupin just so happened to be in the vicinity at right time to try and save them.

These are just what I recall from the top of my head, I'm sure there are a lot more...

*** The Denarian Trilogy is one of the few overpowered Harry stories that doesn't suck; that is because the main enemies are overpowered as well, which gives a semblance of balance.

You can read it without having read the Dresden files, since everything is explained adequately.

I also think it is one of the few stories where Harry is legitimately a badass ( and a bastard as well) and it is pulled off really well. ( Seriously, this story has probably the most and best one liners I have ever seen.)

Finally, even though it has been a while since I reread it (notice: reread), I am pretty sure that the story is simply ok for the first chapters, but then it picks up.

If you don't like the idea of the Fallen Angels ( which comes from Dresden Files ) then yes, there is no way you will ever like the fic. If you don't like crossovers in general you will once again, probably never like it. But if that is not the case, I would suggest checking out a few more chapters.

** I'm a Harry/Draco shipper and one of the most commonly recced fics here is Saving Connor. Finally gave it a try a couple weeks back and was incredibly unimpressed. I think I read the first chapter in full, then decided to just skim the rest. Got about 4 chapters in before I completely lost interest.

It was just so cheesy and the fact that they put SO much on Harry's shoulders while letting Connor be oblivious was really sickening. I'm sure there's a point to it within the fic, but it seems unrealistic. While I think 11 year olds are smart and able to make educated decisions and whatnot, I really dislike when authors give kids TOO much insight since it doesn't seem natural. And Saving Connor felt like one of those stories: where Harry is just innately so knowledgeable and worldly in order to protect his apparently dumb ass brother, who is, in fact the same age and raised in the same environment and really shouldn't be lacking in quite so many ways compared to Harry. No thanks.

*** You made a good choice. That grind is tough to read, and it's the main point of the story. Harry tries to overcome it many times, and he regresses many times, and people accuse him of regressing and he disagrees many times, and it all gets very repetitious.

The story does explain to why Harry is so much more useful than Connor, at least: Connor was raised by James, and Harry was raised by Lily. Lily drilled him like a slave and a soldier from the time he was four. James explicitly wanted to stay away from the pureblood traditions and rituals.

Those rituals and traditions were so precise and all-encompassing, though, that it felt before long like the author was just making them up on the spot, rather than building a world with a range of traditions and selecting from those. It would be unreasonable for anyone to learn even a sizable fraction of the traditions if everything she mentioned in the story were no more specific than typical.

Draco: You are too self sacrificing and do not value your own life. You should put yourself first, by which I mean put me first.

Harry: I find that difficult because abuse.

** Shadow Walks by Lorien. It is recommended a lot here, which is probably an indication of a large number of H/Hr shippers on this sight, but I don't see anything special about it. My problems with it:

1. Angst. So much Angst. Justified angst is fine, but when most of the first half of the story is angst because of something that happened off screen, it gets too much rather quickly.

2. Rather Cliche premise -- Harry and Hermione are forced apart from each other due to circumstances. Not a bad premise by any means, but I've seen dozens of stories like this.

3. I thought Luna was rather poorly characterized. Her character voice just doesn't carry the same charm it did in canon.

4. The Romance was bad. Instead of actually working on it, the author went down the lazy route of "Harry and Hermione are separated, then they realize they love each other romantically." Yeah, no. I don't buy it.

5. While the alternate dimension stuff was better than the angsty stuff, the dimensions themselves were just chosen randomly by author instead of any logic used. Had the author actually shown the point of divergence for the AUs, I would have applauded her, instead we have AUs like the "Harry is a Dark Lord" AU which just seem random and stupid and unbelievable.

That is all, I think. If there is anything inaccurate about my criticisms, it is because it lost my interest early on and I skimmed through many parts of it. Some stuff was genuinely good (I liked the other Hermione stuff), but most it was meh, and what is good is much drowned in /angstangstangst/.

** 95% of the entries in my fan fiction ratings doc have notes about their misogyny. The Firebird Trilogy comes in as the most notable such. It felt like "I'm an MRA, and this is what feminists want the world to look like, and here's totally not a self insert of how I would totally kick ass and defeat those awful females." I can list off thirty or forty fics that are pretty popular and still fail my misogyny filter. It's depressing how rare it is for a fic to pass the Bechdel test. Harry Potter and the Final Straw has Harry dating Luna Lovegood, but Luna has almost no lines and rarely even appears in narration.

Probably the /worst/ fic I've read was Larcency, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood. It's full of torture, rape, and sexual assault played for laughs. Which is unfortunate, because it would have been a fun story if it just removed the Dean and Snape subplots and modified the ending slightly.

**** Well, it wasn't anything rigorous. It's a guide for whether I am willing to reread a fic more than anything else. It's things like:

- Does a female character decide to do anything on her own, for her own goals, to serve her own interests, and then go off and do it?
- Failing that, is there at least one female character who has her own goals besides protecting and helping a man?
- Is any female character fridged? (I'm not worried so much about male characters being fridged because it's rare and male characters are usually more fleshed out and usually have a death that serves as character development for them. But if I find an egregious example of male fridging, I'll count it the same.)
- Is the main plot purpose of any female character being the damsel in distress?
- Is there egregious sexual violence? As an aside, I've only once found sexual violence in fan fiction that /wasn't/ egregious.

The first criterion isn't a hard stop. It should be, but if it were, I would have slim pickings indeed. I just finished Palimpsest yesterday, for instance, and it didn't pass despite having Hermione as the main character, which is rather horrible. When a fic passes this criterion, though, it's like Christmas and my birthday all in one day, if there aren't any other problems.

I have other, vaguer criteria that I use. For instance, I read A Fine Spot of Trouble, and while I didn't note any of these problems, a lot of things just felt wrong to me, so I dropped it.

For general fiction (not fan fiction), I've just lowered the bar to having at least one female character in the first three chapters who is not sexualized, with no characters being fridged or damseled in the summary or first three chapters. If I don't find that, I'll immediately drop the book. Even there, I'm about zero for four today.

Are you unfamiliar with the concept of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][fridging]]? There's more to it than just dying.

In general, though, stories have something like four major male characters per major female character. They just don't have the demographics to allow for killing off female characters and passing the Bechdel test after -- and that's if they had even a whelk's chance in a supernova of passing beforehand.

My selection mechanism, by the way, for general fiction is: go to Kindle Unlimited, go to the scifi/fantasy section, skip obvious romance novels, skip obvious sequels, examine what's left (with a preference for female authors). And for fan fiction, it's mainly looking at what's recommended here.

#+begin_quote
  Isn't all sexual violence by its nature egregious?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]], for instance, features sexual violence, and a huge part of the plot is trying to heal and handle normal life in the aftermath. That is not egregious or gratuitous. (I can't recommend that work, though, because the takeaway seems to be that, if you are experiencing trauma from sexual violence, you just need to find your One True Love and have the sexy times with them and everything will be fine.)
