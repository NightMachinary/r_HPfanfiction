Instead of waiting for this or that. Can be Dumbledore, can be Order Members, can be other people completely.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame or fortune, no Ron abusing Hermione, etc. IF there is please post a warning about it.

Would also rather NOT have Hadrian Potter-Black-Malfoy, etc, either.


** If you don't mind the training being retrospective, then Nonjon's series 'Where in the World is Harry Potter?' has him being trained by a whole bunch of different people who only really work out that he's been trained so heavily well after the fact. The training forms something of an influence on the main plot.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** If I'm not mistaken, and it's been ages since I've read it, but I think Harry is trained by Sirius, Remus, and Dumbledore in Lesser Evils. It's finished too and most of the pairings are canon. linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress)

  Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices; revenge, doubly so. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

** linkffn (Harry Potter and the Lightning Curse by Justbored21) is good. It's a Ginny and Harry ship. It does has Albus, Ron, and Molly bashing. linkffn (Ma Fleur, Mon Ange, Mon tout by mysterycritic135) is a good op Harry. I believe it only bashed Ron and Molly. It's Harry and Fleur
