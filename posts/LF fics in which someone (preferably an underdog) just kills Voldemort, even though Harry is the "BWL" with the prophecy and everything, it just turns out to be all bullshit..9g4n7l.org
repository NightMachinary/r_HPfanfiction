I would love a story in which everyone thinks Harry is super duper important to win the war and it's just not true at all. Preferably after 5. year or so, when he already knows what his mission is suppossed to be.

It would be cool, if the kill was completely unexpected and not at all planned.

Maybe Narcissa Malfoy gets really mad, when she sees Draco crying and just lashes out at the strange snake guy and suddenly boom, he dead.

Maybe Vincent Crabbe accidentally sends his AK in the wrong direction during Death Eater training and suddenly, oops, no whitey boi.

Maybe Remus Lupin can not pay for Wolfsbane once again and meets just the wrong person, and suddenly...

As you can guess crack is fine.

Thank you!


** Wasn't this true about canon? I mean just because Voldemort could lose a body and remain as a soul due to his Horcruxes, that doesn't mean he was utterly immune from losing his body to anyone or anything else in the world besides Harry. Or you could even skip that and NOT KILL HIM, and just lock him up for eternity and problem solved... :)

The prophecy didn't mean anything, except that Harry was a Horcrux and he'd have to die for Voldemort to truly die. But that doesn't mean nobody else could have taken action against him otherwise. :)

*** Yes, it kind of was, that is what I am going for here. For a reason I will never truly grasp Harry was made to hunt down the horcruxes and in the end good-boy-kill old Voldie , even though wizards a trillion times more competent could have done that as well. I would like to see a story that kind of makes fun of the idea that three teenagers are the best wizarding Britain can do against evil.

**** A bit, yeah. Ron tells Umbridge about Harry's Cloak and Marauder's Map, but that's as far as the bashing goes. He isn't much of a focus. Dumbledore and McGonagall are both bashed too. They come off as downright stupid, actually. If it wasn't for the fact that I greatly enjoy a jaded Harry who's sick of everyone's shit, I wouldn't recommend the fic at all.

***** It's worth noting that just about everything that Harry bitches out those two for is canon (I think there's a difference between how things played out with Umbrage and the blood quills between the book and movie). As for coming off as stupid, again depending on what parts of canon you draw from everyone spends plenty of time with the idiot ball.

All that being said I don't think this really crosses into bashing territory, it just doesn't show many people other than the main pairing being positive.

** I've always been a fan of the idea of Muggle methods to be used to kill him unexpectedly..

I mean think about it... Right after his resurrection, suddenly Harry pulls out a S&W M&P Shield and pops a cap in him via 45 caliber....

The wizarding community would certainly go ape shit over it...

Summary: Trelawney's first prophecy is complete tosh, and when Voldemort is finally killed, it's not by Harry. Not even by a Gryffindor.

*** I think I do understand it pretty well, thank you. Harry was marked by Voldemort, that is what sets him apart from others, that he himself has something in him that must die in order dor Voldemort to die. That he was "trained" by Dumbledore and in the end did the wannabe-kill was just because the books are called "Harry Potter" and that is part of why it is so ridiculous. I want to read a story that makes fun of this.
