I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7733333/1/The-Dark-in-Peace][The Dark in Peace]] it's my first "detective" Harry story and I really like it; what are the best Crime fanfiction you know? bonus points for some romance in it, to spice things up!


** Well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]]. It's very much "detective" Harry (overall feel is a noir story) and there's definitely some, well, I wouldn't call it romance, exactly. Seduction is closer.

There was a Book Club thread about it a while back on this board. Maybe take a look at some of those comments and see if it's for you.

*** Wonderful writing style with vivid use of analogies. Well complemented the Noir setting.
