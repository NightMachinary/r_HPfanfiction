I'm tired of reading fics where Harry and Sirius are really close and Remus is just the awkward third wheel in the corner.

Thank you! :)

  Placed with the Dursleys Harry will be safe, but Dumbledore would still like to have someone nearby to keep an eye on him. Someone mild and unassuming and unlikely to upset the Dursleys. Really, there's only one good choice.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I'm currently writing the series with my own OC's and this is a huge reminder that I wanted to incorporate Remus more than just an uncle from a previous life.

I would greatly appreciate if anyone has some suggestionsü§ó

** IDK any but I understand why people put Remus into the awkward 3rd wheel spot tbh. These are the reasons they use

Remus could've gone to rescue harry anytime when he was at the dursleys.

Remus is always considered sub par to Sirius as sirius is generally considered more handsome and his backstory with azkaban and his family makes him more appealing.

Due to Remus having no family name or such he is thrown to the side as a pity case for being a werewolf. Even if it is not on purpose it is done quite often accidentally.

I personally disagree with the fact Remus is not used its just the reasons I found why its like that.
