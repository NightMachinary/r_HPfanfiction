Looking for politics heavy fanfics! Send me your favs! Open to all genres, pairings and tropes.


** I cannot remember the name, but there's a fic where Harry and (I think?) Neville join a secret society called the Sun Chamber that secretly rules magical britain. Like a Wizengamot within a Wizengamot, I guess. That was quite political.
