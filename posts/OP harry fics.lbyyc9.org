Looking for fics of at least 60k words. Either completed or recently updated, also would like something written within the last few years as prior to that I read pretty much everything. No harry/ginny please.

Crossovers welcome.

Thanks in advance


** linkffn(A Flower for the Soul) - HP/FD pairing, involves a fairly powerful Harry, it's updated weekly.

linkffn(13551463) - SW/HP xover, HP/FD pairing - there isn't any development yet, Harry seems to be really OP in this despite haven't showed any powers yet, it's in early stages, updated monthly.

linkffn(13793407) - another HP/FD, it's a new story, don't know anything about his power level yet.

linkffn(13776217) - HP/Cyberpunk xover.

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

  Harry Potter is a being so dangerous and despised, if his secret ever got out he would be dead before dawn. Fleur Delacour is a Veela, and is so sought after you would think her Aphrodite made mortal. They should have never met. But the twist of fate is never so simple, and all the world can do is watch with bated breath as their destinies intertwine.

  With only weeks left to live, V enters the Afterlife for information on the man who built the chip that's killing her. Little did she know, someone else was also looking for Hellman. Harry Potter is as chaotic as they come, with magic and death following in his wake.
