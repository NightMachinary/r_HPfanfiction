The best example would be *Wastelands of Time*, where instead of searching for Horcruxes, he searched for the Lost City of Atlantis which coincidentally is where Voldemort's going too.

I'd just like to see him secretly going on an adventure by himself, and others are unaware of it. It doesn't matter for what honestly, to defeat Voldemort, a greater villain, or even to get power.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] It is a bit of a crack fic but might fit.

Essentially Harry leaves Britain for a vacation because he thinks he won't survive the fight against Voldemort and wants to see the world before his death. Wherever he goes he creates chaos.

*** This was a really great story, I read it a little while back and thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I do wish that the author made a sequel of some sort or something to give it a sense of finality.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
