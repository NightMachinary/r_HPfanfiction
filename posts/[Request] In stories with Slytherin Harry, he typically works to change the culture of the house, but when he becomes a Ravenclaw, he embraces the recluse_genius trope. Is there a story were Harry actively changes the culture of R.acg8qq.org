** Changing the culture of Ravenclaw is mostly a theme in stories where Harry takes Luna under his wing and quite often delivers a serious smackdown to get the message across. But I haven't seen a similar arc in Ravenclaw Harry arcs.

The best I can think of is Harry, Tonks (same age as Harry) and their OC friend ditching Ravenclaw and furnishing their own tower, (+with blackjack and hookers+) in the R-Series, which hasn't aged really well in over a decade.

**** The R-Series is an ancient, 7 fic long series of Harry/Tonks stories where she is his age and they run into each other before Hogwarts. It covers all seven years and the last two diverge pretty far. It is one of the few complete 7-part stories and the later ones are fairly original.

It has not aged particularly well and suffers from the same issues most early era stories share, its original ideas have since then become overused. Also, exaggerated Dursley abuse and the adults are nonchalant about it.

That being said, there are some pretty sweet moments between Harry and Tonks, especially when they have a childish innocence to it (IIRC half of books 3 and 4 is "will they, won't they").

Part 1 (note the extremly low story-id):

** My current ongoing has, among others, a goblin-raised Harry with a Ravenclaw foster mother. Of course he is himself sorted into Ravenclaw. He does the loner bit in year one but reaches out more in year two. Its early yet but I already have the claws looking up to him, as he moves the house toward more Hypercompetent rather than just smart. Ravenclaws get shit done, and so forth.

Interestingly, the same fic has a fem!Harry working on moderating her version of Slytherin. Comparing those two approaches was part of what got me writing the story in the first place.
