Movie Dumbledore is a much less calm person than Book Dumbledore. In PoA, he's waspish and snappy where Book Dumbledore was cool as a cucumber (for example, in the Halloween scene, he's doing a lot of yelling to get people's attention). He comes off as much more aggressive and out of control than Book Dumbledore. Book Dumbledore, in direct contrast, would never have practically assaulted Harry in GoF. In fact, I could see Book Dumbledore intervening in that situation. Stepping in front of Movie Dumbledore as he bum rushes Harry, calmly saying something along the lines of "I have no idea what you were about to do to my student, but I would discourage you from trying again."


** This is because Michael Gambon didn't read the books. He didn't see the point, since he was "playing with [screenwriter] Steve Kloves' words."

*** He did a disservice to the franchise, then. His acting in that scene is responsible for many of the Dark Lord Dumbledore fics out there. I'm not exactly a fan of Book Dumbledore, but Book Dumbledore is absolutely an improvement over Movie Dumbledore.

***** Off-topic, but the only detentions that Harry and Ron received from Snape were quite justified: Ron for yelling at Snape in class, Harry and Ron for calling a professor names (no matter how unfair he seems, as a student you're still not supposed to call a professor names), Harry for a being a smartass and Harry for almost killing a fellow student and lying about it.

******* Snape was demonstrating non-verbal spells with Harry. Harry used a verbal spell (Expelliarmus I think) to throw him into a desk. Snape scolded him, Harry said something, Snape said "...sir" and Harry responded "No need to call me sir". It's a bit of a cheeky response. Tell it to a professor that you have just attacked (even if for academic purpose) and I'm sure it means you're looking for trouble.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
