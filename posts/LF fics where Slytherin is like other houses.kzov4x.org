I am looking for a fic where Slytherin is a house like other houses which contains cunning pupils.

1.No hierarchy 2.No politics 3.No bullying of half-bloods 4.No showing of a United front in the school

Just cunning students living together focusing on nothing other than what they come to the school for-Studying.

Edit: I am getting upvotes but noone is suggesting the name of any similar fic.

******* suggested to be same as canon but hidden under politeness. The Malfoys genuinely seem to like Victoria anyway. Idk why he the other poster said her "ideology" is somehow tied to Malfoys- she's just friends with them, and there's some not so subtle hints that it's a bad decision that she will pay for in the end. (Especially since the plot seems like it's following Taure's previous fic, Alexandra Potter which he deleted once he started Victoria Potter. Alexandra Potter definitely regretted beings friends with malfoy in that one.)

Her being pseudo-ok with racism is being painted as a mistake and character flaw.

********* Not yet. Characters don't tend to instantly suffer repercussions for a flaw the same second it's introduced. Not to mention she did get chastised for it in universe twice already.

But like, we have the rough draft from Taure. He already wrote the repercussions for Alexandra. And given how everything about Susan's relationship with Malfoy is the same as from Alexandra, we can take a fair guess this is meant to be the same flaw she gets punished for.

*********** If I still remember this conversation when it happens I'll luk.

Tho really, one of the things I would critique about Victoria Potter is that she is a borderline Mary Sue. Her unpleasant biases and occasional bitchiness was sort of her most prominent character flaw that prevented her from being a Mary Sue. Would you really have enjoyed the story more if she didn't have that flaw?
