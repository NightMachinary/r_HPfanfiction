  The episodic adventures of a young, big-mouthed auror.

It was just a one-shot when I first read it, I thought it was complete, but looks like the author added another chapter recently so maybe there will be more to come. Can't speak to the second chapter, but the first was enjoyable and should fit your request.

** Heavily features Auror!Harry, and all of his co-workers are OCs. Very long (trilogy of 100,000+ words each book) and very well-written. The only thing is it has other plotlines as well (Severitus, funky explorations of magic, and some romance subplots).

** I am not sure if it qualifies, but it's not Auror Ron or Auror Harry:

linkffn(Murder Most Horrid) features veteran Auror Bellatrix Black. The auror corps there feels like a cop show's, with diverse characters. Hermione's the love interest of Bellatrix, which is a rocky relationship to start.

I've written an auror duo myself, but they're side characters.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
