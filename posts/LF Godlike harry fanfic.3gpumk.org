stories were it depicts harry as a being whos immensely OP, and i mean O-/freaking/-P. romance(hermoine or luna or even a harem) is required but it doesn't have to focus or emphasis on the romance, oh and please no slashes. AUs i can allow if it doesn't go far from the canon too much(e.g harry's parents are lily and snape which results in james being a death eater out for revenge blah blah blah)


** linkffn(Core Threads)

It's one of the really few OpieOP fics i like , it flows and it has nice humor.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

**** I'm not sure about this one specifically, but I find for most HP/SW crossovers you barely need any knowledge of canon other than what a Jedi is and what a Sith is.

**** Having seen the movies is fine, you just have to know how a Jedi/Sith looks like/fights. The rest is Star Wars AU anyway.
