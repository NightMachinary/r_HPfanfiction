I have been in this sub for 2 years now, and I have watched it's slow desent into madness until lately every single prompt is just crack on here. I'm not complaining, there is some really funny stuff on here, but I would have liked to see some real prompts for once.


** "Serious" prompts are super common, probably more common than the crack prompts, in fact. They're just flaired as Requests instead of Prompts.

*** The only difference between a Request and a Prompt (when flairs are used properly) is that requests come with the expectation that someone has actually written it before.

So you're right, prompts are by definition more likely to be crack because no one is seriously expecting it to have been written.

** Normal promts make for pretty boring short stories while you could write a paragraph of a crack promt and that will be satesfactory exploration of the promt.

Ex. harry gets romilda vaines love potion

.vs

Harry acedentaly kills the dark lord and no one know how to react.
