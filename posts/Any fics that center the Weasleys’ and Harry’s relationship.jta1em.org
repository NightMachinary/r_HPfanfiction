Hi! I'm looking for some fics that show Harry being accepted into the Weasley family. It can be canon compliant or not, but if it's AU, I'd like it to follow the general spirit of canon (i.e. no bizarre slytherin/pureblood/Lord black whatever politics, no super overpowered characters, no bashing, etc.)

I don't care so much about ships, but I do not like Harry/Hermione (unless it's Harry/Hermione/Ron), Harry/Daphne Greengrass, or anyone/adults.

Mostly, I'd really just like to hear the Weasleys' thoughts on Harry and Harry getting a family. I don't care about the ages, either.

Thanks! :D

  Harry's seventeenth birthday is coming up, and Molly Weasley is certainly not going to let him come of age without a traditional gift of a watch.

**** Just FYI, that author has a whole bunch of great missing moments/alternate POV one-shots involving Harry and the Weasleys during canon and also great slice of life stories of after the war. The longer ones are on AO3 but there are a bunch that are only on her Tumblr.

** Canon?

  Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.

  In which Albus Dumbledore keeps a bit closer eye on young Harry, and finds the Dursley family to be Most Unsatisfactory. That does, however, leave the problem of where to stash the lad - only temporarily, of course, until he can find someplace more suitable.The inhabitants of the Burrow have other ideas about that...

** Being taken in by the Weasleys after the Dursleys' abuse escalates is an important part of Nightmares of Futures Past. It's incomplete, though, and FFN deleted it. You can find up to chapter 42 in various places, or chapter 43 in the PDF/ebook on GitHub.

Also, linksiye(Meaning of One by Sovran) is mostly about the Weasleys coming to terms with Harry and Ginny sharing each other's thoughts and memories. I really like how its characters are more than one-dimensional. Mrs Weasley struggles the most, yet her worry always springs from genuine love - even when she makes serious mistakes. Mr Weasley is more open, yet he's unhappy about it too, just taking a less confrontational approach. Harry and Ginny are pleased with what's happened to them, but they do get things wrong, like almost incinerating Draco because they didn't know their own strength. It's an intriguing read.
