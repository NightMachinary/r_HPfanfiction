:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry ends up being invited by a teacher to a flying city, if i remember right. Also this DADA teacher gives the students an objective of guessing what kind of "curse" voldemort put on the position. That is all i really remember other than said teacher being an old woman.

I appreciate all help

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
