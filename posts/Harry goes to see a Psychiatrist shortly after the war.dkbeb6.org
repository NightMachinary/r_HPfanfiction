I'd like to read a fic from the point of view of a muggle therapist, who's been assigned a patient that everyone else has had trouble getting to. I've always believed Harry would need years of therapy after everything he's dealt with and experienced in his 17 years. I'd like the story to be about the progress the therapist makes with their troubling patient, who's seemingly dealt with more than anyone his age should have.


** This is a short excerpt I wrote:

[Hogwarts, September 7th, 1998]

Ginny: It's not getting better, a Hufflepuff second year blew out her dorm door last night. At this rate, someone will get badly hurt sooner or later.

Hermione: We need to find a psychologist soon. There must be a squib or two who work that field. If there aren't any here in Britain, I'm sure I can find some in other English speaking countries.

Ginny: I don't know how that Muggle psycho thing works, but I can guarantee you won't find any for tonight, which we need!

Luna: We can try a big sleepover in the Great Hall or in the Room of Requirement? Lots of people together can keep both Nargles and Others away.

Ginny: Others?

Luna: Yes, terrible tiny creatures that infest your mind. Every Death Eater and Snatcher I saw at Malfoy Manor had swarms of them.

She shuddered, Hermione and Ginny stayed very still.

Luna: Anyway, consider my suggestion. It wouldn't hurt.

Hermione: Bringing both boys and girls together, or should we separate the room?

Luna: Of course everyone should be together, it's not like they are going to have orgies.

Hermione: Luna!

--------------

Eventually, Hermione found a squib psychologist in Canada after two months. The therapy and counseling worked in a limited fashion, some got better, but many didn't.

This is postwar, this is not the innocent Luna from Year 6 and prior. She has suffered, she has seen suffering, she has seen many deaths, and she has killed.

I think by this point, most DA members are already using sex as a way to cope with their trauma, and some could be rather daring. Luna is no exception and she never shies away from speaking what's on her mind.
