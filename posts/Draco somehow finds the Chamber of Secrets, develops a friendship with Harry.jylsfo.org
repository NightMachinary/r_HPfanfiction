Harry is at Hogwarts by himself during Christmas break, he decides to enter the chamber because he's bored, all of a sudden he hears a sound and he can hear footsteps coming down into the chamber. Harry puts on his cloak and wait to see who it is. Draco comes in looking upset, and writes some thing on the wall of the chamber. Harry is surprised but writes a response underneath, and then leaves next time Draco returns he notices there's a response and they continue conversing by writimg on the wall. That's all i can remember

#+begin_quote
  When Ron and Hermione get together, they notice only each other. A nightmare prompts Harry to return alone to the empty Chamber of Secrets, and leads to a new look at an old enemy. Harry enjoys the company, but with Bellatrix Lestrange actively hunting him, how far can he trust a Death Eater's son? (H/D -- mostly friendship, progressing to mild slash) Sixth year.Quote: Despite himself, Harry grinned. “It's a dangerous combination, I suppose -- he has no morals and I have no fear.”
