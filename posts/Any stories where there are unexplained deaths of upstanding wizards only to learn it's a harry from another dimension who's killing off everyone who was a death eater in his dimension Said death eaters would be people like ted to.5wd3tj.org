** Hmm ahh, Realignment by Puzzle on SB has what appears to be a time travelling Harry attacking Hogwarts in an attempt to kill a very confused Tom Riddle. Then go on to cause general chaos and death all over, while also pissing of Grindelwald to no end. [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838]]

Features Grindelwald, Harry, Confused Riddle, and Mentor Dumbledore (to Tom). Since Dumbledore is the only Hogwarts professor that can stand up to the mysterious attacker, so Tom has to stick close.
