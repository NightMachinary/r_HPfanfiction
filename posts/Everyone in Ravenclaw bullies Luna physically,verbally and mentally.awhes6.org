** I'm gonna be honest, I think most people are pretty desensitized to canon. In most people's heads, Luna was an outcast and that's as far as they really recall. However minor or extreme someone wants to make it people can usually buy in. It's the same with the Dursley abuse, people bullying Hermione, portrayals of Ron, etc.

Most people are only interested in the general framework of the canon and take liberty with everything past that. There are stories where Harry is nearly killed by the Dursleys, Hermione is mercilessly tormented and hated, and Ron is literally paid to be Harry's friend for the sake of manipulating him.

They're all just devices for constructing each individual's version of the HP world, I wouldn't even say Luna's ostracization is one of the most aggressively abused ones.

** Been reading fics for ~10 years, and never once found those three situations.

You may need some better options maybe?
