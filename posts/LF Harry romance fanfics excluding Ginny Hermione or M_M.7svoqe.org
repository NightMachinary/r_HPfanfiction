Any good romance that left you a decent impression. Preferably finished fanfics with Harry slash any girl except Ginny or Hermione. No harem or at least a massive one. No M/M.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Call Me. It is a romance in which teenagers act like teenagers and do things without thinking it through. Has very little angst and a very refreshing touch on the summer after 5th year.

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

** Check this guy's profile " [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie]] " , he has a few stories you might like. Also, his Hermione in "What we're fighting for" is quite different from canon, so you might wanna check that out. It was one of the most enjoyable HHr fics i've read, mostly because she isn't a fucking pain in the ass. Really quite different, trust me.

Also check his favourites, he's a known romance lover, so there are a few good ones on his.

A few other suggestions are:

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood)

linkffn(Paid in Blood) - either my favourite all-time, or at least top 3 Daph/Harry, can't say for sure.

linkffn(Black Bond)

linkffn(To Be loved)

linkffn(Not the only Redhead)

Also, chek an author called Dorothea Greengrass. She has 4 stories, but i've only read the 3 longest one, and they are extremely enjoyable.

If you haven't noticed, i'm quite a Daphne fan.

linkffn(Trapped in a broom-closet)

linkffn(No More Games by VagueJester)

Yeah, i think that's it, there's a shitload more i could suggest, but those are quite good imo.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
