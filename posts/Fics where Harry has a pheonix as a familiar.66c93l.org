** Oh man, hope someone comes along and recommends a good fic. This idea has always had potential, but holy geez, I have never seen it done well.

Always seems like the phoenix is some weird ass deus ex machina and because harry can "bond" with it so well, he learns some eldritch magic and slaps the shit out of Voldemort.

Bonus points if he is able to learn some sort of fire apparition, seems like a standard thing with these kinda fics.

*** Yeah, canon Phoenix powers are the best imo. Harry shouldn't learn anything crazy from a phoenix, nor should he able to flame apparate on his own.

** linkffn(1657629) - Hedwig turns into a Phoenix. Holy crap, it's been ten years since PoT was updated. =( Loved it back in the day, although it doesn't get very far. Halfway through 6th year or so.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
