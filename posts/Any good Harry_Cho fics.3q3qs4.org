I cant seem to find a decent Harry/Cho story outside of a couple of lemons, and one really really odd lemon that involves a footjob and a cum and toast sandwich.

Any recommendations?


** Feathers, Fangs and Flames by DLP's Nauro... unfinished, but not abandoned, werewolf!Harry with nice, realistic Cho romance linkffn(Feathers, Fangs and Flames)
