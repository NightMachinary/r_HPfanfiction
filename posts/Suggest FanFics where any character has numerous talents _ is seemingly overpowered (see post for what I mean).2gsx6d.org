** Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][The Life of Brian: A Super-Harry Parody]].

nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] trilogy. Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]] by the same author.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][Joe6991]]'s Hero trilogy.

Ruskbyte's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/The-Order-of-the-Phoenix][Order of the Phoenix]] series.

Pretty much anything by [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais]] or [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/][Bobmin]].

It's not Harry, but Hermione from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is pretty much the textbook example of an "amped to 11" character. Well written, but a vastly superpowered main character.

** Phoneix.Writing's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem With Purity]] has overpowered Harry *and* overpowered Hermione. It's very long but complete, and it is one of my favorites - I like that there are so many details that when I reread it, I notice something I'd forgotten. It is eventually Harry/Draco and Hermione/Snape.

** Not entirely overpowered, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8115300/1/Bloody-Valentine][Bloody Valentine]] has elements of a character who has a warped sense of what normal people are capable of. It is a crossover fic though, and Fem! Harry. Might give you ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8021068/1/White-Owl][White Owl]] Another Xover FHarry, this time with a part basalisk/phoenix.

Lastly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] FHarry travels into the past and takes the long way home.

** You could try this one!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble]]

It's a Fate/StayNight crossover where Harry seems to accquire whatever powers he can, sometimes just to be cool, and his growth curve accelerates constantly until the author runs into the problem of not having anything to throw at him that's even close to a challenge by the end of the story.

I felt like some new accquisitions in this one were done because "Oh, hey I had a neat idea for something I could put in!" but then never got used because really, the idea was unformed.
