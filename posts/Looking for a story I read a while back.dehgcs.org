Hi guys

I'm looking for this story if any one can help.

From what I remember, Harry finds solace in the chamber of secrets, and there he finds a waterfall or a painting of a waterfall that allows him to see into the headmasters office. He also learns how to jump into portraits. Where he spies on order meetings, doesn't really trust anyone, not sure if it's a bashing book but could be.

I don't remember much else. If anyone can help I'll be really grateful.

Thanks :)
