** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]], linkffn(4545504): Hermione potioned Harry, but didn't work. (I'm not endorsing this awful fic, just responding to the request)

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

** Despite reading tons of stories with Ginny love-potioning Harry, the concept of Hermione doing it didn't even cross my mind! Would be interesting to read.

*** Yea to make this work one would really have to rewrite Hermione's character completely and change who she is entirely. Ill admit its not something I had EVER considered either and would be an interesting read. Although I also doubt many could do it well.

**** Seeing how she was in the sixth book, I wouldn't put it past her doing it on Ron to sabotage his relationship with Lavender. She was rather vindictive and nasty in that book, even to Harry.

So, more like slightly tweaking rather than complete rewriting.

***** In one of the Hermione-sends-a-message-back-in-time fics, she says something like: Ron's an idiot, but he's /my/ idiot and I've mostly got him trained. That's the sort of Hermione you need.

***** The whole Ron/Lavender thing though was more her being annoyed and subconsciously jealous. Its a big step to go from that to love potions. I also am not sure I would describe her as vindictive. Nasty perhaps, but then again, so is Ron and Harry in the 6th book. That book was a compilation of "Golden Trio" bashing in a way, where all 3 had major issues to sort through and relationships to figure out, and personal attitude problems to solve.

**** IMO, Hermione was more likely to use potions or memory charms to affect her relationships:

She was a excellent potioneer.

She used memory charms on her own parents.

She suggested Ginny to look for other boys to improve her situation.

So to speak, Hermione had the ability, had the idea, had the will, and had prior experience to do something like that.

***** Not one of those reasons really makes her more likely to use such tactics. If anything several of them may make her seem less likely.

For example, the fact shes excellent at potions hardly makes any sort of difference one way or the other. Its a massive reach to equate that ability to being more likely to use them. Suggesting Ginny look to other boys likewise makes zero sense. If she was more likely to use them would she not suggest the exact opposite?

The only one I could see a bit of your point on is the memory charming of her parents. But again, that goes both ways. She used the charms to protect them from a world they could not protect themselves from, in the process effectively losing her parents (as they did not know they had a daughter). That shows a willingness to bend the rules when necessary for the greater good, but hardly shows willingness to break rules for her own gains, especially since even though it saves her parents, it takes them away from herself.

While Hermione may of had the ability, known of the possibility, and had the minor experience of memory charms, its the personality you are overlooking in your assessment. Its simply not who she is. To be honest I don't think its who Ginny is at her core either, but Molly? Thats another story. In fact, many of those stories that have Ginny doing it, imply that its with the guidance of Molly. In fact, many imply Ginny is under compulsion charms (from Molly or other sources).

** I forgot the name, but I once read a oneshot where Hermione potions Harry to create the canon pairings.

Basically even Hermione considers her OT3 to be unrealistic, but as long as they are all Weasley's she wouldn't have to choose between her friends.
