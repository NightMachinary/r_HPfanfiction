So I read a crossover of hp and one of the James bond or mission impossible where harry is Q (or was it R?). Well, he's Q from skyfall (with glasses and sweaters and all) but before he took the role as a quartermaster I think. Bond comes down to the place to find out who he is (as in who R is in person) and everyone else is trying their best not to get harry caught. Harry is kinda sassy, has a tea in a cupboard that apparently holds some sort of chemical. I think the reason Bond wanted to find Harry was because Harry got tired of the agent breaking the gadgets so meddled with one of them. There was another scene where Bond found Harry's cup (the lettered cup with R instead of Q) and the team was trying to cover it up. Pushing Harry under and one of them volunteering that it was their cup. It might have developed into slash, most likely... I was in a spree.

Does anyone know the title of it? Pretty sure it was on ao3.


** I have always believed that the role would fit Hermione much better. Not exactly the one to fight on the front-line, but providing logistical, research and other support to those who do.

  Q has a secret. James needs to know it. Because together, they could save the world. Eventual SLASH.
