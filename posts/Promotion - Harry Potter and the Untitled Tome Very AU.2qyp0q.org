Thought I'd bite the bullet in case it's the kind of fic anyone here would be interested in. No bashing, and any fanon cliches get turned on their heads eventually.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Untitled-Tome][Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome]] - No BWL. After a half-century of conflict, the Wizarding World is granted reprieve while Grindelwald remains law in the Eastern Wastes. Branded both treasure and traitor to the British Union following a slew of schoolyard mishaps, Harry's personal library grows as he delves into the mysteries of his parents' double lives as the ill-fated keepers of a dangerously magical secret.

EDIT: Thought I'd put the amended summary up here - couldn't wait until the next update, to be honest. It's still subject to change.


** The story is in desperate need of a proper summary. Even the lengthy author's note gives no indication of the plot, as it talks at an extremely general level about themes. Not many people will read a fic without any idea of its content and I'm no different.

*** Many thanks for the feedback, Taure. It's quite embarrassing, but that summary is actually the second of its kind (a reviewer mentioned pretty much the same), and I'm honestly not that happy with it either. I certainly intend go back to the drawing board and give it some lengthy thought, but I'll keep it as is until the next chapter is ready.

**** It's inelegant, but if you're struggling with the summary then I'd recommend simply aiming to be informative rather than artistic.

***** I'll take that on board. Either way, it's bound to be an improvement - third time's the charm and all that. Thanks again!

******* Wow - thanks for all those suggestions. In hindsight, I guess that I tried to actively avoid spoiling the plot so much that the summary suffered heavily. Rookie error. I really do appreciate the help, though!

** Thanks for posting this. I'm always looking to read more AU fics and from what little I have read, this seems pretty good. I could really do without Harry's witty comments though but its just a personal preference.

*** Thanks for reading! This Harry's an awkward kid - like most clever eleven-year-olds, he's clearly not as smart as he thinks he is, but people grow up. What this Harry grows into remains to be seen though.

** Really enjoying this so far, I'm on four and intend to finish through eleven this afternoon. The way you're reintroducing the concepts of the (AU) wizarding world is really nice, I feel like I'm still reading about Harry/The Wizarding World (little details like Harry trying to pick up Ollivander's tools are really keeping him in character for me), but with enough changes that I feel like the world building has been done almost from the ground up.

*** Hi, thanks for reading!

I guess I've spent a lot of time on the worldbuilding (more than I would care to admit) and as such, Hogwarts may seem extremely different at first glance, but I'm trying to keep as much of the original charm there as possible.

** I've been following along with your story for a while now. I ran across it on FF.net with my general search parameters, read what you had at the time (either one or two chapters) and really enjoyed the flow and writing style.

The story seems to be going in its own direction and does not immediately remind me of anything else I've read. Keep up the good work. I'm looking forward to your next update, hopefully it will be soon.
