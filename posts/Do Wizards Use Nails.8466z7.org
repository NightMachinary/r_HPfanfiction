This thought came to me while I was deconstructing some furniture over the weekend.

This is probably more of a question for people's headcannon/thoughts, since cannon isn't that well defined (children's book following 'rule of cool' and all that.

I see two directions it could go:

If no: You can imagine wizards using permenant sticking charms or using magic to meld components together. Or even just creating such melded materials.

The thing is, with such a system, you would expect the magical world to have radically different construction. You don't need grout because you can just merge the rocks. Wood could be curved or have grains going radically different than what you see in regular lumber. For that matter, lumber itself should be very different: the way lumber looks relates to how we cut and sand the wood. Why wouldn't it look like lumber cut by Lazer or something?

If yes, then we would expect magicals to have a lot more knowledge of engineering/construction/physics. You can imagine magical solutions being harder to use or non-permenant. So it makes sense to say, use nails or grout when you are constructing things. Of course, magic would make this easier (magical nails that expand to needed size, or using magic to nail hundreds at once).

In this case the magical world would be a lot more similar to the muggle world.

Thoughts? It seems to me that with HP universe has to be the second. While this means there would be a much larger set of shared knowledge between the magical world and the wizarding world than is displayed in the books. But given how much seems to be "normal but a little magical" instead of "radically different"....

So, do wizards use nails?


** Magic in the HP world tends not to replace physical things but rather enhance them.

For example, heating is mostly achieved by conjuring fires rather than directly heating things with Charms.

Another example is that "illusions" are not common - wizards who want to change the appearance of a thing will generally Transfigure it, changing the thing's actual physical composition.

This isn't a hard limit - we see what might be described as a warming Charm in HBP, and there are definitely Charms which create illusions (e.g. disillusionment Charm). Rather it seems to be a matter of habit and culture.

*** It is also the nature of charms to be limited to objects.

#+begin_quote
  Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.

  Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.

  “And off again!” shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.

  “How do those hats work, then?” said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely. “I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object... I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though.”
#+end_quote

When Potter-verse creates a (lasting) enchanted objects, it is the object that is enchanted and behaves magically. The object is not merely a token to project a magical effect. The clearest example in canon of this is the invisibly cloak. An invisibly cloak works by being invisible. Wrap yourself in it and you become invisible yourself. Compare this to defining invisibility object in mythology: the Ring of Gyges and its fiction counterparts such as the One Ring. Such rings project invisibility beyond the object itself in a very un Potter like way.

One wonders where do the nails come from. Are they muggle-made? Would a pureblood use "filthy" materials in his mansion?

*** Well, that is interesting because in the regular world, nails are used to affix things like that because they are handy, but they are generally created for their role in construction. You could imagine the wizarding world being strange enough to go make nails just to nail messages to things.

But it might indicate they have access to nails that are used in construction.

I also note cannon has a few axe's and other tools around, suggesting wizards do use them to chop trees and the like..

** That's an interesting question, and there are a few ways you can go with it. Bonding potions, magically reshaped materials to form joints (such as dovetails or biscuit joints), magically merging objects... And if you don't have permanent versions of these, you can still use them to help in the construction process.

Canon tries to keep the feeling of Muggle UK, just a century out of date, and sometimes with a twist. That means essentially mundane buildings with magical additions. I'd expect nails driven by hammers, but with Thumb-Cushioning Charms on the hammer and magically sharpened nails.

*** Cannon does try for an 'out of date' feel instead of a 'completely different' feel. I guess you could say they are up to date to a point where they didn't need new advances because of magic.

But even 17th century building had a lot of domain knowledge that is not taught at Hogwarts. No wood shop here!. So there is a blank about how that is handled. Obviously they don't go learn from muggles. Maybe an apprentice system?

** To piggy back of some other answers, I would assume yes they use nails but generally just attach them with magic instead of using tools. For example when someone wants to build a house, they'd get all the wood and nails/screws/whatever and magically put them in place. I can't see them using sticking charms on the boards when building the frame since either a finite or time could erode the charms.

I may be remembering incorrectly but doesn't Mr Weasley have fun playing with a hammer sometime during the books? So I just see it as they just don't use tools.

*** More seriously, I think it depends on the artisan. I imagine a lot of the magical effects to imitate mundane ones unless intended otherwise: e.g. magically chopped wood is as if it were struck by an invisible, perfect axe, etc. So any "traditional" artisan will improve old designs with magic, but not change them. I imagine the more progressive designs to be over the top and eccentric, and therefore only suited to a niche audience.

In my very slowly developing AU, understanding is paramount to the quality of a spell. So a carpenter who knows the muggle techniques will be able to repeat those feats using magic, whereas someone without that innate understanding will create crude facsimiles of the real thing.

TL;DR

Yes, I do think they use nails. Even though there are purely magical alternatives.

** You can build without nails IRL. Google nailless construction. It's not as radically different as you imagine but the joints themselves would be larger without joists and nails.

**** Oh well in that case then yes they definitely use nails and rivets if you use the movies as canon. Of course that's because the movie sets and props were made by us muggles to be used in filming but lets just ignore that.

***** Well, the books don't exactly describe the wizarding work as being radically different, so of course the movies didn't spend a bunch of money to diverge from that.

That being said, it does seem that having magic would fundamentally change your principals. For instance, we use flat boards because of ease of creation and transport, curved surfaces are largely not used in part because of the cost of creating them. Would you expect greater use of curved surfaces in a magical world?

****** Considering that everything in Diagon Alley is warped looking I would say definitely yes.

The ability to shrink objects and teleport places would allow for cheap instant transport of basically anything. I bet they also have magic to instantly cure wood instead of having to let fresh lumber dry for a year or more. Their magic might even cause a tree to grow into the shape it needs to be rather than actually worked by hand.

If The Burrow's whimsical structure is any indication, they do have this, at the very least, if they wish to construct with magic alone (or predominantly).

From the title, I thought this thread would be about that lady in Knockturn Alley who was selling human fingernails, lol.

** That's a good question and one of the things that I wish JKR had been more explicit about, even though it really only matters to those of use who write fan fiction! You raise a good point with the grout--I believe the basement kitchen floor of Number 12 is described as "stone-flagged" which indicates discrete stone tiles held together with some sort of medium. Why not just make it all of one piece?

In one of my stories I mention the California Architect Julia Morgan. She designed and built Hearst Castle and many other structures in California that have withstood the test of time and earthquakes. How? Simple--she was a witch and used strengthening spells in the concrete!

** Certain builders and companies would probably use Nails, the risk in using Sticking Charms even 'Permanent' ones is that anything that feeds on magic, can undo the spell or other wise could interfere with the stable spell could cause the entire structure to fail. Nails are cheap and easy way to insure that that shotty sticking charm doesn't cause the entire house to collapse.

** There are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPUPyuz_ink][very labor-intensive ways to join wood]] that would be much less difficult with magic. Wizards would likely have figured out such things before iron smelting, and without the labor-savings of nails, they wouldn't have any reason to switch.

*** Which supports the idea that wizarding methods should be radically different than what we know (despite what we see in cannon). After all, so much of what we do is based on the ease of manufacturer, shipping, and use of these materials. So much of how we construct a cabinet is related to the physical requirements we need to meet.

Notched wood is basically why I would guess you wouldn't need the standard ways if you had magic: if you can make wood grow into each other in spike, you can get a very tight bond more useful than nails.
