I've always been fascinated with the idea of how an older Harry Potter would be like. A powerful, skilled, intelligent, hardworking, and resourceful Harry. Even more so than he was already portrayed to be in the books. Unfortunately, most fanfics involving an older Harry have him inhabiting the body of his former child self which I'm not a fan of. I'd like a piece where the story takes place during either Harry's original school years or the Marauder's Era. If there's a piece that goes even beyond the Marauder's Era (Grindelwald's time for example), that would be fine too!

I've already read quite a few of these but none really scratch that itch - sorry for not linking them but I honestly can't find the ones I liked on fanfiction.net just now for some reason.
