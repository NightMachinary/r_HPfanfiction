I'm not really interested in Harry or Hermione in Slytherin. I've already read the Changeling.

I want something that centre's in Pureblood culture within the Slytherin house I would be interested in stories from the POV of: Marcus Flint Blaise Zabini Theodore Nott Draco Adrian pricey


** In the Pureblood Pretense Harry is sorted into Slytherin and is pretending to be a Pureblood, and becomes friends with Draco and Pansy. As the series progresses they deal more with Pureblood culture and what it means for them.

** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but Slytherin Squad by Halfblooddragon explores Slytherin culture post-war and how Draco is working to change its reputation and attitudes. It's a Draco x Ginny story about a squad of aurors from Slytherins and it features Blaise, Daphne, Cassius Warrington, Theodore Nott. It explores the culture and attitudes they've been raised with and contrasts them against the other auror squads. It's also just really, really good.
