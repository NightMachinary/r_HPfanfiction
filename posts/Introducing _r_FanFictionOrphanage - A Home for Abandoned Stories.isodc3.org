Hi there!

So a few hours ago a post on here got some traction - talking about how there should be a site/source for abandoned stories, so that later writers can breath new life into them.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iscasr/there_should_be_an_orphanage_for_abandoned/]]

I'm happy to announce that I've begun working on something of that exact purpose: [[/r/FanFictionOrphanage]]

It's still a bit of a framework right now, but feel free to hop on over and start posting stories that deserve a second chance!

Also: I'm looking for other's who are passionate about this idea as well, to help form a mod team to keep this idea going and make sure we do it in a way that respects authors and readers alike. If you're interested please message me!

EDIT:

I think there's been some confusion over the language I've used in the comments. I don't mean at any point should someone who adopts an abandoned fic try to pass the original author's work off as their own. At all times a story attempting to continue from where another story left off (or any point before) should defer to the original work. We do this when we write alternate 4th year stories, this does not change just because the author hasn't written recently or because we are dealing with fanfics.

To put it in the words of [[/u/chyaraskiss]], "By all means do a FanFic of a FanFic. Show the direction you would take it. Make sure to give credit to the Author. But don't steal other people's hard work."

EDIT 2:

Alight, I hear you. I see posts saying that fanfiction of fanfiction is okay, I see posts claiming it's plagiarism, I see posts claiming both at the same time. This is not the hill I want to die on, and it is not the one I want what I hoped would be a useful tool for people who want to take up abandoned stories to die on. I'll change the rules.


** I'm really hoping that a subreddit rule will be "With author's permission only."

Edit: For those of you endorsing continuing a story without an author's permission, here's an actual example of it happening:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/949287/Project-Dark-Overlord]]

The original author eventually quit because he got flamed for writing the worse version. The plagiarist stuck an "inspired by Project Dark Overlord" and changed the first few chapters after her fic had already taken off. No permission was ever granted.

Edit 2: Oh and for those saying that the sub would just be for fanfics of fanfics, and not actual continuations, then why is the sub only for abandoned fanfics?

**** It's for that exact reason that I'm pretty sure that this project will be dead on arrival. Any fanfic author worth their salt, who is going to put a lot of their time and effort into a story, will want to put that effort into their /own/ story ideas.

The only authors who are going to want to write continuations of other people's stories are the ones who aren't up to the task - meaning their plans will never get off the ground, or if they /do/ get off the ground, the quality will be too low to be considered a true continuation.

It's very, very rare that you find a plagiarist who has the ability to write their own story but for some reason chooses to take someone else's.

I've had 10+ people message me, over the years, asking permission to continue Lords of Magic. Although I am uncomfortable with the idea of other people taking that story and running with it - I still have plans for it, one day - I have always granted permission on the assumption that it will never go anywhere. And guess what? To this day I've not seen a single posted chapter from someone continuing it.

*** Hi there!

So with regards to author's permission - if the author is still active or at all reachable, absolutely.

My personal hangup comes with situations where the author is either unreachable (for whatever reason that may be) or where you simply receive no response. Should the stories of an author who has been inactive for 10 years and who does not respond to any communication attempts be left unfinished? If ten years with no communication is enough to consider a story defacto abandoned, what about 5, 1, six months?

I think it would be a disservice to fans of a story to prevent them from asking that someone give them resolution, but I also want to make sure the subreddit is as respectful to the author as possible.

Right now the conditions for a story to be considered defacto abandoned (abandoned without explicit permission) are as follows:

1. The story has to have gone at least 1 year without any updates or new content.

2. The author has to have been inactive on all reachable platforms for at least 6 months.

3. The poster has to have attempted to contact the author, and given them reasonable time to respond.

I understand that is still at its core based on my personal view that stories even can be abandoned without explicitly saying so, and as such is still up for much debate. I don't intend to pass my views off as law here, so if the majority of users want only fics with explicit permission on the sub, so shall it be.

Most fanfic communities would say yes, you can explore what future extensions of works could look like.

****** You folks keep not understanding the point. There is a huge difference between a TV show or a book series and a fanfiction author.

Here it is again, in simple words: when you write fanfic of a TV show, everone knows that yours is not the canon version of that story. Everyone knows it's fanfic of another work.

When you write fanfic of a fanfic, people may not know or care that there was originally another story which you've appropriated into your own.

Imagine an example when FA (Fanfic Author) #1 writes a fic, but doesn't complete it. FA #2 takes that unfinished story, writes a continuation and presents it as the authoritative version of this particular assembly of tropes&ideas.

Fic #2 gets hugely popular. Now imagine yourself being FA #1, whose OG story might be found and accused of copying the story that wouldn't exist without yours.

This has happened, it's not just speculation.

You can't hijack JKR because she's JKR. It is possible for you to hijack another fanfic author.

I understand the frustration. Prince of the Dark Kingdom will most likely never be finished. But I am not interested in reading the ending to it written by anyone other than Mizuni-sama. All it takes is a douchebag with a bit of luck to try and present a story they didn't originaly come up with as their own.

Stop equating a fanfic as a source of fanfic to a TV show/book series as a source of fanfic. They're not on the same level. Apples and oranges.

I don't understand why this is hard to understand.

Anyone can already try to pass of others stories as their own. By your own admission this has already happened. This is NOT what we are trying to do here.

When you read a new series do you start with book 2? Because that's what you expect people to do apparently. I've said it before, no one will copy the original work and repost it as their own. We point to it, we promote it. We say, here, this is a good story you need to read. And if the original author eventually finishes it? Great. They will get the recognition. And if they don't? Well here are two or three of our authors own version of how things could have gone.

And I find it funny how everyone who opposes the idea of the sub mentions that x or y story won't be the same or worth reading if the original author doesn't write the end. Yet you also assume no other reader will be able to tell the difference in how one author writes vs the story he is basing his fanfic off of.

A few points here:

It's hardly a resolution when it's a different author.

*Someone who copies another author's work without permission would not be someone who could create a satisfying resolution. By copying without permission, after all, they confess their own inability to come up with creative divergences from canon.*

It's not respectful to steal without permission.

As [[/u/SerCoat]] so eloquently notes, process your disappointment like an adult and avoid plagiarizing.

Where do we draw the line? If the fact that we don't rewrite word for word canon up until that point is good enough for fanfiction, then surely it would be good enough for what is essentially fanfiction about uncompleted fanfics.

******* Hi, I think I see the confussion, and its more over my use of the word 'copy' than anything else.

I'm not suggesting that, when you continue an abandoned story, you try to pass off the original text as your own. I'm not suggesting we do not credit the original authors. I'm not suggesting we do anything in any manner to attempt to say our 'continuation' of a story is more valuable than that an original author may in the future write.

I use copy in the same sense that we copy characters and places from the original HP books. Not in a word for word replication, but in that we take a snapshot of the world at some point, and then change it.

And as far as permission goes? HP is unique in that JK has apparently given blanket approval for fanfic. But most other fanfiction does not have that benefit. While I think we should be held to a higher standard internally in our community, I also think that unless an author has explicitly forbidden fanfic of their work, then we shouldn't expect more than a reasonable attempt to ask them for permission.

*The authors did not give permission. If someone does not reply, you do not assume that they have given permission. If I ask my neighbor via email if I can borrow their house while they've been gone for a long time, and they don't respond, I do not go live in their house because "a reasonable amount of time has passed". Many authors have already noted that they would consider it plagiarism without permission.*

*By nature of the medium, continuing an author's story without permission devalues their authority over their ideas and world. As Taure also noted on the original original post, the medium has inherent competition within it and the relationship between fic authors are very different.*

*Calling it a continuation carries the same associations. You should not "finish it."*

I don't mean that people should copy the original 'abandoned' fic and try to pass it as their own. And I don't mean that they should claim their version as any sort of 'true' or 'superior' ending to any the original author could, or may in the future write.

I think what you refer to as a divergence from the original fanfic or story, I was just using the term 'finishing' for, in the sense that, like someone who writes a fanfic 'book 7', they are 'finishing' the story. Bringing the story arcs that were introduced in the previous 6 to a conclusion in a diverging way from the original, and ideally introducing new arcs, ideas and themes.

Just to be clear, I don't think, outside of explicit original author blessing, anyone should be reposting the original body of work, or in any way implying they are anything more than a spiritual successor in the same way all fanfiction is derived from another author's words.

****** I'm on a fanfiction subreddit, I have no issues with fanfic.

If you copy/paste a significant amount of the actual Harry Potter books before your point of divergence and only change a little bit, you're a plagiarist and most sites will take that shit down. If you just say 'look, this is canon up to Chapter 5 of GOF' that's different.

But there's a /massive/ difference between writing fanfic of a world-famous book series on sites and in forums where /everybody knows/ its fanfic and stealing someone else's fanfic in order to continue it.

Someone could come into Harry Potter fanfic not knowing for example (since they were mentioned in the original thread) who the original authors of Core Threads or Prince of the Dark Kingdom were but they're very unlikely to come into Harry Potter fanfic not knowing who wrote Harry Potter.

If that person were then to come across a re-post/continuation of those two fics, they might have no idea who the original author was.

Since reviews/kudos/likes/favourites/whatever are the only currency a fic writer receives, using someone else's work to get yours is akin to me republishing the first four Harry Potter books and making money off it instead of being sued into the ground.

**** My main response to this would be that the way you want to do it could possibly lead to a lot of authorial resentment. Six months inactivity is way too short a time, for example, and you could definitely do with adding in something about not harassing authors for responses because I can very much picture two-thousand emotional readers inbox-bombing an author who's just taken a six month temporary job contract and not had the time to write for that period and so on.

People have literally deleted their entire profiles and all their fics in response to things like this and if someone is going through a big life change that's not letting them write for a year or so, then having their fics be copied and 'taken over' by other people could be a little disheartening or angering to some people. '

As much of a good idea I think this adoption thing is, you have to be careful and do it in a way that doesn't scare off authors or cause too much distress.

People also have a problem with this. It's not just the copying of text that people have a problem with, it's the concept of completing someone else's story idea.

To help you understand why people object, consider the following analogies:

*Analogy 1: Using Someone Else's Incomplete Draft*

Imagine that during 2006, JK Rowling's incomplete draft of Deathly Hallows was leaked to the internet, prior to its publication in 2007.

Imagine you then wrote a story based off completing the story of the Deathly Hallows as it had been leaked, and that you put your version on the bookshelves for sale before JKR did.

Is this okay, in your view? Forget the fact that legally it would break copyright. Is it ethical to take someone's incomplete story, then write an alternative version of it, beat the author to market and publish something which competes with the original author's story?

I would propose that all decent, honest people would say "no". That story is JK Rowling's to tell.

Does it become OK if a few years pass and JKR still hasn't published? Again I would say "no" - impatience does not entitle you to something that isn't yours. You're still beating the original author to market, meaning that you're supplanting their right to tell their story they way they wanted it to be told.

Even if you don't copy JKR's text and just pick up where the incomplete draft left off, even if you clearly say that the original story idea was JK Rowling's, your version is still on the shelves, competing with JKR's as-yet-unpublished version.

This is basically what a WIP fanfiction is. Authors are inviting readers into their creative process, allowing them to see a story as it is in the process of being written. In return they get feedback which hopefully improves the story. What readers are reading is an incomplete draft. If another person takes that incomplete draft and continues it, even if they do so with credit, what they have done is create a story which exists in competition with the original, beating the original author to market.

The difference between (i) writing a fanfic of a fanfic and (ii) completing someone else's story is the difference between (i) writing a post-DH story and (ii) completing JKR's unfinished DH draft and beating her to market.

*Analogy 2: Building a House*

Imagine you come across someone in the process of building a house. You think the house is beautiful and can't wait to see it finished.

But construction stalls after the ground floor and you come to realise it may never be complete.

Can you go onto their land and pick up where they left off? Obviously not. It's their house. It being incomplete doesn't mean you can help yourself to it.

What you /can/ do is go back to your own land and start building your own house, /from scratch/, with an architectural style and layout inspired by the incomplete house you loved. But you're still going to have to dig your own foundations and ground floor.

**** Re: analogy 1

Exploratory fanfic is already a thing. After book 6 came out, tons of people posted what they thought book 7 would be like.

Were not saying authors have to hand over whatever they've written but not published. We write our story based only on what the author has already published, the same as any of the fanfic year 7s did.

By your reasoning no one is ever allowed to write fanfiction about the next generation of hp kids, because Rowling might eventually write another book about them.

Re: analogy 2.

This analogy falls through a bit because it assumes were trying to live in the ithers house in the first place (steal their role as authorarive author).

Whereas in fanfic, we can clearly point to the original story/frame and say: this, this is a beautiful house frame. And then we show the construction crew the mockup pictures showing what we imagine the house could look like when finished, and oh how beautiful it could be. And we wish the original builder would finish it because we'd love to see their style more.

But we don't actually copy the frame, because we don't need to. Were painting a picture of the house, to show how pretty it could be finished, not trying to complete it and move in for ourselves.

**** But people /did/ write fic of the original HP books as they were coming out, continuing the story where the originals left off, especially between OOTP and HBP. It'd be shitty if you set up a patreon or otherwise tried to profit off it, but this is /fanfic/ not publishing actual books. People use each other's ideas all the time, that's how tropes are born.

If the fanfic writers currency is likes and views, I don't think you're going to deprive them of that by writing a spin off. I know if some of the abandoned fics I love got a spin off, and then the writer came back to finish it, I would absolutely still read it. Especially if it's published on Reddit instead of fanfic.net or something, it really wouldn't take away from anything. I imagine this is a /very/ common sentiment.

I'll give you another analogy: Brandon Sanderson finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, or Christopher Tolkien organizing JRR's notes into later books in the LotR universe. If someone's been dark for five, ten years, they've basically died to the fandom, for all intents and purposes. Then, unless the author explicitly prohibits it, like GRRM has, I think it's not unreasonable to write another version of what the end of the story could look like. If someone finished my fic after I'd abandoned it, I would be fine with it. We're writing for the joy of others, so as long as that happens, I think it's in the spirit of the fandom.

You've missed the point of the analogy, I think.

The point is to show the difference between the JKR-FFauthor relationship to the FFauthor-FFauthor relationship.

When an FFauthor writes a continuation of another FFauthor's fic, the two fics exist side by side as competing versions of that story.

The equivalent in the JKR-FFauthor relationship (that is, the action which results in the two works being on the same level and competing with each other) would be for the FFauthor to take JKR's incomplete draft, finish it, /then put it on bookshelves for sale/ before JKR has published DH.

That is, I would suggest, universally accepted as unethical, even if it were legal. It would remain unethical even if JKR hadn't made any progress in her draft in 10 years. Therefore I am not saying that fanfic of fanfic should be treated differently to fanfic of the original. I am in fact saying that the two should be treated exactly the same - you just have to correctly identify the equivalent action.

My assumption was that a reader would have to go to the original fic, read it, and then read the continuation. Obviously copy-pasting someone else's work directly into your fanfic is stealing it!

Honestly though, while I think 1 year is too short to assume a fic abandoned even if the author never responded to you, if a fic was last updated in the early 2000s why is it such a huge issue for someone to pick up where the author left off (again, while not posting a copy of the original fic).

And if a fic is orphaned, then it's definitely been abandoned. Again, I don't think anyone with half a brain feels like people should be allowed to claim these works as their own or repost them. This is just about writing an ending for them.

** Yeah people are way overthinking this, and getting defensive over people doing to them the exact same thing they're doing to Wildbow.

I mean really, claiming that Fanfics compete with each other but not with the original work? That is complete bollocks. Do you know how many posts or comments or fics I read every week that involve some variation of ‘I've never read Worm in full because I like the fanfic better?' It's a hell of a lot, lemme tell you. That's fanfic competing with Worm, right there.

Also, the idea that readers /won't/ pick up variations on the same ideas? Sorry, that's laughable. Do you know how many continuations, sequels, and spinoffs of Deputy there are? Quite a number, and it's never been an issue for the community before.

For that matter, a continuation isn't unlike an omake, and plenty of fics out there have nearly as many words of omakes, if not moreso, than the original fic does. Look at Taylor Varga and Mauling Snarks omakes --- bith stories have several different spinoffs that essentially a branch-off at a certain point. I love all of them, and the originals both.

It's just silly. It's not like any of us ask Wildbow for permission. Or ask for permission when we start something based on someone else's altpower idea. I don't see people complaining, for instance, a out other authors stealing Wiki Warrior's randomization idea, and there's a good half dozen or more different stories based on it. Nobody minds.

Yes, you should probably at least /ask/ for permission if you can. That's just being polite. And if the original fic writer asks you to take down something you already started, you should probably do it. Again, that's just being respectful. But sometimes you can't /get/ permission, because the author is long gone from where the fic was posted, maybe banned or even /dead/ in some tragic cases. Or maybe it's one of those fics with no updates or activity from the author for 4 years, and they aren't respond to PMs or comments... yeah /those/ fics should be as fair game as Worm itself is.

In all cases, obviously you should give credit to the original authors, of course. Unless its somehow implied (like, I'd consider the ‘Harry Potter' section of FFN to kind of have credit to JKR implied by nature). And don't just repost old chapters, either --- you should link back to the original post, because then likes and other metrics that get tracked will go on the /correct/ author's profile. They wrote it after all, you stealing their likes and whatnot on stuff you had nothing to do with is asshole behavior for sure.

But other than that? Go for it. I've long thought the Worm community ought to put something like this together. There's a lot of fics with great ideas out there that started off with great ideas and good opening chapters, but then got dropped before really going anywhere.

** As a fanfic writer who has both complete and incomplete works published, and a general desire to maybe finish the incomplete ones at /some/ point, I honestly don't see the issue with "finishing" an incomplete fic, with or without authorial permission as long as they give credit. This being because, unless you solely restrict your fanfiction reading and writing to ones where the author has given explicit permission, it really just makes you doing like a massive hypocrite.

Fanfiction is built upon years of directly disrespecting author's wishes and encouraging freedom of writing and creative adaptation of existing works. In some ways, modern fanfic is /founded/ on that principle. Saying "oh, you can write all the fanfic you want of original works is morally and ethically okay, but writing fanfic of fanfic is an abhorant practice" goes against everything fanfic culture stands for.

It's not like the internet has a limited amount of space, in practice. If I put out an unfinished work, and someone else decides to finish it without asking, but does give credit, then anyone who cares enough to read the unfinished version can do that. I'm not getting "stolen from." I can always go back and finish the work myself, and anybody who wants to read it can.

*** There *is* a clear and principled difference between writing a fanfic of an original work and a continuation of someone else's fic.

JKR's works are on the shelf in the bookstore. When you write a post-OotP fic, it's not appearing on the shelf next to HBP as an equally legitimate version of Harry Potter's 6th year. Fanfiction is not in competition with the original work - everyone knows that JKR is the true author of HP and that all fanfics are derivative from her.

When you write a continuation of someone else's fic, on the other hand, it is sitting on the same shelf as the original. The two stand side-by-side and compete for readers. And because they're /both/ derivative works, the first fanfic author does not benefit from the same protection/status that JKR has as the recognised authority as to that story. If the second fanfic is more popular, that author will become the authority as to that story.

This is why the fanfiction community has developed the common standard of always requiring permission to continue someone else's story.

****** All due respect, but I don't really see how that is in any way an issue. For starters, a fic being the "true" version is such an abstract concept and has barely any relevance. If it means the original, well that wouldn't be an issue if, as I said, the original was credited. If it means the better fic, well that would be a matter of opinion, and on the writer to prove their worth.

The fic should earn it's value as a worthwhile fic, not have it automatically delivered because it was there first. If anything it is an insult to the original, to assume it could not survive "competition." I could release a continuation of one of your works here and now and I doubt it would even begin to reach your level of popularity, because your quality of writing is far superior. I stand no threat to you. Besides, in the unlikely event that someone happened to like my version more and not yours, it's not like my version not existing would change their opinion.

Readers aren't a finite resource that can only be used once. I can't count the number of times I've read basically the exact same plot with the exact same ship in 4 different fics, because I valued the individual differences in their adaptations. Some continuation of your fic existing doesn't mean that yours will be left and forgotten. If anything, in my experience, it would get /more/ traffic. Personally, any time I see that a fic I liked was inspired by or a continuation of another, I automatically read the inspiration.

I guess what I'm saying is the the existsnce of a "third party" fic does not diminish the value or worth of the original, and in fact may very well increase it.

A fanfic writer came along and took a snipping of the tree - he grew it in his own garden, with his own fertilizer, making it his own tree but inherently with elements of the original.

Now I'm suggesting that we take our own snipping from the fanfic writer, because we too have our own methods of caring for apple trees, that we believe will produce a crisper apple - the original author liked them more for pies you see, the first fanfic author for jam, and we to eat whole.

We took from the fanfic author's tree because we liked their color more than the first author's, and because their tree was dieing. Now they may come back later to tend their tree once again, and I'm sure it'll produce nice jam everyone will enjoy. I will even encourage anyone who likes our apples to try their jam. But we would like a crisp apple for lunch tomorrow, so I suggest we grow our own.
