Does anybody know of a long (100,000+) fic where Lily married Snape rather than James, and had Harry. If possible I would love to have it cover Harry growing up and then going to hogwarts fully prepared because of his father/mother's loving relationship.


** Lily reproducing with Snape? It's as bad am idea as Hermione reproducing with Ronald

** How does that work? They would have a different child... even if they named it Harry?!

*** I feel the same way about 'Harry is born as a space marine in 40k' fics (as an example, any significant change to the backstory would work)...how is that actually /Harry/?
