Hey guys.\\
I'm looking for fics where Harry is paired with girls that have personalities that we don't see too much.\\
Exemples: Tsudere, Yandere and the other deres, Tomboy (A girl that does't act feminine).\\
Or even a distant and cold girl, i've readed a fic with Harry x FemTom Riddle, and Tom's personality was cold and irritable, in the begginig she acted very hostile with Harry and does't show emotion, but even so the two had their moments because Harry knew how to interact with her coldness and agressive demeanor.\\
Even completly insane girls are worthy, i just want to see a very unusual personality in the girl.\\
OCs are ok, does't need to be a canon character.

-More than 20 chapters pls (Need something to distract myself)\\
-No Harem/multi (Really don't like)\\
-No slash (Obvious)\\
-No Dumbledore bashing.

  Tsudere, Yandere and the other deres,

I've no idea what any of this means, but here are a few. They are not very long, but it is what it is. The third one is longer, but I'm not sure just how "unusual" different people would consider Abby. It is an excellently written fic, nonetheless.

***** That is where the terms come from, but they are pretty good categories for secondary characters everywhere.

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr
