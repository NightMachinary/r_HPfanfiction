Hello, Could someone please recommend me some good WBWL/WGWL (wrong boy/ girl who lived) fanfictions where Harry doesn't forgive his parents? I've read quite a few fanfics with this idea but in most of them he ends up forgiving them for neglecting him for like ten years and I'm supposed to accept that? I've tried looking for those where he doesn't forgive and maybe goes dark but they are quite hard to find so I'm asking for your guidance fellow Reddit users :). Also if he ends up being really cool and powerful then that's a plus too. Let him show them what they missed out on ;). Thanks in advance.


** Harry Potter and the Prince Of Slytherin is 100% the best one out there. It's being updated too!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
