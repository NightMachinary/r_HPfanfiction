** I can't see Dumbledore assigning this, but I can see Sirius doing this of his own initiative. Mrs Figg is under strict orders to keep all wizards away, but this handsome young muggle named Merry White is a fine addition to the neighborhood.

** To quote my comment on this post: "I think he should have put a wig and fake glasses on and pretended to be Arabella Figg's nephew who went to live with her to keep her company/help her with the cats after she broke her leg or because he lost his job. If she happened to tell someone in the past that she didnt have relatives, he could have been introduced as her scandalous new toy-boy."

Can be serious, comedy or crack or whatever you want.

If something similar already exists, even better, please could you link it to me? Thank you
