Every time I watch the movies I get hundreds of ideas for things I wish happened differently. Just finished DH pt 2, and I'd like to see some more Aberforth. Be it that he raises Harry in an AU, or he becomes more active after his brother dies. Also, any Grindelwald stories or Snape/Dumbledore actually tell Harry that Snape is still a good guy would be welcome.


** I love the idea of Abe raising Harry. Gruff bar tender making a caring mentor.

** He's a major character in my AU story "Patron", although he doesn't appear until chapter 16.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** It's a Grindelwald story and Aberforth does feature a fair bit.

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Abeforth is a headmaster here. Canon-ish yet original take on magic. On long hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140][Phoenix Corrupted]] - Those chapters I've read so war (around 1.75 of the year) were pretty average, but it's readable regardless. Abeforth is a DADA teacher in this. Ongoing, often updated.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Albus and Gellert, two bright young wizards, would meet in the summer of 1899 and develop a strong friendship, but would part ways following the death of Albus' sister, Ariana. But what if Ariana survived this encounter? What would it mean for a boy named Harry Potter and the events that would unfold almost a century later? (Currently on Year 3)
