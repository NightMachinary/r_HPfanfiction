** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/][Innocent]] is great with a sequel and a third in progress. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/][The Wise One Trilogy]] is good and complete. Both Sirius raises harry fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/][Promises Unbroken]] is a what if James and Lily lived to continue fighting LV. Three parts and complete.

Edit: I also just remembered [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/][You want to make a memory]] a pretty much canon compliant complete James and Lily from beginning to end fic. Get your tissues ready.....
