There's this one story in ff that I can't seem to find anymore no matter the filters I try to remember...

Darth Vader happens upon hog warts and becomes the defense teacher I think? Then he mentors Harry in the force, sorry about the lack of details but that was my main problem too lol

Also a little off topic but I'm also looking for a fic where Harry is sent to durmstrang and befriends a girl who's last name I'm sure was Rosier (an oc I believe)

I've been trying for weeks, I'd appreciate the help! Thanks

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
