I'm looking for fics where the main character basically isn't a good guy

Can be dark harry or dark other character, I'm not really bothered. Slash is...iffy, but as long as it's not porn, I'm alright with it. Basically stuff like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12456653/1/The-Subjugator][this]]


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Demonologist): I wouldn't say she is /bad/ per say, but she is definitely dark. Hell, she learns from Voldemort.

Linkffn(Too Young To Die): Harry will do anything to get his sister back. Anything. No regrets either.

Linkffn(Paid in Blood): this one is hard to call, but Harry was no good guy.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): this is the most crazy!Harry I can remember without being crack, he is terrifying a lot of the time.

Linkffn(Broken Chains; The Stars Alone): Harry, Luna and Hermione are on a universal rampage.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** linkffn(12021325) is the best of the following. Ignore the cringe summary, this has done some truly incredible things. Harry is still Harry even though some of the things he does are not good. But he struggles with them, in a very well done way.

linkffn(10267302) has a pretty great first half, although once the politics stuff starts towards the second half it goes off the rails.

linkffn(7359933) is alright. It struggles in some aspects but I love the ending and find it rather fitting.

linkffn(9057950) is a classic. A lot of people will hate on this fic, and deservedly so but it does such a good job of making Harry truly ruthless. Rather well done and a fic I always go back to.

None of these are slash.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
