I read this fanfic sometime ago in fanfiction.net. But I can't seem to find it. The story goes like this;

- Abusive Durslys hurt Harry and Voldermorts horcrux communicates with Harry
- The Horcrux befriends Harry and manipulates him, making him leave the Durslys and take refuge in Diagon Ally.
- Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, befriends Draco
- The Malfoys visits Harry and turns the Durslys into toads.
- The Voldermort horcrux manipulates Harry into absorbing the diary horcrux
- Ultimately Dumbledore kills Harry, but it's the original horcrux that gets destroyed.

I'd be grateful if you can find the name of the fanfic. Thanks

** I'm pretty sure it was popular. It was well written as well. There were basically two horcruxes(?) living in Harry's mind at one point, arguing with each other. The story ends with Hogwarts first year, where Dumbledore kills Harry, but Harry regains consciousness and runs away. He still had the diary horcrux in him, which was more friendlier and saner.
