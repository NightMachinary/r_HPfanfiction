In your opinion which one do you dislike more when you're reading fanfiction- an overused/uncreative (or plain weird) plot or characters who are OOC? Edit: formatting


** OOC is forgivable if the plot is great, or if the changes to the character improve them.

Bad plot is always bad no matter how you look at it.

** Unorthodox characterizations can be great if they do something genuinely novel and interesting with the character. But a weak or derivative plot just sucks, no matter how true to canon the characters are.

** If Harry is raised by a Pandaren brewmaster on Azeroth, we can forgive him his uncharacteristic love of beer. As long as the story is interesting, I am willing to give it a try.

*** Exactly! Years ago I turned to fanfiction while waiting between book publications, and I craved only fiction that was written in the style of the books, and gave me cannon-based possible scenarios, like conjecture on the way the next book might go, or "missing scenes" that fit seamlessly in with cannon. Maybe it was because I was trying to keep a complicated plot straight in my mind while I awaited the next book.

But now, I am up for just about anything. I don't mind huge deviations from cannon at any point with characters who have sudden epiphanies that change their characters or discover dormant super powers, as long as it's well written and makes sense within the story I'm reading.

So bring on Snape-as-gentle-gardener, Brilliantly Scheming Luna, Mastermind Harry, or Evil Straight Dumbledore, just write it well enough to make me believe.

And, honestly, I don't mind retreaded plots either, same reason I can eat pizza every Friday. As long as it's well-written, I don't mind a little comfort-reading. This is all in fun.

But a perfect characterization and flawless original plot lines can't save bad writing for me.

***** aaargh, drawing a blank, and there are some out there. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle_in_the_Jungle_A_Harry_Potter_Adventure][Here is one]] just as a consolation prize, that I just read with Luna breaking character in a believable way, though I don't feel she reached her potential here. It was a wonderful concept, but she wasn't developed enough to really satisfy, though lots of other good stuff in the story and it's sequel. Sorry I can't deliver scheming!

** Uncreative plot. HP fandom's the only fandom where I read fics like original fic. Give me anything, as long as it's interesting.

** Bland plotlines leave me steaming. 'OMG Dumbledore/Ron/Hermione/whoever is totes a basturd' followed by 'Harry be angry lol' and 'thx goblin doodz' inflicts physical pain on my brain. It has so much potential as a plot, too; if we could see the betrayal happening before it becomes obvious, if the theft/murder/deception/whatever is subtly implemented rather than the in-your-face stuff, if the reaons behind them /made sense/, then it would make a great story.

Alas, none of the fics I've come across so far do this. The only one that actually works is 'partially kissed hero', but that's more to do with the beyond-the-impossible WTF factor than anything plot-related. Dumbledore's dick dastardly impression in that one is spot on, if only because he secretly /is/ Dick Dastardly.

And even that one fic, when you strip away the originality factor of taking character-bashing to its logical conclusion, is good, but not Oscar-worthy. Neither am I, but hey...

So yeah, bland, overused plotlines done cookie cutter style are about as interesting as soggy toast and twice as unpalatable. If you're going to do something with a plot, at least make it interesting. Like, say, if Harry's going to end up being raised by someone else that's not part of the HP 'verse, make it a 'verse that's either not been explored yet. There, rant over, done.

Third one down (which I'm currently reading) is literally your first sentence. The poison pen one, have you read it? A ton of changes are different from canon, but none of them make any difference at all in anyway until 4th year.

And yet, 3rd highest favourited on all of fanfic.net. Also it says it's humour but I haven't noticed any jokes at all.

** Depends on how OOC they're being. If it's just a subtle or reasonable change, I can forgo it for a good plot. On the other hand, if they're wildly OOC, I can't bear to read long enough to figure out what the plot actually is.

** A bad plot is the worst. I have recently broken into reading fanfictions where there is some OOC and it only works well if the plot is good. You can't really enjoy any novel anywhere with a bad plotline.

*** I personally disagree with the new characters part (mainly because we only know maybe about 1/15th of all the Hogwarts students?), but I agree with the crossover part. There is way too many cross-overs and no way to hide them XP

** A bad plot is far worst than OOC characters. I EXPECT everyone to be someone OOC in most fics, because I like my fics to be somewhat...different...than each other. There is only so much room to work with if everyone has to stay in with character as written by JKR.
