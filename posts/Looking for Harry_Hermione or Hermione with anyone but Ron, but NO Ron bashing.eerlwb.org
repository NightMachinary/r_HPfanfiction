So, for the record I strongly dislike Harry/Hermione, mostly because I see them as brother/sister, the second biggest thing is whenever they end together the Author bashes Ron and pretty much the entire Weasley family.

Same with Hermione being with anyone else but Ron. So yeah, I'm looking for any stories where Hermione is with someone other then Ron, and there's NO Ron and Weasley bashing in general.

Now, he can mope around and be upset, but I want them to make up by the end of it, if not before then. I don't want the author to bash Ron and the Weasley's just because.


** I recently compiled a big list of HHr fic recommendations found [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit][*here*]]. While I only read about this pairing, I despise a lot of tropes/cliches that permeate this fandom (bashing, SuperHHr, ...). So you won't finde any of these there.

** I'm reading a Maurader's Plan. (H/Hr) The shipping is slow burn and in the background and 33 chapters in no one is together, plus Ron is criticized, but so are all the characters including Ron and all the characters actually address their flaws and try to grow so if that's up your alley I'd recommend it.
