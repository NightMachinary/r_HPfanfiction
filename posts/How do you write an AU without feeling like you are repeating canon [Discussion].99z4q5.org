I want to write a Pokemon AU, where Hogwarts is a school for young trainers, but when I write it feels as though I am just substituting canon for AU words and settings.

Is there a way to avoid this, or is it to be expected?


** My favorite advice for something like this is take the divergence to its logical end.

I've read something where a progression went like this: If Ginny dies in the chamber, the Weasleys don't go to Egypt, Pettigrew isn't seen by Sirius, Sirius doesn't escape causing Pettigrew to stay put, causing Voldemort not to return 4th year.

On a larger scale its a bit harder, so I'm not sure what to tell you, other than to read fics similar to what you want to write and take pointers from them.

**** Not necessarily - it's likely there would have been another Tom Riddle out and about had Ginny died. I think Dumbledore says that it's unlikely that Lucius understood what the Diary was and what it would do, and that it's unlikely he did it at the behest of Voldemort

****** (I'm assuming we're talking about Voldemort plan to return)

I'm pretty sure the 'voldemort' that would have returned had Ginny been consumed by the diary would have been entirely independent from the Voldemort hiding in Albania. There would have been a diary Riddle and a spirit voldemort coexisting, so Voldemort wouldn't trouly have returned. Having the diary possess someone wasn't part of Voldemort grand plan, but simply Lucius trying to rid himself of the diary and also bring down the weasleys (I believe Dumbledore says this)

** 1. If it's a Pokemon AU, why not have Harry and Co need to spend a great deal of time on the road catching new pokemon and exploring new places.
2. Get rid of the prophecy entirely and have Voldemort obsessed with Harry because he wants a certain legendary pokemon, but Harry was somehow blessed by that legendary and now Voldemort thinks he has to steal the blessing for himself.
3. Make the Death Eaters some sort of mystical pokemon cult related to your specific legend trying to obtain its powers to give Voldemort a super power (I suggest somehow working in immortality since defeating death is Voldemort's deal).
4. Take things to the logical extreme: Hogwarts doesn't need to be hidden, everyone knows about Pokemon. Dumbledore is basically Professor Oak. There is no magic, only pokemon, so have the substitute for any magic spells.

​

1. Have fun, be creative, and keep your character motivations straight.

*** And if I was doing this....

​

Voldemort was once a respected young Pokemon researcher, mentoring under the wise Professor Dumbledore. However, tragedy struck, and Voldemort lost someone dear to him to death. Voldemort became obsessed with defeating death, and researched ghost pokemon extensively. However, he was unable to find a way to bring either pokemon or people back to life, despite developing odd psychic powers. This disturbed Dumbledore, but he sympathised with his young student. Along the way, Voldemort learned of the legend of Ho-oh, and how it had brought three pokemon back to life...

​

One day, Harry Potter and his family were caught up in a horrific fire in their home. Harry's parents were killed along with their pokemon. Harry's burned body lay atop a pile of ashes, dead. However, a miraculous pokemon descended from the heavens: Ho-oh. It brought Harry back to life, marking him with a special scar. As it departed, Voldemort emerged. He had started to fire to lure Ho-oh out, and had captured and corrupted the three legendary dogs. He attacked Ho-oh, and nearly captured it. Just he was ready to claim the legendary pokemon, Dumbledore and the elite four arrive. Now, however, they were the elite three: Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin. Harry's father had been the fourth elite four member. They drove off Voldemort and his death eaters.

Harry grows up marked by Voldemort as his foe (I would ditch the Dursley's angle frankly. I might have him raised by Sirius, or by someone else. Either way, don't give him an abusive childhood unless it's needed which I don't think it is). People view Harry as having a great and terrible destiny, but Harry really wishes he was a normal kid. Still, he's determined to stop Voldemort one day and restore his parents honor. Feelings on Ho-oh are complicated. On one had, Harry was saved, but on the other, his parents were not. He's torn between resentment and gratitude.

​

Harry ends up at Hogwarts. Here, there are three houses, because fuck Slytherin, it's just the evil houses. I'd pick a legendary trio (probably the birds or dogs) and make them the house themes. To Harry's distress, he ends up in Voldemort's house. His starter should be themed around whatever house you place him in, so a fire, ice, or electric, or type. I'd go with electric personally since Zapados is a BAMF but you don't have to. Don't give him anything too OP to start off with. Also: not a pikachu. I'm hella partial to Mareep personally but that's just me. For the friends starters make it fit their personality. Harry meets up with some friends (one from each other house) and they go on an epic adventure. My advice? Ron and Hermione are his traveling companions and Draco is his rival if you want to be boring, but you could totally make some cool choices like have Lavender and Dean or whatever traveling with him.

​

Also, they are 11. No romance.

​

Alternate between classes at Hogwarts and field time. Harry slowly uncovers mysteries about Ho-oh and Lugia. He earns gym badges, and catches neat pokemon. However, he also has run ins with Death Eaters. The first few times, Sirius and Remus have to pull his bacon out of the fire, or a gym leader (read: Hogwarts Professor) does. Eventually he becomes TEH VERAH BEsT LIEK NO WHUN EVA WUZ and proves his strength. But OH NO VOLDEMORT HAS HO OH AND THE LEGENDARY DOGS NOW OH SHIT. But thankfully Harry becomes BFFs with Lugia and one of the Legendary birds (his friends get the other two birds). They have an epic show down and VOLDEMORT IS DEFEATED YAAAAAY.

The end.

** 1. Figure out how the AU differences would affect the plot - if magic works differently, then some plans will need to work differently as well. Maybe the GoF plot needs to be overhauled to account for runecasting or something.

2. Feel free to skip or gloss over sections that would be the same as canon anyways. If Harry meets Ron on the train to Hogwarts and they become best mates, you can reduce that to a single sentence. You can skip later train rides if no plot points occur, or gloss over the World Cup if Harry doesn't go or it doesn't get attacked. You don't need to worldbuild stuff that was in the books already.

** Take a closer look at the Stations. What is happening, why is it happening, and how else can the villain get what they want without repeating each event blow by blow? People say "extrapolate a diverging event to its natural conclusion" or some such, but thinking from small to big is a lot harder than going from big to small. So If you don't want the Triwizard tournament to happen, find out why it was happening in the first place and see if you can take it in a different direction. I imagine the idea for the tournament was because Fudge wanted a PR stunt. So you can diverge from there and figure out some other far reaching stunt, or you can maybe make the schools disagree on where it's held, or maybe the Goblet is just straight up broken so they have to make a new one that acts differently. This means you still get yearly events, but you can point it in a different direction more easily.

*** If I may digress, my take on why the Triwizard Tournament happened is mostly that Karkaroff had finally found the Goblet of Fire (which had been long-lost) and wanted to restart it because death tournaments are his jam, natch. Dumbledore and Maxime didn't want to go along with it, but eventually Fudge hears of it and decides holding ir in Britain is the perfect way to divert the worldwide public's attention from Britain's failure to catch Sirius Black.

(Hence, in my story, Karkaroff being killed earlier means no Tournament in Fourth Year... but possibly one in /Fifth/ Year because Karkaroff willed the Goblet to Dumbledore and demanded he organize it as his last request. So Dumbledore is allowed to take more time to make it safer, but he /has/ to do it eventually for reasons of honor. Fudge isn't particularly insistent because, with Sirius believed dead and no Voldemort in sight, things are actually going pretty great for Britain.)

** My normal way is to work out what would have happened without interference from the main cast and work from there. But I suppose that works mostly for canon divergences, rather than straight up AUs.

** Ask yourself if the change would affect the stations of canon. For example, I'm writing a 6th-year divergence where Tonks helps Harry to deal with Sirius death and teaches him Occlumency. That doesn't really affect anything else at that point, so the rest of the year happens just as it did (which is one of the reasons why I began the story just before Slughorn's Christmas party).

*** The problem with that is that it works for single-point-of-departures better than it does for what OP is describing. If the world is different from the get-go (Hogwarts trains Pokemon-masters) /and/ the plot diverges quickly, what's left of /Harry Potter/ anymore?
