I know I'm a decade late to the party but I just finished watching *A Very Potter Musical* on YouTube. The relationship between Quirrel and Voldemort in it made me laugh but also warmed my heart.

So now, I hope you could recommend stories that explore the relationship between Quirrel and Voldemort. They don't necessarily have to be comedies.
