:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic, where the scenes I remember takes place during a (alternative first?) task of the TriWizard tournament - but it may have started earlier, and continues past. It features a super/powerfull HP, and probably a grey or dark HP. Dumbledore is at least manipulative, possible evil. Anyway, here goes:

Fearing HP is turning dark and wanting to test/expose him, Dumbledore borrows a stone arch/column with lots of runes from MoM/Dep.Secrets. This will force the champions to "face themselves". Not sure if this is an additional task or a replacement, but it's done in the dragon-pit.

Fleur faces her fully transformed, avian (flying?) veela self; who berates her for living like a human and not embracing her veela self. Veela-Fleur then attack the spectators, and Fleur must defend them and fight the veela. Fleur eventually wins.

Harry faces an older version (about +10 years) of himself that is covered with runes-tattoos and very powerfull. FutureHarry is also pretty dark and cares little for others. It's possible FutureHarry reviles that he got the idea for the runes from the task and the column/arch (in his past). They start duelling and pretty much turns the dragon-pit into a sea of lava. Harry wins when he destroys the column/arch.

Some time (week?) afterwards Harry talk to a friend (Hermione?), and show where he's tattooed a rune identical to one of his future self. Harry assure he only intend to have this one, and that it's for a good reason (power, protection, ...).

That's as far as I got.

Probably read for 6-12 months ago, probably on AO3, probably a WIP.


** Was it Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight?

I know the story you're talking about, I read it on FF though. The future Harry/construct thing talks about using the rune tattoos to anchor his soul to his body, making him immune to the terrible shit? He ranted about Hermione being the last of his friends that stayed with him, but then even she had to go or something? And the construct wanted to use the runes to take over Harry and switch places?

I can't say for sure if it's Rune Stone Path

*** Yes it was, that's the one. Thank you so much! I remembered the start of RSP up to Harry's 2nd year or so (eg. fighting troll with rune-stones), and thus totally discarded it as a possibility for the column.

** That's definitely linkao3(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path). Pillar is the second to last event in the TWT iirc.

Entire story was finished when I read it.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.
