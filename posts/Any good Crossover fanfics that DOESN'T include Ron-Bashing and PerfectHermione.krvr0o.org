The title says it all. are there any good HP-crossover fanfics without any Ron-bashing (includes throwing Ron under the bus while Hermione follows Harry like a dog or vice-versa) and without having the cliche fanon Perfect in everything Hermione?


** Anything more specific? I feel most crossovers are just super powerful Harry rolling up to a new Universe...

*** Well, "super powerful Harry rolling up to a new Universe" definitely does not fall into the good fanfic category

But any type of crossover is fair-game, no matter if they are from different universes or from the same universe.

But as long as they make sense that is. Cause I hate how when Harry is for some reason in another planet or universe Hogwarts always finds a way to drag him back. Or in the same-universe case, their world mixes awkwardly, like how something that is supposed to be personal information about the main character of the other setting is common knowledge among wizards.

** I cannot recommand enough the excellent [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] linkffn(8096183)

It's a DnD crossover where a Player Character named Milo end up in HP universe, but he, and only he, is a wizard whose life is ruled by the rules of the game. So hit points, limited spell slots, fixed spell list, and the like.

it's very well written, fun and serious and good at both.

Even better Ron, Hermione and Harry are written like kids, without being annoying as hell so you avoid the weird "children acting like grown adults" effect.

** Try Hard Won Homes by Luna_sss on AO3. It's a Harry Potter x Anita Blake crossover set towards the end of the Anita Blake Blue Moon book. You need to have an account (roughly takes 1 - 2 days max) on AO3 as the author has restricted the story to members.

** Do you like Yu Yu haksusho? Best crossover I ever read with HP is The Best Defense. Prepare for laughter as well.

In the wake of Cedric Diggory's death, after another Dark Tournament in Japan, Koenma discovers problems in the Wizarding World. Who to send but his team, undercover and under false pretenses? New magic and new companionships, as the Reikai Tantei are set loose on Hogwarts.

I don't know how to use BOT. Here is link.

** Obviously I have to recommend the Harry Potter and Some Other Nerds Series, first book (Oi, Death wants to protect you cuz some other loser has got to die) is complete and suuuuper awesome! We're following the OC's for a good time and Percy doesn't figure much, but ughhhh the writing is great. (HP x Percy Jackson) ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/898773]])

And also the crack/one shot How to interrupt a monologue: Nico di Angelo's Style. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13948497]])

There's some more on AO3 but not complete or the ones that are... Well, they aren't my cup of tea. :/
