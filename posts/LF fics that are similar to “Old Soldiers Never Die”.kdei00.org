As the title says I'm looking for fics like “Old Soldiers Never Die” by Rorschach's Blot. Also anything like “Emperor” by Marquis Black is welcome too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] are your next bets then, both from the same author
