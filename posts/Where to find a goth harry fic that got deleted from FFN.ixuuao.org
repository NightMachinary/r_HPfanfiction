I remember reading a Harry Potter fic on fanfiction.net called the Damned and the Lonely and i think the author is BloodRedEnd but I am not sure. In the story harry was paired with draco and they both listened to goth music and had goth clothing? It got deleted and I can't find it anywhere

Edit- I rechecked my list and thats what it is called but the user can't be found on fiction hunt:/


** Edgy much?
