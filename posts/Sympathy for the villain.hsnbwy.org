Any stories in which Harry learns Voldemort's history and has a “Sympathy for the Villain” moment, as in, recognizes that Voldemort was a result of the environment and the people around him and that Harry himself could have ended up just as bad (if not worse) in a situation akin to that. Would also like if Voldemort had a “Sympathy for the Hero” moment back to admit that Harry had a bad lot in life and that he understands why he opposes him.

Not necessarily having either of them change their goals or even become friends. Just understanding is fine.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** That's actually the canon, isn't it? During HBP there is always a pity mixed with revulsion over the young Tom Riddle's life.

*** Yeah, but it was left mostly implied and didn't really get well developed. We get the idea, but it didn't really created sympathy in Harry (or Dumbledore for that matter). I am looking for stories in which it Harry does look at the facts he saw in the memories, adds what we can see from Tom's probable treatment at the orphanage, the whole thing with London's bombing of the IIWW and actually feels bad for him instead of going with the whole “He was bad from birth, see how he killed another orphan's pet? Yes, this proves it, let's not waste time actually analyzing the situation in particular and seeing why he did it. Evidence? Why my boy, don't you understand that such a thing is only needed when it's you trying to prove something?” Mentality Dumbledore argued for.

*** There's some in the book version, but I think the movie tried to make young Tom Riddle out to be the Antichrist.

**** Well, he was (don't let me start: I am practising Christian with rather non-mainstream opinions about the subject; see Jan Milíč z Kroměříže on Wikipedia, but the English version doesn't bring much details of his theology).

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]
