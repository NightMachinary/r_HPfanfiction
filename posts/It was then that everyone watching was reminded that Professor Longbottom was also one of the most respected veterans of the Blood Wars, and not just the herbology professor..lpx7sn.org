** I'm sure there's a Northumbrian story that contained a similar idea but I can't remember its title right now. You see, in Northumbrian's universe, most of Harry's batchmates, including Neville, became Aurors in order to help the Ministry round up all the remaining Death Eaters before moving on to their respective careers. Neville became the Herbology Professor and after many years, the Headmaster of Hogwarts.

The story I'm trying to remember the title of had a sculptor interviewing Harry's friends as research for her sculpture of Harry. One of those friends berated the sculptor for not doing enough research prior to her interview because she didn't know that Neville became an Auror and worked alongside Harry for a few years.

**** Blood Wars was better than Awakening, which surprised me, because I had expected the series to get worse and worse, dwindling into nothingness. Blood Wars opens up interesting possibilities with Selene as an elder, her daughter returned, but only if they hire better actors for the daughter etc and get their good writers back.

Her friends had tried to calm her down but there really was no stopping the 14 year old once she had started. He'd been too late to save the poor boy from a trip to the hospital wing but it was then that everyone watching was reminded that Professor Longbottom was also one of the most respected veterans of the Blood Wars, and not just the herbology professor.

** Kind of reminds me of the wonderful fic Mistakes. From the description:

A story about the road not traveled, refusing to bow down to dark forces, and finally learning that no one should ever underestimate Neville Longbottom.

And contains among others this scene:

“Did you honestly think it would be that simple? Lumbering, backwards Longbottom, meek herbologist---is that what you really thought? I have seen worse than the likes of you, and heaven help me, I will again. Who else is with him? Who else is going to the castle?”

“I'll never---“

“Crucio,” I whisper.
