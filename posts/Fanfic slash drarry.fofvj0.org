:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic where harry is abandoned by his parents because they think he has the magic of voldemort

It is a slash drarry, just like in that fanfic draco is committed to harry's sister. I read it a while ago but I don't remember its name, I would really appreciate it if you knew the name.


** And Harry is living in New York or something? If this is the one you mean I will try and find it

  AU, HPDM slash, one-sided DMOFC. Nineteen years ago, the Potters betrothed their firstborn child to the firstborn Malfoy child. Eighteen years ago, Voldemort was defeated for good. Seventeen years ago, the Potters changed the contract so that their secondborn child was substituted for their firstborn. Now, Draco Malfoy is trying to work out what happened. COMPLETE.
