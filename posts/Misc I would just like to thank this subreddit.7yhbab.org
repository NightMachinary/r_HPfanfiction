If it weren't for this subreddit, I wouldn't have discovered so many wonderful fanfics - "wonderful" for good and/or bad reasons. I have discovered such a vast quantity of creativity from such a range of authors, that it still blows my mind. And to think, there are still so many stories that haven't been written yet or have only just begun.

Thanks, [[/r/HPFanfiction][r/HPFanfiction]]

I think that is the main reason people pick up writing. They have an idea for a unique premise or a new twist on an old one and then the creative process begins. Or sometimes it is the desire to read something that no one has written so far.

When I first began reading HP fanfiction, I happened across a rather disproportionate amount of Harry/Ginny soulbond fics. That got me thinking why there were none with other characters (at that point I wasn't even aware that it was a trope) so I decided to write my own, just with Luna instead of Ginny because I had trouble finding a decent story with Luna in it. After 20k words of scrapped drafts, I came to the conclusion that this premise wasn't meant for me, but by then the ideas were coming. For example, the Harry&Tonks grow up as siblings idea, heavily influenced by the R-series, eventually became [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758/1/No-longer-alone]["The Tonks family takes Harry in after Sirius fails to clear his name"]], which has very little in common with my original outline, but that's how the creative process works. As of today, I have written close to 200k words, of which 82k were published, only because I wanted a Harry/Luna soulbond, a concept I find rather boring nowadays.

** Completely agree, I've been reading FF for about two years now and this has been, by far, the most useful place on the web. So glad I found it.
