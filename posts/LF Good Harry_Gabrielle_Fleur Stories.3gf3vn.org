** The classic Harry/Gabrielle fic would probably be [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]].

Since it's hosted on fanficauthors, I'll do the bot's job and summarize.

Hope was updated on 30th May 07

Status: Completed - Rating: Teens - Chapters: 12 - Word count: 202,926 - Genre: Action/Adventure, Fluff

Summary: A man who is lost in his own country. A girl who needs her mate to survive. A tale of Quidditch and romance, of anger and betrayal, of friendship and enmity. A story of the power of hope.

This was written well before the last book was published, so it suffers some deviations from canon (Bill and Fleur aren't married yet; Dumbledore survived and continues to be Headmaster). It also can be a bit mouthy and over-explained, but it has a sweetness to it that's charming.
