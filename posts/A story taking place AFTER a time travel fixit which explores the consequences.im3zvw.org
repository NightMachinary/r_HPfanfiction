Several years after the second wizarding war an adult Hermione with a unique time turner travels back to the first war. She has a detailed plan to destroy Voldemort and his Horcuxes as well as ensure that his followers won't escape justice to rise again later. Succeeding in her task she attempts to return to the present but finds herself dropped off in her 11 year old body just as someone knocks on the door. It's Professor McGonagall arriving to inform her that she is a witch and has been accepted to Hogwarts. Upon later reflection she'll realize that this is the point at which her own timeline diverged thanks to the changesand so she is forced to resume her life from that point.

At first the changes seem good as she goes for school supplies in Diagon Alley and observes how things have been improved. However boarding the Hogwarts Express she realizes that the friends and people she knew have been changed dramatically and something equally sinister is afoot.

Harry Potter has had much more than just two living parents in this timeline. He's grown up with knowledge of magic from the start and lives in a wealthy household where he has likely never had to want for anything. He's also had both his marauder father and godfather to influence him into being an overly self confident rogue. The only thing he wants but doesn't have yet is fame (beyond his rich family name) since he never became the boy who lived.

Harry's rival Draco has grown up in significantly less opulence, being raised alone by his mother in a modest London townhouse instead of a sprawling manor with servants to fill his every wish. This Draco is a quiet boy and borders on paranoid as he frequently checks over his shoulder, always mindful of his mother's warnings about people who might still want revenge on families like their own for what the Death Eaters did.

Ron is changed too. While the Weasley family hasn't suddenly become rich the absence of powerful players like Lucius Malfoy has allowed his father to move up in the ministry and so he's gained a lot of influence and power despite a lack of generational wealth. Ron and his siblings have all spent their youth being introduced to the kind of people who are important in this Death Eater free world. With opportunity before them they are being groomed to climb the ladders of power and establish a permanent Weasley dynasty within the Ministry.

But Hermione's fixit was perhaps a bit too tidy. With their seemingly easy victory attitudes have become complacent and even 'good' wizards have allowed themselves to adopt some rather troubling ideas about how Muggles could and perhaps should be 'managed' for their own good. How is Hermione going to fix this world's problems when everyone she knows is different?

Time travel again and again until she gets things right...^{^{/s}}

In all seriousness, this Hermione is in her 30s, a war veteran and, well, she's Hermione (so tons of random knowledge and research). Screw future knowledge, short of Dumbledore she should be able to match anyone and therefore she'd be a prime target for Slughorn to collect (since she dealt with the Death Eaters, Snape is dead at best or a random potioneer at worst). Slughorn gives her the connections she'd need (and as an adult she'd understand this) to reach high places and the ideology you chose (Muggle dominance) should be quite easy to stop with a campaign or two about becoming what they fought against in the 40s since that was Grindelwald's cause. And she should be able to get this moving under an alias even before she graduates, worst case like Harry in Poison Pen.

  The first thing the group noticed when they walked into the Great Hall was the sheer number of students, almost twice the number that they remembered from the first go around.

  "What in the world?" Hermione muttered.

  "Didn't you know?" Susan whispered. "In the old world only one in three muggleborn students lived long enough to receive their letter. It seems that they were especially prone to fatal accidents."

  "Then Lucius Malfoy and a few of his friends suffer fatal accidents of their own," Luna chimed in, "and the number of accidents befalling muggleborn falls to almost zero. What an amazing coincidence!"

** Like [[/u/hellstrike][u/hellstrike]] has said, this Hermione is very powerful and still armed with substantial future knowledge about Muggle world.

She still knows that Internet, computers, and mobile phones are going to be hot. She can easily make 100-1000x on her investments in stock markets

As a technical 30 years old, she's not going to hit on those kids, because that's in fact pedophilia and grooming! She can either relax or go for the jugular in this world. Her options are pretty much endless.

*** The Hogwarts time travel paradox. Those who would be legal crushes for the traveller (anyone aged 16 or above) cannot return the feelings or else they would be the pedophile ones.

** Always wondered about a followup to Wind Shear. Imagine Cygnus Black dealing with his son-in-laws. A blood traitor, a mudblood and a halfblood. He likes the mudblood the best, he's the only one that shows the proper respect.

Meanwhile Nymphadora Black has the elder Blacks wrapped her fingers. Harry's kids go to Hogwarts with his half-siblings and become friends with Ron and Hermione et al. And he's a paranoid wreck, "Don't go to the restroom alone, there's trolls!" "Sure, dad. Whatever."
