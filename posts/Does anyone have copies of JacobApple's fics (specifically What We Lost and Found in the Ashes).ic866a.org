The rest would be appreciated as well.


** For those who don't know, JacobApples seems to be reorganising their HP fics to an archive profile so they can get a fresh start and move on to other fandoms and projects. It says on their profile summary thingy.

Apparently new FFNet profiles are limited to two new stories a day, so they're going to be taking some time to reupload all their old Harry Potter stories to the 'JacobApples' profile, while their new stuff will go on the AppoApples profiles.

Looks like some are being reposted. I only had Broken Reflections which is already back up, and What We Lost is there as well.

Download the EPUB or MOBI file from the first result of both links if you want proper formatting, as the recent re-uploads are all combined into 1 large chapter & stuff like bold & italics weren't preserved IIRC.

** As someone else commented, ff2ebook has them. You need to download the epub or mobi to read it though.
