After a hard day's work at the Ministry, Harry thought it would be a good idea to take a break. That's why he decided to take his family out for a meal.

So, the Potters went to a fast food establishment on the outskirts of London, led by Harry. Having taken the orders of Ginny and his three children, Harry went to the line to order his food, everything went normally, until his gaze hit a picture on one of the walls of the restaurant of a man who looked very familiar to him. He was so disconcerted when he saw the man's name, "Tobias Riddle" in gold letters, with the inscription "Employee of the Month". With his blood freezing, Harry took his order, went to his table and didn't say a word, hoping to finish his meal and leave that place as soon as possible...


** Lol, Riddle is not an uncommon name.

If he's shocked by Tobias Riddle, he will probably get a heart attack [[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/412712753322218021/][seeing this]].

*** Well yes, electing judges is a really fucking stupid idea and should shock anyone.

**** It's pretty common, at least in the US. The idea is that corrupt or abusive judges could be removed from their position. However, most people don't really know anything about judges, so they probably just vote to keep them or skip the whole section of the ballot.

Lifetime appointment of judges could be dangerous if the people don't have any way to hold them accountable. People who are drawn to positions of power tend to not always have the best interests of common people in mind.

***** Common in the US, but practically unknown everywhere else, hardly a ringing endorsement of them given that the only other thing common in the US but practically unknown elsewhere is aerosol cheese. Where you see an opportunity to have the people remove abusive judges from their positions, I see abusive judges having an opportunity to cement their position through populist sentencing and jury direction.
