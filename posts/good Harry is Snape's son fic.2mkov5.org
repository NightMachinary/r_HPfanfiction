Are there any GOOD stories where Harry is Snape's biological son? Preferably a story where Harry turns dark and is a bit ruthless. In Blood Only by E.M. Snape was okay, but Harry was a bit too weak and at times pathetic for my taste.

** Not dark, but also not a Dumbledore follower but more of a third side in the war: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501523/1/Forlorn-Hope][Forlorn Saga]] - just reread it after someone here helped me to find it again after I "lost" it.

** The "like none other" series by aspeninthesunlight is quite good, though unfinished over three books so far.

** Thanks for the rec. I can add Stronger than Hope, in case somebody else is looking for good mentor/father Snape/Harry stories too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope]]

Snape isn't Harry's father, only his mentor, but plays an important role. Both characters are somewhat dark.

If anybody else knows other good stories where Snape is Harry's mentor or father and Harry is a bit darker (or very dark), I'm still looking!
