:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First fic I'm looking for is where Harry is either blind or sees magic differently than others and/or maybe powerful and doesn't care for wands and asks magic to do it for him I remember him being civil with Draco and tell him how he views magic

Next would be a fic where Harry doesn't attend Hogwarts and later found by Yonks and is blackmailed by Dumbledore to attend Hogwarts this might be the same fic as the one above its hard to remember with people changing the tags on their fics or deleting them

Last but not least if you guys have any recommendations for Fics involving powerful and/or smart Harry that doesn't let Hermione boss him around that would be lovely and the pairings should be slash or fem harry or Drarry NOOOOO! Snarry that pairing is creepy especially with Snapes obsession with Lily

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I know exactly what fic you're talking about for the second one!!! He's laying half dead somewhere in Knockturn alley and Tonks and Moody find right?! And then Tonks sees his forehead and is like “Moody, Look”. I'm gonna see if I can figure out the title.

*** Yes that's what happened I tried to find it but with most fics it's hard to find if you don't know the pairings, or any specific tags and most writers don't put the correct tags on their work lights I know a few Bamf or smart Harry fics but he just does the same crap in canon with no major impact
