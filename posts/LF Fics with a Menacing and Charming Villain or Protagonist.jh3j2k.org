So I just got done watching Inglorious Basterds and I have a nagging for villains who are not over the top evil like Canon Voldemort and Bellatrix but a villain or even a protagonist more along the lines of Hans Landa. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0dAqhxfvlg][Basically what I am looking for]]. A main character/villain who is suave, charismatic and utterly ruthless. Thanks in advance. I would prefer little to no romance if possible. (I highly recommend the movie btw).
