I want to write a little something but I don't know where I should post it.

Worm fics, I know, are found mostly on forums like Spacebattles or Sufficient Velocity, and I like the amount of writer-reader interaction that those sites provide. The vast majority of Harry Potter fics are found on FF.net and Ao3 if I'm not mistaken, but neither of those allow for the kind of writer-reader interaction I am looking for.

I've heard good things about Dark Lord Potter, does that allow for any kind of fic or is it limited to "dark lordy" fics?

And are there any other good places I should look into?


** AO3 will probably be your best bet for interaction. Fanfiction.net for views. DLP doesn't seem like a good idea unless you are familiar with the type of fics the community likes, the types of tropes the community hates, etc etc.

If you're writing a specific pairing, there are other sites. SIYE might be a good place if you're writing Harry/Ginny, for example.

(You could also post your fic on Fanfiction.net for views and ask for feedback from here. But while we tend to be less specific than DLP in what we /like/, there are still tropes the community tends to hate.)

** I've posted stories to three different archive sites:

AO3 - Offers the greatest artistic freedom inasmuch as there are very few rules. Don't expect a great deal of feedback aside from the occasional kudos. Comments are hard to come by. The organization behind the site seems very professional and very stable, so there's no need to worry that your story will disappear from the internet next week.

FF.net - Probably the largest base of potential readers and the most likely place to get feedback. The quality of the feedback is usually pretty low, however. Be careful not to run afoul of their rules regarding lemons and underage pairings. The site has been around forever and it's not likely to go anywhere.

HarryPotterFanFiction.com - The community here isn't large, but it tends to be very, very passionate. If people bother to review, they often give lengthy, detailed and thoughtful feedback. Before the site owner decided to close down the associated forums site, there was a very strong sense of community. The rules of the site are extremely strict with regard to sexuality. Prior to a year ago, slash fics were required to be marked with a special tag and HPFF's "Mature" rating was pretty much equivalent to a "T" rating on FF.net. The site has been having financial issues over the past year or two and the site owner constantly threatens to shut the site down whenever anything happens that he doesn't like. I'd say the odds that it continues to survive in its present form are around 50/50.

** Also consider Tumblr, I get a lot of good interaction there. Also, depending on what kind of story you have, some smaller sites, like SIYE, can be good.

DLP likes a certain kind of story, definitely. I've avoided posting my stuff on there because I don't think I'm their cup of tea, but they'll certainly give you detailed feedback.

**** Generally AU, generally with a more powerful/smarter Harry, paired with someone other than Ginny (Fleur seems popular), and absolutely no slash. I lurk there because it's interesting and I like their pet peeves thread and general discussion, but I'm just way too much of a softy for them I think.

***** They seem to be the Severus Snape of fanfiction critique... Highly detailed feedback, yes, however, you'll have the sarcastic tone in bonus.

If your writing is found lacking, you'll never hear the end of it.

It's still an interesting site however.

**** They can be open to pretty much anything as long as it is compelling and well written. So, a generic post-5th year indy!Harry with arbitrary rare pairing story isn't really going to stand out unless it's exceptional, something like The Black Prince or Shadows of Angmar will, because there are so few quality stories of those crossover fandoms.

** I have no idea what a worm fic even is?

I was under the impression that DLP didn't actually have its own archive? It links to other sites and has a c2 on ffn. They either like you or they don't and it can be the kiss of death if they don't. So unless you are really on their wavelength I would be wary of going there.

*** Worm fic, as apposed to Harry Potter fic, is a fanfic... about Worm, rather than Harry Potter. It's a different fandom, I was giving an example.

** Unfortunately, I think you're going to find that many of the best ones are now defunct -- mugglenet, fictionalley, sugarquill, etc... It's been nearly a decade since the series ended, which I guess makes it understandable, albeit still tragic. That being said, here are all the still-active sites I know about:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/]] (just listing these two for completeness)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.io/]]
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/]]
- [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/]]
- [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]]

As well as the ship-specific:

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction]] (H/Hr)
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]] (S/Hr)
- [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/]] (D/G)

Generally speaking, I think you're going to get better reader-writer interaction the more niche you go --- The type of fen ship-specific sites draw tend to be more passionate and more helpful. DLP has a community based around giving detailed (if acerbic) critiques, and you won't be able to post your own stories until you've become a part of the community --- However, you need to be writing a certain sort of fic for it to even be applicable to those sites.

As far as the more general archives go, I'd reckon that hpff and hpffa are a bit better than ao3 is better than ffn is better than ffio, which is barely a month old and doesn't have much of a community at all yet.

Personally, i'd recommend posting it to every site it's applicable for. You'll get a variety of different readers, and you can figure out which gives you the type of interaction you like best that way.

In any case, good luck! Hope this was helpful.

**** They don't have a lot, but that doesn't mean that your story wouldn't have exposure. Applied Cultural Anthropology has over 100 pages of coments, and just because the people there don't write that much HP fanfiction doesn't mean they don't read it. Also, the audience is very interactive there, which is a plus.
