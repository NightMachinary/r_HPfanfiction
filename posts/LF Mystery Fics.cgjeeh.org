** linkffn(10099028)

Read this a while back, and it has three arcs. More of a detective type fic than a mystery, but it is well written and is one of the best AU fics in this fandom.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Idk if Lady Thief is a mystery fic, it's certainly a big mystery for Harry which he eventually figures out by putting together clues, but the reader already knows who the night nargle is since half the story is from her perspective. It's still one of my favorites.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** Most HP books are mystery books, including the last chapter where +Hercule Poirot+Albus Dumbledore (or sometimes Harry) explains what is the answer.

1. PS: most simple whodunnit “Who tries to stole the Philosophers Stone?”
2. CoS: “What's the danger at Hogwarts? What/Where is the Chamber of Secrets? Who is the Heir of Slytherin?”
3. PoA: “Where is Sirius Black? Who helped to kill Potters?”
4. GoF: “Why is Harry in the Tournament?”
5. OoP: “What is the Secret Voldemort looks for?”
6. HBP: “Who is the Half-Blood Prince? What is Draco Malfoy after?”
7. one of many problems of DH is that here the mystery is a bit confusing, perhaps “Where are Horcruxes?”

**** Not really, the basis of a mystery is to be resolvable. The resolution to a mystery needs to be a realization, not a revelation. Just addressing plot points at the end of a book does not make a mystery.

*** You absolutely can! Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright was a mystery game set in a fantasy setting, and it handled itself very well. Each spell had specific set of limitations applied to it (for example, there was a spell that created gateways through walls, but only if the wall was green on both sides). So long as there are established and internally consistent rules for the world in question, then fantasy mysteries are possible

**** Yeah I played that one too and it was great, but that's probably less feasible with a magical setting as lax as the one in the HP universe. I had to integrate mystery elements in a fic once, and it's just hard to justify, in universe, not just cheating the reader by having any problem resolved magically.

***** That's true. HP canon is kind of soft on its worldbuilding. A fanfiction could theoretically do a good job setting itself up as a mystery, though, by firming up aspects of worldbuilding to result in better internal consistency

****** Well that would require a large amount of worldbuilding to basically reestablish the whole magical system, which is not optimal in a mystery because it's a lot of noise from the mystery itself.

At the end even I gave up on writing a proper mystery fanfiction and just integrated howdunnit elements in the fights, which also helped make wizarding duels less boring. I'd like to see someone manage to write a good HP mystery but I frankly don't have my hopes up.
