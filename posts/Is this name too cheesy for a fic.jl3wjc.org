So if I were to create an OC named Luna Lupin, would it be too confusing? Even if Luna Lovegood isn't a major player in the story? Is it cheesy? I think it rolls off the tongue and fits in well with the whole wolf theme that Remus has going on. It's his sister if that helps. Who is not a werewolf.

Also, I didn't know if I should pick discussion or misc as my flair. There was an effort.


** Personally, I'd go against this choice - while it's true that in real life names don't belong to a single person and frequently overlap, in books that tends to be largely avoided for the sake of clarity, unless same names are a plot point. Especially when one of the characters is an established, well-known character. While I admit that Luna Lupin would be a really cool name for Remus' relative, when reading sentences referring to her with her first name only I would always assume Luna Lovegood first. Doubly so if the fanfic would be in chapters - I subscribe to a lot of fics, sometimes sit on a good few chapters before reading, and it takes a while before I remember all the important points. If one of the OCs shared a canon character's name, I could easily go through a few chapters wondering how Luna Lovegood was Remus' sister, before remembering that it's not actually her.

*** I love your point about the chapters. I hadn't considered that. Thanks!

** Could be fun. If you did have Luna in the story, you could lampshade the name similarity a bit and have them meet and just go "Huh, same namesies!" or whatever the Luna equivalent of that is. :)

*** I actually considered having Remus's sister and Pandora be friends so it isn't a coincidence that they have the same name, but I didn't want to add a layer of unnecessary drama.

**** I see what you mean, but it doesn't have to be drama. Could just be one friend naming their child after another. Or could even joke about it "I've always loved the name Luna, even before I met you. Hope you don't mind the confusion when I name my child that too.".

** Well, there are tons of characters in HP who have same initial first names and last names so if anyone says it's cheesy I'd just point that out

** You could name her "Lune", the French version of the name.

*** Coincidentally, she actually drags Lupin to France for a time after the first war so it's cool that you would mention that.

** I like the alliteration but with Luna Lovegood already being a well known character I would suggest using another L names.

Since Remus is named after a roman Mythological character I would suggest using Roman names , here are some that I found after searching " Famous Roman Women","Women in Roman Mythology" and " Ancient Roman names".

/L names/

Laelia

Lavinia

Laurentia

Livia

Liviana

Livilla

Licinia

Lucia

Luciana

Lucilla

Lucretia ( The name of Sirius Black's paternal aunt , but might work as they're different generations)

​

/Non- L names/

​

Antonia

Augusta ( The name of Neville's grandmother but I think it'd work as they're different generations)

Aurelia

Camilla

Claudia

Cornelia

Diana ( Roman version of the Greek Goddess Artemis who is associated with the moon)

Faustina

Helena

Julia

Junia

Marcia

Marciana

Maxima

Octavia

Sabina

Tiberia

Valeria

Valentina

*** Omg you're the best! I did some research on Roman mythological names but none of them stuck out to my like some of yours do. I initially chose Bellona, or Lonnie, for the goddess of war but something just felt wrong. It didn't vibe. Thanks so much for your list.

** I'd choose another related name from Roman mythology. Maybe Sylvia? In the myth she's the mother of Romulus and Remus, but I could see Remus's parents using the same source material for baby names. Especially if she isn't a werewolf, having a moon connected name makes less sense than a Roman myth connected one.

** It's probably too confusing. If you want L names then I would suggest Leah, Lara, or Lisa.
