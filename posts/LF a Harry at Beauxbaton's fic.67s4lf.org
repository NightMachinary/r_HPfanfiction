I remember reading a story, but I can't find it through google-fu.

Harry transferred to Beauxbaton's after 2nd or 3rd year, tired of being a target in school. Hermione's parents would not let her transfer with him. Dumbledore was desperate to get him back, and rigged the GOF to make Harry the champion for Beauxbaton's.

(Why is this so hard to find?)


** Was it a H/F fic? Because I remember one like that, and could try digging through my history.

*** I'm pretty sure it was Harmony, as I remember Hermione wanted to transfer with Harry but her parents wouldn't let her. She also made arrangements to visit as often as possible.

That doesn't mean it couldn't have been H/F with these elements mixed in. "Pretty sure" is often a dice roll with my memory...
