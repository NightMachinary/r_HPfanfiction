Looking for a story I read on fanfiction.net a while back. Its mainly a Harry and Ginny romance. It takes place after the war. I think Ginny might be younger than she is in cannon. Harry is just as close to Ron but he has never met Ginny because Ron didn't want her to know how involved he was in the war.

Ginny is a professional ballerina and the story starts when she bumps in to Harry Potter after her first show. He asks her out but she declines.

I can't remember much else. Does anybody KK now what this story is I really want to read it.
