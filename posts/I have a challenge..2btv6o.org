Basically, one person writes the first paragraph in the comments, and then another writes the next. And it continues and continues. I'm curious how this will turn out.


** "I don't suppose there's any use in arguing," Harry said with a heavy sigh. "You'll just tell me there's no other choice." He leveled a glare at his companion, but it was half-hearted at best. He couldn't find it in himself to be truly angry.

**** "Yeah, yeah. I know you are." Harry stood up abruptly and walked across the room to stare out the window at the Quidditch pitch, where he could dimly see the bright yellow robes of the Hufflepuff team running drills. Even knowing that they were in the dungeons at least thirty feet under ground, it still looked so real, like he could open the window and let the fresh spring air wash over him.

***** "Alright," Harry sighed, shooting one more envious glance at the Hufflepuff fliers. "I don't suppose you received any sort of direction other than 'do this or your family dies,' right?" Harry scoffed at Draco's negative head shake. "Figures."

****** Harry grabbed some chalk and began a rough draft of the design for the rune circle that they would need for the ritual. After a few seconds, he glared at Draco, who quickly grabbed his own piece to begin work on the opposite end. "You've gone on about your father for years, how crafty and powerful and wealthy he is. Others have warned me about him. Two weeks ago, I would not have believed he would fall for such a stupid trap. Then again-" Draco's chalk snapped, and Harry wandlessly sent over another piece "-Two weeks ago, I would have no desire to save him."

******* Harry could see Draco's hand trembling so hard from across the circle that it looked like he was about to break a second piece of chalk in as many minutes. He leaned back onto his knees and watched the blond boy, who just last year he would have sworn had no feelings to speak of, try to rein in his turbulent emotions. "This will all be for nothing if the runes aren't drawn straight, Draco," he said, not unkindly.

******** The rune circle was complicated, but Harry was mostly certain his draft was passable. Probably not perfect, but close enough to work. Maybe. Rolling the chalk between his fingers, he looked to where Pansy sat stupefied in the corner of the room. She was unconscious, but sniffling, and tears still stained her face like the chalk on Harry's hand. She was going to be trouble later, but there wasn't time to worry about her now. "You know my father took me on a trip to Albania," Draco said, and when Harry looked he'd stopped drawing. "The summer before we got sorted."

********* "So you've seen this circle before. You know what I have planned?" Draco shuddered, but Harry almost smiled. "Don't, Draco. We're going to trap them in turn. This is win-win-win. I'm going to transfer a hanger-on, my own soul shouldn't be affected by the ritual. We've both seen what Pansy has done, first to Hermione then to Greg. She deserves to be kissed on both counts." He plucked out one his hairs and dropped it in a potion. "I almost wish I could keep the connection to Tom so I could feel his rage when he realizes how badly he buggered this one up."

********** "It was an accident. She was only trying to help." Draco moved as if to continue drawing, but his hand hovered over the rune circle. After a pause, he instead lifted the chalk and pointed it at Harry as if it were a wand. "And I didn't think I'd ever hear you say anybody deserved The Kiss."

*********** Harry also stopped drawing. "Draco, that Hanger-On is a piece of Tom's soul. When he attacked me in my dreams the other night, he did something. It's leaking. I keep on feeling bursts of insanity and cruelty and power and... plans, dozens of them, with impossible contingencies. I am not sure right now what I think about The Kiss, just that I have to get this out of my head as soon as possible. Can you see another way we can do this?"

I need you to be ready to use it on me within seconds of ritual failure. Fiendfyre would also work, but you still can't control it, can you? I need you to be able to hate me again, enough to cast it within about 10 seconds of the ritual. If you can't, and he takes control, he could destroy everyone and everything at Hogwarts, starting with you."

************** ''I don't hate you though.' Draco looked up from his scribblings at Harry who sensed what was coming. 'You saved my life. My fathers-'

'You hated me before.' Harry said. He was slightly bemused at how quickly Draco had turned. With any luck he would do so again. Harry just needed to push him. He looked back at Pansy and an idea struck him.

'Did you love her?'

"She was merely a means to an end, Harry, you know that.", he told him, his eyes shining in adoration.

**************** [Not part of the fic here, commentary. You are cornering this into drama/romance between Harry and Draco, but even if they are lovers in this fic, Harry has shown signs of serious mental instability/evil, and at the same time Draco's family is being held hostage. No matter how much they are in love with each other, Draco shouldn't have adoration right now. Harry is trying to convince Draco to kill him if necessary, and at the same time they are to perform an unavoidable ritual they both loathe. My implications being that it was sending the scar horcrux into Pansy, polyjuicing her, and having Voldemort kill her (dunno about everyone else). But regardless of all that, the "shining in adoration" kills the pacing and kills the fic.]

***************** [I am going to continue the story as it's written in this post. I agree that under the circumstances, adoration is probably not reasonable. I also have a hard time seeing Harry advocating killing anybody even if mentally unstable. That said, as I see it the point of this topic is to build off of what came before you. If you don't see the previous posts as reasonable under the circumstances, or you think the story is moving in a direction you don't agree with, your remedy isn't to outright disregard what was written, but to find a creative way to change the direction or shed light on the previous posts that changes how they're viewed without having to disregard them. Harry Potter is one of the few stories out there where "A Wizard Did It" is an acceptable explanation. Let's get creative!]

Draco had always been a bastard, but he wasn't heartless. Even if he really didn't love Pansy--and there was a good chance he didn't--he still hadn't given her up when she messed with Neville's Transfigurations and McGonnagle blamed him. Served three weeks of detention for it. Harry looked him hard in the eyes. Adoration. Of all the times for someone to have slipped him a love potion. "Draco," Harry said, "I need you to concentrate for this. Someone could die here. You understand that, right?"

Garlands and wreaths draped the walls, leaving only a few specs from the white of the wall to be seen. She was utterly confused by his adornment of the Christmas tree, which on it hung about fifty Hawaiian Honolulu dancers. Ron sniggered at her bewilderment, happy he dumbfounded her.
