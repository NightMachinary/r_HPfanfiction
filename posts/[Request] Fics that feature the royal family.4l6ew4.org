Most notably the Queen, but any of the royals.

Personal preference for cooperation between them and wizards but as long as they're not waging a muggle vs. magic war it's fine.


** I've been reading and enjoying Long Live The Queen

** Probably not what you're looking for, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3yoj8e/harry_potter_the_british_royal_family_is_or_has/][I wrote a theory that some of the royal family are likely magical]]. Queen Mary I was also portrayed as a witch in the film /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's / Sorcerer's Stone/, and Pottermore says that Lucius Malfoy I unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister, Queen Elizabeth I.

Likewise, Lucius Malfoy I cast a jinx that, by supposedly prevented Elizabeth I from wedding and having children, caused the end of the reign of the house of Tudor. Instead, the throne passed to the house of Stuart, eventually resulting in the persecution that would lead to the colonization of wizarding America, and International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
