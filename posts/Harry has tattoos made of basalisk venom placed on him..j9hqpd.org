I think Susan Bones was in it as a main character, and I believe that the tattoos were incredibly painful basically burned into his skin from the venom. He may have gotten a knockturn alley shopkeep to do it and they may have been in a special Potter book. can't remember much sorry but it's driving me nuts.


** I think i read part of that one. Heavy political bent harry was gonna be really close with Neville susan and daphne. I gave up on it cause the writer made him needlessly mean towards ron and hermione. If you find it i might give it another shot
