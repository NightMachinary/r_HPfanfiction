I'm reading That Universe Over There by mytimeconsumingsidehobby(Ao3) and it is excellent. It is a really adorable and funny story about Harry adopting his alternate reality self who is a girl and raising her as his own daughter.

It's a comedy and it is genuinely very well done and cutesy funny. Ivy Potter is a sweetheart and and painfully adorable.

I am looking for more stories where Harry goes back in time and raises himself, if there are many like this. I'd prefer his other self to be a girl, I just find the dynamic of father/daughter to work very well.

I'd appreciate whatever you guys recommend. Thanks

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

  Echoes from one world can effect another, when people awake in Westeros as part of House Peverell waves will be created, futures might be changed and on the dawn of one of the most devastating wars in the country's history this could be all the greater.
