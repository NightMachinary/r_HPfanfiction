I'm currently at book 3 of my series rewrite and I'm a bit stuck for the next book. The same events happen, but they happen differently. So, I definitely want the tournament and I want to have 3 or 4 tasks, as that's how many competitors there are.

My question/issue is how to handle the tasks and whether I should keep them the same, such as dragon, water, maze, or alter them into something else... something more unique.

I do like the dragon task, no matter how I do it. It's spicy and has a lot of different routes you can take with it.

This is what I've got so far.

Task 1: Dragon. Competitors must survive for a minimum time of ten minutes. The longer you survive (not get injured), the more points you get. Hidden in the arena is a piece of a riddle that will aid the competitor with the last task. Collecting this riddle adds a bonus of ten points to your score. Killing the dragon loses you 1,000 points (pretty much a disqualification).

Task 2: School versus school battle. Each champion will be given control over the fifth, sixth, and seventh-year students and to prepare them for a schoolwide battle. Getting hit with a spell or disarmed renders you out of the battle. Pretty much a magic version of paintball. Hidden in the battleground are 4 pieces of map. The person who collects them all (if you get knocked out, they return) will have an advantage in the final task. Each piece is worth fifteen points.

Task 3: Each competitor is locked in a room and they must escape before a time limit hits. There's different rooms and each room is different. Leaving one room may lead you into another room, which you then must escape from. Each room has a list that will help the competitor in the final task. Retrieving this rewards the competitor with twenty-five points.

See, I can easily leave it at 3 or I can add one more. Or I could just follow the can tasks and just spice them up a bit. I'm not sure on how I should handle it.


** Without making specific suggestions, if you want to keep the tasks thematically consistent with those from canon, here's what I suggest:

- Give each task an elemental theme.

- Make sure you do NOT have the Champions competing directly against each other (in the sense of casting spells at each other). Rather they should each be seeking to overcome some "third party" (animate or inanimate), and the one who does it best wins.

- Make sure the task is designed such that it is essentially a problem-solving task, one which has multiple different possible solutions.

- Consider the following dichotomies: creature opponent vs obstacle, preparation vs improvisation, confrontation vs evasion, placement vs retrieval. So, canon first task is a creature-improvisation-evasion-retrieval task. Canon second task is a obstacle-preparation-confrontation-retrieval task. Create new combinations to get new tasks.

I like your "escape from a room" idea. Now change it from a boring old room to a more exciting locale with an elemental theme, and make sure you have multiple different ways for the escape to occur so each champion does it differently.

Not a fan of the dragon survival task. Firstly because it's boring, it lacks any kind of goal that requires the champions to take positive actions. Secondly because it seems easy. Without forcing the champions to take risks in order to achieve their goal, surviving against a dragon doesn't seem difficult at all for a competent wizard. Fourth year Harry would struggle but the others could just sit it out behind a well cast shield charm.

*** Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Each task needs an elemental theme. That has really thrown a wrench in my plans. Having the elements could also be used as a clue as well. I like that.

The only task that would come close would be #2, which even doesn't really pit them against each other as they're the 'generals' and their job is to make their troops win the war.

Hm. Yes. That's where it gets complicated. Maybe I need to sit down and improve the solutions rather than the problems.

ooh! That is handy. I'll save that and use that.

I must admit I was watching Saw when I was debating it. :P I did plan on the rooms having plenty of escapes and for the rooms to be somewhere else, somewhere inetresting. I was gonna use the RoR for it as it'd remove any plotholes.

Neither am I. I just wanted dragons xD The task is essentially a defensive game. The thing is that they wouldn't be told what to do, just tossed into the arena and told to not harm the dragon. There would be subtle clues that clued them into survival. I do agree, however, that it is a boring task.

**** On the subject of elemental themes, I remember a fic pointing out that the first task was fire-and-air themed, the second was water themed, and the third earth (or, you know, wood) themed; it used this as justification for why Fluer did poorly in the second task, fire-chucking Veela don't work well in water elemental conditions.

...I wonder, why have just 3 tasks? I know there's 3 competitors usually, so it's a tri-tri...But why not make it 9 tasks in groups of three (a triple triad, counting the competitors), or maybe evoke the 12 labors of Heracles?

...Perhaps not that last one. Those labors can be summed up as kill-the-unkillable, catch-the-uncatchable, ^{row} ^{row} ^{fight} ^{the} ^{power} and in the last few a fair bit of divine sabotage.

I think the individual tasks should be of great significance. Maybe you could do multiple smaller tasks back to back in a single day, but I doubt you could have 9 large events on different days with press attending etc.

Because 3 is a number with significance for wizards, and 9 not particularly.

That said, you could really make it have any number of tasks that works for you.

***** I'm not the OP but here's my opinion : It's for the flow of the story. If I was writing a story totally centered on that particular year, I would surely do more than 3 tasks but while they are fun to write (and I hope, to read as well) there's still other things going on. I personally write about 30 000 words a year in my main fic so that's just not possible if I want to show good tasks.

** I've always thought the Tasks were twists on old fairytales and legends, or at least inspired by them: battling a dragon, retrieving a 'treasure' from a dangerous and unknown 'land', and navigating a labyrinth filled with dangers (including a sphinx, who poses riddles!). If you want inspiration, perhaps look at other myths and legends such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules][labours of Hercules]].

The changes you've made to the first task don't really add anything, and actually seem to reduce the conflict - instead of actively trying to steal the egg, Harry now has to avoid a dragon for ten minutes. There's no point changing little things for the sake of it - if you want it to be different, make a new challenge entirely.

Your second task as it's structured right now doesn't fit the spirit of the tournament imo - the tasks are meant to test the individual intelligence, resourcefulness, and magical skill. The idea does have potential though - perhaps instead of students, each champion is given command of a legion of transfigured soldiers, like McGonagall's chess pieces. You can tweak the rules to make it interesting - champions can modify their soldiers, eliminate each other by capturing an competitor's base, etc.

The third task is again an extension of the labyrinth as a series of escape rooms. I suppose you could make the 'puzzle' in each room interesting, but that could be done in the maze challenge as well, and this seems a little anticlimactic compared to the maze. It could fit as an alternate first or second task though.

Some other ideas for tasks:

- All four champions are dropped deep inside the Forbidden Forest with only their wands, and must navigate back to Hogwarts. They're free to work together, or got their separate ways.
- Champions have to scale (on foot) one of the mountains of the Scottish Highlands to retrieve a clue for the next task on the summit. The mountain is inhabited by all manner of dangerous magical creatures like roosting dragons, and takes more than a day to climb.

*** Oh, God, I can hardly decipher riddles let alone create them. :p Mythology is something I lack in. :( Time to do some studying.

I must admit that it was a quick idea draft and I was going to add it to something else, but dragons are frightening and I was certain that it would shatter the champions' confidence by facing a dragon -- you're right, though.

The task is meant to test how the champion reacts under pressure, can recruit and handle a bunch of troops that can turn their back on you at any given moment. I like the tournament to be about the schools, not the individual person. It's kinda why I chose to have a battle as a second task.

The point of the puzzle rooms was to be a more confined version of the maze. Each room would have a trap or two, a riddle to solve, or a brute force method. Depending on how you solved the room you could be teleported to another room or onto the podium.

I dislike the maze as it's impossible to watch and I want each task to have spectators.

**** If you have no idea how to change them to keep them in spirit, then keep them the same and simply fade to black and have the characters talk about it later. Ambiguity is your friend; if you give them just enough details and no more, many of your readers will come up with the tasks that were interesting on their own.

That said, I think only part of the problem comes from the fact that so many people wrote about the very same tasks. I think that at least a part of it comes from people forcing themselves to write the tasks as if they all had to be narrated second-by-second when they themselves don't know what exactly they want to do with that stuff.

So the question you should be asking yourself is: Do you know what you want to do with this stuff? Or do you just want to get through it for the sake of having it?

** If Voldemort is still trying to interfere, you could rework the tasks so that each one has a (different) trap for Harry that would take him to the Little Hangledon graveyard, rather than that only happening in the last task. It would require him having more followers at the Ministry who are able to influence the details of the tasks, but it could be both a good justification for the changes and a starting point for designing the tasks.

** Here's my contribution:

Set up the triwizard tournament as a test of wit, power and imagination.

The canon setup for the first task is sufficient, but you can have the competitors focus on defeating the dragon not with spells, but with smarts-i.e. they are graded on how cleverly they handle the dragon rather than by just getting past it. Hence wit-getting past the dragon is not important per se. How you trick it into allowing you to get past is far more important.

The second task would be one of power. What counts here is the spells being used and how they are used. Given the rather nebulous way in which power is defined in canon and your own setup with how power is defined/handled in the fic, it can be literally anything-a straight up magical duel being the most basic idea while an obstacle course would be the less obvious route.

Imagination, though, that's going to be the main event. How the competitors use a limited set of spells to overcome a challenge will be the focus here. A good fit for that one would be simple-given a week or more to prepare, the contestants have to navigate through an urban area and find the Cup before the others do. They can bring whatever tools they can make in that time, but are limited in the spells they can cast to get themselves from point A to point B. Using any other spells would lead to immediate disqualification. That the competitors end up fighting each other is expected, of course, but if they do fight each other, they are forbidden from doing so with a wand.

There, premise set-enough leeway to play around with, different enough to be interesting and a nice sandbox to use to showcase the wildly different ways in which the various contestants will approach battling a dragon, getting across dangerous terrain and hunting for the Cup in a completely alien environment.

** Idea I just had: since it's Hogwarts hosting it, do four tasks and have each task represent one of the founders' values. The "steal an egg from a nesting mother dragon" canon task is a great example of Gryffindor courage. Finding a way to survive in a lake long enough to rescue someone would invoke the intelligence Ravenclaw valued. For Hufflepuff, maybe something that's a lot easier on the champions if they work together? I have no idea how to represent Slytherin best through a task though.

By canon, you have hundreds of students imported from across the continent, staying at Hogwarts for eight months, to put their names into a cup, dance, and watch one lucky person from their school do tricks for three hours. This does not make sense.

The school standings are determined solely by the champions. This does not make sense.

The solution to the first part is to have more events. The solution to the second part is to have events that are not about the champions.

Debates, a dueling tournament, artistic demonstrations, crafting competitions, all with varying degrees of formality. Multiple social events -- Beaubatons and Durmstrang both providing food for their schools' feasts, and perhaps dances using their styles and their music.

Different, I'd say. Canon tasks had some problems, and they've been done a lot.

#+end_quote

With just the champions, things are easy. Champions each choosing one companion, that's also easy. Using small teams is harder, and using the entire school is just asking for trouble.

How do you determine who competes? Are people forcibly drafted using the Goblet's magic? What if you don't want to compete, or you're sick that day? How do you make fair teams? What happens if someone's upset with the champion and decides to backstab them? How do you divide the Hogwarts students between Harry and Cedric? How would the Goblet handle it if someone (not a champion) cheated during the event?

You might want this sort of trouble for your story, or you might think it worthwhile, but it's a load of work regardless.

*** The issue is I didn't want to write more than 5 tasks. Other things are going on such as chess tournaments, Quidditch games, dueling tournaments, and other such things. The students won't be bored. :)

The task is rather simple, but complex depending on everything. The joy of it is what goes on once it has started. Whether the champion puts them in small forces or goes for a blitz strategy is up to them. How Hogwarts will handle having 2 people to choose from is up to them.

Anyone who entered their name has to participate. You have to be fifteen or older to add your name, hence fifth-year and above.

A lot of those people will be a bit peeved that they weren't chosen. Not all of them will be willing to support a different champion. They'll be a little peeved if they suddenly have to obey orders from someone they saw as competition. They won't work with the champion as well as they might, and that's just the baseline. Some will actively dislike the champion and want them to lose.

This effect is somewhat, but only somewhat, mitigated if you announce this event before people are allowed to enter.

You still haven't resolved how to distribute students between Cedric and Harry.

What happens if five people enter from Durmstrang and thirty enter from Beaubatons?
