:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a long while ago I read a fanfic about Fem!Harry being transported to the Naruto world and was Shikamaru's sister, since she was found by the Nara's. I remember the fic was pretty popular with thousands of favorites on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], but for the life of me I can not find it. I'm not sure if this was the best place to ask for a crossover, but please help!

the author did a rewrite which is probably why you had trouble finding it
