Which is more important to you in a story - that the characters sound like WIzards and Witches, or that they sound properly British?

For that matter, do you think that British slang and turns of phrase are 'Muggle' or do you just accept that Wizards sound British simply because they are? (They all have the accent.)

For me, it's always important that the British characters SOUND British, that they use words and phrases I would expect to hear a British person say.

It seems like we only hear a difference in their swears, like invoking Merlin and such.

For example, 'smashing' or 'brilliant' versus 'cool' or 'awesome'. ('Rad' and 'Tubular' are right out.)

If the dialogue in a story is filled with British people talking like Americans, does it bother you? Or would it bother you more if they talked like muggles?


** Personally, I prefer the British over the Magical. Bloody Hell instead of Merlin isn't that jarring, because it's unfamiliar to me and it's not an intrinsic rule in my head, while 'mom' instead of 'mum' is jarring because it's a rule that Americans say that and not British people.

Although, on that subject, if people do write American characters, I'd prefer if they went full hog on the magical-slang too. I'd love some proper Magical American Slang, there's so much potential there - imagine if instead of "Sup, Dawg" you got stuff like "Sup, Krup." and the like. A little beatnik an example, I know, but it'd be great to see. :D

******** Yeah, it was one of those older generation comedy fics (Nonjon and Rorschach's Blot's era). Helga's Girdle became a big magical item in the story somehow - though I forget exactly how. I'll see if I can find the fic, but I'd recommend doing a What's that Fic thread since I have no idea whatsoever what it's called. :D

** I do prefer British spelling as far as it's possible. I even appreciate an attempt even if I do see American terminology here and there, because I realise how hard it is to know all the British English terminology if you're not British (I know; I'm not British myself). If there are any blatant American English words in the story, it destroys the "plausibility" of it, and I lose interest.

*** This is one of my biggest concerns when I'm writing. I try to keep the terminology as British as possible, especially when characters are speaking. I also try to keep it fairly generic as far as British terms are concerned, staying away from anything that's too Regional.

** British. I really, really hate all the Americanized fics where the author hasn't done the bare minimum of research on another culture.

No, we wouldn't go to a diner to have pancakes for breakfast. We'd go to a cafÃ© and probably have a full English. Medical debt isn't a thing over here and it hasn't been for decades. Even my grandmother doesn't remember a time before the NHS.

No one gets a sports scholarship to university. Your uni doesn't care that you're really good at football. Uni sports are a hobby, not some semi professional thing. See also legacy admissions and graduation. We don't have graduation ceremonies in the UK for secondary school. This is partly because different kids leave at different times. I left at 16 and went to an FE college to study childcare. My partner stayed on to do his A levels and left at 18.

Something else that bothers me is when every character is from London. The UK is a lot bigger than just one city. Have a character from Manchester or Leeds or Glasgow or /anywhere/ but London.

*** I had no idea about sports scholarships. It's such a huge industry here. Collegiate Athletics generates billions of dollars in Revenue every year for the schools. It's not something that Wizards would interact with, mind you, but it still pretty interesting. At least it's something to watch out for if I ever see Dean getting a footy scholarship.

I imagine that characters in Harry Potter are from all over. Cho is obviously Scottish as is McGonagall, and Finnegan is obviously Irish. Everyone else just has a received pronunciation British accent to some degree. The Weasleys are from Devon but they don't talk like the characters from Hot Fuzz.

In my own experience, I'm writing a story where Pansy Parkinson is from Blackpool. Reading Hagrid and Fleur's dialogue is already tedious enough, though, and I wouldn't even know how to write a Northern accent.

It would be cool to see characters that were actually from the Midlands and the North.

**** It really, really bugs me when I see stuff about sports scholarships. If Dean wanted to go into pro football, he'd go through the clubs and probably not bother with uni. I'm the wrong person to ask about it though, I'm not a sporty person.

In the films (we don't usually say movie and /definitely/ never movie theatre), Neville has a strong Leeds accent. Blackpool is a dump though. Once you get away from the promenade and the pleasure beach, it's properly rough.

Regional accents are really hard to write down, I agree. However having at least some characters reference living somewhere outside of London and the south is really important.

Although a crack fic where Harry talked like a surfer might be fun.

** As an American one of the things that throws me straight out of a story is when the author uses inches, feet, pounds etc instead of metric units of measure. Idk why this is the thing that drives me the battiest, but it does.

As a writer, I do worry about using Britishisms properly and not using catch phrases that are clearly American.

*** People in the UK do use inches, feet, and sometimes even pounds for measurement though. You talk about buying 'pints' of milk even though it's sold in litres, people state their heights in feet and inches, they mark distances in miles...

**** We use a weird hybrid of both systems depending on the situation.

I run or cycle in kilometres but drive in miles (and measure driving speed in miles per hour) and watch horses race over furlongs; my height I measure in both feet and inches and in metres/centimetres but all other things like furniture or cable length or the size of anything under a microscope I'd measure in metric; I'd weigh most things in kilograms except myself which is stone and pounds; and I'd buy milk or beer in pints but everything else in litres.

Gen Z have moved further to metric though, with measuring their own weight and height in metric in the main. The really big national difference is measuring driving distances and speeds in miles, most other things are either metric or offer both systems fairly easily. We spend a lot of time converting - eg I do a rough conversion of 0.6 miles to the km in my head on the fly pretty often, and 2.5 cm to the inch.

*** Do we see Wizards and Witches using the imperial or metric system in canon? I've never thought about it before now.

EDIT: Apparently Wizards use the imperial system.

**** Yeah the imperial system is used, but since that didn't come into effect in the UK until after the Statute of Secrecy, I like tossing in some really old obscure ones - pottle, firkin, kilderkin, scruple are my favourites. I think there used to be a pennyweight too, which I converted to knutweight/sickleweight/galleonweight - perfect for measuring out sweets!

*** To be fair, JKR uses feet and inches in her stories, as she felt it was more appropriate with the wizarding society. The metric system didn't become official in the UK until the 70s or 80s, and that's in the Muggle world. People still use feet and inches and miles in the UK; that's not an Americanism

*** While pounds are unlikely to be used for anything but burgers and steak, feet and inches are pretty common for heights, ounces for cooking, stone for people, miles for long distance and mph for speed (noone uses km) etc.

Some Imperial stuff is less common now, but back in the 90s when Harry Potter is set it was ubiquitous.

*** As a German, using metric in English just sounds wrong even if it is the native system to me. The bigger measurements are pretty easy to convert anyway (1 yard = 91 cm, so you can guess with a 1:1 ratio, 1 inch = 2,54 cm, 1 mile = 1.6 km, 2 pounds ~ 1kg). Only stones, combined heights rather than decimal and liquids are unintiutive IMO.

And despite having switched to metric, well I've been in London last summer and saw very little in metric.
