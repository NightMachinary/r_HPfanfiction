Does anyone have any good strategies for finding long lost fics or just new fics with a specific subject? Obviously there's always the main search, but aside from that the only way I know is to google it and just put site:[[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]]. But that's not perfect. Are there other ways to search for fics?


** Check the favorite stories of authors you like, and then look at the reviews of their story, and if it seems a reviewer has similar preferences to you, check their favorite stories too. You can sort by word count.

** This Chrome extension vastly helps in further filtering down FF.net searches: [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fanfic-filter/cfoadfegpeknjcnocdlfdfjkonfimhfj?hl=en[1]]] It also works in Opera if you have the Opera extension to accept Chrome plugins.

** I'll tell you my attempts, you judge their worth. After the obvious list by favs, check up to page 35: xD. Actually next, i tried limiting it by genre, which gave interesting results. Next was doing t by "follows", which gave even weirder results. In the end, I tried doing by Update date, completed only, 10k or more only. I found quite a few stories up to page 160 like this, that were "interesting". The saddest part is, if there was a minimum favs requirement, and maximum publish date, this would be a lot simpler. Anyway; to see if you align with my ideals: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The unforgiving minute.]] If you like, I'll share other low fav stories that screamed awesome to me at least.

** The FanFiction.net Communities can be a good way to find new stories.
