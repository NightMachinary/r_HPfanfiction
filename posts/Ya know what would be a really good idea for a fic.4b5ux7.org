I've wondered before how much a criminal could get away with in the Wizarding World. You have access to Polyjuice potion, wiping people's memories away, altering memories, body control, the list goes on. Now one could argue that you have just as much advanced magic that makes catching criminals easier, but I reckon that if you had a particularly smart criminal who planned their steps, then they would be able to get around that.

Imagine a fic where there's a criminal who manages to take advantage of all of that. Wouldn't that be great? Would certainly make a good mystery and is begging for twists and turns. Just another one you can add to the list of ideas that somehow haven't been written yet.


** I wonder if Felix Felicis gets used in police investigations: take a dose, and it'll lead you right to the culprit. To counteract that, the culprit would have to be taking it continually, which they wouldn't be able to because it's very expensive and very toxic over time.

*** Isn't it also incredibly complex and time consuming to brew plus dangerous if done wrong?

They would need a Potions Master working around the clock, can't imagine that being a terribly cheap prospect. We also know nothing about the shelf life or how large a batch is, if it takes 6 months to brew the single tiny bottle from HPB then mass production is impossible.

**** Well we know the shelf life is at least the time from the beginning of the school year when Harry won it, to the end of the school year when Harry gave the last drops to the DA members during the attack on the school. I don't feel like looking up the exact dates of when these happened (and knowing the fandom, the exact dates /are/ known), but that's probably about 8 to 9 months, right? I doubt it would be used in every investigation what with the 6 month brewing time and toxicity, but I could see it being used on extremely dead-end cases or cases where you want to catch a killer before they kill again.

**** That said, you get the sense that serious crime is relatively rare in HP. Outside of the, y'know, actual civil war you just don't get the sense that there are many murders and so on. A major crimes unit might have a little stash.

** Alternatively, a fic that abuses the expectation that criminals will be using magical means. Just a really clever Moriarty-type, that has a read on the MLE/Auror Department/plucky YA protagonist, that commits offences entirely the muggle way.

I may write that myself.

** A really good crime oneshot, which uses some of these ideas discussed here. I'd say more, but I fear spoiling this.

Took a little while to find, as in the DLP WBA. As such, it will require an account at least, and possibly 5 posts.

** linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville) isn't really about criminals in the sense you're describing, but it is a /very/ chilling and weird story about some of the ideas you're talking about---how some of the magical systems in Harry Potter could basically destroy the foundations of civil society as we understand it.
