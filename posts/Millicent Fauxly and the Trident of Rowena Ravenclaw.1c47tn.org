[[http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?searchall=millicent+faux]] Above is a link to the suptg archive. Over the past couple of months I have been writing a collaborative story set in the Harry Potter Universe. There are no canon characters used except references to the founders of the school. Give it a try, I'm so proud of what I've accomplished with my fellow Questers and to see Millicent Fauxly become a worthy alternative into JK Rowling's world. The way the story is made is that I, the creator of the story, give the readers choices and they roll virtual dice to follow the outcomes. We created Millicent from scratch and she has become my favorite and best literary character to date.


** I've been following this as it goes, seems really fun!
