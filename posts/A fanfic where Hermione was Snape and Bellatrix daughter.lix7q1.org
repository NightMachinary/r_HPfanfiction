:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction where Hermione was snape and Bellatrix daughter. She was being abused by her dad and brother. She was pregnant and Bellatrix sensed she was in trouble so did harry. Bellatrix and snape took harry and Hermione back to Voldemort who I think was Hermiones godfather. And Lucius helped Hermione get better. It was either draco/hermione or Harry/Hermione


** I know no fics like that but I couldn't resist responding.

â€‹

Why the hell would Bellatrix and Voldemort be nice to Harry when Harry hates them both and they hate him back...

Voldemort would never be a godfather. Hermione would probably go and spit on Snape and Ballatrix for being Death Eaters and try to escape. OR this is one of those stupid fics that involve an amazing cuddly bear Voldemort and a super accepting Hermione and Harry. THIS FIC PROBABLY SUCKS AND MAKES NO GODAMN SENSE.

Every time I see pregnancy being used as a plot device to create drama and angst, I become a little more Pro-Choice.
