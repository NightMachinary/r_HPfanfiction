Nor do I necessarily want to tell them. But I'm always amused when I see super-upvoted posts like, "I'd love to read a book where Harry isn't the BWL!" or something like that. There are always a ton of comments like, "bro, I would pay so much money to see that!" Like, have they never heard of fan fiction?? I guess not.

But for real that 20% is pure gold. I think I figured it out around the time cursed child came out and everyone was like "I've read 10,000 fanfics that are better than this" and I was like... aight imma head over to ff.net and see for myself. Got hooked when I read the snape chronicles.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

*** A harem fic if done properly can actually be a decent read Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is a good example of that, mind you if it is a harem fic There should be a great deal more to the story then just smut , a well written plot with plenty of drama, action and adventure with a bit of smut in The author finds it necessary Can make for a very good story.

**** Dodging prison and stealing witches unfortunately is not well done. I've written it out before and I can find my post again if you want. Cliff notes? It's weird that an adult Harry is getting several witches. And the way they become because of him - barf. Daphne who wants a fertility ritual at 13? Why not intellect boost or something? Why railroad her into being the matron and mother of the group at age freaking 13?

And the way he won over the "badass" daughter of Sirius. Aww yeah, adult Harry overpowers her and that makes her fall in love with him.

The harem aspect severely undermines character growth. Harems are tropes on tropes on tropes.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHBwk0quxs][Dumbledore and Grindlewald - The Greater Good]]

I would recommend watching "The Black Sisters" and "Neville Longbottom and the Black Witch" right after each other. They aren't by the same people, but the second one basically takes off right where the first stops. They are both great though.

Origins of the Heir, is ok, but has a very dissatisfying ending.

Dumbledore and Grindlewald is good. But I haven't watched that in a while, so I could be wrong.

I meant they, as in people outside our fandom, probably can't understand what's so great about a series of kids books about wizards going to wizard school. Sounds boring. You're telling me the main character gets into the same life or death situations around the end of school every year, for seven books, and you don't get bored reading that?

*** For a "getting started with fanfiction" list, I think you'd want to emphasise canon-compliant stories or at least close to canon characterisation, and being complete is pretty important.

Also, you probably don't want to shake up the pairings all that much for someone's first time; some new-to-fanfiction readers might be excited to find a Harmony fic, but Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Snape is probably best left for those with more experience.

The most important thing would be clear labeling, though. People who don't really know what's out there or what to expect need to know what's in a story before they can be expected to take the time for it.

Quite possibly. I read Harry Potter for the first time around 2002- 2003 in Bulgarian since I didn't know English yet. I don't think there is a lot of (if any) fanfiction in Bulgarian. I only discovered it around 2015 quite accidentally. I was watching a video on youtube about easter eggs in the puzzle game The Talos Principle and one of those eggs was a reference to The Methods of Rationality. Things escalated rather quickly after that.

Anyway, my point is some people started reading Harry Potter as children/ teenagers in their first languages and only later discovered the ton of fan fiction that is available for English speakers.

** A couple of things to consider:

1. The original HP generation is pushing 30+ now. First book came out in 97 and was aimed at ages 8-16 which means that currently that group would be 31-39 years of age now (I am a member!)

2. While Reddit certainly attracts people of all ages the largest user age bracket for Reddit by a large margin is the 18-29 group, which is obviously younger than the original HP crowd.

3. Finally, Harry Potter Fan Fiction was arguably unknown by the average HP fan early on, really only coming into its own in the mid to late 2000's, but as that first group "aged out" to some degree, activity slid as many moved into other phases in their life and knowledge of the world of fan fics as it pertains to Harry Potter slid with it.

I bring up these points because we have to remember that there are several new generations since the original generation enjoying the world of Harry Potter. But they, like the original generation early on, may not have stumbled across fan fiction yet or before. This is likely especially true on Reddit communities since the ages skew younger. And the slide of HP fan fiction somewhat as one group ages out, has not been countered yet necessarily by new generations aging in and starting to write their own fan fictions.

So ignorance is to be expected until the wave pattern or cycle comes back around.

They are younglings.

Give them time.

HP fanfic was a bit revolutionary and definitely carried by the group that you mentioned, the now 30s - 40s. However, I think teens today grew up with the books. I know that my sister and her friends (think high school tiktok kids) all read the books as kids but might have been too young at that age to really get into fan stuff? They don't grow up with the books the same way we did since they're all out and can be read in a row. So they read them in elementary/middle school, and they encounter fan things like the subreddit as they're getting older. But I think they're more aware of things like fanfiction in general because its part of pop culture, where as a lot of adults just never encountered it when they were younger.

** Funnily enough, I myself have never read the HP books or watched further than the first movie. But I do know /E-ver-y-thing/ about its story because I am SUCH an avid fanfic reader. I occasionally 'try out' new or different fandoms containing quality writing without having any pre-attained knowledge regarding anything about the canon story or characters existing within it. That is what I did here. I had limited knowledge, true, but not nearly enough understanding to not be pleasantly confused through my first half-dozen fanfics here.

(And, well... HP is /fairly/ popular, so there /is/ a large pool of quality fish - I mean, stories - for me to choose from, so that was bound to draw me in quicker. It was an inevitability, really.)

I like to see what I can glean from a story that is presented on a platform upon which one is quite expected to already have /some/ idea as to what is being referenced and referred to. It is as much an intellectual challenge (to see how fast I can learn what is and what is not canon material, and how fast I can pick up on "what-the-heck-is-happening" in a brand-new world with new names, lingo, and inside jokes) as it is a gauge for how well and how thoroughly different authors will present well-known (to them) characters and scenes, as well as it is a mere temporary release from pure undiluted boredom.

What is even funnier is that I wouldn't even call myself a fan of the HP story itself; I am only really a fan of how authors have so much sand in this box to play around with inside of the realm of the HP /world/ and to such an enormous extent. What if... What if... Oh! And What If ....

*I Live for Stories and Story Ideas.*

So... it's a bit... /incomprehensible/ to me... that normal fans of the book/movie series... would be so darn oblivious. Actually incomprehensible.

I read on another thread that there are people who resurfaced from the realm of fanfic long enough to re-read the HP books, and quickly came to the conclusion that the canon material reads like a bad fanfic. So now I'm not even halfway curious enough to even look at them!

I mean, that is objective, and it's objectively wrong. By definition fanfiction is a fan's writing of an original work set in that work's universe. Harry Potter, being an original work, is objectively not fanfic.

Unless you meant to say it's /as poorly written/ as bad fanfic, in which case that can also be objectively proven or disproven by comparing poorly written fanfic to the original work and seeing how they compare in terms of writing quality.

That being said, the original Harry Potter book series is a wild ride.

*** I've done that with Naruto. Never seen a single frame of canon, but have pieced together a reasonable idea, at least as far as the invasion of Konoha at the chuunin exams.

*** Hey, putting HP aside. I too have that really high appreciation for and maybe addiction to stories. Terrible movies, badly written books, and poorly programmed games, I have gone through them all as long as I can divine an interesting tale from them. My measure of a good story doesn't involve plot holes or worldbuilding though. I hate complex, rigid and perfect worlds with no substance. I hate tightly woven stories with no purpose. When ever I read a good story, its a direct window to the author's soul. His/her thoughts, desires, wants and feelings laid bare for all to see and experience.

The reason I said all that is because as I read your "story", I saw something that looked like my own mind or heart or whatever. So just wanted to see if you get a similar feeling or not.

**** */Kindred Spirit!/* 0~0 Someone /Understands~!/ And has expressed it in better words than my own, as well! "... divine an interesting tale ..." Precisely!

For me, Plotholes are like gaping archways between what we have been explicitely exposed to (in canon) and a hidden realm of /Opportunity/. Still a part of the world, but unexplored territory. It begs my consideration. "What If...." I feel like an adventurer mapping (or attempting to map) out a previously uncharted course in my daydreaming of *"Story-Land"; Sector Insert-Fandom-Name-Here*.

I am like a child in a sandbox. It is a sandbox with someone else's name to it, but open to public perusal. I pay a bit of money for unlimited access. And then, once in, there are few to no boundaries. The sky is the limit to what my imagination can, as you say, 'divine'. The existing 'story' surrounding this sandbox is fine as it is. But the /world/ has many toys for my imagination to poke, prod, and play with, and is, therefore, much more entrancing to me than the original story it was constructed for. And, with the existence of fanfiction, I get to wander about and peruse other peoples' tweaks and inventive creations. Like some kind of Literature-based crafting fair!

Yeesh... do I even make sense?

I am quite possibly addicted to Stories. =P

EDIT: I am also quite possibly something like a covert pirate, because I can skip paying my entrance fee to other worlds by jumping straight into the 'Crafting' Area of fanfic for foreign (i.e. different) fandoms.

**** Naruto; My Hero Academia; Fruits Basket*; Harry Potter; Hobbit; Avatar: Last Airbender; Danny Phantom; Rise of the Guardians; Big Hero 6; Supernatural; Stargate SG-1; and Merlin, would be my top recs (not in order of preferance or quality).

*Quality Disclaimer: I haven't really found any GREAT (as in 'well written AND engaging') Fruits Basket fanfic. But the fanfic I did read prior to testing out the (then early-2000s) anime gave me a great idea of what the manga/anime is all about, which was partially the point. I did abandon that fandom for the anime mainly because its core ideas were cool but the writing quality of most fics... did not satisfy me. At all.

You will notice that most of these titles are top-tier popular fandoms, which is what drew me to trying them out in the first place. A bigger pool to go fishin' in means a larger chance of catching good eatin'! That said, I will grant an honorary mention to one (astronomically) small game fandom on FF.net: Cinderella Phenomenon. There is a long-fic (the only one there, at present) which I read on recommendation. The writing is... heh, /'Phenomenal'/... and I had a great time going through it and sifting out what was simply the bones of 'This Story' and figuring out what the core canon story was primarily about (aside from clearly being an otome romance). Since there are not enough fictions in that fandom to compare and more accurately figure out what is a canon depiction and what is not, however, I did quickly end up trying out the game.

TvTropes Fanfic Recs are a great place to start delving, once you have picked a fandom - instead of blindly choosing random one-shots to test the waters (I highly Do Not Recommend that method... if one can even call it a method). You could also sort by number of favorites/kudos to see what the top 3/5/19 are about. In my experience, though, For Want of a Nail AUs are great for figuring out character dynamics and Peggy Sue fics are the best for learning canon. Ship-fics can be fun but are extremely unreliable character gauges. They are, IMO, way more fun to indulge in /after/ one has sorted out who everyone is and what each person's place in the world is. Otherwise it's confusing. But hey: do what you want!
