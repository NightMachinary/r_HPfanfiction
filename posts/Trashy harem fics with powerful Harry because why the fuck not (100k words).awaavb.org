*** My god, that one was terrible. I had no idea what I was getting into when I started, and by the time I got to where it was too much I had gotten too far to stop. I was honestly baffled at how the author tried to rationalize why having Harry hate Muslims, along everyone and everything from the Middle East, was totally okay. He was legitimately ranting at the end of every chapter over the 'hate' he was getting.

**** It was a breathe of fresh air, to be honest.

Personally I'm dead tired of reading about the same hyper-empathetic, super pro-equality main character. I can only take so many played out "Harry and Co. DUNK on bigots with FACTS and LOGIC" (not really) before I want to gouge my eyes out.

It's literally in every story. Except for the ones where he's "dark" or some shit, and even there it's usually acknowledged that he's just a "bigot" because he's "evil" for the sake of it, or because he's just not "educated" enough: /dark Harry meets Hermione, who shatters his bigoted brain!/ Ugh.

I've yet to read a story where it's acknowledged that no, everyone is not equal on every metric, stories that apply the same logic of there being rational reasons to dislike a group of people (KKK for example) equally to other groups (Islam) based on a person's social preferences.

Having characters that break that mold is a good thing, even if you happen to disagree with that worldview.

****** Ironically the gods in Discordant Note are real, Harry has conversations with them and even makes his own god! Talk about high magic lol, Harry even thinks in the story that he once thought Westeros was low magic but it was actually high because the gods absorb all the magic into themselves and only give out a portion to their followers. It's actually quite interesting. Though I'm still not a fan of the previous story.

****** How? KKK represents ignorance, as does Islam. The only difference is that KKK shows an ignorance and bigotry towards one outside race (blacks), while Islam is misogynistic, authoritarian, and the people practicing it outside the US are just as racist towards the out-group as any KKK member.

Having actually worked with Muslims from the middle East, eastern Europe, and India, they may not all be extremists and condone terrorism or sharia (and a lot do, especially that last bit) but a lot are very racist, especially towards blacks.

The fact that you think the KKK is somehow on a different level than Islam - when terrorist Islamic sects have killed and brutalized infinitely more people than the KKK in the last hundred years x1000, is just amazing to me.

​

1) KKK , the way you describe, is just a bunch of good people showings "ignorance" towards just one race. WEll, no...they are actually whitw supremacists, so they do look down on other races like jews for example. And, your comment gives me the impression you do not believe they are violent, when in fact they are responsible for lynching of many black folks in the south. Does this seem small to you? Well, that just goes on to show your standards are very different than mine, to say the least.

​

2) Islam- although you make a "concession" saying that not a lot of them are extremists, you go on saying they are mostly racists and etc,- REALLY? do you realize that you are not speaking about just one group of people? It is like saying all christians are the same when they are not.

​

You met a lot of muslims? So did I. I met highly educated individuals; feminists; single folks that worked in doner shops...a lot of them. Including black ones. Including mixed heritage couples.

I guess racist people you will find everywhere; you will find mysoginists everywhere too. Not only muslims. But christians...hindus...man, go and check this amazing documentary about a buddhist leader that preached racial extremination- it gies to show that human people, regardless of their religion, are capable of twisting any given Belief to cater to their own Bias.

​

And no, if I amaze you by politelly telling you that comparing KKK to Islam FAVORABLY to KKK is very incacurate, then you really should go have some tea with the racist-bigot-SJW exterminator-admitelly sad person author of HArry Potter´s Mein Kampf !!!

First of all, obviously I'm not saying the KKK was never violent. Obviously they did lynchigs.

However, the extent and number of these lynchings has been greatly exaggerated, and the fact that "lynching" was a form of vigilante justice that also affected whites is downplayed;

Estimates are that about [[https://www.famous-trials.com/sheriffshipp/1084-lynchingsyear][4,000 people were lynched between the late 1700s and 1965, 30% of whom were white.]]

However, [[https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30][Islam is responsible for over 34,000 terrorist attacks globally in just several decades.]]

Obviously, I don't support vigilante justice, and any death outside the judicial system is a death too many. I'm just trying to lend some perspective here.

*86 Innocents were murdered in the name of Islam in the past 3 days alone, vs. 70 black lynchings in the past 85 years.*

But keep saying how I'm a "KKK minimizer" and now I'm "unfairly" characterizing Islam.

I know white American liberals don't like hearing this, but most of the world outside the west is racist. I was born outside of the US, I lived in Asia, East Europe, and worked and interacted with dozens of non-American Muslims. Yes, they are racist. Obviously not all, but the vast majority.

And maybe I have the wrong impression, but the majority of Muslim are extremists by the perspective of America, as even Indian and Asian Muslims have strong support for Sharia and all it entails - even supporting terrorism - even if they themselves are not terrorists or violent themselves. There's been several Pew research studies on this. American Muslims are unique in that they have the lowest support for what Muslims abroad generally agree with due to integration.

Yes, the Muslims in America are the highest educated ones, who come to study from already more liberal households. Citing your insulated college experience is laughable. It's the equivalent of going to North Korea and visiting the fake prop cities, and coming back with the impression that NK is a free and prosperous country.

It's not an accurate representation of the world at large, there's a number of selective pressures and factors that account for who gets into and attends what college.

********* How many people are/were a part of the KKK, how many are a part of Islam. The KKK has ~5000 members today, Islam has About 1.8 billion members. Comparing their violent attacks is nonsense. Was their religion the cause of their violence? I doubt it, as the Koran is pretty pasifistic. It really does not matter where you go you will find racist people, and I am not sure that the religion of certain people has an impact on that. I'd argue the amount of education and values one has received are more important than their religion.

********** ]:No, comparing KKK to Islam is ridiculous because almost nobody is in the KKK. It's not 5,000, even [[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2017-08-14/the-kkk-is-still-based-in-22-states-in-the-us-in-2017][the largest estimates put it at 3,000, and that's including "unaffiliated people who identity with the ideology"]], which could just mean racist, but nonviolent Hicks: and this is with the admition that the largest KKK "chapter" has only 50-100 members, and the vast majority have less than 25. Furthermore, they haven't been active in any violent activities for many decades now. They have literally zero members in over half of US states.

Talking about the KKK in modern times like they're a real threat worse than Islam is ludicrous. The KKK is a complete nonentity.

And if you want to talk per capita honestly, then let's see how many people per capita are in the KKK - with sympathies to "their ideals"- compared to how many people are in extremist Islam groups, *with sympathies to their ideals*.

Because of that's the metric we're going with, and we're just going to excuse the tens of thousands of murders in the past decade with "sOcIoEcOnOmIc FaCtOrS", then let me break it to you buddy, [[http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-10/][the picture doesn't look good:]]: only 33% of Muslims in Bangladesh, a country of 150 million people, said that suicide bombings are never justifiable to defend islam. 14% think it can be justified often to defend islam.

Furthermore, separating Islam from socioeconomic factors - as if religion isn't an integral part of a given society and is completely interchangeable - is itself fallacious.

It's not even the most extreme region, and let me tell you, there's a lot of fucked up, religiously motivated shit that a *majority* of Muslims believe Globally that doesn't extend to terrorism, [[http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/16/extremism-concerns-growing-in-west-and-predominantly-muslim-countries/][with general Muslim extremism growing even outside of the middle East:]]

It's more like 0.0005% of Americans are in or sympathetic to the ideology of the KKK, whereas it's more like 40% of Muslims are extremist to some degree.

I'm serious, look into all the Pew research data - I'm too short on time to find the data where they polled global Muslim countries with large populations for their opinions, and found that large percentages agree with what any reasonable person would say is "extremist", like the mysoginist aspects of Sharia.

Find me something else tying all these people together that isn't Islam. And, by the way, the Quran [[https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx][isn't pacifistic.]].

On the "verses of peace", [[https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/quran-peaceful.aspx][there is this to say, with example verses:]]

#+begin_quote
  While there are some verses in the Quran (and episodes from Muhammad's life) that would appear to promote tolerance and peace, they are usually mitigated by circumstances and context.  Closer examination proves less convenient to the simplistic interpretation furnished by apologists - which usually tells us more about what some Muslims wish were there rather than what actually is.

  Coexistence as equals was something that Muhammad promoted only when he did not have the power to conquer.  In the full context of the Quran, 'peace' means submission, and 'tolerance of other religions' means not killing those members who agree to live in a subjugated status to Islamic rule.
#+end_quote

People who think there isn't any significant connection between Islam, terror, and extremism have a fundemental problem with pattern recognition. Sure, #notall, but holy shit if it's not many, and I'll be damned if it isn't a problem.

***** This is true, but a strong personality does not a good story make. There are many fics I know of with single characters with terrible personalities and excellent plot and vice versa. The reason Rune Stone Path being a good fic is such a noteworthy accomplisent is that it isn't just a harem fic, but one that takes many of the tropes of that particular type of fic and does something interesting, original, and most importantly good with them, without diminishing them in any way. It is the consummate harem fix, and it is also somehow good despite that.

It should also be noted that whether it is 3 or 3 million, having more than two people in a pairing increases the complexity of a relationship just exponentially. Which makes it correspondingly more difficult to write it well and make it convincing, which is a critical part of any story, particularly one in a fantasy setting. So being limited to less than "5+" girl's really doesn't matter that much, it's still complicated as hell to do right and is deserving of commendation regardless.

****** Ah, for me there needs to be at least some quality to both characters and the plot. So many harem fics reduce the girls to "Insert subject here" + house + family name. And fics that avoid that are leagues ahead of the rest.

​

I use 5 as a max simply because anything more and it usually takes the leap from wish fulfilment to wish fulfilment taken to the max. And as I said, feasible. Going over fics where Harry is with 30 girls, you just don't get to see anything of note. Though, that probably has more to do with those fics usually devolving/evolving into fuckfest fics.

  Sighing visibly, the girl stepped forward, into the rapidly quieting Great Hall, and walked to Harry's side. For one second, she looked at him, him looking up her standing for with a look that was both curious and filled with trepidation.

**** The only thing worse than seeing such amateur writing and fan service (eg hot slaves) is when the main character is too much of a wimp/goodboy to do anything with them. I've only skimmed the first chapter, though, but this applies to other fics.

Like, why even bother writing in a plot where a hot girl is "yours to command" when the main character is a goody-two-shoes that will never give a command in his life? Is it a way for the author to somehow rationalize writing in essentially slavery? It baffles me.

******* You were complaining about fantasies where the MC gets a harem of super hot chicks willing to do anything, but the MC being a pussy and not asking for anything.

That is something that frequently happens in harem animes, the guys gets multiple girls, who overtly show sexual interest, and he ignores them.

In some shows I don't mind, like ones where the guy is way older and sees them as his kids. There also some where the guy actually returns the interest (like Trinity 7) those can be pretty great.

I tend to like trashy anime, so I can be fairly knowledgeable on this subject. My preferred genre of trash is isekai though, not harem/romance, there is some overlap though.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  At the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament Harry sees his chance to strike down his enemies - and takes it. Here is a Harry who knows how to think and reason. Really Bash!AD, EWE, Clueful!HP Eventual HP/HG/DG/FD NL/HA/SB and others. Unapologetically!AU.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

** I've been working on a fic like this (very broadly, at least; it's an SoL fic where Voldemort actually died at Godric's Hollow where Harry is basically Uesugi Fuutarou), but that's a ways off, yet.
