Are there any fics with two or more completely different systems of magic? It could be crossovers with two distinct magical systems (not the crossovers where the different magical systems are integrated together), AU fics with many different systems of magic or even fics where the MC goes into another universe with a different magical system.


** Linkffn(Fate's gamble) this mostly fits. Harry is the only one with both magic systems.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

*** How much knowledge of the nasuverse is needed to get into this fic? I have not yet seen the fate series because I don't know where to start.

**** Eh just start with zero, then ubw, the Hf movies. It helps, ngl. I have not played tsukehime or malty blood and was able to get buy. (Most characters are not from fate but from other games.) I would give it a read and if you don't understand stop. (I found google imaging there characters helped when reading).
