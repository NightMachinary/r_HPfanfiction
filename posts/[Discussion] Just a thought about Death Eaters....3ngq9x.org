Seeing how easily a death eater (yes, Snape) could be a spy and even be a high level occlumens, wouldn't it be really sensible for Voldemort to have all death eaters make an Unbreakable Vow?


** From what we have see unbreakable vows seems to be extremely rare and possibly dangerous. Despite what some fanfictions claim it's not a routine contract signature but an extreme measure. Remember Mr Weasley reaction to what the twins tried to do: "He went mental, only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum"

I doubt that even the most devout Death Eater would do it, even for the Dark Lord. For maybe it has lasting consequences on your health/psyche/soul. Also DE are all about loyalty and proving it, the only thing Voldemort would achieve by imposing it would be to show that he trust no one and that none is safe from his paranoia. Remember that Voldemort is all about PR and personal cult. The best dictator is the one love by his base.

It could be used to humiliate someone, sure. But as a security measure it's pointless, look at what he did with Wormtail and his magic hand: basically a PR move showing that he rewards loyalty.

*** Well. Pettigrew's hand choked him to death as soon as he showed the slightest sign of disloyalty. So you can argue the hand is a sort of unbreakable vow of loyalty.

**** But Wormy didn't know that (even if it was expected). My point was not that Voldemort was not assuring loyalty through magic, but that the unbreakable vow would have done way more harm than good (if any). By acting like he did with Pettigrew he send the message to all the Death Eater that even Wormtail, the lowest of them, was rewarded for his loyalty and somewhat trusted by him. An unbreakable vow would have send the opposite: "chop off your hand and get a deadly leash".

**** I know the Rowling probably intended for that scene to convey that Pettigrew's disloyalty triggered the silver hand to kill him for it, but when I read it, I interpreted it as it being the life-debt in action.

Here was Peter, trying to /directly/ kill Harry, who he owed a life debt to, and the life-debt turned Peter's hand against him for it.

***** I never thought about it like that. That's a really good alternative explanation!

** From what we've seen of it, the Unbreakable Vow involves a specific purpose with a finite time requirement. It also may require a lot of the promisee; Narcissa was willing to do anything for Snape to protect Draco, but her wording was sufficiently generalized that you'd think she was protecting herself by it. Perhaps a Vow that traps the promisor would reflect the punishment onto the promisee.

All of this is conjecture, but what we do know is that the Vow is sealed by the third party- someone trusted by both of the others to judge whether the Vow has been violated or fulfilled. Voldemort trusts NO ONE. This is the same reason he won't use a Fidelius Charm.

*** Hmm, makes sense he wouldn't trust anyone. But if it would require something of the promisee, it wouldn't be a problem, he'd get someone else to be the promisee, right? And also, he could be the one judging.

** Yep, and not just to willing Death Eaters. Instead of killing, force every wizard (except the mudbloods, of course) to join him. How many people are going to defy him at threat of death via torture? He would be unstoppable.

The OPness of the Vow is why I like to pretend that it doesn't exist.

** The Unbreakable Vow adds noting to the canon story, and only wrecks the world building and suspension of disbelief. It can add to a story, but it's not easy to make it work.

** Unbreakable Vows are binding one's own magic to potentially work against them instead of helping them as it always does; basically the wizarding equivalent of installing a mini-bomb somewhere in your body that cannot be detected and explodes if you do /something/ out of line. Not a common thing and not really anything /anyone/ would agree to on purpose unless they were desperate.

Heck, even if you ignore the possibility of it possibly having a negative effect on one's body even without the whole “explodes and kills you” bit, and you have to admit that there is the possibility of it affecting one's magic negatively because it basically binds some of it to do /something/ that it was neither supposed to nor wants to do, having to make an Unbreakable Vow to prove one's loyalty is humiliating and degrading and I see pretty much every single Death Eater (outside of Bellatrix and others close to as fanatical as she is, and /their/ loyalty was never really in question) objecting very strongly on it and preferring to get crucioed rather than make one, not because they aren't loyal enough (or so they'd claim) but because of the degradation and humiliation and possibly the side-effects that they might know about but we don't. And I really doubt someone unwilling to make an Unbreakable Vow would even be able to make one; someone unknowing of it yet willing, sure, but not someone knowing and unwilling.

It's one of those things, just like veritaserum, that seems like a perfect solution to something in the series until you stop and actually think about it in-depth, which is when you discover that no, not really, it isn't and thought it has its uses ... maybe, it can't be used to solve everything. And before you ask, the problem with veritaserum is that it doesn't render you only capable of speaking the truth but instead makes it impossible for you to try to lie which means that if what you perceive as truth isn't actually true it won't stop you from speaking it out, and the other problem with veritaserum is it being an invasion of privacy that most people wouldn't agree to not because they “have something to hide” but rather because it's an invasion of privacy and a humiliating one at that and they have their pride.
