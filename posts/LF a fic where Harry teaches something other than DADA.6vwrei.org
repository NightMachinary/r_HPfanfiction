Whether it is potions, transfiguration, or even history of magic. To be honest, I'd even accept a fic where Harry does Filch's job. It can even be a made up class.


** linkffn(0-800-Rent-a-Hero by brainthief) has a crosstime Harry teaching Divination.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

**** Mostly she and the other Order members treat him like a deserter for not helping them solve their Riddle. Harry's crash course in Divination reveals practical uses for the discipline that Trelawney didn't know and/or never covered -- like 'attuning' a crystal ball in order to make it work. It's hard to scoff at it when he can prove it's useful.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** There's linkffn(how harry turned hogwarts around), but it's more of a fix-it fic with not much conflict (though there is a Death Eater battle finale). He fills in for DADA then teaches potions. Or, rather, he's hired for potions for the next school year in early spring, then fills in for DADA for the remainder of that school year.

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.
