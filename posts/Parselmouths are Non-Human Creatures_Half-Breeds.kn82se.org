I'm looking for fics where Harry is a snakey non-human and his Parseltongue comes from that side of him. For example, fics like /Apex Predators/ linkao3(6080178) where Parselmouths are a different breed of human with different brain chemistry, and as Harry goes through puberty his development diverges from the norm. Or /Eggs/ linkao3(21607906) where Parseltongue is spoken by several non-human species that can magically breed with humans, and something triggers Harry's metamorphosis into that ancestor species. It doesn't matter where it comes from, I just want snake!Harry.


** linkao3(27949034) - Parselmouths have snake instincts and some minor physical changes. He isn't completely non-human, but humans can't swallow raw eggs and spit out the empty shells.

  Being a Parselmouth came with the inherent predisposition to understand snake behaviours and imitate them. It was relieving Harry wasn't going to kill anyone with venom, nor petrify them with his gaze. But also, somewhat frustrating as it was all completely useless. None of the skills that came with being a Parselmouth would help Harry survive Voldemort. In might, in fact, have the opposite effect. For all Riddle's fury that Harry was the cause of his elder self's defeat, he was fascinated by the fact Harry was also a Parselmouth. He had grabbed Harry's face, turning him side to side looking bemusedly enraptured by Harry's threat display. “At your age, I was imitating much more vicious snakes than this, Harry.” That may have been all well and good, but Harry didn't feel very vicious. He felt very threatened and in over his head.

  Puberty means all sorts of changes for a boy--even more, Harry discovers, when being a Parselmouth means more than just having a dark talent.Abandoned.

  Sirius was dead and it was at least half Harry's fault. He'd once again been abandoned at Privet Drive, but he didn't even care this time. He deserved worse than that.Unfortunately, right in the middle of his months-long sulk, something impossible happens that changes everything.What the hell's a male, mammalian virgin supposed to think after laying a pair of eggs?Well, if that male, mammalian virgin happens to be an orphan desperate for love, acceptance, and family, the course of action is pretty obvious.ANYTHING IT TAKES TO PROTECT THEM....A story of family, love, growing up, and all the things you never notice when you can't see past the blinding Light to the shadows lurking between you and the Dark.
