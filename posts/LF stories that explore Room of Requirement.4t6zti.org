I always wondered, why seemingly noone wants to look into the nature of RoR. Are there any fics that do that?

For example, in my headcanon, RoR (located right in front of entrance to Gryffindor tower) used to be the quarters of the first headmaster, Godrick Gryffindor. It's actually keyed in to all of the Hogwarts wards and in addition to being literally TARDIS, allows to completely control the castle, but for whatever reason it was abandoned and soon forgotten. Elves rediscovered it a couple of centuries later and started using it to store lost and broken items. Neither elves not students have access to the most advanced of room's abilities, because they are not a headmaster. Ironically, the only time actual headmaster visited the room, he was looking for a chamber pot.


** The Arithmancer features the Room quite heavily, the author of the fic is actually on this subreddit, he's a pretty nice guy. This is also one of the fics I will be audioreading.

** In linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall), the Room of Requirement was Gryffindor and Ravenclaw's response to Slytherin boasting about his Secret Chamber. linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) does something similar, but the Room is Gryffindor's secret chamber alone.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, miraculously still alive. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** I cam here to recommend the merging. I just finished it (up to where it is anyway) a couple days ago. I hate when I do this to myself, I read this amazing fic that I get invested in, that I know is incomplete and hasn't been updated in forever and then I get really sad thinking I may never see the conclusion. :'(

** It's been a long time since I read this. I recall it mostly taking place in the RoR, and I think talks a little bit about it. But the main focus is the characters, not the RoR nature.

** There are two really good Draco/Harry fics that have an interesting spin on the RoR.

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy]] Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR in the hours just after the last battle. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. Towards the end, both boys were questioning if the other was "real" or if they were just provided by the room like everything else. It was a very unusual and great plot device. Linkao3(852061)

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/319257/chapters/513333][At Your Service]] the DA starts up again during 8th year because there's a mystery with students disappearing. The RoR is heavily involved with this fic in a really cool way but to explain would spoil it. Definitely a great read though. Linkao3(513333)

** The corridor the door is in is actually in the Seventh Floor Corridor which is attached to the Fat Lady's Picture Corridor which is where the entrance to the Gryffindor's Common Room is. There are no wards in canon and why would the headmaster of the school not use the headmaster's office in the Headmaster's Tower which holds the office and the Headmaster's Residence?

Edit: Also, no TA. RDIS works.

Your headcanon is interesting but can be refuted with a little research.
