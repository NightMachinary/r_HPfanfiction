** Honestly, if they are going to do that, they will be digging their own graves. It would be the real world's equivalent of something like a marriage law. If people can't get their Netflix and other similar dopes, you will get an uprising that's going to put the fuss about Obamacare completely to shame.

Our city just decided to implement a municipal broadband, despite heavy lobbying from the telecoms. Many other good alternatives, such as the Google Fiber, are just waiting for the big telecoms to raise prices.

*** Exactly. Almost every scare tactic of this debate is utterly asinine and would likely severely cripple if not kill the ISP provider. Look at how drastically cable TV has changed in the last decade with streaming and other alternatives available.

Alienating a customer base is more likely to lead to other alternatives arising than anything else. Honestly, internet service has been fairly stagnant for the last decade or so and could probably use a kick in the pants in the innovation department anyway.

I feel like what is likely going to happen is more akin to it will be much harder to torrent and illegally download things from the more widely known areas and the rest of the internet will remain exactly the same.

**** Alienating a customer base means nothing when you have a monopoly/colluding oligopoly, going without is not a realistic option and the barrier to entry for new competitors is astronomical. The ISPs have /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/][done this shit before]]/ and it was the FCC who slapped them down.

***** Sure it does. Alienating the customer base bankrupted Standard Oil. Ease of access to things like Amazon effectively murdered Dinosaur companies like K-Mart that refused to adapt to the internet age.

Hell, Sears was essentially Amazon sixty years ago. They're pretty much defunct now. Change is good is the business world. You would rather a company beholden to consumers than the federal government. Anything that possibly forces them to compete with each other is a good thing.

And as I said in a previous comment, what is going to happen here is going to be a radical shift in how ISPs deal with content PRODUCERS and not content CONSUMERS. People like Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, ESPN all have far more to worry about than your average consumer.

I have also lived in multiple major metropolitan areas of the United States and never have I only had one option for an internet service provider. You can bet if one starts charging astronomical fees to access anything, the other wont purely to gain that many more customers.

****** Your key word is metropolitan.

Many cities and towns don't have that luxury and the ISPs know that. By engineering (lobbying) the rules to benefit the entrenched ISPs it's already a shit show for the majority of rural areas and small city/town areas.

So sure. The metro areas won't be in lock step for raising prices but you can bet the monopolies and oligarchies will.

**** On the other hand, I expect ISPs to extract significant concessions from content providers such as Netflix. You may have noticed the Big Techs (Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) have been very quiet about this issue so far. I think this net neutrality change will negatively impact their competitions.

***** I think people that assume the ISP is going to go 'Hey you're paying 80$ a month for Internet. If you want Reddit to load it will be 100$' are looking at it utterly backwards.

The ISP is going to say, "Hey ESPN, you have X Million views on our internet in X location. Pay us X or we're going to try to shift those views to NBCsports.com instead' which will effectively hurt ESPN's advertising revenue. They can get way more money from content providers than content consumers. Providers are more likely to pay, consumers more likely to look elsewhere.

The onus will be on providers beign able to ensure their content gets to their consumers and as such they can keep bringing in their advertising dollars, and not on consumers being able to get to content.

****** I am sure that will happen. It is already alleged to have happened when Netflix and Comcast were negotiating something or other (it was a couple of years ago) - Comcast slowed down the speed of Netflix and Netflix eventually caved to their demands. However, I am equally sure that a) any increased cost from such (legal) extortion will be passed along to the consumer and b) ISPs will directly take measures to prevent consumers from accessing content if they think it benefits them.

Remember, these are very large companies. They have interests in various news outlets, cable services, streaming services, etc. - I'm sure we don't know the half of it. There are also their advertisers to consider as they bring in quite a lot of money for these companies. What is to stop them from slowing down or preventing altogether free traffic to those sites that are in competition with them or their interests?

And just generally speaking, don't you think that these corporations might want to prevent people from being able to access information or being able to use the internet as a platform for action that could go against their broader interests? For example, if people want to, say, use it to organize and try to get more progressive politicians elected in order to change the system which is currently incredibly favourable towards corporations? These changes would allow them to block people from doing that.

The possibilities for abuse are really quite endless. And although I didn't discuss it, I see this being used very abusively in the area of copyright. I am not American (I am Canadian, so this will significantly impact me anyway), but in my country these companies are very aggressive concerning copyright and constantly lobby for draconian copyright rules. They would kill for something like this. I don't see American telecommunications corporations being any better.

**** There are many markets (my own, e.g.) in the U.S. where there is only one ISP providing broadband service and any competition arguments fall flat. There's no way in for competitor technologies. Monopolies can do whatever they want to screw the consumer and we have no choice but to bend over and take it.

** I'm sure reddit would count as a single entity for the purposes of billing.

Additionally, they're not likely to completely prevent you from viewing sites- rather have "fast lanes" for sites you subcribe to for "premium" speed or whatever- or really it could take any form- they could just say nothing and make all sites but theirs (and "partners" that pay a premium) slower.

But completely preventing you accessing sites won't likely happen, the outrage from that would be far too severe. They're evil and greedy, not stupid.

And as that's likely the case.. Honestly, as horrible as it would be, fanfiction sites probably would be the least effected, it's just text, you might have to wait a second or two more for it to load.

** Wonder how this could apply to a fanfic.

bandwidth : every wizard is a dimensional tap to a dimension of pure magic energy. the amount of energy per unit of time that you can channel is your bandwidth.

throttling : every wizard is born with a gift , a type of magic they are good at. in reality they aren't 'good' at it, they just have unthrottled bandwidth on this type of magic. everything else is more diffcult for them to use.

internet service provider : a wand or other focus that lets you use your magic

paid services : you can perform a ritual to temporarily unthrottle a specific type of magic. the preparation for this ritual takes either time to prepare the components or more commonly money to buy them. they are used up in the ritual. the duration of the ritual is proportional to how much you paid for it in either effort or expenses.

hell now that I think of it you could use a lot of Information Technology concepts in a fanfic and as long as you don't give up the source nobody would even realize what you're drawing inspiration from. everything above seems pretty reasonable , could even be canon and we wouldn't know.

This is not going to be about consumers. It will be about how providers deal with content producers than with their customers.

Honestly people should be way more concerned about the massive driver and truck shortages in the US and how the new Electronic Logging systems going into affect are going to harm them than this issue. Because that's going to have a far more noticeable affect on the pocketbook than this.

** Respectfully,

Unpopular opinion follows.

I have a hard time seeing the point of all this campaigning going on right now.

The vote is already bought and paid for with campaign contributions and other “considerations.” No amount of eleventh hour grassroots is going to make the plutocrats vote against their pocketbooks. What we need to be doing is figuring out how to deal with a post-Neutrality world. We need to be figuring out how to get these narrow minded weasels voted out of office.
