Most fanfictions I read have all these politics, pure bloods whinging about their culture, everyone being focused on status etc.

While I enjoy some of it, the books always had a sense of chaos, weirdness and diversity, to the extend that it seemed magic kinda messed with people's minds.

I'd like to see fics with a magical world that largely consists of caricature right wing Americans (The 'they took our jobs' kind from southpark) / libertarians/ anarchists/ hippies/ mad scientists/ crazy hobo wizards/ wizard traveller/ gypsy caravans.


** That makes an uncomfortable amount of sense. We'd have:

Lovegoods, who aren't /really/ conspiracy theorists but cater to that demographic and over time find themselves almost believing some of the conspiracies. Xenophilius and Pandora are actually hippies that smoked too much Mandrake leaf back in the 70s. Luna, of course, doesn't realize that the Quibbler isn't reality.

Malfoys, who are those very well-to-do upper-middle class people that genuinely believe that poor people are poor because they don't work hard enough and conveniently don't realize that the laws that the Malfoys help pass don't allow for much upward mobility.

Diggorys, who are amiable soccer-mom types that are generally good and helpful people but can't stop talking about how their child is amazing and better than yours and go nuts during Cedric's youth Quidditch games.

The Potters are libertarians in the model of Ron Swanson. They have some very problematic views but they work very hard and are extremely generous to friends and family. They are also against the Ministry getting too involved and so they make sure to distract it as much as possible.

The Princes are mad scientists of the most explosive variety and many of them meet early deaths or are cast out from society due to their experiments, which are morally ambiguous at best.

The Dumbledores are notoriously eccentric Welsh wizards and witches that are known to have a few screws loose. They are well-respected because they tend to be socially intelligent and good at manipulating people to ignore their eccentricities, but they don't actually get a lot of their goals accomplished. Albus is the sanest of the lot, so he is reasonably effective.

The Finnigans are anarchists but are /really/ bad at it. They are easily distracted by the affairs of their friends and the Muggles. They also create some extremely destructive spells and potions, but most of them never get used because they immediately start coming up with /another/ destructive spell or potion. They like the idea of anarchy more than actual anarchy, but mostly they just want to blow things up. Think Adam Savage crossed with Fred and George Weasley, with a healthy bit of Green Arrow. They all think that they are Zaheer, however.

The Weasleys are completely mad country folk that accept pretty much everyone into their group. They never have any money but they always manage to feed everyone. Most of their life revolves around weekly potlucks and brunches, playing their own brand of very physical Quidditch, and complaining that they can't get rich despite the fact that they blow their money on whatever catches their interest at the time.

****** If you want a current real-life parallel, look at Boris Johnson who refused to take the covid issue seriously until he himself got sick from it. Despite all his flaws, he is a well educated man and quite an apt politician (because let's be realistic... not everyone is cut out to become the Prime Minister of a country). Yet sometimes people choose to ignore a threat in order to maintain the comfort of peaceful times. Such was Fudge and, honestly, at least in my case, I don't know how I would have reacted in that situation. Sure, one might say "But Dumbledore knows his shit... how can you not trust him?". Well in the last book Dumbledore is revealed to not have been entirely flawless and despite the image of the old all-wise mentor that is projected to us through Harry's eyes, he is still a human (a very wise one) with flaws and defects.

******* The difference is that Fudge wasn't a very good politician at all, he was a convenient placeholder, every time he has to do political stuff he is shown to be blunt and incompetent, with no ability to choose good subordinates(Dolores), the only reason it works is because of corruption and plot.

Look at how he dealt with Barty, with Sirius, and then with Voldemort, look at the way he spoke and acted regarding Harry, any time things didn't go as planned he would start getting mad and resorting to stupid tactics that should never have worked.

Harry's trial is an example that either shows the entire court is corrupt or Rowling decided to forego consistency to cause drama.

Honestly, it's up to a point I honestly thought Fudge was just a Voldemort supporter and was just pretending to not believe.

******** I see your point but then you have to also remember that the book is written from Harry's perspective. With regards to Harry's hearing, he's a corrupt and quite gullible guy... for what we know Malfoy could have just bribed him in order to mess Harry's chances of getting acquitted... and while not explicitly stated in the books, I get the feeling he was the head or had massive influence over the Wizengamot, which in the end decided anyways that Harry was not guilty.

With regards to Sirius and Barty, from the information he had (and not the one we had), I think he acted correctly. In the first case, to all the world Sirius was known as a dangerous criminal who had accomplished what was thought impossible so it was only fair to start a manhunt against him. In the second case, Barty was supposed to be dead and buried in the yard of Azkaban so as an official you will bring protection against a wizard who could defy such circumstances. Whether Fudge knew how bad of an effect the Dementors had over other people that's up for debate, but he most certainly trusted them as loyal subjects to the Ministry.

With regards to Umbridge... well, Umbridge was a very ambitious woman according to her entry on Pottermore. She probably knew very well how to play Fudge, as well as the political games. Actually that's even stated by her when she's about to torture Harry ("What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him"). I'm pretty sure that when you're in a position of power you might find yourself surrounded by such 'snakes'. It's only a matter of whether you're good enough to see through them or not. Pretty sure a lot of adults would fail at that if they lack in people skills, let alone a bunch of teenagers. The only reason Harry saw through her was because she was very against him right from the hearing.

No, he didn't, he did NOT act to find out HOW he had escaped, he instead summarily executed Barty to cover up the fact the guy escaped at all.

He gave zero shits about 'acting accordingly' all he did was try to maintain his image.

Barty was bound and stunned and Fudge had him killed as soon as he could without letting anyone know, that's not acting well, that's a blatant cover-up.

He had several eyewitnesses telling Sirius Black was innocent AND that there was another guy, the real mass murderer, free, he didn't do ANYTHING to investigate, he just tried to cover up.

Fudge is the worst kind of politician, petty, incompetent, dumb, gullible, and malicious. He has NO redeeming qualities, the only good thing he did for Harry was waiving his guardian authorization to go to Hogsmeade, to try and gain his favour.

He is almost a caricature of how I think JKR sees most politicians.

Umbridge by the book and movie was clearly NOT trying to appear as a gentle or good person, it's noted several times her voice is false, her eyes are full of hatred, she's bigoted. Everyone knew that. Fudge knew that, he sent her there to quell what he was a coup d' etat, Fudge gave her full authority to terrorize children and did his best to stop the staff trying to mitigate it.

He never cared about the student's safety, he sent Dementors near children, he arrested Hagrid on a whim.

Harry didn't say he was being tortured, because he was being a stupid teenager with trust issues, I know people who would've walked up to her and killed her if she had tortured their children. The thing was, again, plot, no one knew about the Quills because the children were being coerced to not tell.

And then she organized the Hitler Youth and fucked things up more. Sometimes I imagine that if I was in the DA and someone blew the wall and when I looked I saw all those crazy racists, I would've just started shooting, because there was no way she wasn't going to torture me.

I agree with most parts except the fact that his willingness to waive Harry's guardian authorization to go to Hogsmeade was a good thing. That's very irresponsible when you know a supposed criminal is on the loose aiming to kill that person.

Umbridge is an evil woman but she knew how to play the political games better than most other characters because otherwise she would never have gotten so high up. She knew how to suck up the superiors but treated those she deemed as inferiors like shit.

I never really understood why people on this website got so worked up over the Quill detention. Only 25 years ago children in Eastern Europe would be punished by having them sit bared knee on wheat grains and many times children were punished through beatings throughout education's history. The wizarding world is fairly medieval and Molly speaks quite lightly about the scars Arthur got from beatings just because he got caught strolling with her one night. Not to mention the ease with which Filch brings up the idea of chaining misbehaving children upside down or the fact that only two years later a bunch of Death Eaters would have kids practice the Cruciatus Curse on their classmates serving detention. It was cruel and Harry was stupid to not speak up out of some pride, but I don't see what Fudge has to do with this.

It's because she was making children self-mutilate over a false pretense, she was basically conditioning them to self punish. It was psychological as well as physical, getting a few lashes with a belt or kneeling on corn has nothing on scarring yourself repeatedly.

I am pretty sure an aristocrat trained from the cradle by a competent tutor could outsmart Fudge. The problem may have been Malfoy.

*** The economy functions based in the rule of heads or tails, when someone is born they toss a coin, if it fails in head the person is rich and will be able to afford anything no matter the price, they basically have infinite money, if it falls in tails the person can only buy a set amount of things (decided by dice) by month and it have to be of low-quality (the exception being in Knockturn where instead you get to buy things with “evilnessing points” gained by any action that affects negatively other person, ranging from a momma joke to acts of unspeakable evil). Magic could potentially take care of most necessities for a relatively comfortable life-style, so not much use in buying/selling it. The habit of storing gold in a bank has actually more to do with how pretty Wizards find it rather than any economic reason.

The Goblins are the utterly terrified hostages of wizards, having to live their life's by their crazy and unstable overlords whims to avoid being annihilated. They rejoice in getting away with the small rebellion of being rude (which honestly mostly pass over the Wizards heads) because they know that their life's depend on how amused Wizards are with them. The whole Gringotts business was something the wizards forced on the Goblins because they though it would be funny to see a specie made to be suitable only for battle having to deal with a purely bureaucratic job. The “rebellions” were half the Goblin's desperate bids for freedom and half the nut-job of the week forcing the Goblins in a position that they find the most amusing.

Formalized education has as it's only reason give the parents some blessed months free of children while giving them something to do so they wouldn't try to experiment by themselves and accidentally (or on porpoise) destroy the planet.
