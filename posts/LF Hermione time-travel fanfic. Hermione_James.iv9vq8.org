:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The details that I remember:

Pairings were James/Hermione and/or Sirius/Hermione.

While still at war and ambushed by Death Eaters (I think) Harry sends Hermione back to the Marauders era. He says something along the lines: "save my parents and help them if you can...". Turns out that he learned some uncomfortable truth about James and thinks that if Hermione returns in time she will be able to help. I think in this fic James is a bit dark (e.g uses an unforgivable on someone who Lily used to date?). Anyway, Hermione befriends James and Sirius and they both become interested in her. I also remember that the girls, including Lily, were trying to bully/ be rude to Hermione but she stood up for herself. I think the last chapter I read was about DADA class where Hermione blew up a wall with just a Bombarda and that was very impressive.

I know this is hectic, but I tried giving as many details as I remember.That fic was very well-written and I really want to read it again.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
