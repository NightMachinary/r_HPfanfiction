This doubles as a prompt, I suppose, because I'd like to see this. Basically, the twin heralded as the Boy of Prophecy is not at all interested in becoming a Beacon of Heroism and would rather be a normal kid. Not in a bashing style, either - he's just a normal kid with a relatively normal upbringing, who thinks Voldemort is gone for good, and he has to be this popular figurehead. Or perhaps a typical Ravenclaw nerd instead. And instead of being jealous and mean to Harry, he embraces him like Cor did Shasta, and is pleased to escape the public eye.
