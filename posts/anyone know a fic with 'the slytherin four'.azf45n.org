I remember reading this fanfic ages ago, I don't really remember it but Harry was a Slytherin and the boy who lived was either his brother or it was wrong boy who lived. I remember instead of the golden trio he was part of the slythering four (with Draco and Theo) and I think some/all of them were deatheaters. I think the auther also said something along the lines of 'and then, the Slytherin four became closer than the golden trio would ever be' in a scene where they were sitting in the library or something. Anyone have any idea? I know this is super vague but it was a good fic (or at least to younger me). xoxo
