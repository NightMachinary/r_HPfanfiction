I know that on this sub Ron is one of the more beloved characters and many of the authors nowadays try to do him so well deserved justice. However I never understood how it got this point. Sure it might have started out with some canonical snarky remarks, then the movies made Hermione a Mary Sue, then the Harmony shippers tried to find ways to bring Harry and Hermione together. But I still don't get it. The only reason Hermione became part of the trio was because of Ron. Even up to GoF, it's stated that Harry didn't enjoy Hermione's company as much as he enjoyed Ron's. Which makes sense because no teenager guy will choose the company of a girl whom he has no romantic interest in (be her one of his best friends) over that of his best male friend. Hell, he even enjoys Ginny (even when he doesn't crush on her) or any Weasley for that matter, over Hermione. So I don't get it what mental gymnastics do the Harmony shippers perform to bring the two together. Furthermore I don't understand how did some people make Ron the bad guy (or neglected at best) when he is the glue that keeps the trio together.


** There are a few reasons.

1) the films took all his good attributes and gave them to Hermoine. Ron became a crappy caricature of himself.

2) Ron bails on Harry... Twice. The first was childish, sure. But it happened. The second. Well, regardless of what has already been said, Ron knew what Hermoine was doing to protect the group. An apt metaphor is pushing someone. You can regret it after the fact, but you knocked them down. You can't take it back. I don't see Harry as blameless in that exchange, either. He tells Ron to leave like twice. He exacerbated the fight. The thing is, the movie made Harry the good guy during that exchange so thats what is remembered.

3) Most fanfic authors aren't going to write 1mil words. That means they need to drop unnecessary crap so they can focus on their ship. It's easy to write Ron out, give his story role to Hermoine (like the movies) or to the new love interest.

4) They hate Ron.

** My theory is that Ron's treatment, like so many other quirks of fanfiction, is because of the younger age of most readers and writers.

A minor embarrassment might make a teenager not want to go to school anymore. Unfair treatment by a teacher will make them seethe and cry. A perceived betrayal by a friend will hurt deeply. Ten years down the road it'll be just a fond memory or something to laugh at, but in the present, it feels like the end of the world.

So you get fics with no-compromise, teenage black-and-white thinking. Harry never loses, he talks back to teachers with impunity, and he harshly punishes any slights against him (such as Ron's perceived betrayal during GoF).

**** But that version of Harry is just as unrealistic. He's just the paint by the numbers Hero's Journey version of Jesus Christ. He forgives literally every terrible thing against him, but everyone deserves redemption, and he had to be the exact opposite of Voldemort.

A real teenage Harry under all of these exact circumstances would've snapped a long time ago, or been pretty terrible to friends that "betrayed" him. I don't like the fanon version of Ron, but that Ron didn't spawn from nothing. He's Harry's best friend, knows him and his secrets and was there for everything, yet the second Harry gets something he wanted(fourth year), he turns against him like he just learned Harry was actually a Death Eater the whole time.

I may be wrong, but I don't think Ron turned on Harry "because he got something he wanted". I mean, canonically, Harry got a lot of thing that Ron would have wanted (starting by his 2 brooms), and he was nothing but supportive in each case.

The way I understood the scene, Ron was not angry that Harry was chosen as a Champion, he was angry because he was afraid that Harry found a way to enter his name in the Goblet without even bothering telling him about it. It plays right into his fear of "just" being Harry sidekick, just like he is "just" another Weasley.

In an AU where both Ron and Harry had entered their name, I'm convinced that Ron's reaction to Harry selection would be something along the lines of "/Well done mate/".

********* It's partly because honestly Ron did little to embody what was needed in a prefect, unlike Hermione.

If Harry had been a girl and Hermione go chosen over her, she would've just went with it because it was obvious.

Similar to Malfoy of all people becoming a prefect.

Dumbledore's excuse is some of the most bullshit I had read in a novel, especially regarding how stupid he was by isolating Harry that year, it's literally the kind of thing that could have had horrible consequences if Harry was a normal teenager and not a "Hero".

You can totally see in that scene that the sole reason Ron is a prefect was one more way for JKR to make Harry feel bad in that book, it literally works itself for nothing more than that and maybe making Ron and Hermione interact more.

The only other reason I see is Rowling not wanting to write Harry having prefect duties and writing more detailed interactions with other characters, wanting to focus on the DA group and Umbridge.

True, but that doesn't mean it's realistic.

That's what I meant, being a prefect would increase that even more.

Think of it from Harry's perspective, in the last four years, all he has gotten is more screwed, with little recognition to show for it, the Tri-Wizard was a complete mess, and the first time he's going to get something that he may have deserved it for himself, some recognition, it's given to Ron, who despite being a good person, is lazier than Harry and much more prone to slack off. And has worse grades.

The fact that Ron Disapparated doesn't mean he "walked outside to get some space". It means he left. Also, your reply almost seems as if Ron got nabbed by Snatchers when he "walked outside" when he didn't; he Apparated nearby them.

My issue with writing Ron is that he's normal. Not that he's a bad dude. Not that he gets in the way. He's just kinda.... a dude. Like every other dude out there. He's super relatable. Throughout all of the books (even when he's being a little shit) it's just standard teenager stuff with how a teenager would react. I don't dislike him but he doesn't inspire me at all.

** The theory I subscribe to regarding this would be that people don't like Ron because he is human and not perfect.

Fanfiction, generally is an escape. People like to beautify and make everything perfect, OP, everything goes according to plan. You didn't like something canon? Escape into fanfic.

But you can't have everything perfect, you need some thing to cause drama. So while they exaggerate the good things in other characters, the also exaggerate the pre-existing bad things in the characters they don't like.

Ron is possibly one of the best written characters in the series because he is real and relatable. Very often people bash him for leaving Harry in GOF, or on DH, but no one really considers what they'd do in a similar position, in real life, at that age.

Most fanfics forget how children and teenagers act, and its understandable, as after all they want to create their own world and you wouldn't put imperfections in your own world, so they expect a higher level of maturity than what most humans would be able to exhibit.

As a result of those expectations and the need for an easy, comical character to bash, you have Ron, an easy target who exhibits human tendencies such as jealousy, immaturity and speaking without thinking. Personally I love Ron. He's a good character with complexities.

Also in Harry Potter, mostly everyone wants to be Harry, and not Ron.

So they perfect themselves and bash an easy target.

No guy will want to hang out with a girl who constantly bosses him around and always criticises him for what he does.

I largely blame the films for turning him into a stupid-looking comic which doesn't fit with his canon personality in the books. So if you've only seen the films, or you have let them override your memory of the books, then Ron comes of as useless and selfish because so much context is missing. Hence, it's interpreted that he is like that for no good reason, so it fuels dislike for him among the film audience. And bashing is spawned from the dislike of particular characters.

** I have two main issues with Ron. The first was that he didn't have the most graceful introduction into the story. And it was pretty OOC of Harry to still hang around him. Him being the BWL already made him uncomfortable, yet "Hey, lemme see your scar" "Hey, do you remember your parents being horrifically murdered in front of you?". That was exaggerated, mind you, but the point still stands. You have Malfoy and Ron as the introductory characters, and they are both on opposing sides, yet equally annoying (in their introduction).

Then, my next big beef is that Ron barely brought any of his strengths to the table. Besides the chess match, practically anything else done by Ron could be done by another person.

Oh, and his family doesn't count. The twins could have just as easily took Harry under their wing.

The only Weasley we really get to know is Ron and I think he is the voice of the Weasleys. Actually he is like the average of his siblings. Ambitious enough to make a Prefect or to make it on the Chocolate Frog Cards but not so much as to be the child prodigy that every mom wants as a son.

** u/Glorgamitch:

  Which makes sense because no teenager guy will choose the company of a girl whom he has no romantic interest in (be her one of his best friends) over that of his best male friend.
#+end_quote

Okay, so... this line makes me cringe a bit. I understand the idea, but I can't say I agree. I've had fairly close male friends before, and I can't say I prefer their company to my female friends. Even beyond my girlfriend. The way they think tends to mesh better with me, so I spend more time with them. Although it seems I am in the minority there.

Also...

#+begin_quote
  The only reason Hermione became part of the trio was because of Ron.
#+end_quote

And Harry for actually remembering her. Ron wasn't exactly thrilled about the idea, if you recall.

‘I've just thought -- Hermione.'

‘What about her?'

‘She doesn't know about the troll.'

Ron bit his lip.

‘Oh, all right,' he snapped. ‘But Percy'd better not see us.'

If Harry hadn't, she may have died... though we can't say for sure, because that didn't happen.

Quite indeed. I, myself, used to get better along with my female friends as a teenager (although to be fair I still got horny around most of them even though I wasn't romantically interested) but realistically that's not the general case.

** For the reasons I think. This is my opinion, I personally don't like him or his family in general.

Ron abandoned Harry three times for pretty stupid reasons. 2nd year for being a parselmouth, which is looked favorably in other countries,;4th year for being entered into the tournament, even though Harry repeatedly said he didn't want to enter;and during the horcrux hunt when he left because he was hungry and missed his family. I personally believe he's lazy, petty, disloyal, has no empathy for others, and begrudges people who have things he doesn't have.

*** 1. How do you know it's looked at favourably?
2. Ron was scared of being the sidekick, teenage fomo, again, something that 14 year olds do.
3. Harry had no family, and Hermione had obliviated hers. All of his family had a price on their heads. So I don't think he lacks empathy.

** He is the guy, that guy, nice guy normal dude guy, the popular guy's best friend but not the popular guy, the dude you know that dude.

Honestly, I think its because he is the most real person of the lot, I could never study like Granger, suffer nobly like Potter, peacock like Draco, loony like Lovegood, etc.., I think its also why Ginny gets hated too. They aren't easily defined as a caricature of some archetype. They arent the scholar, the HERO, jester, or any Jungian ideal. I guess Ginny could be slotted as the 'damsel' in the second year but honestly, they have the most human faults that we hate in ourselves. They are easy to bash because they are people and people can be wonderful or petty, and without that concrete archetype, they kinda are like putty in a writer's hand.

*** I would disagree with the first statement. I think Ron, despite his stage fright, is the most worldly and people's person in the group (just like his dad who is on a first name basis with most Ministry employees), just like Ginny or the twins. Hermione is a socially awkward nerd who loses herself in critical situations and the only reason she has friends is because she happened to be in the bathroom that was attacked by a troll (that's not to say that she is not a great character). Harry, because of growing up bullied and as a social reject (due to no fault of his own), is also quite socially awkward and his popularity comes from his status as a legend and as the only one who, even as a baby, could stand toe to toe with the Darkest Lord in recent memory. But, unlike Ron, he is not relatable because he makes no effort to appeal to people, but he still gets news coverage for things that he did not do (such as his mom's sacrifice or Dumbledore arranging the things so that Voldemort will eventually be defeated). It's actually ironic that Harry's greatest individual accomplishment was being a Quidditch star seeker... but just like Krum, on the ground he is awkward.

** Mainly the movies I guess. Besides giving his best moments to Hermione the movies also needed to be relatively short, so much of the everyday stuff that makes Ron more likable and shows he is not in fact a lazy parasite was glossed over. The inverse happened with Snape with the movies ignoring his jerkiest decisions, Hell, even the prophecy is not well explained in the movies with maybe half a scene implying that Snape had anything to do with it during the viewing of his memories by Harry.

In essence in one case the movies jumped the parts that show a character as not being an asshole while in the other the movies jumped over the instances where the other proved beyond doubt how much of an asshole he is.

** Ron is abused because he's perfectly placed in the story to abuse. He can be the comedy relief, he can be the gluttonous fool, he can be the betraying backstabbing bitch all with only slight tweaks to canon.

I have abused the living fuck out of Ron when it suits the story I want to tell. A favorite bit of one of my stories has Malfoy being scalped (well, has his hair hacked off) by a cursed blade, so the hair won't come back. Lucius who is completely over the dimwitted little shit his wife crapped out won't pay for a curse breaker to fix the damage but spends the princely sum of 5 pounds 60 for a selection of headwear from a pound shop. Draco has plowed through the selection of Hats and is stuck wearing a Dayglo orange Afro clown wig, which he convinces Ron is his natural hairstyle and it's always been like that.

The two end up in a slap fight shortly after that, but Ron would testify that Malfoy's hair had always been like that.

He's just perfectly placed to do that to.

I've also made him the Big Damned Hero in a story too, and good god the whining that inspired.

** ron is simply completely underused in canon. his family brings things to the table ron exists purely to be an emotional connection for harry after book 1.

ron is a pureblood. why is hermione the only source for exposition. ron has lived with magic his whole life why is magic such a chore for him while hermione excelles. hermione can do very well through her immense hard work as a story mechanic, why is ron both lazy and incompetent?

harry needs an equal in the series. Hermione talks down to him. the older weasleys his superior, draco his rival. and ron... just tells harry he should take it easy.

that's fine as a method to keep harry emotionally stable but harry is already emotionally stable irregardless of his trials or what real people would be like given similar circumstances. ron is also a bad emotional rock in that the instability in Harry's friendships is all placed on ron despite Hermione's clear conflicts of interest.

hermione wants to succeed academically and be seen as resource. she strives for school work and trusting authority figures. but is somehow also the main driving force for extracurricular adventures that would see them expelled.

ron's family could have taken care of themselves while hermione's could not have. why then is hermione's family completely negated in an awful way to allow her to abandon them and move on while ron is the one made to feel worry.

simply put hermione is an author insert that cannibalized rons value as a character while keeping his flaws.

*** That's great and all... and from a literary device standpoint it makes sense what you are saying. But you are forgetting that Harry, despite all his deeds, is still human. And a human needs a human friend, more so than a mentor or someone that, even with their best intent at heart, constantly criticizes them. As humans we need someone that sometimes tells us to take it easy, someone that we can laugh with and someone that can make us forget our worries, all the same, while remaining fiercely loyal and even willing to sacrifice their lives for us.

**** dude.

i know

i wrote that he should have fulfilled that role, harry's peer/equal. in the parent comment.

rons entire role is that, despite harry being uneeding of emotional support because hes kind of inhumanly emotionally resilient.

its a fault of characterization of harry. its a fault of hermione being an author insert.

the obvious points where Ron should have been an equal were taken from him as i said above, the emotional rock role he was given is largely seen as useless due to the lack of support harry seemingly needs, and finally the bonds of companionship being broken was done entirely through ron's character whereas Hermione was always available despite her personality and character traits making her more likely to have contrary motivations.

so again people dont like ron because his value was in canon stripped from him to pad out the author insert.
