  Assuming everything in the story is planned exactly for the villains

Depends on what you mean by above, because there would be massive deviations* just based on First Year.

First Year I think there are two major options for the major plot + likely change to affect Year 3, and there are tons of minor plots that likely change in hundreds of different ways as well:

- Stone is likely destroyed pre-Gringotts if the Flamels were already looking to pass on. Quirrell getting possessed by wraith Riddle is likely to search out Malfoy or Snape at this point. He didn't approach either because he believed the stone would bring back his body, and coming back himself would make him look even greater. Snape approached because potions master, Riddle might force Snape to create a potion to get his body back, ala 4th year potion. Malfoy approached because of the diary which likely has some way of bringing him back with a body.

- Stone is still for some reason brought to Hogwarts, Quirrell gets trapped in Mirror room. Riddle is a genius so it is a possibility he is able to remove the stone given enough time. But working around that, and assuming he cannot, Dumbledore would find him, Riddle would still escape from Quirrell unless Dumbledore has a way to trap a wraith in that room and bind him there. If this is the most likely case, you go on to 2nd year with no other real change.

- Prophet writes a story about Harry not being at Hogwarts, it somehow makes its way to Sirius and Sirius breaks out. This is the most likely and only scenario in which Sirius breaks out if he does. There is no other reason he would know Peter would be with the Weasleys and he only really broke out to save Harry. If Sirius breaks out, Peter runs to find Riddle. If the Stone was destroyed and there was no possession because Riddle didn't look for the Stone at Hogwarts, Peter finds Riddle even sooner, and brought back summer Second Year if not sooner.

Second Year - if for whatever reason First Year plays out as it did with extremely minor differences, there is zero chance Second Year doesn't affect the rest of the years.

- Diary Riddle has a massive chance of coming back to life or Riddle straight up dies faster. There is almost no chance it doesn't happen, and I lean more towards Riddle coming back. Malfoy gives the diary to Ginny because he is looking to get back at Arthur Weasley who is looking to raid his house, while at the same time getting rid of a dark object. Either Ginny would die, or some other girl would die. It was in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom and little girl would have found it, if not them, Ginny likely would have come back as I doubt she needs to be connected directly to the diary to be possessed. Arguable it wouldn't be Ginny because the only reason she got it back was because of Harry, but honestly there was no reason she doesn't toss it again once she steals it back instead of writing it in. There's a ton of reasons why I think Ginny would take back the diary in some way, but would take too much to write it all out unless it is necessary. With Diary Riddle back, you would get the start of the Second Blood War. Likely Wraith Riddle finds his way back after hearing about Diary Riddle in some manner and things go straight to hell.

- If Diary Riddle doesn't come back and stays in the bathroom and gets found by someone, likely the information disseminates and it either becomes a massive hunt to bring Riddle back even faster, or for his Horcrux to kill him. Hell, Malfoy might have found the diary and realized what it was in connection to the attack if he had stepped in to take over the school, which he already had the clout to do because he forced Dumbledore to step down.

The following years would be too unpredictable to be honest because there is almost no chance that Second year result doesn't greatly affect the rest of the years in some manner.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** First year ends with Quirrel staring at a mirror till he does, without Harry and the others looking into shit like the Troll or the Quidditch attempted Murder. Hermione probably becomes a lonely girl because no Harry, but doesn't set smashed since Ron isn't spurred on to insult Hermione for not having friends since he doesn't have any himself, Dean and Seamus I doubt would want to hang with Ron since they have nothing in common and Ron would probably look down on Neville aka 'the Squib'.

Second year without Ron and the Twins becoming friends with Harry and Hermione, Arthur probably doesn't get the Muggle Protection Act passed (perceptions of the Wizengamot). Without the passage Lucius leaves the Diary at home.

Third Year still goes on like usual since the idea had little to do with Harry's action or inaction. Without the need to look after The Boy who Lived and looking like they need to do something, No Dementors. Sirius captures and kills Peter who's body is found by the Aurors, which start new questions to blow up. Sirius's escaping England is your choice but if he is caught he is killed for killing a Wizard (ignoring that wizard had faked his death 13 years ago).

4th year and the Goblet gets ignited, Victor probably wins and gets transported to a graveyard where a Barty Crouch Jr with Old V sticking out the back of his head is waiting, sacrificing the Quidditch star in some new version of a dark ritual (especially since Voldemort wasn't in his Homunculus form) is reborn from Victor's body.

** 1. Dumbledore scrambles to remove the stone, since he only placed it there to test Harry. Hermione isn't attacked by a troll since Ron didn't have a friend to tell she's a nightmare with no friends.

2. This is an interesting year. Would Ginny be writing in the diary if she didn't have the unrequited crush on Harry? Would Malfoy put it into play, would he have picked someone else to give the diary to? If Ginny does get the diary, and writes in it; the school is closed down for some time after she is taken into the chamber and killed. 16 year old Tom goes out into the world.

3. Maybe the newspaper have an article about how Harry is still missing or how hogwarts is still closed in addition to the picture with Scabbers. Peter; he can either be spooked by Sirius escaping and making a run for it back to Voldemort, or Sirius can get him while at the Burrow. Few or no consequences for the school. Young Tom is roaming England, possibly gathering followers.

4. World Cup and death eater attack happens. Crunch (?) jr still leaves to find Voldemort, but doesn't become teacher since there was no Harry to trick. Maybe he finds Quirrel with Voldemorte still atatched, maybe he finds Young Tom. Tournament happens. No reason to rig the cup. Krum wins. In my au there is a conflict between Tom and Old Voldie (resurected as in Canon, with another persons blood and Quirrel or Crunchs arm), both thinking they are the real Voldemort and this comes to a head during the final task when both decide to launch an attack to show their strength.

5. Umbridge is still the defence teacher since the ministry are denying that two Voldemorts showed up at the school the previous year. Some students rebel. The two Voldemorts keep a quiet war, try to poach each others followers.

6. Um...yeah, never read this book. Don't really know what happened. So just ignoring it. Lets just say Voldie 1 & 2 are escelating their conflict and the muggles start taking notice, the Ministry can no longer deny that something freaky is going on.

7. Dumbledore have secretly been finding and destroying Horcruxes. It either ends with him having destroyed them and killing the one who wins the epic battle of the voldemorts, or the muggles declare war and carpet bomb every magical community.

If there was no Harry then I think Ron and Neville would probably be closer friends. Neville is a bit of a push over and I think Ron would like being the one in charge for once

**** But why would Ron want to hang out with the boring near-squib who only knows plants? This is not DA-Neville or the guy who sliced Nagini in half, it's the boy who fell of his broom and forgets the passwords.

***** Because he has no one else to hang out with? Because Neville is willing to be led by Ron, who has only had his older brothers to hang out with before and that probably means he's never been able to decide what they were going to do.

If your options are having no friends or tolerating someone else following you around, whether you class that as friendship or not, a lot of people are going to pick the latter.
