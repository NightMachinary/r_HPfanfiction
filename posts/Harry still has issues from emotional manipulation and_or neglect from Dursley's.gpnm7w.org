Say Harry hides food, fearing it'll be taken away. He cleans even if the place is already really clean, because it was ingrained in him, or other such ideas. (Doesn't have to be the exact same).

Can be as canon or as AU as possible. Can be a minor thing in the story or a major thing. Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site. Can be any length. No OP Harry, Harry smarter and stronger then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it. If Harry is Lord I'd like for him to still help people.

No Weasley bashing, if at all possible. Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et cetra)

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

Somebody who may felt bitter resentment against her family, because he felt rejected by her sister? Somebody who wouldn't hesitate to use magic against a Muggle woman to make her defenceless?

I had this in my head for some time, but I used it only in the background of my story (in Czech), because to write the full-front rape story requires somebody who knows a wee bit more about it to honour all those abused women.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

I think I've proven whatever it is, I can take it. I'm not going anywhere.” Her voice had taken on a defensive edge, but Harry could hear the hurt beneath it. She thought he didn't trust her. She was wrong. She was so wrong.  “I know. I know you can. It's not that. It really isn't, it's just-” There are things we haven't talked about. Things I didn't want you to find out, not like this. Things I shouldn't tell you like this. He coudn't bring himself to say it, but she was watching him with those eyes so he took deep breath and tried again. //One shot set after the war. Harry and Ginny are living together and just trying to get by. Harry has a particularly bad episode and he and Ginny talk a little bit about what life was like for him at the Dursley's. Because they've all been through a lot and Harry needs to start dealing with his childhood trauma, dammit!

** I've seen the cleaning thing in a number of Severitus/mentor!Snape fics. Two of them off the top of my head: Crime and Punishment linkffn(12951919) has him doing it originally to spite Snape ("you call me lazy, ha, I'll show you"). Later there's a minor subplot about the subconscious meaning of cleaning as proof that he's a member of the household. A Very Slytherin Harry linkao3(11047995) has a similar subplot of him feeling useless and using cleaning as a way to calm himself down.

The second Ninja Wizard has a great subplot about how living with the Dursleys screws up his relationship with Sirius once he goes to live with him. "You have a bad attitude, go to your room and stay there" does not normally mean "you can't come out to eat meals or use the bathroom or send letters to your friends until I explicitly say your punishment is over."

  "Emergency food stores?" Adeline said quietly.

  Oddment nodded.

  Sirius let out a shaky breath, feeling rather sick.

  "A kid his age should have porn, or at least racy photos of teeny boppers in bikinis hidden in his room, not food."

  "Does he have anything else hidden?"

  "Medicine, bandages and weapons."

  Adeline closed her eyes and covered her mouth, while Sirius clenched the back of the chair he was standing behind in a white-knuckled grip.
