I have a fic that has been on hiatus for several months now and I'm trying to work up the energy to continue it. The thing is I have been doing edits on it and while most of the edits have been cosmetic in nature (grammar, word choice, etc) there is one whole scene I think I should cut. I know I felt the need to include it at the time but I don't remember why and it just seems really forced. Basically, I don't think that it would have happened the way I wrote it and it doesn't actually impact the plot in any way. I know I don't like it because I kind of cringe while reading it. Should I go ahead and delete it, replacing it with what makes more sense?

Mostly I'm worried about the readers who've already read what is there of the story - some of them did complain about that scene, but would they be annoyed about having to potentially re-read that part? If you were a reader, what would you want the writer to do?

I'm not planning on posting any edits until I have a few new chapter ready to post (which may never happen) but I need a second opinion. Also, while I do enjoy my writing (I write in the fix-it genre mostly) the stories I post are specifically because I think/hope other people would enjoy them and so I do try to take my readers' opinions into account.

For those interested, the story is 'The difference a good solicitor makes' and the specific scene is the troll scene in chapter 12.


** I'd want you to repost the scene as a "special features"/"omake" kind of deal, for the benefit of anyone who wants to reread it; but definitely replace it in the main body of the story if that's what your artistic instincts tell you. Do state in the next Author's Note that the scene changed and they should go back to check what changed in Chapter XYZ, though.

*** This. I don't know if keeping the old scene as a 'omake' is necessary, that's debatable, but if you think you need to get rid of the scene, do so, and acknowledge what you did in an author's note in your next chapter.

** I've seen a lot of writers remove scenes that didn't feel right before. Leave an Author's Note at the beginning of your next chapter telling that you deleted Scene X in Chapter Y because of reason Z. It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.

** Absolutely you should edit out the scene. The primary advantage of releasing a story in serial form is to gauge audience reaction and adjust things if plot holes develop or the theme is shifting too far. Leave a note for the next chapter about the last edit, but I wouldn't include the scene in an omake unless it was 'fun' in some way. You're writing not just for the current audience but for readers who may not discover your story until years after it's concluded. They won't care much about the process.

** Yes. The only thing which matters is whether the end result, the story you'll finish, is any good. If anybody cares about anything else, they are wrong.

  Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.

  -- Michael Crichton, alluding to Steele MacKaye (1889) article where he said this about theater plays.

I think the serialized writing of fan-fiction is rather harmful to the end process (serialized fiction is always harmful to the end result; Grimaud is just an abomination), and I am just planning to scrap everything I have published of my novel-length story and I will publish only when I finish it, and yes, I am just in the middle of rather large rewrite.
