Hi, This post is to mark the final update for Barefoot for a while. I posted a nice chunky author note like the sap I am just to clear a couple of things up. I open this to answer some questions anyone might have about the story or what the hell I've been doing.

/

FAQ

Why do I write in first person? Cuz it's easier.

Why do I write in such a rushed way? I am too eager to pour my ideas out, always have been.

Hedwig thing? Poll years back and I just messed up BIG style. Sorry!

Tonks thing? I was trying to be thoughtful and to go against what tends to happen in fanfiction, particularly M rated stuff, but I think I just messed that up and a well loved character is a paedophile now(This is a bad thing).

/

As mentioned in the notes at the end of the update; I love this story. I hate this story. I've seen forum posts over the years marvelling over parts of this, and the also very deserved negativity that I have received. (Two death threats to date!)

Hopefully a couple of questions pop up. Negative opinions are just as welcome, I do appreciate feedback so I know what I've done wrong, but try not to just roast every mistake I've made.

So, I am Zaxaramas, Author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot][Barefoot]] AMA!


** Let me just tell you, i didn't intend to reply to this post, i actually closed Reddit right after reading it, not because of anything against you or the fic, but because at the moment I'm going into a deep depressive state and am in no state to give justice to what you fic has done for me.

I fully intend to come back and write to you in details what i thought about it, mayne after my hands stop shaking and i havr to correct every word I'm writing.

Just know that every time you posted an update, i would go back and reread barefoot, and on those days when i just want to feel better i read it again, it had the sort of effect on me where i simply imagine what it would be like to hold a violin and be able to see all of it's history, to see the struggles and blood and tears that went into mastering it.

I have always had a very deep imagination, and there are always those fics that make me live the scene, where i am so immersed that i just stop reading and drop into that world and live it myself.

As a writer myself i completely understand the feeling where you feel your work isntup to your standards I have the same thing, even when I'm being sowrn to it's perfect, i still find fsults in it

Just knoe that whenever you do decide to come back, if you do come back, you'll have a definite reader ready to tackle it once more.

Sorry for the strange reply here I'll do better when I'm better

** I think taking a step back is a good thing, but maybe not for the reason you think. You have taken the words of readers who didn't enjoy your story for legitimate reasons, but also haters and flamers to heart, and they've hurt you with their criticisms, justified or not. It hurts to read what you wrote in your author's notes because I've felt similarly although, my fics have never met anything close to your level of success.

Writing is about your world that your mind imagined. I followed your fic and read every chapter. You had some fantastic ideas and the writing in the first person thing never bothered me. Not every book is the same, yet i see fanfiction favouring certain styles. Don't worry about that. Sure, I didn't really need the hedwig or tonks aspects, but this is YOUR story. One that garners as much success as barefoot is always going to attract jealousy and entitlement from others. Those who get mad about small mistakes or unusual/unpopular decisions.

So I agree. Take a break, take a step back, and remind yourself that you own Barefoot. You created this beast of a fic. Some people don't like it, others love it, others just follow along. I appreciate your work, your efforts to making Barefoot what it is: ultimately, a cool story with a very cool premise that is executed in a very cool way. And it's fanfiction, but with a proper AU vibe about it. I loved the exploration of Azkaban, nothing has felt quite like it. I'm sure that beside the criticism that seems overwhelming, you have received very good and enthusiastic reviews. But they don't have quite the same impact, I know.

Maybe focus on writing for yourself a little bit, just when you feel like it. Either don't post at all, or maybe with a different account so that you can be a bit anonymous again. You have talent, you can craft interesting worlds and legends within legends. Maybe some short fics to get your own groove back.

Don't let entitled douchebags and trolls get you down. Take the well-written, constructive criticism, have a look and see if you agree with it. Those parts you agree with, incorporate into your new writing if you want. Or don't, because this is fanfiction, and you have ultimate control over what happens in your story and how it is written. Hang in there! You are not a bad writer for using first person or making miracles happen with Hedwig. I bet you had fun writing it, and that's what really matters.

** Hey just wanted to let you know I loved barefoot. Loved the characters, writing style, the concept and the UNIQUENESS (Hedwig being a person, the feeling the history of objects thing, ...). This was definetly a 1% kind of fic. Not amongst the best out there but definetly close. You deserve credit if only for daring to do things differently.

At the end of the day it's your story and intellectual creation. It's entirely up to you whether you want to continue this or not but don't let yourself be dragged down by negative comments. There might be some legitimate constructive criticism in some of them but I assure you most can be categorized by two groups:

- young teens who only read Harem fics where Harry has 6 lordships and everyone is bashed.

And

- DLP 'professional' critics who like to shit on other people's works all the time whilst having usernames like: Lord Hadrian Peverell.

P.S. so even if it means little, I personally really enjoyed your writing and my day in turn was made better by it.

2. it can happen to all of us. about rushing
3. no one will like every choice you made. Ive written under a few pen names both T and M, and all the stories got praise and hate.
4. the tonks thing? You realized there are ppl who ship him with Snape, Voldermort, heck Molly, and His own mom. I forgot how old you had him in the story, but this is No worse or better than hundreds of people dreaming of other ships with older people and (keeping it clean) with fade to black or writing it.

****** in part i blame that most of the fan base was very young when this series came out. I was on older side reading the books to my cousin i was helping with. So, now 20 years later we are all very different people.

Its not like say a horror movie which attracts a certain Niche, but rather was read by a whole generation who all pictured it their way. Add in alot the fanfic was to start written by young people with low life experiences, or without the emotional knowledge to understand how horrible a person snape really wa s just because of "always"

Now we are all a varied lot who have very huge life differnces, and few this series very differently.

never mind JKR basically shitting on her own canon ( IE. I have no issue with a Black hermione, but in the books they talk about her skin being white in a few places.) and now shes all for it. her her dropping dumbkedore is gay after the books for basically publicatiy, now the whole " sat on nagini for 20 yrs"

we dont even have a stable basis of stuff.

another great issue is How the new series while i love it, is just magically superior in ways. lol

The inital name for the story was actually posted as "Copycat" due to the ease of learning from other wands.

I think Blindness had just been published at the time, and i thought it was a fascinating idea with the magic-sense i think was in that story. I didn't want to just spin another take on being blind, so i thought "What other senses can i use?" and just landed on this idea.

An early comment also recommended the Jeff Goldblum film "Vibes" to me, and that resonated with me very well!

** You were amazing. Truly. I will try to say that to you with my broken english as much as possible. Barefoot was one of those fics that kept calling to you "read me, again,again" and I listened. For the last few years, I've re-read this story from the begining almost everytime you post a new update, everytime I feel down, sometimes when I'm high and just wanna have some fun I read barefoot. It distracted me from my live everytime I need a distraction and I thank you for it. Your ideas were really original, you were building a awesome world. I posted this on ff, now I'm saying it again, no story is perfect but barefoot very close to it. Tonks stuff didnt really bothered me much yeah Harry is a child and there is a big age gap but you didn't really wrote harry as a child, you wrote him as a cranky and quirky old man and I've always seen him as one. I'm definetly against pedos but what is age but age of your body and your life experiences. Harry had the life experience of many, and this made him old in my eyes. Still, I wish you waited a few more years before starting that relationship. And talking of quirky old man, I loved his relationship with Albus, his friendship and communication was very well-written. So I'm saying this, even if other people and you critize this work of art, It will always have a special place in my heart and my fav stories. I understand your feelings, and I hope this break makes you feel much better about yourself and your writing. Even if you stop writing barefoot, I hope you keep on writing other stories because I really think you have an amazing talent. Thanks again for this great experience. And thank you for reading this letter to you that is written with a broken english but it's the least you can do considering I've read thousands of your writings, again and again :D Cheers

** Can you open it up to other authors to take over please (I have my fingers crossed for a third person but you have really made it work well, potentially the pony first person I've enjoyed, and that incudes me judging it against published fiction) like a prompt and maybe when one or two have made a bit of progress you do one more chapter update linking us to them all so we're aware.

While I understand people issue with tonks you put more the tenderness of a friendship side of a relationship rather than pedophilic detail for which stories have been kicked off of FF before (and I would have reported it for this) as it is the honks was the reason I got into the story as way back then had been reading a few of them.

I can't remember the Hedwig thing but surely it can easily be retconned.

The scope of the story has definitely grown in the past few chapters

I may make a list of usernames and stories to check out if anyone wants to play off the idea of Barefoot! I've always loved the PMs i get from other FFN users talking about things that Harry could do, or the things they would do if they wrote it. I always encourage creativity, no matter the inspiraton!

I'm not sure if i'm the right person to try and spin it as a third person telling, it's just not my writing style, but i'd love to see somebody take a swing at it from another character's perspective/third person!

**** You know, I love your story. It would sadden me to see it abandoned. Altough there are some concepts that I don't really understand... Such as Hedwig suddenly becoming a person thanks to pixie magic. The parts I've enjoyed the most is when Harry had to solve mysteries for Dumbledore/the ministry.

And btw, I support the relationship between Harry and Tonks. Whereas he's quite young, he does have an especial gift that makes him know a lot more than any 14-year-old. He doesn't speak as a 14yo boy and act as a 14yo, I'd say.

You manage to create a lot of history/magic to fit in your story and it is not that common in fanfiction. You had amazing ideas (the floo in the last chapter is a good example)

Don't let the critics getting you down. Your story has flaws but hey! it IS a fanfiction not a published book that has been re-read countless times AFTER being finished. And really, I just don't get the "first person POV" problem. It is only a problem in badly written stories.

Anyway, take care and thanks for sharing your work ! (and I do hope you will eventually feel like finishing this story)

** I have to say, one of the greatest parts of Barefoot was the character building regarding Dumbledore and Harry. Their relationship is impossible to describe properly as terms like 'friends' or 'companions' and the like seem so fragile and even weak. The best term I can think of off the top of my head would be 'platonic intimacy'. I feel like you've written their relationship so well, which is not something I can say about many fanfics, though that is not particularly surprising considering how well you have woven the intricate pieces of this story into a beautiful tapestry.

I hope you are doing well and will continue to do so, and I hope you don't give up writing altogether.

I also hope that in the future, be it in 3 years, or in 10, that I receive an email telling me that barefoot has updated once more, even if it is only to say that it will be no longer be continued.

I wish you the best,

farewell.

I love having Dumbledore in my stories, and i like to see the protagonists interact with him on a human level rather than him being 'the light leader' or whatever, something i imagine wouldn't be too common in his life. I'm so proud of how Harry and Dumbledore so naturally connected when i was writing it in the early days, so the foreboding future they could see together along with the solemn comfort they took in each other's company.

** You may not see this, as it is a little late, but this is my all-time favorite HP fanfic (The second being a Black Comedy of course.). You understand moderation while also giving us a taste of what Telemetry can do for someone. I was initially confused by Tonks and Hedwig dynamic but I grew to understand and enjoy it. This story is a work of art, I really love the ideas that you have put into it. I have read it many times, every month or so, returning to start at the beginning because I couldnt remember which chapter was the last I had seen. Every time it was just as interesting to read as the first. I understand the abhorrence that an author can hold for his work, but understand that this is a fantastic way to use the universe and lore of Harry Potter while also creating new lore of your own.
