Canon:

-Developing magical technologies, like Time Turners

-Hall of Prophecy: Are they supposed to inform subjects of prophecies?

-Researching artefacts like the Veil

-Brains in jars -> Researching magical biology?

Fanon:

-Magical forensics, helping aurors in the high profile cases

-Enormous collection of powerful magical artefacts = "Wizarding Britain's equivalent of a nuclear arsenal", deterrent against war with other magical countries

-Spellcrafting

-Countering Dark Magic, finding out what Voldemort's rituals do

-Horcrux Hunting


** Distracting/occupying potential dark lords. Some dark individuals don't have aspirations to rule the country, they just want to research some seriously illegal or unethical subjects.

Keep 'em in the basement, make sure they remember to eat and sleep occasionally, break up any fights, try to keep them from doing anything /too/ dangerous. Kinda like being a parent.

** According to fanfiction, hunting down and kidnapping anyone who says they time traveled, or looks like they did, if they invented something that seems too "futuristic".

In every other fanfic where Harry goes back in time, he says he can't tell anyone to get help with his situation because he's afraid the Department of Mysteries will get wind of it and catch him to experiment on. It's an obvious excuse to ensure Harry never gets help from an adult and has to solve conflicts on his own, or with the help of his sidekicks... but it's basically the magical equivalent of every superhero novel, where the newly powered-up teenage hero can't go to their parents or teachers because the Pentagon will turn them into the next superweapon.

** In my head I imagine they're a research agency like NASA, CERN, and DARPA. There is also an arm of the organization involved in intelligence gathering and covert operations like the CIA. For example if the research arm needs some artifact, the intelligence arm will find it, take it, and cover their tracks, so it would be a mystery who took it.

*** I've always envisioned the Department of Mysteries as a mix between a research agency and an intelligence agency, just like you said.

On a similar note, I've always thought of hit wizards as the soldiers to the Auror Department's police officers- Aurors being highly trained in crime scene analysis, detective work, and peacekeeping- standard cop duties. Meanwhile, the hit-wizards would be more highly trained in combat, infiltration, and other battlefield skills.

I wish Rowling would have done more with the hit-wizards- as it stands, canon essentially has the wizard NYPD on the front lines against magic ISIS, instead of sending in the military.

**** I kinda have the same view as you do with Aurors and Hit Wizards, but in my head canon I think the Aurors don't deal with standard police duties, they're like the FBI.

I also think of the Hit Wizards as the magic equivalent of muggle special forces, they probably work with the Intelligence arm of the Department of Mysteries as well. Moody would've been in this branch instead of the Aurors, or maybe he could've joined after being too injured to continue with the Hit Wizards.

The third branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement (that doesn't exist in canon) would just be well trained standard officers, they wouldn't be exclusively Hit Wizard wash outs.

** A friend and I discussed this years ago, and we liked to theorize what else they could study. Dreams maybe? If they keep brains in jars (which is likely about the biology of magic or effects of spells on the brain), could they manipulate dreams a la Inception? What about the finality of death? Or even speaking to the dead? Hermione doesn't place much stock in divination, but we know (and they know) that it's real; do mediums exist? And then there's other, more philosophical, things - truth, beauty, fear... The possibilities are endless.

** I read a fic where they were called Unspeakables because they did unspeakably horrific things in the name of research and controlling the population.

The fic itself was rather mediocre towards the end, it was a Harry/Luna/Hermione one where they ended up becoming fae?? But the DoM being monstrous was something that stuck with me
