I read this Snape/OC studen fanficition years ago, about 6 or 7 or so. I remember a lot about it but I cannot, for the life of me, find it. Especially with how many different fanficitons there are so hopefully you can help.

Firstly, the fanficiton was published on fanfiction.net. It even had a youtube trailer about it that had the song Cosmic Love by Florence and the Machine in the background and clips from Sweeney Todd mixed with Harry Potter (Only the Alan Rickman bits) and some fan filming.

Now for the story. The girl is a Slytherin prefect who ends up in a relationship with Severus Snape (Though I never read far enough but I remember the prologue). And she's basically immune to the obliviate spell because her sibling used to do it to her a lot when she was a little kid. It's set before Harry Potter comes into the picture. one of the chapters is about how she sneaks out to go see a concert, if I remember right. And she ends up being in his advanced potions class where it's just them two. It's a long story, if I remember correctly. One of the things I remember about it is that they had a reference to the Rolling Stones, one of the students called them turning pebbles.

If you've got any idea what it is, please do tell. It's been like an ear-worm for me.


** I feel the need to ask how old she is in the fic...

*** I'm like 99% sure it was her last year and she was 18. Plus at that time Snape was what...late 20s? Still iffy but it's killing me because I never finished and it's the most annoyingly persistent thing in my mind. Don't ask why...
