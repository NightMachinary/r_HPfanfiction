** Linkffn(Pygmalion)

It's super dark and bleak but it's one of my favorite fanfics. Tom Riddle travels forward into the future on accident and begins to take over the world during Hermione's seventh year. People are super OOC but the whole premise of the story is that he turns them all dark.

There's another one where Hermione travels back in time that's really good but I don't remember the name. I remember there's Grindelwald and Slytherin and Dumbledore involved in Europe and at one point Tom takes out a hundred trees in a hissy fit. Does anyone else remember what I'm talking about?

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

Where Hermione, Harry, Ginny and Draco travel back in time together? I definitely remember that scene with the trees in there.

** linkffn("War Paint") - Hermione receives the diary in second year instead of Ginny. Its pretty canon compliant and the way they meet is actually plausible unlike Pygmalion and other pretty popular ones

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  The war is over, the good guys have won, and Hermione Granger goes to sleep in her lovely flat only to wake up in 1953 in the bed of someone she'd really much rather were dead. "I'm working on the 'kill Lord Voldemort now, work out the temporal paradox issues later' plan," she tells him. He laughs. Tomione. COMPLETE

** Tomione as a genre casts a very broad net - are you searching for horror? Modern AU that explores a sinister Tom? Romance?

I notice as a ship there's a huge variation on how writers tell a story with those two. The first one I enjoyed which is an AU where hermione finds tom's diary rather than Ginny, made a big impression on me. linkao3(1731827)

  She had checked.  [ ALTERNATIVELY - Hermione finds Tom Riddle's diary, but not everything is different. ]
