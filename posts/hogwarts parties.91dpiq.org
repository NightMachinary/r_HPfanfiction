did the students ever throw parties?(besides quidditch victory parties) i would think they would but where in hogwarts would they even throw parties? or would they not throw parties? any ideas?? i would like to potentially write a fanfic with some partying in it but im just not sure where in hogwarts / if people even had parties in hogwarts.


** Slughorn hosted more than a few parties, Harry even went to one.

I imagine the more popular students with birthdays in the school year had them though we didn't really see any save Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party, the books were decent at not putting in too much filler save romances that didn't go anywhere like Chang.

I imagine the older students threw the wizarding equivalent of keggers- especially Griff's and Claws- their heads of houses were hands off to ignore/not help with massive bullying campaigns against Harry and Luna, they would have likely missed parties as well. Snape too I can't see caring all too much if it was his precious snakes partying as long as it doesn't reflect badly on him- IE don't get caught.

Edit: One fic that featured what parties might be like in every house that I recommend you read for research is linkffn(6966314) DOOM Day, one of my favorite crack fics, in which Harry gets stuck in a time loop on the day he and members of the DA go to the ministry to rescue Harry's Dogfather.

**** Year 2- Heir of Slytherin bullshit, and year 4, Triwizard tournament bullshit.

I suppose cannon wasn't as bad- fanfiction tends to exaggerate them both.

Of course, there's also the bullying from Snape and Umbridge to deal with, the later Potter's literally being tortured and gets told by his head of house to keep his head down and shut up basically. I'm not a fan of the cat lady or the midget.

***** I agree about fifth year for sure. But fourth year, Gryffindor was totally with Harry. They threw him a party the night his name was drawn. The whole "Gryffindor kicks out Harry" storyline bothered me because rather than exaggerate something, it blatantly contradicts canon.

Year 2 is hard to put a pin in, mostly because it's really overlooked how afraid a lot of people are. It seems less like bullying and more like a general distrust and fear of Harry

** Common rooms, mostly (at least this is canonically the case for Gryffindors). I'll bet that abandoned classrooms or even the RoR would be good places as well.

  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.
