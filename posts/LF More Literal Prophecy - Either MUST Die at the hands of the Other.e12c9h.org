Harry and Voldemort literally being invulnerable except to each other. As in every death eater at once could cast Avada + Fiendfyre + every spell they have, and Harry would walk through it unscathed as if they did nothing, but Voldemort and Harry could kill each other with literally any method as long as they were directly doing it themselves, and not ordering others to do it. So Either MUST die at the hands of the other

** There was a theory that said that the real sacrifice Harry made wasn't to go die at Voldermort's hand but that after Voldermort dies, Harry won't be able to die anymore as it could only happen at the hand of Voldemort. And in the end the real sacrifice is that he never will be able to join his loved ones in death and will be cursed to see them all grow old and die and he will roam the universe til the end of times.

** The first time the killing curse deflected off baby Harry and struck an almost fatal blow to Lord Voldemort. Why did it not kill the dark lord, well that is rather simple. Either must die at the hamds of the other. Hands, not forehead, not a wand but hands. This time the curse comes towards Harry and he catches it, Voldemort never saw it coming.

** Nah, I don't like it. The more traditional way is way better, in that either MUST die at the hands of the other, but even if say, Lucius Malfoy cast a Killing Curse at Harry a Dobby will always appear to blast him down the hallway (hate to use a movie reference). Basically, that if anyone can have a shot at either Harry or Voldemort circumstances (which could have been set in motion months or years earlier) will prevent that. It's magic after all. It can manipulate events over decades or we wouldn't have prophecies at all.

But, if you want it... There were some, I'll have to search a bit, cause it's not a very popular idea.
