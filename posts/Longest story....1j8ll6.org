What's the longest story/series of stories that you've read and liked?

Mine would have to be the Resonance, Revolution and Resolution trilogy by GreenGecko totaling at 1,713,478 words.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]] This story weighs in at a whopping 1,193,806 words at the moment and is still going. It takes place across all seven years in an alternate universe where the Potters ran away and Voldemort won the war completely.

**** The synopsis is given below. The fic is an expansive AU that examines the natures of Dark and Light magic and morality. It's heavy on angst but brilliant in world-building. Although it was not my favorite fic (it has its weaknesses like any other fic), I thoroughly enjoyed it and would certainly encourage you to see if you like the story. It is quite a beast, which could be good or bad. If you really like it, you've got reading material for /weeks/ (months even). If you aren't digging the story, the length will probably dissuade you from continuing.

***** I have heard that it is incredibly angsty and I couldn't stand the 5th HP canon book, do you think it is worth trying this?

****** I do think the type of angst it contains is different from the angst in OOTP. It's hard to say... If you generally dislike angst (especially recurring angst that takes a long time to resolve), then this is definitely not for you. To compare, the fifth book has always been my favorite HP book, and I thought the angst in the fic was alright, although I couldn't really stand reading a lot in one sitting. The story may not be for you

** This is hard, as stories that long tend to start suffering from bloat and lack of focus (and my willingness to read a million words has, unfortunately, waned over the years). A few longer stories/series not yet mentioned in the thread that I enjoyed enough at the time to finish:

[[http://abraxan.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#Harry__Ginny][Abraxan's]] The Refiner's Fire and Time of Destiny might appeal to some. Over-long, sappy, melodramatic, and a bit far on the whole "boost Harry to eleven" scale, it'll appeal to those who prefer canon pairings and enjoy soap-opera-like hospital scenes. >1M words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns to come to terms with the death of Sirius. As he heals and grows emotionally, he learns how to enjoy life again. But there's a war on, and Voldemort's primary objective is to kill Harry Potter, by any means necessary. As a result, Harry and his friends have a very adventurous sixth year at Hogwarts. Canon-based with some OC.
#+end_quote

[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#HarryHermione][Bobmin's]] Sunset/Sunrise Over Britain. Another "dial Harry to eleven" tale, this one Harry/Hermione. >1M words, complete. Does fall into tropes, including Ron the Death Eater and Mustache-Twirling Dumbledore. The story hasn't aged well, though some might like it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life at the end of his 5th year was in utter chaos and his life was not going to get any better any time soon. From the flames, a brotherhood thought dead will reemerge, a family will break, trust will be destroyed, an enemy will change their path, a father will finally be found, a love will bring hope, and a hero shall rise from the ashes to become the legend he was born to be.
#+end_quote

Bexis1's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] is readable. Another (eventual) Harry/Hermione pairing, the story really should have been broken up. 1.1M+ words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Sixth year fic. Examines H/Hr in context of his unwanted wealth and fame, and her need for independence. H struggles for magical control over a mysterious, powerful fifth element, receives an inheritance and has a dalliance that ends in disaster.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][Joe6991's]] Hero Trilogy. An old story, canon pairings. Dimension-travelling Harry. Joe was finding his narrative voice in this and those who have read his later stuff will recognize the progression of his prose by the end of the third novel. 1M+ words, complete. Yet another of the "dial Harry up to eleven and turn him loose against existential threats that make canon Voldemort look like a kitten" ilk. For those who don't know him, Joe's an award winning professional writer; he makes good words.

#+begin_quote
  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza's]] Denarian series (Renegade, Knight, Lord, Apocalypse), 700k words, complete (effectively--one can easily read up to Lord and stop). A Dresden Files crossover where a young Harry picks up a blackened Denarius coin and becomes host to a fallen angel. Readable even if one hasn't read Butcher's Dresden Files.

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

**** You can definitely feel the length with this one since it is one story, less than one year, and maybe 1.5 million words. I only made it to Chapter 56 before giving up. It is good though, worth reading as much of it as you can.

** The Draco Trilogy when Cassandra Clare was Cassandra Claire and fanfiction writer rather than a novelist. 895, 000 words,

I read this as it was released and I think it is still the best in my mind. You can literally watch as her writing got better and better as the stories progressed. I compare all alternate universe fics to this one, and I compare all OOC Draco Malfoy characters to her Draco Malfoy.

The controversy that surrounded this story and Cassandra Claire wasn't something I was interested in back then, just wanted to read the story. For newer readers of Harry Potter fanfiction you can learn about the controversy [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Draco_Trilogy#Plagiarism_Controversy][here]]

I re-read this fanfic whenever I can find it online, the last time being within the last 6 months, but now that link is down as well. I'll try to find a site that has it and post the link.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/100447/Miranda-Flairgold][Miranda Flairgold.]]

Comes in at 626,588 words over two completed parts and the unfinished (looks abandoned) third part. Awesome read that I've reread once or twice.

Also since the question related to something else I've read...

It's not Harry Potter, but the (Ranma 1/2) Just Won't Die series by Jeffrey "Oneshot" Wong is fricking amazing. It's ridiculously long. Like, a couple days of nonstop reading marathon long. If you happen to be into Ranma and really long/good stories I'd check it out.
