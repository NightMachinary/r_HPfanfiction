I can't imagine going back 20 years and living my life. I mean everything is better right now (well not exactly right now but...). You may argue that Wizarding world is isolated but a thousand years should change everything.

​

Also imagine redoing your life and interactions. Do you really want to sit and watch the most boring re-runs? Talk to children for extended amount of time? Do you even remember what you ate for breakfast yesterday?

Following canon in any way shape or form is abhorrent!

/\/But harry's a perfect occlumens!**

/bUt haRrY'S A PeRfECt oCClUmenS!/


** So... What's the discussion here as the tag suggests?

There are lot of people here who'd give almost anything to be able to do that, don't judge/comment on that till you've been in their shoes!

Or is this just another rant about time travel fics? I can support that definitely cause it is unreal being able to remember everything even after 20 years, let alone 100+

** I think the problem is that in many cases Harry is going back to correct things that went wrong and that filled him with regret. Since those things in canon happened when Harry was 11-17 that's the age/timeframe he has to go back to. For example, keeping Pettigrew from escaping in third year, Cedric from dying in fourth year and stopping Voldemort's resurrection, losing Sirius in 5th year, etc. And then of course, whatever twists the writer adds to the story like Hermione dying etc.

In many cases Harry yearns to go back but is unable until "x" happens. Eg he dies, finally figures out long time travel etc. The key is how miserable Harry is because he couldn't prevent something and how much he desperately wants to change it is why he's willing to jump so far back in time.

** I agree after a 1000 years he should have made his peace with what happened is probably looking forward to moving on and seeing everybody again rather going back

** I'm currently 23, I think the earliest time where I can properly remember a lot of details is 18 ish; although even that's sorta stretching it. If he's a thousand he /maybe/ remembers Ron and Hermione. Maybe.

** Recently I was thinking something similar about time travelling back just a 100 years - in the 'redo, back in your own younger body' scenario.

Imagining a 120yr old re-living their life as an 11 year old (or younger) is kinda creepy and it seems like a very challenging approach from a writing perspective. I do still read the stories, cause I love the'time travel/redo' trope, but I do tend to ignore all references to the characters previous age.

Personally I think the ideal age bracket to stage a time travel event is the 17 to 25 range, when rational thinking is still finishing up (in a brain developmental context) so teenage recklessness still feels realistic.

Also from my own personal perspective, daydreams about redoing my teenagers years changed from guilty pleasure to horror around my late 20's lol. I can honestly say now, in my early 30's, that I couldn't think of anything worse than being a kid or teenager again.

Of course no judgement for whatever a writer chooses, different ages and time periods bring different elements to the plot.

** I'd be interested in reading more thousand-years-old-Harry-travels-back fics, actually. But only if they were done properly. Like, imagine a thousand years of experience, compared to the ten to twenty that his 'present day' friends would have. The immense personality gulf between him and them would be really hard to cross, and reading a properly-done fic (other than A Long Journey Home for the twenty-third time) where Harry has to deal with that would be really interesting.

Fuck that! I would replay it differently. Hell, a thousand years old? The sorting hat would likely shout HEADMASTER! and Dumbledore gets ejected out of his ostentatious throne.

FIFTY POINTS TO HEADMASTER!

​

In all seriousness, if I was a thousand years old, I would be forever sneaking into the Headmaster's office to steal the Hat. "uhhhhhh, what happens next?" "Oh, time to go slap a Quirrel then..." "Okay, now what? Oh, I should probably write all of this down..."
