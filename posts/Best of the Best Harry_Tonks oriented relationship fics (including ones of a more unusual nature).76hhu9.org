I am looking for your best of the best Harry/Tonks fics. I have read a few recently and am looking for more (just finished "Like Grains of Sand...").

However, while I am happy to be recommended traditional Honks fics, I am even more interested in more unusual ones.

For example:

- A Honks from Tonks perspective (as its more often from Harry's).

- A Honks where Tonks or Harry time travels (like the one I just finished).

- A Harry/Tonks/Hermione*(or insert another female here) relationship (or even Harry/Tonks+multi one).

- A Honks where Tonks age or other aspects are altered for whatever reason (drifting away from canon Tonks basically).

- A Honks where they are dark, or gray, or not their canon selves.

- A Honks where they keep their relationship completely secret.

You get the picture.

Basically, I am looking for the best of the best Honks stories, but am especially interested in ones that fall outside the typical path or a follow a "tame" canon Honks story.

I would prefer Mature+ fics. I would prefer no main character slash. I am fine with smut/lemons but would prefer plot come first. There is very little I would be offended by.

Thanks all!

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

***** I thought so. Could you explain that bit to me? That was my biggest problem with the whole fic and the issues it created kinda turned me off, I can't remember if I finished this fic or not.

For one thing, it seems pointless, like it was a literary device to create conflict out of nothing. The original reason for why they did it was something like "We need a solution now, this is the best we got", which would be fine, except for the fact that the solution was /not/ the best solution they had. One of the worst. Even setting that aside, they kept bringing stuff up about problems the Simulacrum was causing and then it never really built up to anything except for a certain death. After that it was forgotten and I guess he had free reign.

******* It's been a while since I read RC last, but IIRC it was a way to let Harry get out of Hogwarts and fool anyone trying to follow him or w/e. Plus, you know, plausible deniability. "I wasn't there and you can't prove it". I think it was mentioned that simulamancy was the perfect disguise, even with all the stuff magic can do like Polyjuice and self-transfiguration. Plus it involved Tonks' blood, which lead to some not-directly-spelled out implications that something went really wrong, as in the whole HIS NAME IS HARRY POTTER thing. As a subplot, it was left without closure, but I thought it might have been explored in the sequel before it was abandoned.

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

** I love the Honks concept, and beyond Summer of Change this is probably my favorite. ffn(8175132) Jamie Evans and Fates Fool is a Honks story with a reality skipping Harry who ends up gender-bent in this reality. Personally I'm not a fan of those stories, but this one was recommended often enough that I gave it a shot, and I'm very happy I did.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Since most of the Honks fics i've read i've found by turning on the favorites filter with tonks selected in the character filter, and don't see why you can do the same, I'll reccomend (Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror) which is discontinued and no longer on ffn. Google it its still on many sites. Features a well characterized tonks and a slow building relationship.
