I read this on FF.net several years ago. I've tried searching for it, but it has completely disappeared. I wonder if the author may have gotten signed for a publishing deal, so her stories were taken down... The title may have been "Sorcerer" or "Sorceress" with a brief description along the lines of "Hermione Granger is a witch. By the time she's done, the whole world will know it."

A marriage law was passed down and Granger married Snape. She's at Hogwarts (as an apprentice/8th year student?) and starts working with Pureblood girls to get a hold of their knowledge/books and begins an operation of creating book dowries for half-blood/muggleborn girls. In the midst of this, she is working to destroy horcruxes, has subconscious/shared dreams with Harry and Ron, and learning about ancient magic.

I have distinct memory that Granger publishes an encyclopedia-esque book with a mini Snape as the snarky helper/paperclip, briefly attends muggle university and tries to get a broom to fly in a simulator, and later assumes the position of Lord of Light, with Snape swearing fealty to her. There's a final battle, after which she sends a message through all her books about a safe haven where the marriage law magic does not work due to something about separate magic network?

There was a sequel that was still in progress about the actual safe haven itself and has similarly disappeared with no traces.

If anyone would share where I can re-read this story or why it's completely missing, I would appreciate it greatly!!
