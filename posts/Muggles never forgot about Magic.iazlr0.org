After the implementation of the International Statute of Secrecy, Muggles were supposed to forget magic existed, but they didn't. They merely forgot their hostility towards magic. Of course, wizards thought all magic was erased from muggle minds.

5 years after the Statute was put in place, a new lesson was added. Wizard Studies! From ages 12-17, muggles would learn about Magic and their Wizarding neighbors.

This ruse went on until 1992, when one Dudley Dursley saw what class he had for 4th block.
