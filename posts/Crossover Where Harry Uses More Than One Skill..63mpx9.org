You know how every crossover has Harry only using one skill and maybe British wand wizard magic. Like sometimes he turns into a mutant learns magic becomes an alien of some sort and surpasses tony starks technological intelligence but only ever uses wand magic or maybe mutant power. Fuck that, us real handsome people don't care how shitty, how large the harem, how many alternate names, how much of a sue the MC is, or how many people get bashed. we need a fic where he learns all sorts of things and uses all sorts of skills. turn him into a Kryptonian let him learn fma style alchemy let him learn Kryptonian magic teach him to use the force make him sorcerer supreme say that he is an omega level mutant stick radiation into him so he can do cool shit turn him into a fucking make him a goddamn white lantern if you have to hell use the hallows to do it. JUST MAKE HIM USE THE DAMN SKILLS MAN.

Point is in crossovers harry only ever uses like one or two skills. That's fucking lame as shit. Do you know where we can find any crossovers that are not lame as shit for only using one skill.

*** YOSH and it is of such a YOUTHFUL^{tm} length. I hope that this such YOUTHFUL^{tm} fic can provide me with */at least it's better than tv/*^{tm} mental sustenance for a most YOUTHFUL^{tm} time period.

Besides. It's nasuverse!

**** It sounds like I should remind you that 'Boruto' had its first episode air in Japan on Wednesday. If you got a crunchy roll account you could watch the English Sub on the site.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
