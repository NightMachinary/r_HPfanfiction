... pop out a sprog, kill the soul, put my hocrux in it and when I die of old age start the whole thing from the top. O.O --> immortality b*tches. Just a random thought I had.


** If I were Voldemort, I would not have bothered with the horcruxes in the first place, or not until I had full control of the British wizarding world.

I have a nagging suspicion that making horcruxes negatively affects one's decision making skills, even though the process does not diminish one's magical power or intelligence. Voldemort had become indeed extremely powerful after going through all these magical experimentations and transformations, but I think that he could have achieved far more or caused far greater damages if he pursued the 'Palpatine Route'.

Palpatine hid under Yoda's (a wise figure akin to Dumbledore) nose for decades, steadily corrupting the Senate (Wizengamot), creating conflicts that had Jedis (Aurors, the Order) confused and the public scared, seizing the position of Supreme Chancellor (Minister of Magic) as a sympathy figure, playing both sides of the conflict as a puppet master, thinning out the ranks of Jedis in a war he controlled, successfully turning the Chosen One due his love for his mother and wife, and eliminating his enemies in one fell stroke.

If Palpatine didn't turn his back to the parent whose kid he was torturing, he would still be ruling the galaxy.

** I think this question deserves two types of answers depending on how you mean it; Am I (A) Me with his power set? Or (B) Him with my methodology?

In either case, I'd do one metric butt-ton more research into horcruxes before trying to make one at 16. Immortality is nice, but an eternity as a crazy person incapable of proper emotions doesn't sound pleasant.

A) I don't think I want to rule the world, or even Wizarding Britain.

It either sounds like either far too much work, or small potatoes. If I woke up tomorrow in the body of an 11 year old Tom Riddle on his way to Hogwarts I'd set my sights on beating the muggles to the moon. From there, the rest of space. E=MC^{2} only remains relevant when you can't enchant something so that M = 5 independent of how much fuel you cram into your magically expanded fuel tanks.

B) If you instead mean how would I accomplish the goal he picked?

If I set out to conquer the world as a powerful immortal wizard... I'd become Dumbledore. I'd cultivate an image of a academic/intellectual researcher type (See my above project) who wants to learn more about magic. I'd act surprised when I failed to die of old age (Assuming Horcruxes even work that way, I suspect I may need to mimic Palpatine's self cloning operation as well as having the horcrux to handle being murdered) Wait until the entire populace sees you as a force of nature that simple IS while slowly building up your political base until it's functionally impossible not to have a vote go your way. (Also helpful if you can resist the urge to meddle in the minor things) (Arguably, Tom tried thisbut Albus wouldn't hire him as the DADA professor because Tom couldn't keep control of his snake, and should consider that as or more embarrassing that the usual way that euphemism runs)

Magic lets you sidestep a lot of the problems inherent in spaceflight. Effectively zero mass fuel is insane. You can also replicate food, create water, vanish waste off into the ether... Now I kinda wanna read a scifi HP fic that isn't a crossover, where they start a magical space program and go exploring.

**** ... I'm probably going to feel compelled to eventually write that fic if you don't come back and tell me you found one.

Also: You left out the important questions of about /how/ does magic bleeping work?

Is there magic in space or does the mystical energy come from something about the earth?

Clearly the first step is to send up some sort of probes to test this before risking Wizarding lives... namely my own.

** Make my horcruxes from small, easily overlooked objects that I could keep around my home without suspicion; an old shirt shoved into the back of a drawer, a book picked at random from a giant library. I'd cover them with spells to keep them safe, stop them from deteriorating, and other general maintenance spells and light magic to mask the dark magic within, so that if anyone examined them they'd just see something that had been given a bit of extra protection; perhaps a little over the top, but certainly not suspicious. I'd cover other objects with the same light spells to make them blend in well. I'd also put notice-me-not spells on the horcruxes so people didn't want to look too closely.

Then, my pièce de rèsistance. I would gather beautiful objects from my family, the house founders, leaving a trail of bodies as I did so. I would put the darkest enchantments I knew upon them so they reeked of darkness and death; dark magic leaves a trace, easy enough to cover, but I'd pretend I didn't know how. I'd use a very mild cloaking spell on them, so it looked like I'd at least attempted, but make sure they were still radiating evil. I would make sure the enchantments flared up when they were threatened, or simply opened, and that they were grand and dramatic and unmissable.

A book that contains a spectre of my former self, channeling a little poison into their body through contact with the pages until they slowly go mad.

A ring containing an unstoppable curse that will rapidly deteriorate the body, and an echo of my laugh.

A locket with a boggart tethered to it, and a curse that will make the wearer miserable and weak, before revealing their greatest fears upon opening.

A cup that would poison any who drank from it, and release a flood of dark energy if destroyed.

A diadem whose powers were corrupted to drive the wearer mad with conflicting lies, where once it would give only knowledge and truth. A spectral light show included upon destruction.

Each of these I protect with powerful spells that will stop them being destroyed by anything other than basilisk venom, or fiendfyre. I hide them, in places connected to my past, or to my followers, covered with dark enchantments to make them difficult, but not impossible to retrieve. If these enchantments happen to torture or incapacitate my enemies, all the better. I make sure to give one to a follower with a link to Hogwarts, tell him to sneak it in, right under Dumbledore's nose when the time is right. I make sure to drop hints to my bumbling but affectionate potions teacher, asking about the horcruxes I am already expert on, mentioning the "sacred number seven", as though such things would matter to a boy who grew up in a muggle orphanage. Eventually I will have my followers terrorize him, chase him back to Dumbledore at the right time to drop these hints. I create one final "horcrux" in the form of my loyal pet snake, who I can control easily with paseltongue, and add a spell which will make her blood fester and smoke upon her death.

Finally, the boy. My "seventh horcrux". I am not stupid enough to act on half a prophecy, I certainly found out the entire thing before acting, and the idea that Dumbledore truly believes a toddler will be my undoing is too good not to act on. I am aware that the prophecy may apply to either the Potter boy or the Longbottom boy, and I will "mark" one; I chose the Potters mostly as it gives me an excuse to kill Lily Potter and turn Severus against me.

Make no mistake, I do my research before allowing anyone into my inner circle, I have no doubt that he is in love with her and will turn to Dumbledore the second I mutter the curse. This is good. It gives me a way of feeding the right information to Dumbledore through my "most trusted servant". Severus has already told me of James Potter and his three best friends. I'm sure the Potters are under a fidelius curse, just a matter of torturing those three until they give me what I need; best to start with Pettigrew, he seems the weakest and will crack easily. Perhaps I can make him my spy, or at least put him under a strong Imperius.

Once Pettigrew has spilled, I go to the Potters personally. I send Bella and a few lesser followers to the Longbottoms, having already gleamed their address from their secret keeper. I tell them not to harm the boy, but to torture his parents into insanity, so he will know better than to ever defy me. Perhaps he will come of use some day; the Potter boy certainly will. I kill his parents, giving Lily a chance to live so that the child will be protected by mother's love, and keep him safe until he is old enough to be of use to me. Then I prick both our fingers and rub his blood into mine; our shared blood will stop the protection from affecting me. I mark his head with a curse scar, essentially a modified dark mark; it will allow me to create a passage from his mind to mine, to see and hear what he's seeing, to share emotions, even to channel my powers through him if need be. When that's done, I blow up the house (making sure not to harm the kid in the process) and I apparate away to a safehouse in (also under a fidelius charm, performed by an imperiused witch or wizard already assumed dead who I will keep around as a servant. I'll let people think I'm dead for about 10 years, and spend my time researching the Deathly Hallows, and plotting ways to take down Dumbledore and my other enemies.

** That seems a bit short-sighted. The horcrux child can keep its soul and grow into its power. It would always know that it was wanted and would be an unwavering ally, since the child's mind would always be open to you and could be possessed at will should your own body be destroyed.

** Horcruxes (Horcruxi?) never strike me as a logical method of achieving immortality, based of my own thoughts of how a soul or Life/Death works from a magical perspective.

I've always thought that a soul is more like a box. It contains (or links the body to) ones memories and magic. Perhaps even soul bound items if you can figure out how to do that.

If this were the case, splitting your soul would diminish your overall magical capacity and shatter/damage both memories and the psyche, leading to personality disorders such as megalomania, which I'm pretty sure Voldemort had.

It could also explain why ghosts could be seen; their prior magic sustaining some form of illusion at the cost of their magic reserves. Where usually depleted magic reserves would refilled from ones life energy, a ghost is usually tethered to location and feeds of the naturally generated magic there.

Placing a part of your soul in your newly born child would basically mean that a child grows up with memories already in place, but without the developed brain functionality to access them, and while they develop and grow to being able to access these memories they form some of their own, changing the soul within them and becoming a new person (who most likely won't step aside so that you can live). This also why I feel memory charming people is killing them slightly, and remaking someone you prefer (if you alter memories) since our personality and reactions are based off of our memories.

The two best ideas for immortality I can think of are; you can make a phylactery and artificial body (possibly clone your own repeatedly). With your soul safe elsewhere and a replaceable body you can control remotely you can essentially do whatever you want.

The other method is becoming a Necromancer. Necromancers have two main skills/functions they develop while learning; communing with the dead, and the manipulation of life energy. By drawing in life energy from other people, animals, and fauna you can essentially stop or even reverse your aging process.
