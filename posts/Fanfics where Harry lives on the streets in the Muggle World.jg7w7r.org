I've been seeing this around this Reddit under different names so I wondered if there was a specific one for the theme? Basically any fic recs, preferably long length and complete or recently updated, where Harry runs away from the Dursley's and lives on the streets in the muggle world. Can be anywhere not just Britain. Ships are fine but no harem pls they gross me out

I've seen some good ones around that are written by British authors and are thus very believable, but I forgot the names


** linkffn( Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) is close. Harry lives in the woods.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Dumbledore expected a weak Harry who lived with the Dursley's. He was not expecting a Harry who grew up on the streets and has no interest in playing a hero. After being abandoned in America by the Dursley's Harry learnt to survive using his brains and magic. Dumbledore, Hermione and select Weasley bashing.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

** “Sky by Dalnim” linkffn(9355381), but I have to admit I haven't finished it.

I still dream about somebody picking up “Street-Smart by 3.1415926535897932384626433383” linkffn(12278819) and gives us good HP/Oliver Twist crossover, but I haven't found anything like it yet. Modesty Barebone is so awesome character and it is pity she got lost.

  AU. Harry Potter was abandoned by the Dursleys to the streets and later found by an Unspeakable, who tells him of his identity, inheritance and destiny. Under a new name Harry sets out to right the wrongs that has been done to him. Wolfstar slash later in the story.

** linkffn(11483808). Harry is living on the streets, falls in with a Fagin-type.

linkffn(5362578). Lily's mother provides Harry's protection; he's living on the streets.

linkffn(642799). Orphanage/street kid Harry has a traumatic past.

linkffn(12011689). Harry gets amnesia, lives on the streets for a week before he's found. Not a runaway-from-Dursleys story.

linkffn(13541079). Harry runs off, lives on the streets.

**** I didn't know that; it's on my "get around to reading someday" list.

I've done a search the first chapter, though, and can't find anything that includes more than "nig," which is found four times as part of the word, "night." I couldn't find "n-word" or "n word" in searches, either. Are you thinking of a different one than the obvious? And is Harry actually using it in an insulting manner, or using it in a context such as, "I've run across this word. What does it mean?"

I probably won't get around to reading this one, though, because I ran across more profanity than I care for in the first half of the chapter.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.
