I'm looking for a good smart/magically powerful harry Potter fic rn. Idc what house he's in as long as he's at least magically powerful. All the usual places have been kinda dug out, so I'm looking in outside sources.


** linkffn(Honor Thy Blood) A magically powerful war based fic. One of my favorite docs that i have read, it's written pretty well and doesn't fall into shit tones of cliches.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
