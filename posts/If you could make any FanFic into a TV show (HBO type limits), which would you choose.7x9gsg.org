** A Black Comedy - a lot of its chaos, slapstick, sex related humor would play well on screen. Characters are not so obscure compared to most fics. Most characters other than Harry are pretty in character. The duel between Voldemort and Harry + Sirius would be amazing to watch. Harry's little trick with the arms would have so many cool special effects. It would have great merchandising opportunities. The story is segmented in a way that would work for an episodic mini-series.

Hell, when you read this fic, it already reads very visually, camera shots and choices wouldn't even be that difficult.

***** I enjoy it for its more realistic reaction to a snake that kills on sight being loose in a school of children. It would make a ton of sense to close the school and make sure there isn't another one.

I also feel its less a competent government and more a few competent people/departments that the HP community as a whole generally feel are competent. Amelia Bones, without any real canon support besides her murder, is generally viewed as being competent and a threat to Fudge's administration. The same with the Department of Mysteries and Croaker.

There's also seeing a good-guy manipulative Dumbledore get out maneuvered and called out for getting stuck in one way of thinking.

All that said, you are correct that everyone is slightly too competent/aware/lucky and far too many potential problems are resolved.

Still its a story that I have in my Google and Calibre libraries and I hope to see a sequel/resolution of the main Voldemort story line someday.

** Harry potter and icecream delights. A sweet Harry/Luna romance fanfic. Its a bit out of character but i do love it and a well acted slice of life show would be awesome.

Harry Potter Geth. Mass effect and Harry Potter cross over into a somewhat absurd power fantasy where magic and space age technology meet clash and mix. Seeing Mass Effect's universe done properly in live action would be awesome.

Or just about any action Anime style game or show/ HP. Im a combat junkie and HP when it has a crossover generally seems to focus mostly on the combat. So theres a ton of options out there, just off the top of my head though i would probably want to see Fates Gamble. A MASSIVELY OP HP/ Fate stay night fanfic, where by the end of the first story it would not be inaccurate to call Harry a god.

**** That really depends on what you mean by 'Good' i dont really pay attention to quality of writing or tropes. A fanfic gets a good job from me if it makes me giddy and is fun/filled with awesome moments. So while i can recommend fics for you i cant say if you or anyone would find them good.

Fates Gamble

FateProphecy-Break

Harry Potter and the Eclipse Princess

Queen of Conquerors

The Golden King and Harry Potter

The old version of 'A Broken Wizard and a Broken Magus' i haven't tried the newer version yet.

Harry Potter and the Counter Guardian

Approaching disaster.

Gorgon and Thanatos, was decent but i havent kept up to date.

Many people also enjoy the Matou Shinji series but iv never tried it, i hate the base character too much for me to even try a fanfic where he is the MC.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
