Imprison is a skill that prevents the opponent from using moves that the Imprison user also knows. So a Spell version would be terrifyingly overpowered. "Oh, you know the exact same spells as me. Imprison. Congratulations you're now effectively a squib for this battle" it'd be a bit cracky, but it could be written well. Maybe it registers any spell your wand has cast, and Dumbledore not having cast the Killing Curse but knowing the Imprison spell would explain why the Death Eaters/Voldemort spam Unforgivables and not using any variety. It could lead to a plot of Harry trying to find every spell Voldemort has ever cast, even going as far as to use the Dark ones just once, so he can block out Voldemort's abilities.


** "Do you really believe you can beat me, the greatest wizard to ever be born."

"Yes Tim, and I will prove it to you."

"My name isn't Tim. /Crucio."/

"/Imprison/"

"What.. /Crucio, Crucio, CRUCIO"/

"Really Tom, have you forgotten what /Imprison/ does? Do you not remember Dumbledore using it"

"/CONFRINGO, AVADA KEDAVRA, FLIPENDO"/

"Really Tom, are you so desperate that you are using spells that I could use in my second year."

"I AM IMMORTAL, POTTER. YOU CAN'T KILL ME"

"Are you talking about your Horcruxes? If so they are all destroyed."

"How..?"

"It's time for you to go Tom." And just to add insult to injury "Flipendo."

I'm sorry, I can't Harry doing that much research. Maybe him finding the spell by accident. And then....

"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione! Hermione!"

"WHAT!" Exploded Hermione.

"SHHHHH!" shushed Madam Pince.

"I found this booklet. Named TM44. It has this spell..."

...

Dun Dun Dun duh duh duh Dun dun Duh Duh duh DAAAAAAAAAAAAH

"Hermione! Use Imprison!"

...

I can't take this seriously anymore...

** As with most "clever" spells, it has the problem that if you can hit them with that, you can hit them with a stunner or a blasting curse. To be at all useful, it would have to be a remote voodoo spell, maybe like what Quirrel does to Harry's broom in PS..

** What about the possibility of turning it into a temporary Ward? No one inside can use the Spells on the list at the time of creation. It would go down after a set time, and then the spells can be used again.

I'd keep a gun or two on me if I had that.

*** Most Death Eaters would have the 3 Unforgivables and a Stunner. Voldemort would have the 3 Unforgivables and Fiendfyre. Harry would have Expelliarmus and Expecto Patronum
