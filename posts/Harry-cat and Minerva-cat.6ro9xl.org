Are trere any stories featuring Harry transforming into a cat (animagus or another way) and McGonagall being a cat for Harry? It's just like professor-cat and student-kitten. Maybe they just hang out in their cat forms?

It's just so cute and sweet that I can't get it out of my mind.

This I'd expect as a tag in an NC-17 fic on Ao3 tbh.

*** I just remembered reading a scene scene like this:

"What is your animagus form Mr. Potter, if I may ask?" McGonagall asked.

"Oh, just a cat," said Harry.

And then Harry transforms into a fucking tiger & laughs at his ass out.

.... But your scene sounds better.

** Heh, I was reading about servals (a kind of wild cat species with big ole pointy ears), and the thingy I saw mentioned how the Ancient Egyptians worshipped them for their power and grace.

And while that might sound silly and backwards, remember that in those times, cats, domesticated or not, were pretty good at taking down household pests like mice which would have otherwise eaten precious grain.

Imagine that; when Harry finishes his animagus transformation amazingly early (like the Marauders), Trelawney wanders by and delivers a prophecy about blah blah 'ancient guardians of the great river's grain' and 'legendary foe' and 'forgotten power of the past', Harry and McGonagall end up using their cat animagi forms to research an Ancient Egyptian counterpart to Parseltongue and Parselmagic; Catgotyourmagic from Catgotyourtongue (working title).

Can Peter Pettigrew in his rat form, bolstered by Voldemort's magic to spread pestilence and decay and eat all the potato chips, defeat these two feline masters of lost magic when they wield their massive powers of protection, pest-control, and yarn-ball manipulation?

Not the most engaging story I've ever read, but still a high quality read that is additionally fairly long. The plot is quite unique as well, and I don't remember much bashing happening.

***** No, that happens in this fic.

From chapter 9- And they all think Harry won a war, they thought. At least Andi seemed like the type who was willing to ask the hard questions. Emma flipped to her to-do list, which was growing quite ambitious by now, and, more in frustration than anything else, added the line, Introduce democracy to the Wizarding World.

I don't like stories where Harry or his friends just comes in and thinks they can change the political system because it's "barbaric" or something like that.
