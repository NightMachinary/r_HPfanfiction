I need ficus that I can download on my iPad or iPhone.

I don't mind length, I enjoy dark fics (dark Harry/grey) I enjoy slash.

But I'll read anything as long as it's good


** I don't know if you can download them directly to the ipad/iphone, but presumably you can connect em to a computer and do it that way with [[https://ficsave.com/][ficsave]] the latest in a long line of websites aimed at downloading fanfictions into various ebook formats.

So in short, any.

**** You can open epub files in iBooks, which comes with iOS, so p0ody is fine. If you only want pdf, then ao3 is the place to go.

***** I understand that you can open ePUBs in iBooks (FicSave also sends me ePUBs and those work fine), but there is something about the way that p0ody downloads files that doesn't allow it to work for me. If I want a deleted fic from the archives I have to desktop download and then email the resulting ePUB to myself to access it on my iPad. Dunno why this happens (if it's just me or if it's iOS in general or iOS7 specifically or whatever), but I figured to just tell him which worked for me.

****** Weird, opening epubs straight into ibooks from p0ody has been a-ok on the versions of iOS I have had. @_@
