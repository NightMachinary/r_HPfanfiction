  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Pureblood Pretense is over a million words, I believe. Bit tropey, but Very well-written and engaging. Fantastic world-building and characterisation. linkffn(7613196)

Death Rides a Pale Horse series is lovely, too. Excellent writing and lovely relationships between the characters. My favourite Remus, I think. linkao3(5418194)

I also enjoyed the Very Slytherin Harry series. Interesting Harry, and a fun plot. linkao3(11047995)

There's also the Serpensortia series. It only covers the first three books, but it's sooo good. Linkao3(4913998)

And the secret language of plants series is also lovely. Linkao3(9323225)

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
