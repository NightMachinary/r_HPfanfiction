I would like fics where Harry is dating a younger woman. Obviously this should happen in a post-Hogwarts era. I don't mean like 1 or 2 years younger i mean significantly younger.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Did you not read the description? I agree "significant" is an open ended word, but again, via the implication that it has to be post Hogwarts, they are not looking for 30 year old Harry and 12 year old whoever. They also say younger "woman" implying someone "of age". They are looking most likely for something like 25-40 year old Harry, dating a 16(age of consent in UK)-25 year old woman or so.

And before you go 16!!!. That is the age of consent in the UK, AND we are talking about the Wizarding World here, where to be fair, even younger would likely be accepted. Plus its also likely that the OP, by using the word "woman", actually meant 18+, but regardless, im beginning to ramble ;)

**** I did read the description, that's WHY I was worried. It said post hogwarts Harry and significantly younger women. Post hogwarts means any age after 17, and significantly younger probably meant five or more years.

****** How in the world does that imply both he AND the woman wouldn't be at hogwarts? It says the story should happen in a post hogwarts era, that means the story would happen after Harry graduates from hogwarts. That in no way implies that the woman would have graduated from hogwarts as well.
