I think if I ever signed up for it, I would miserably fail Divination. I just don't feel connected to the ethereal plains of the Spirit Realm or whatever. I think I would do pretty well in Potions, if I wasn't getting detention/points removed for back talking Snape, because I genuinely enjoy Chemistry and lab work.

â€‹

What do you guys think would be your best/worst class?


** Id definitely fail Potions, since the exam requires you to brew a potion from memory, and you obviously gotta memorize a whole bunch of them. I got a crappy memory, at least when it comes to very finesse and detail oriented stuff like Potion making would be. I would most likely excel in DADA and Charms.

** Given a decent textbook, I'm sure I'd ace history easy, just like I did in high school and college. Same would go for other social and/or language based subjects like muggle studies and canon runes.

I'd like to think I'd be good at charms and transfiguration, because I would find it very easy to muster up interest and effort for subjects with immediate practical payout (/spells/).

I'd be absolute shit at potions, herbology and care tho, that's for sure. Handling animal viscera and other repulsive potion ingredients? Manure in the greenhouses? Stinking animals? Fuck that shit, those classes would be nothing but hours spent screaming internally while I try not to show how unreasonably squeamish I am.

I'm unsure about arithmancy and divination. It would depend on whether they have actual applications or not. It's not really clear in canon.

** Charms > Transfiguration > Defense > Potions > Astronomy > Herbology > History

I think with my general type of mindset, I'd excel at charms -- various kinds of utility spells that requires simple focus and correct wandwork to work. Transfiguration requires visualizing the transfiguration process, something I'd definitely feel to be trickier.

Defense generally seem to consist of 2 parts: combative magic and learning how to defend against various magical creatures. I don't think my skillset is worse here, but I find the entire ordeal less interesting than the 2 former subjects. If this is before Voldemort's defeat, we also have the lovely trait of having next to worthless Defense teachers most times (Even if this isn't HP-era, I can't imagine 60-91 teachers being any better once people realized that the position was jinxed, having progressively worse teachers over time, and even if they were competent, inconsistent curriculum).

Potions is probably something I'd love to study the theory of, I always liked chemistry in school. How certain things interact, their uses, harvest times (and why that is). The major drawback is that I have little to no dexterity when it comes to the practical parts -- chopping, and whatnot. Having Snape as a teacher would probably not really help either, even if I keep my head down, since he loves stalking around and standing right behind you, looking down at your dubious conoctions. If not for the practical issues, this would probably be my best/2nd best subject.

Astronomy, Herbology and History aren't /hard/ subjects, but they're ones that I'd frankly find boring. I cared little for these in my school years except "space is cool", but Hogwarts is centuries behind when it comes to space discoveries anyway. Special mention goes to History for having an abysmal teacher, so on top of being boring, you basically have to read books instead to get any actual facts.

My electives would probably end up being Ancient Runes and Arithmancy -- the three other selections doesn't interest me much. I can't place these difficulty-wise since we don't really know how they work indepth. But I think I'd like Ancient Runes more than Arithmancy.

I like studying languages too, even though it never matched my passion for science and maths, so Ancient Runes would be my second.

I'd terribly fail Divination and Care for Magical Creatures, and Muggle studies is a boring subject coming from a muggle background.

** I'm a physics student IRL, so an O in Arithmancy is almost guaranteed. I think I'd do well at Potions too, considering I'm quite good at lab classes. And of course Astronomy. I had memorized the planets and most of the larger moons before I started primary school.

My weakest core class would be Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'd struggle very much with Care of Magical Creatures. I've never felt comfortable around animals. I'd be absolutely useless at Divination too, considering I'm a very rational person, similar to Hermione.

Of the other classes, I think I'd do well at History, Transfiguration, Herbology and Runes. Flying is something I think I'd enjoy, but I wouldn't be particularly good at it.

** I think, in such a situation, my first move would be to set up memory palaces and cram them with all the theory I could.

I'd also be practicing spell casting non stop in and outside of class and experiment as much as possible. so I'd probably do well with the spell casting classes (Transfiguration, charms and defense).

I'm a decent cook though nothing extravagant and I've always done well at lab work in chemistry classes, so depending on how much of that transpose in potions I could do fairly well. Flying, herbology and astronomy would probably be my dump classes, though I'd try to be at least average in those.

As for the electives, probably arithmancy and runes would be my choices. For these kind of things, memory palaces really shine (and for history of magic, of course). Then again I've never been excellent at maths. Those seem the most usefull subjects, though.

One thing for sure is that I would put up the work and strive to excel at those subjects I deem important.

I'm certainly not gonna slack off when given the chance to study magic...

I'd probably be best DADA because I'm small, quick and if someone gets hurt it ain't my problem. So I'd go all out and rapid fire every spell I knew.
