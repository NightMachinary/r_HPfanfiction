I just want to read stories with Petunia. Redemption stories, do the right thing stories, AU stories.


** I've written "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider". Focused on her - she's the POV character - and complete.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Petunia's family is already perfect. She does not want to raise the child she found on her doorstep. So Petunia, self-described anti-adventurer, takes little Harry on a long drive in order to find Albus Dumbledore. But what good is a Volvo against the course of fate?

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

#+begin_quote
  He's sassy, he's gay, but he's still Vernon Dursley! The Dursleys' marriage isn't the unholy unity of two stale Muggles. Instead, it's a marriage of convenience- a sharing of assets and hearts (if not of bodies)- between the homosexual Vernon and his best friend Petunia. This makes for very different foster parents, who nevertheless maintain some level of propriety.
