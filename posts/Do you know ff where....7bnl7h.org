Harry is in another dimension. His parents are alive but he isn't weak and needy. He is powerfull and you know... Strong ;D


** linkao3(C'est la vie) should fit, even if it's unfinished.

- Dimensional Travel ✔
- Powerful Harry ✔
- Parents Alive ✔

I recall being disappointed that the story is abandoned, so it isn't a bad fic either - but an unfinished one.

*** Something about that fic just rubs me the wrong way.

I think it's just that Harry, after dealing with the war, gets transferred to a new dimension where his parents are still alive - great. He can be with them and be happy and whatnot.

Why does he have to deal with previous-Harry being a spoiled ass, and making up for it to everyone?

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I downloaded one called Stages of Grief a while back that meets those requirements. Technically.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
