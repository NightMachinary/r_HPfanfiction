Not the best writing I have ever done, but I like the idea behind James x Pureblood OC, and hope to motivate fellow writers into exploring it in a better form then I can. Or, for that matter, fanfiction where James does not become a Marauder/Sirius remains the Black Heir

That is why I am shamelessly self-promoting.
