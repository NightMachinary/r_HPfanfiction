So here's a question I was pondering for a while. What do you think Voldemort was planning to use for the Horcrux when he went to kill Harry? We know he had no other artifacts of the Founders (theoretically), so what would you see him using instead?

I thought it might be kind of interesting if he used his wand, but I cannot decide if Voldemort is /that/ impractical. On the other hand, the purported plan for the Diary was even more insane, so thats not that out there.


** Wait what? I thought that was complete fanon? I'm getting so confused with all the canon/fanon crap :D

I thought he didn't intend to make a Horcrux that night. He just wanted to kill Harry. Doesn't the whole plot hinge on the fact that Voldemort didn't realize that he created a Horcrux? I'm sure he would have figured that out if he was performing the Horcrux ritaul thingy in the Potter cottage.

Maybe I'm just going crazy and am losing my mind though.

*** Here is the direct quote from Dumbledore regarding this:

#+begin_quote
  "Well, it is inadvisable to do so," said Dumbledore, "because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you.

  "He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed."

... but Dumbledore? What does he know? He's the guy who also thought that the Dursleys would make a great environment for Harry so his judgement is seriously impaired anyways.

Man, DH is trash on so many levels, no wonder I seem to unintentionally try to forget that book at every opportunity. Why is everything about the main plot so bad?

*** It /is/ just a theory, you're right, not confirmed fact. It is, however, a more plausible one than you give it credit for. Within the framework of the theory, Voldemort had begun the Ritual when he came to kill Harry, but never thought it had been anything close to completed because dammit, the victim /hadn't died/ (but turns out his soul was so mangled the piece was ripped off anyway), and so he goes on believing he never made that Horcrux, and the canon plot is intact.

Nah, that makes Voldemort a complete idiot then. He has a mysterious connection to Harry, that almost allows him to possess him and his scar is all kinds of myserious. If he was also in the process of creating a Horcrux while in the presence of Harry it would make him an utter moron if he can't put 1 and 1 together. "Hurr I have 1 here and 1 there, and I know it's supposed to add up to something, but I have no clue how that's going to happen, dURRrrrr, so I guess Avada Kedavra is the solution... or whatever"

The only reason the plot works even a little bit for me is that it sounds completely ridiculous that you could create a Horcrux that tears apart your soul accidentally and not notice it. So Voldemort is forgiven for not making the connection.

***** Well, I mean, it's the whole point of the Horcrux Ritual that you're not supposed to be able to split your soul /without/ the sacrifice. Presumably, again within the theory (and I'm not saying I believe it in the absolute, but I do think it's sensible), Voldemort assumed that the just-begun ritual /was/ the cause of the connection, but simply didn't think it had gone so far as to tear out the soul-piece altogether.

****** To theorize further (because it's fun), Dumbledore (Or Slughorn) says that it's the act of murder which splits the soul in two. I think Voldemort would not only take this at face value, but it would fit that he would expect the ritual to work with /only/ murder, and nothing short of it, since, in Voldermort's mind the only way for him to achieve immortality would be to show power, not so? How could he achieve something he thinks as the height of his achievement after being defeated by an infant? Surely not?

My theory would be, just like Harry's sacrifice in DH, it is the /intent/ which matters in the ritual more than the action itself, but this is the exact kind of distinction Voldemort would canonically overlook. 'There is no good and evil, only power,' so how could his intent fuel his immortality If he isn't demonstrating his power? There can be no evil in his intentions so what is fueling the ritual if he fails?

And, more philosophically, it would make more sense if intent was important in this ritual, anyway. What would cause you split your /soul/? Actually wanting to kill a toddler or the fact that your curse actually hit?

That's fine. But, he doesn't have to *believe* or *think* that Harry is a Horcrux... he just has to be able to posit the hypothesis. The idea that Voldemort tried to create a Horcrux with Harry and in all the years afterwards never once pondered the possibility that Harry might be a Horcrux ("I wonder what's up with that Potter boy?") sounds ludicrous to me. I don't want to go to far into "genre savvyness", but the dramatic irony of that situation on its own should make everything click into place when thinking that thought, not even considering all the other stuff surrounding their mystical relationship (scar, prophecy, parseltongue, symmetries). The mere association of Harry with the word Horcrux should be enough.

Even if he doesn't believe it, can't he create a Horcrux detector or something just to rule out the remote possibility of ruining everything by being ill informed about circumstances? He's supposed to be an expert in this Dark Magic, Horcrux and Soul Magic business. Voldemort is either incredibly competent and brilliant or completely blind, incompetent and frankly stupid, whatever the narrative requires. This is the guy who created the Diary, the complexities of which boggles my mind.

It's just so dumb to me, I can't comprehend it unless he's supposed to have <60 IQ.

******* What makes you think a horcrux detector is even within Voldemort's capability to create? We don't know how complicated it is, but if Dumbledore didn't think to create one it might mean that he doesn't even know where to begin. Also, Rowling created the magic system and likely didn't want a horcrux detector to exist, which also supports the idea that it is far too difficult for Voldemort to create at that point in time.

Finally, have you ever considered that Voldemort, with his expertise on Dark magic, concluded that Harry wasn't a pseudo horcrux? He is not an expert on the type of magic that Lily's sacrifice used, but is just arrogant and knowledgeable enough to come to erroneous conclusions. It happens with real life geniuses all the time.

Dumbledore has no clue about the kind of magic involved. It's repugnant to him.

Seriously though: It's completely silly. A Horcrux isn't exactly subtle - in fact from all we've seen it's the opposite, with the evil aura and mind influencing properties and all that - and you're telling me that it must be super difficult for Voldemort to tell whether he's standing in front of one of his own Horcruxes or not (if he wants to)? The guy who knows how to create one and "I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality". Suuure. Magical portraits that talk and have intelligence, a charm that erases the knowledge of a location or a piece of information from possibly millions of people's heads, Elder Wands, Resurrection Stones and Invisibility cloaks, sure, that's all no problem for Magic, but detecting a stupid Horcrux?! That would be ridiculous!

********* Nobody said it's ridiculous to have a spell that can detect horcruxes, just that such a spell apparently isn't known to Voldemort. And either he can't create such a spell (detecting a horcrux might be a completely different kind of magic than creating one, or he just isn't such a good spellcrafter) or he doesn't think of it. Contrary to what you claim, it is /not/ obvious that Harry is a horcrux. The diary and the locket both try to heavily influence those they come into contact with, trying to possess them and the ring somehow compelled Dumbledore to touch it, whether that was a normal compulsion charm or caused by the soul piece inside it is unknown. The other horcruxes were destroyed before they could do anything like that, but it isn't unreasonable to assume that they would similarly try to possess whoever tried to use them. Harry on the other hand showed absolutely no signs of being influenced by the horcrux in any way. Even if Voldemort would think about the possibility that harry became a horcrux (which he might not, because the ritual was not completed and there wasn't any reason to believe that it had any effect) then he might think that his horcrux would have immediately taken over harry's body, since he could not comprehend the idea that a mere child could be stronger than even a piece of his soul. He was quite arrogant after all.

As for Dumbledore having no clue about the magic involved with making a horcrux: There is absolutely no evidence for this. Dumbledore found out about the horcruxes, he recognized the diary for one from descriptions of what it did alone, and he correctly assumed that Harry was a horcrux himself. The latter means that he either understood the horcrux ritual very well and could predict what would happen if it were interrupted in the way it was, or he had a way of detecting a horcrux. Just because Dumbledore found the idea of horcruxes repugnant doesn't mean he would shy away from finding out everything about them in order to find and destroy them.

And no, the connection between Harry and Voldemort is not necessarily sufficient evidence for Harry being a horcrux. Voldemort did not have a connection to any of his other horcruxes, he didn't even notice when they were destroyed. And since nobody before made another human into a horcrux there weren't any observations on what that would do available to either Voldemort or Dumbledore.

********** To posit an alternate theory here: I always thought that Voldemort did know that Harry was his horcrux, or at least considered the possibility, he just didn't /care/.

He clearly didn't particularly value his own soul, since he had no problem tearing it into little bits. So in a purely utilitarian sense, he only needs at least /one/ horcrux. Obviously more is better, but killing Harry The Potential Horcrux is an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice to get rid of the threat the prophecy represents.

He just didn't think casting the killing curse at him would kill the horcrux but not the boy.

My headcannon is that Voldemort made Nagini into a horcrux after first suspecting that Harry was one. Because before that it didn't occur to him you could make one out of a living being, but afterwards... well, obviously he had to try it.

** I'm partial to the theory (from Super Carlin Brothers) that Voldemort actually /did/ get his hands on the Sword of Gryffindor by taking it from a "worthy Gryffindor" Order member whom he killed after they summoned it, and he was planning to use that for his last horcrux. No one knew it was at the Potter's house that night because it vanished immediately with no one left to hold it like it did in the /Deathly Hallows Part 2/ film.

This would explain why Voldmort waited so long between making his fifth and sixth horcrux, and why he waited a year and a half after hearing the prophecy before trying to kill Harry. (Ignoring the inconsistent timeline with the Fidelius.) He was waiting to find the sword to complete his collection. From the photograph of the Order that Moody showed Harry, a disproportionate number of Order members were killed in the 4 months before the Potters' deaths, even though the war had been going on for years. Maybe Voldemort was stepping up his efforts or enacting a new plan to get the sword.

Dumbledore was wrong about Voldemort using significant deaths to make his horcruxes, but these lines of evidence suggest that he /was/ doing that with Harry, and I think the Sword of Gryffindor is a plausible option.

** What's so impractical about making his wand a Horcrux? It's actually a very good idea. It might give the wand even more intelligence than wands already have, allowing it to make its own decision on what spells to cast in the heat of battle, thus protecting Voldemort. And conversely, if there's one thing Voldemort will not let out of his sight, it's his wand.

My bet, however, is that he was already planning to make Nagini the 6th Horcrux. I don't see why he'd change his plan come 1994 and pick a completely different object than whatever he had planned in 1981. And before someone brings it up, I am /not/ a fan of the ideat that Voldemort only met Nagini post-1981 in Albania. I feel like he would only trust another living being enough to entrust his soul to them if he'd known them for many, many years of loyal service. I am thus strongly of a mind that she was already by his side during the First War.

All things being said, do keep in mind that the theory that Voldemort was planning to use Harry's death for his 6th Horcrux is just that: a theory. It would make a lot of sense but it's never confirmed in the books.

It's implied /very heavily/ that he put it there when he applied for the Defence Professorship.

Instead, I have the headcanon that Magical Albania is a political mess that only pays lip-service to I.C.W. regulations concerning dark magic, and welcomes fugitives; hence why that's where Helena Ravenclaw hid the Diadem in the first place, /and/ why Voldemort thought it was a good place to hide out.

***** I'm cool with the diadem being brought back to Hogwarts and left in the Room when Voldemort applied for the Defence position. My headcanon assumes that the horcrux he left in Albania in the place of the Diadem was replaced with Nagini once Wormtail had worked up a semi-functional body for the Dark Lord.

It's like this: Voldemort creates Horcruxes, but then finds out that they don't need to stay nearby to perform their function. In fact, it's best if they are stored somewhere safe but accessible, as the soul will be drawn back to the horcrux when the body is killed. His powers will be limited to wandless and wordless magic, so he'll be able to use only the most basic talents, which for him includes Legilimency and its sub-skill for Masters, possession.

He left the diary with the Malfoys, so that he could interact with them if he wound up there. He left the cup in the Lestrange's vault at Gringott's, as there would be goblins nearby. He left the diadem in the Room of Requirement, since the house-elves were the only ones who knew of it. For the locket, he populated the cave with Inferi, which would make very willing possession subjects but wouldn't be good for blending in.

His mistake then was in leaving the [pre-Nagini] horcrux in Albania in the place where the diadem was hidden, expecting others who might be looking for it to find his horcrux instead. Alternately, he figured the forest was well-traveled enough that he could waylay an Albanian peasant if the need arose. In this case, it's possible that the tectonic activity in the Balkans ended up tossing his treehouse into a crevasse; there was a 6.9 quake in Albania in 1979...

The whole reason for the explanation is to satisfy two lingering plot holes:

1 Why doesn't Voldemort drop a horcrux somewhere inaccessible?

2 Why does his spirit flee to Albania when it's body-less? If he isn't limited in movement, he could just approach the Malfoys or the Lestranges (before they jumped on the Longbottoms and got thrown in prison) for help in restoring his body.

** Hmm. Hypothetically, if Voldemort realised that Harry was a Horcrux, maybe that has something to do with why he wants to kill him by his own hand rather than let one of his followers do it? Maybe it'd help him to retrieve the bit of soul?

I've seen a theory that he might have tried to use Gryffindor's Sword for symmetry, but I've never been convinced by that because there's no evidence in canon that I know of that supports it. I remember reading a story where he used the skull of either Sirius or Regulus as his horcrux; maybe he would have used Harry's? The wand is a super interesting idea, but I reckon the Phoenix Feather would have some weird reaction with the soul piece if he did. Being in Godric's Hollow maybe the artefact was something known to be in the town that was related to Gryffindor?
