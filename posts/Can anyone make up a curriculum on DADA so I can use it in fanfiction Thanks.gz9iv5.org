In the original HP series, the DADA curriculum is so varied that I don't know what was /supposed/ to be covered as opposed to what was /actually/ covered.

Anything would be awesome. Thanks again!


** A piece that might eventually show up in a story:

"I imagine that you have been hearing a similar speech in all of your classes- most Professors treat their subject as the most important one. I am no exception.

"Transfiguration and Charms are fundamentals, the foundation of spellwork. Potions and Herbology are key to understanding non-spell magic. History teaches us why we are and why we're where we are at the moment. Astronomy teaches us perspective, and to see more than what's right in front of you. Also physics.

"Defence Against the Dark Arts... isn't essential. Not everyone wants to fight the forces of darkness as part of their life. So, why do I think this is the most important class?"

No one replied.

"I'm asking. Why do you think that I believe this is the most important class?"

Still no reply.

"It might help if you know what topics are covered. Over the first five years, you will be introduced to the creature classification system and learn specific techniques in dealing with such creatures if you come upon them. You also are taught about jinxes and hexes and how to undo them. Starting in third year we discuss well known curses and defences against them. As such, you also learn how to cast them. By the time you reach OWLs, you'll be expected to know and recognize all of these threats and how to deal with them.

"So, I ask again, why is this the most important class?"

"It isn't safe?"

"What isn't safe for whom?"

"Magic. It isn't safe, for us."

"You're getting close."

"Magic isn't safe for anything?"

"Now you're just guessing. Here's the answer: magic is, by definition, breaking the normal rules of life. Magic breaks reality. We are the only ones who can do it, so everything that is magical, is our responsibility."

"But what about dragons and nundu and --"

"To put it slightly differently, we are the only ones who can fix what gets broken by magic. Muggles can't handle a dragon, or a nundu. They can barely handle a jarvey. It's up to us to deal with magical things that can harm others. That is our jobs, every one of us. It's my job to teach you how to be citizens in our world, and take up the foremost, most basic responsibility that each of you was saddled with by birth- to make sure magic doesn't get out of control."

"So why do they call this Defence against the Dark Arts?"

"Honestly? It sounds much more exciting than 'fundamentals of civic responsibility'."
