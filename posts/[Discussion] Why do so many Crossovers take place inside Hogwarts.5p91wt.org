I love Crossovers and I try and find good fun action filled stories... But all I often find are Harry and everone needs protection from Voldemort, so X comes to Hogwarts, even when what ever that other series is takes place in a far more open and often times adventurous settings. Turning series that should be full of action sequences to a story full of Malfoy cracking bad jokes (or worst being the nicest kindest boy), Snape being a dick to the new heroes (or strutting around like a bleeding heart Brad Pitt with a hooked nose) and general mocking of the Potter series/magic. Often with neither team/setting changing from Canon much... That is until the new heroes kill Riddle for Harry (often in a Curbstomp Battle)

What is the the seemingly wide spreed fear of leaving Hogwarts, as often times the Author is JUST as familiar with the other world as well so it mostly isn't lack of knowledge, so what is it? What do you think it is? If you wrote a story like this, what made you stay in the castle? If you have read a story like this, what made you read it and did you like it?


** I really don't read crossovers that play in the HP world.

But I'd say its probably the same reason we see so much Super!Harrys. Its power-fantasies played out. The HP world is inferior in terms of power compared to a lot of worlds. While hundreds of HP wizards couldn't level Hogwarts, for example, a Fairytail wizard like Natsu would do so barely straining his muscles.

Except Child of the Storm I can't recall a good crossover fic that played in the HP world. But as I said, I prefer those not playing there in the first place.

** Harry's a kid, he's supposed to be in school. My two current stories are crossovers. In one, harry's eleven and at school, learning to handle his family's ability, controlling the darkness. The other stort takes place in star trek 'verse, where he's preparing for a new galactic war.

Take a look at child of the storm. Harry's in schol but the story takes place all over the planet~~universe.

** Fear of the unknown, lack of imagination, easiness of familiarity and playing in its own comfort zone. Much easier to nail an environment everyone is familiar with, so that needs very little description, than create something from scratch.

Most of the fics are just rehashing the canon, albeit with other characters mixed in, and even then the results don't change much. You can't expect those people to show a modicum of imagination and creativity and create a new settings for their story.

*** Yes, because if they write a crossover and decide it would be better off, or they like it better, in Hogwarts rather than elsewhere that means they have no creativity.

**** This is not what I meant. But Hogwarts is already an established setting. There is no need to invent it or even describe it. I can say great hall and everyone had his own picture of it. It's easier to use it
