Title pretty much says it all. Stuff like the blood magic from Miranda Flairgold's A Second Chance at Life series, the experimentation in In The Mind of A Scientist by ZenoKyuubi, and the runic magic in Runes of War by Nimohtar.

**** It didn't really capture and hold my attention that well, it seemed like a typical cliche 'back to the past fic'. The battle scenes were barely worth reading, they just seemed to lack a spark of some kind for me.

**** Pretty much. Wastelands has a point to make too (captured my imagination with a vice the first time), but yeah.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
