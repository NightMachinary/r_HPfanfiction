:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where a Hermione at University (Muggle, not Magical) agrees to go to a bar with some friends and they get delighted when they realise 'The Guy'TM is there - she, baffled, asks what the heck they're talking about and they point to a dark-haired dude in one corner and explain that he's a cute guy who sits in the corner and doesn't talk to anyone, and one of them tried to hit on him once and he let her down nicely.

Hermione looks at the guy, nods, then walks over and says something to the effect of "Hey Harry, long time no see." and the friends are impressed to find out she used to go to school with 'The Guy'TM and ask questions about it.

There's some other plot to it, I think, but I don't remember anything beyond the one scene. I have no idea whether it's post war or alternate universe or what, only that they reconnect in a bar in the Muggle world after having not seen each other for a long while.

  Driven to frustration by her mother, Hermione makes a choice she might not have otherwise: she goes out clubbing with some new friends and runs into an old one.

*** That is it! Thank you, fellow internet person. You're a gentle-sentient and a scholar. Should've known that kind of Harmony fic would've been by LeQuin. :D
