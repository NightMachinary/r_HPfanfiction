Hey all. Was just wondering what are you favorite wand creationsfor Harry? E.g anything other that Harry's cannon Phoenix and Holly wand. This can include parts of his O.G/ cannon wand but it has to be modified. E.g what Darkness Enthralled did in A Cadmean Victory.

Just looking for some obscure and different things from cannon.

T.I.A

** In the story Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence Harry's wand no longer works for him so he has a new one made. It uses a core of Thestral hair and the Heart string of a Ukrainian Ironbelly (dragon), placed into two woods Ebony and Purple Heart fused together with amethyst.

In the story Honour Thy Blood by the Same Author Harry's wand was broken in the graveyard. He escapes and later has a new wand made. It uses a core of Horntail heart string and a claw from a Golden Griffin using White ash that is marbled with obsidian. It also incorporates phoenix tears and Basilisk venom.

*** Funny you should mention these particular fics as I have just read them ðŸ˜„. I agree that they are interesting and different and it is mainly what prompted me to post this.

Thanks for the comment

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
