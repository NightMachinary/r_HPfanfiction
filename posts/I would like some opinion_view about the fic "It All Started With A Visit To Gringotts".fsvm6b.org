The fic was recommended for me by a friend and i would like to have some opinion before reading them. I like the slash and i'm curious about the theories of the olympic gods add to this one too but i'm still hesitates to read 'cause if you're not careful while handling the gods in the story line you might end with a bad taste. I have read a bad one before and i hope this one is good, you know 'cause my bf told me so.


** I've read it a couple of times over a few years ago and remember enjoying it. I didn't find the gods stuff detracted from the general story.
