:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm LF a fic where Harry and one other person (I think Daphne, can't be sure) show up at the train first year followed by the force of Death, a wind that doesnt speak only carries out orders. It makes inane changes to cause chain reactions to kill various characters.

I read this years ago and would love to again. PLZ HALP

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and Amanda Maxwell, his girlfriend and lover, are starting their first-year at Hogwarts. And so is their best friend and indentured servant; Death Incarnate. A very different take on what happens when Something Grim This Way Comes.
