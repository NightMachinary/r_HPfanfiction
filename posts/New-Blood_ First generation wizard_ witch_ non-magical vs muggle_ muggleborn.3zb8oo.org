Where do these terms come from? I keep seeing them in fan fiction. Were they from the American books or something? I know that they were edited to make it "easier" for American readers or something.


** The American books weren't edited for any wizarding terms, more things like "jumper" turned to the American term "sweater" because to us a jumper is the little overall dress that a small girl would wear. Just things that would cause misunderstandings between cultures. Anything Rowling invented is intact.

When a term or concept that is not in the original book canon keeps showing up in fanfiction, we call it "fanon"- fan canon. In this case, lots of fanfic authors don't really like the term "muggle" because it seems derogatory, so they have tried to come up with their own more politically correct word for people who are not witches or wizards, and witches and wizards born of two non-magical parents. Non-magical is a pretty standard term that probably lots of authors just use naturally, and first-gen instead of muggleborn probably spread through the fandom when people saw it in stories, liked it, and copied it for their own stories.

You may see "nomaj" popping up more now. It is canon, Rowling has said it's the term American wizards use instead of muggle and we'll probably see it in the Fantastic Beasts movie next year.

What term would /you/ use to describe muggles and muggleborns if "muggle" was off the table?

*** Thanks for clearing this up. I'm glad that they didn't change stuff like this and it's just a thing invented by PC idiots.

**** I find that's worse than muggle. Mundane suggests muggles are boring sods, insulting them whereas muggle just means without magic.

I may be without magic but I'm not mundane. I'm a muggly muggling muggletastic muggle.

***** [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle][Rowling has said she created the word "Muggle" from "mug", an English term for someone who is easily fooled. She added the "-gle" to make it sound less demeaning and more "cuddly"]].

So basically a lovable fool...not really sure I prefer that.

** As far as I know, muggle and muggle-born are cabon terms, introduced by Rowling. The rest are founded in fanon.

** They grew sort of organically. I don't believe the terms new-blood or first gen were ever used in any HP publication, but they probably did originate in American circles because of the backlash against terms like "dirty blood" and points that compare "muggle" to +"nigger"+ "negro" even though +one is clearly much worse than the other+ that was not necessarily JKR's intent*. The justification, which you usually see in any fic that eschews the term "muggle", is that it's akin to calling them animals or some bad "other". They're no longer humans, they're just dirty muggles. Most of the average wizards were shown having no regard for non-magicals or their cultural differences to magicals, and fanfic authors came up with those terms to introduce a more inclusive (and PC) view to their stories.

*** Thanks for clearing this up. I was never sure where these words popped up from. I'm just so fucking tired of this PC bullshit. Yes the Death Eaters are evil. But that doesn't mean that people are going to start using "newblood" or whatever just because one person's delicate sensibilities were hurt.

Really comparing the words "muggle" and "nigger" is rather insulting in of itself. These assholes need to get off their high horses.

Sorry it's just this whole PC shit is annoying as hell, especially when they have no fucking idea what they're talking about. I've just started avoiding fics that use terms like that. Nomaj sounds silly to me, but you wouldn't expect countries to use the exact same terms. IRL Americans and Brits use very different terms for a lot of things for ex. So I'd be ok if it was a different culture sort of thing. But it's just a bunch of people getting their knickers on a twist over an imagined slight. Thanks for your help!

P.S.- source for the cultural diff. thing: I spent most of my life in England before moving to the US.

**** After thinking on it for a bit, "muggle" is and more like "negro" as it was used for the last 500 years up until the 60s/70s, and less like "nigger" with the scathing, biting, hateful meaning. As such, I still disagree with the second paragraph in general. It's not about being PC really. Muggle is a loaded term, much like, as I said, "negro". In canon but especially in fanfictions, it's used to describe third-class citizens, people that are not fit for regular society. It's used even by moderates to describe a group that should be excluded and looked down upon. So in order to remove that image of a third class citizen, we come up with another descriptor: First Gen, non magical, African American, etc.

When you stop using the words that keep reminding everyone to keep them down, the pervasive mentality changes for the better. And really, most PC things are like that. Sure some go to the extremes of trying to control and punish thoughts (SJWs) but most just want to disassociate the negative connotations.

Think back a few years ago, there was maybe 10 years or so where faggot and retard were used as insults. The worst of the worst. You called someone that because you wanted them to feel bad, to feel hated and excluded because that's what gay or mentally challenged people should feel like, right? They deserve to feel that way, right? And then we collectively pulled our heads out of our asses and said, no, not only is that not remotely true, but we feel like morons for making it seem that way. That's not being PC, that's being respectful. Those are people with rights and feelings and they don't deserve to be derided as lower class people.

It may not have been JKR's intent that "muggle" is seen that way alongside of "mudblood", but some of us might, or at least use it as a plot point. A sort of "you know your world is bad when even your leaders are using derogatory terms to describe your fellow citizens." which is why you almost always get the additional explanation that the British Wizarding World was using it as a slur/insult.

***** There's a different between being respectful and being an arsehole about it. People waving the "PC" flags do it because they're a bunch of circle jerking dicks. It's got nothing to do with being respectful, hence my hate of this PC nonsense. I don't have anything against the sentiment but I just don't like the people behind it. Today it's all about the extremists, you have the racist arseholes on one end and the PC Nazis who get offended at pretty much everything.

The problem is that this kinda bleeds into fics and it just ruins it for me. This is just a personal thing. Some of these fics are well written and have good ideas. They may not be heavyweights like perspicacity or Newcomb or Jbern or rosharch's bolt, but they're good fics. Then you have this newblood thing. One cha fa tee talk about this and suddenly, boom, everyone starts using the term with no resistance at all. It's like no one ever arought this issue up before.

The wizarding world already has the equivalent of a racial slur I.e. mudblood and we all agree that its a terrible word. But in the case with "Muggle" one has to wonder if the Wizards use the word as an insult or simply dismiss them as a threat. Of course one cannot discuss that without discussing who the Statute of Secrecy really protects. Does it protect the Wizards from Muggles or does it protect the Muggles from people who regularly bend reality to their will.

I guess my biggest problem isn't with the idea of the word muggle being a slur, but more the execution of said idea (as I described above). The people using it don't know how to make it believable and the best authors don't bother with it.
