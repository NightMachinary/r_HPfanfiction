Half-Veela, Half-Cat or a dementor, anything goes as long as it's not a regular witch.

Preferably 150k+ words and completed. The more gruesome, bashy and smutty/lemony the better, atleast if its storydriven.

Give me your recommendations!

**** The first time I read it, for some reason, I got bored right after Ginny and co. go to Dublin. Then, it took me like 6 months to go back to it, during one of those droughts of new fic. Started right from where I dropped. And boy, was I stupid to drop it in the first place. I absolutely loved it. From Kally and Harry's relationship, to the Horcruxes and later on with all of Dumbledore shanenigans...

I've been suggesting this fic over reddit all the time, because I can't, for the life of me, understand why there are so few fav/follows on it.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

*Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun* 250k+ words. Not sure if completed.

Veela, Water elementals, cool/unique magic and Huldr(Foxgirls and squirrelgirls) and what a story that moves forward, and that i find enjoyable.

Very smutty, very fun, very magic

** Well... Hermione in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) hasn't been 100 percent human in... a while... but she wasn't /born/ that way. It's complicated.

Also, just putting it out there that if anyone has recommendations that fit the basic request but not OP's additional requirements I'm taker.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** Secondstarontheleft on a03 has an interesting story about Sirius's daughter, who is half veela, and Blaise's mother is insinuated to be inhuman, perhaps Fae or something along those lines. A lot of it has to do with being not entirely human in a word that looks down on them.
