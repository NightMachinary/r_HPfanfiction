I was wondering if anyone knew of any good stories that mainly focus on Tonks being a kick-ass auror?

Prefer no romance, or at least not Remus.

I just came across Willoway ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5637821/1/Willoway]]) and that made me want to look for more.

  The situation, Tonks surmised, was indeed bleak. She had no wand, no contact with the Ministry and no way off the remote Scottish island that held her prisoner. If things went according to plan, she'd be dead within the hour.
