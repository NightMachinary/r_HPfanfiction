Chapter one of my new reader-inserted Harry Potter Fanfiction is now live on Wattpad and FanFiction dot net!! I've been working very diligently alongside two amazing editors/beta-readers, and now my first fanfiction ever has been posted on two sites -- well the first chapter that is.

If you're interested, I hope you enjoy the story I have to tell of you, the reader, living out your days in Hogwarts alongside some of your most beloved characters! This is to follow your story in your efforts to discover where you come from and who you want to be as a person! No following around the golden, silver, or bronze trio in their quest for success, only your individual quest for success.

Many romances are to be had and many classes to take!

***also it's in the first person :) ***

***** Yeah, they're kind of like a disgrace to the fanfiction world for whatever reason, they're not too popular. I just see it as essentially an RPG videogame in words. But thank you, I really appreciate it.
