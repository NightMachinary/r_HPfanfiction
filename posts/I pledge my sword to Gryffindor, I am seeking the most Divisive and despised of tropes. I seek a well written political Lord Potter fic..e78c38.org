  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

*** Fair warning to potential readers; the author overplays the stupid to a fault because tradition and magic trope just a bit. Don't worry, if you don't mind a little of that, it's a pretty great afternoon read.

** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon)

25-year old Harry accidentally travels to an alternate dimension where he finds his dimensions Sirius who "died" 10 years ago. They both end up as "Lord Black" and hilarity ensues.

I acknowledge that this probably isn't what you're looking for, but you said crack was welcome and this fic fits most of your requirements. This fic is worth reading for the crack alone. (spoilers):

An actual plot, OP Harry, Smart Harry, Thief duo Harry and Sirius, Anti-Wizengamot Harry and Sirius, badass Harry, stronger Voldemort, WBWL, a dozen side-plots which are all amazing, and all the things that accompany an AU-Harry.

** Try Prince of Slytherin by thesinister_man. Harry isn't Lord, but he's heir, and has a lawyer, and regularly manipulates the government, and commits multiple counts of treason.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
