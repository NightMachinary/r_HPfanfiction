*** well now it just seems obvious.

It also seems like a pointless thing to add because you just use the request flair which shows you are looking for a fic like described.

**** Before, a little while back, there was not an option to flair from a dropdown list, you would have to write LF. I sometimes still write LF just out of habit.
