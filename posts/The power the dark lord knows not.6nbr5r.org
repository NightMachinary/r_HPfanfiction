I'm looking for any fics that have a power either unique to their story or unique to Harry that is a large element of the story, slash is fine as long as there is no smut or mpreg and no weird age gaps with Harry falling in love with snape or Voldemort or whatever


** linkffn(If Looks Could Kill) Harry obliviates Voldemort so that any spell would be a "power he knows not" and to bring it full circle, he puts a Killing Curse just above his right eye. linkffn(7120596) Hijacking the Kangaroo Court. The Power He Knows Not is House Elf Magic, never seeing Dobby bring Harry into the room behind him until Harry put a /Reducto/ into his skull.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

**** Start is rough, and it has a dose of that independent Harry stuff that the fandom really should have outgrown, but I find it entertaining enough. And I like the fact that I've been to the town where Harry spends most of the summer.

***** I always push to the 10,000th word at the very least when I start recommended fics. Gives it a chance, and in HP terms, that's like reading the first two and a half chapters of Sorceror's Stone
