Yes please see the title, please write this fic someone!!! :) :) :) :)


** I'm not sure which penguin Harry would be - Skipper is a little too gung-ho, Private is entirely too meek, Kowalski is basically Hermione without the need to soapbox and Rico...

Maybe he's Rico. Tousled hair; insane lack of fear; nearly incomprehensible to most people...

**** if I were going to make Harry a penguin I'd have him learn a wandless spell that makes the air act like water for him so he could swim in the air.
