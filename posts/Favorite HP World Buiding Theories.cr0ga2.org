They don't have to be from fics just in general. My favorite is:

Magic has a level of intuition you get by feeling and emotion think like accidental magic and playing around with it helps with your understanding of it. However muggle borns dont have the chance to do it because they arent in a enviroment where they would be encouraged to tune in to their accidental magic. A magical baby when you have no magic is scary plus you probably live in a muggle heavy area so they do their best to repress. This means those with magical parents come into school with an advantage that the muggleborns will struggle to meet if education focuses more on this intuition. So instead they focus on memorization and strict rules. This lets them focus on magic but doesnt foster creativity. Which is why so few advancenents have been made in recent years and most truly new unique innovative things are made by purebloods or people who played with magic and didnt care who saw. Ex: Voldemort Dumbledore Snape the Marauders the Weasely Twins. Hermione despite how smart she is was not innovative in the way they were and showed the least aptitude for magic relating to instincts and emotions ( Divination)

What are your favorite world building theories?

Edit: I also really like the all wizards are magical creature + human hybrids


** Magical theory breaks down into two mutually exclusive categories. Literal and Symbolic. They can interact with each other, but they aren't part of the same thing.

Literal magic

#+begin_quote
  behaves almost like energy in that the concept of an "amount" of magic determines how successful or accurately a "spell" is conveyed. It's not exactly quantitative, but behaves as though it were quantitative. It can account for variation in how corporeal a Patronus appears or how well an object is levitated. A more accurate account would be how "real" the magic becomes.

  It's not as simple as draining some amount of magic from some sort of magical core and pushing it into a spell, but it seems like it.

  Discussions with [[/u/Taure]] make me think this is related to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid][Platonic solids in some way (and therefore the elements: earth, air, water, and fire)]].
#+end_quote

Symbolic magic

#+begin_quote
  behaves like the magic transfer of metaphysical concepts into physical results. The classic example of this would be potions where an annual plant might represent the cycle of life and death, so could be used in a Draught of Living Death. This would also account for things like Transfiguration or Conjuration which are often absent in hard magic realism systems because they breaks the laws of physics and don't behave in a quantitative manner (like energy).

  This isn't only limited to subjective symbols that exist in a single person's head, but also can extend to collective symbols like runes or incantations.

  Again, discussions with [[/u/Taure]] make me think this is something like pulling [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms][Platonic Forms]] into reality.
#+end_quote

The interaction between the two forms of magic would account for how you can conjure food, but can't eat it because while symbolic magic accounts for the ability to conjure it at all, it's too complex to become fully literal in it's intended Form. On the other hand, conjuring water is much more straight forward, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kepler_Icosahedron_Water.jpg][because water is the symbolic analog to the icosahedron Platonic solid]], so it can be permanently conjured in it's physical Form.

I imagine Gamp's law references the biplay between the Literal and the Symbolic theories of magic as applied to Conjuration.

It's also conceivable that magic itself is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)][Fifth Element]] as described by Plato and Aristotle, later called Aether, but I don't necessarily see that as being in conflict with the idea that Aether is the combination of the four elements giving birth to Forms.

^{Suppose} ^{it's} ^{also} ^{worth} ^{hedging} ^{that} ^{I} ^{don't} ^{know} ^{shit} ^{about} ^{Plato} ^{or} ^{classical} ^{philosophy,} ^{so} ^{sorry} ^{if} ^{any} ^{of} ^{this} ^{is} ^{wildly} ^{wrong} ^{in} ^{that} ^{sense.}

** I have some favorites, though the canonicity is probably variable:

- Magic appears to be of multiple components (much of it symbolic) in all its forms. In the case of wandwork, there are a set of principles and patterns that /can/ make a spell work. However, these are just tools for teaching those who aren't able to yet (if at all) shape magic to their intent in the specific manner. This is where much of the wizarding specializations descends from - certain people have minds/personalities more geared toward shape, or the abstract, or violence, etc.
- All living creatures are magical. However, this is largely dormant in most cases unless specific characteristics or features appear in individuals or beasts (think Grindelwald's line of 'Magic blooms in rare souls'). This explains why squibs are sometimes born, or where muggleborns come from - they have just the right qualities physically to manifest magic. This also explains why things like seers and metamorphmagi are seemingly related to parentage, despite the dubious blood-magic connections.
- A lot more of the magic creatures that exist are products of magical breeding/manipulation by wizards than the WW would have you believe. Not all of them, but it can't just be acromantulas and other dark creatures.
- There are more ways to combat or control dementors than we are told in canon. Harry's mention offhandedly of Snape disagreeing on how to handle them may imply this as well. I doubt you can kill them per se, but its likely you can contain or starve them of sustenance, since they grow from damp, decay and misery (equivalent to magical mold). Possibly something fire-based for instance, as they prefer cold and dark environments, or even just warmth.
- The Patronus spell is not the only spell so heavily based on positive emotional catharsis. Others could exist, but we aren't provided real evidence for that either. I doubt no one has noticed their connection though. Also, part of the reason its so seemingly difficult to learn is the same reason its difficult to learn the Unforgiveables (Harry's Imperio not withstanding) - you need to be able to call forth the emotions effortlessly, rather than specifically focus on feeling happy or gleeful or hateful and so on (see first point).

** I love the idea that each person has a different magical imprint and so performs the same spell differently from another person, getting similar results but in their own style. For example, the school might teach one way of performing the spell and this way might work for the majority but there will be ppl who struggle with it and who will probably learn it in a different way (a bit like muggle school where every student has a different learning style but are made to all learn the same way ).

I love this because it would mean that instead of a world where every spell is performed in the same way, we get a world full of colourful personal interpretations. This would mean that, for example, famous wizards would have famous magical imprints or styles and so would be easier to recognize if needed.

** The International Statute of Secrecy was proclaimed by European wizards, who then used their superior wand magic to impose that rule around the globe. They had already been seeding representatives as part of the empire-building over the previous centuries. They used the will-destroying effect of opium to break the Asian resistance.

*** Yes but he still did play around with magic is what I meant. At least if im remembering this correctly. Despite facing reprocussion for it. Maybe it was a rebellious thing but he still did it.

I mean not like Voldemorts orphanage super wanted him to use magic either or was the nicest place but he still played around with it.

As opposed to say being muggleborn and like not wanting to accidentally set fire to the couch because your parents cant easily fix that with magic or be exposed to your friends because what if they think youre creepy. Or what if the neighbors see you. Its not really anyones fault its just no one really knew how to help muggleborns feel free to play with their magic in enviroments with other muggle with the secrecy laws and all. So instead they tried to be more inclusive with their curriculum and this was the idea they came up with. And here are the consequences.

At least thats the theory I came across it was on reddit but like years ago and i didnt bookmark it so I cant find it. But it does sorta make sense. And I think a pretty interesting setup to put stories in.

** Transfiguration changes the /figure/, aka the "Properties" of an object. So if you try to transfigure lead into gold, you get lead that looks, feels, weighs, etc the same as gold but it's still lead. On the one side this allows to transfigure things that would be impossible without magic like wood that has the strength of metal or animals that think like humans, on the other side if you don't know how to magically express a property (such as radioactive half-life) you can't transfigure something with this property.

** The ministry was built by muggles, they added it onto the blueprints for the underground then obliviated the construction workers. The hogwarts express was acquired in a similar way, change an order of trains one up, steal one then change it one down.

For settings where magic disrupts electronics the Diagon Alley wall serves an important purpose, It temporarily opens a hole in the normally impenetrably wards that prevent magic from frying all the electronics in the surrounding area.
