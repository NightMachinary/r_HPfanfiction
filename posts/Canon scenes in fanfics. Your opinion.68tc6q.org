There are a few scenes in canon, that, if an author wants their fanfic to go into a certain direction, are essential to the story.

A few examples that come to mind would be Harry's & Quirrel's confrontation, Harry and Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry being selected as the fourth Triwizard champion, or Voldemort's resurrection at the end of GoF. Of course not every story needs every scene, and I don't want to discuss the merits of forcing canon moments (like the Hermione/troll scene) into stories where they don't fit.

But, if a canon scene should be part of a fanfic, due to how things in the story progress, how do you prefer to read about it?

A shorter version, where detailed conversations and observations mentioned in canon are glossed over?

The scene rewritten in the authors words with verbatim quotes where they fit (e.g. Voldemort's monologue at his resurrection)?

Or no quotes at all?

I'm curious about how other fanfic writers treat these scenes, and what readers think about it.


** This was something I had to think carefully about when writing NFO. Certain scenes were going to overlap and while I didn't want to bore the audience by repeating it all, it felt like it would break immersion just summarising it in one sentence. So I tried to make sure that whenever I was repeating canon, I was careful to make sure it was adding something new - something harry might not have seen or noticed from his position in canon, for example, or ways of showing a different emotional reaction than he had. Where I could, I skimmed over it or cut to a new scene but tried to make it feel as natural as possible.

** There was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/59j0is/the_deadliest_sin_in_fanfiction_wasting_our_time/][similar discussion]] a while back, and the opinions were mixed.

Personally I think scenes where things unfold exactly like in canon should be skipped, or if that's not possible, glossed over as you've said. Sure, it might make the fic more disjointed, and it wouldn't work if you were writing an original story, but we're writing fanfiction, right?

In fact that's what peeved me about "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux": it's such a great fic, but there's too much rehashing (occasionally even whole paragraphs lifted from canon). I guess removing these scenes would ruin the story's flow, so I can see why the author did that, but I still don't like it.

** I would say "Seventh Horcrux" handles this really well:

/Meeting Draco on the Train:/

I smirked. "So, you wish to join me. Your foresight is commendable, and I assure you that -- should you choose to be my minion -- I shall allow you a sliver of my eventual glory."

Malfoy sputtered in indignation. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys are not minions.”

--------------

/First Lesson with Severus:/

"Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Severus Snape demanded.

I said, "The Draught of Living Death."

Severus sneered. "The Draught of Living Death, sir. Ten points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor."

Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

"Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" he snapped.

"The stomach of a goat, sir," I told him smugly.

Severus' eye twitched with frustration. "Twenty points for smirking. What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

"There is no difference. Would you like to hear its third name?"

"Fifty points for your cheek!" Severus roared.

That year, I was determined to singlehandedly win the House Cup.

For Slytherin.

--------------

/After the Troll incident:/

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

--------------

/The Stone:/

I nearly fell over in shock when I spotted Quirrel. The professor was crouched in front of an ornate mirror, tapping the glass experimentally. I suddenly realized that his stuttering, his idiocy, and his horrible teaching were all an act.

Since I was covered by an invisibility cloak, Quirrel had yet to detect my presence.

"Avada Kedavra," I whispered. Too focused on the mirror to see my spell, he crumpled to the ground. Immediately, a dark mist rose from his body and wooshed through the flames.

"That was weird." A quick incendio charred Quirrel's corpse and I kicked it to the side.

"Now, how do I get the stone?" In the mirror, my reflection (an older, distinguished-looking professor) shrugged and smiled mischievously. Neither physical nor magical attacks had any effect on the mirror and I was about ready to slam my head into the thing when Dumbledore burst through the flames.

"Headmaster!" I exclaimed in surprise. "This isn't what it looks like. Y'see, I realized that someone was going to steal the stone and Quirrel attacked me and then he burst into flames."

I waved my hands around for emphasis. This is why I usually prepare my cover[...]

--------------

/Confronting the Diary:/

"Diary?" I shouted. "What in Merlin's name are you doing here?"

She (he?) hissed, "How dare you address me so disrespectfully? I am Lord Voldemort!"

"You're going to regret that name in a few years," I said, "and I'm the real Lord Voldemort. You're just my horcrux."

Diary sneered. "You're Lord Voldemort? No, I think I'm Voldemort.”

[...]

“You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man."

The Weasley girl smirked. "Of course, you could always join me. I might let you rule at my feet -"

"Avada Kedavra," I said, pointing my wand at the diary. The Weasley collapsed as the book glowed green and the soul inside screamed. The Horcrux was destroyed. Or released, or something like that.

It was a necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around.

** Too much canon rehash will make me X out.

If it's really necessary to hit that canon station, why not instead skip that scene, and write a scene where Harry tells someone else about what happened? At least it's something somewhat different.

*** In my story, because Harry is a very different person due to his past, so describing his reaction as the scene unfolds is necessary, but at the same time Voldemort is the same person, and it feels natural that he is, at least in parts, going to say the same things. (Writing the resurrection scene at the moment.) But yes, I don't like canon rehash either, which is why I was wondering how to best approach this scene.

** The Hermione troll scene is one of the most forced scenarios in fanons. I have read so many fictions forcing the scene, it doesn't make any senses...

I believe if a single event happened differently, the canon event never would occur. It was a plot device for developing the friendship between the trios. For example, if Hermione didn't sort to Griffindor or she ignored/never interacts with Ron or Harry didn't friend with Ron or didn't sort to Griffindor, the scene is never possible.

I have seen lots of time a Ravenclaw/Slytherin Hermione with the scene. And what I find most funny always Harry to save the day whether it's Slytherin Harry, Ravenclaw Harry, Hufflepuff Harry or Griffindor Harry; or a WBWL Harry, a big brother Harry or a dumbledork Harry or a weasel Harry.

** I really don't like canon rehashes, especially fics that repeat words or phrases verbatim from the books. Direct quotes from the book, especially if it's something recognizable that I have read many times before just makes me annoyed and sometimes makes me drop the fic. I much rather you change, condense or skip the the scenes entirely, tell from another pov, or else briefly mention them or describe in ways completely different from the books.

Just don't lift paragraphs directly from the books. It's lazy, a sign of bad writing, a bad story and is extremely boring and frustrating to read. I tend to skim and skip chapters that focus too much on canon and tend to stop reading fics that have to much of it.

*** Thanks, I mostly agree with you, and don't think my story runs the risk of repeating canon. At the moment I am writing the resurrection scene, and Harry is a very different person, with different reactions, which is why I can't skip or summarise it, but at the same time Voldemort is, at this point, still the same person he was in canon. So that left me wondering if readers found it acceptable if certain sentences from his dialogue were lifted from canon. As he would - up to a point - say the same things, rephrasing them feels to me like a poor imitation.

** If there isn't a significant divergence from canon, as in more than just the names are changed, the writer should summarize or reference it at most. A few lines recalling critical moments aren't too bad, but really only if there's something new to add to the story.

** I wouldn't use verbatim quotes except for possibly the odd well-known phrase -- I would paraphrase if necessary. That said, I would only be interested in reading (or writing, which I have done) a canon scene if it was told from a different point of view from canon in any case. And those can be very interesting.

** If the scene is being narrated through someone else's eyes than in canon (which would almost certainly be harry since we see things by his eyes for like, 99% of the books) then I think it's important to write it in, because someone else will have different thoughts about what's happening. Perhaps summarizing a bit of the dialogue if it will indeed be exactly the same.

But there are several things to account for past that. For instance, is the scene going to happen exactly the same way? Is Harry the exact same character than in canon, and if he isn't, in what way will his thought of the scene differ? Will his thoughts cause him to take a different action?

I only support skipping if a) the scene happens exactly like in canon, or b) if after the skip, we are told what happened in a summarized fashion though a small flashback or more likely, a conversation that speaks of it

** I prefer a story to focus on what makes it different from canon. You do sometimes need to include pieces of canon just to remind your reader of the context, but you don't need to fully recreate the scenes.

Some quotes though are so iconic, I can't imagine not using them if you are writing the scene. For example, I don't think I could write the graveyard scene without using "Kill the spare!" The line is just so much more powerful than anything that I could write to take it's place and it is necessary to set the tone for the scene. The only way I wouldn't use it would be if I was going for a completely different tone.

I don't need to read about how to pass the chess board for the millionth time. Fanfic authors treat their audience like children who can't fill in the blanks.

Definitely no quotes though. If you absolutely have to re-tread canon for some reason at least put it into your own words. The only exception is the prophecy.

** It depends on a nature of the fic. There are some fics that stay fairly close to canon and quickly go through repeated and less important stuff, focusing on differences and it works because that's what they do all time. Examples being On the Way to Greatness and The Changeling.

But, this won't work in fic where you normally has scenes described in details. It will feel jarring and disconnected. In those cases, the writer should do something to make the scene feel fresh, interesting. Maybe there are some slight differences because it's an AU that hasn't yet branched heavily. Maybe we have a different perspective on those events because it's a canon-compliant fic from a different perspective. Maybe it's an author's writing style that will make it interesting. In the end, it's important to not bore readers, but also to keep a fic consistent.

Also, while quoting dialogues is okay if the same things are beings said, quoting whole scenes is bad and writers who do this should feel bad.

** I usually start a story off with a scene from canon so the reader knows exactly where the story is kicking off from, and where the divergence is. I'm not saying that that is a good way to do it, but it's what works for my writing style.

I do think it's important to not use text verbatim in the middle of a story. A reader doesn't want to just be reading canon. It's bad enough when a story is just a rehash with Daphne substituted for Character X, but when it's worse than that, it's quite pointless.

** If I find a fan fic that starts with a full page (or at least 90% of it) of canon quotes then I click the back button. If you are going to write a fan fiction then I think you should use your imagination to rewrite the necessary scenes. If you change anything in the story, then I believe that is enough reason to have to change everything after that point. It's the butterfly effect.

That all being said, I have read some fan fiction where they used the canon quotes and did a damn good job of it. I still think they could have been done with rewriting the scenes though.

** If canon scenes must be quoted put it in italics so those who glance at the scene can see where it begins/ends and skip to after.

If there's a change in the scene, like dialogue, give just barely enough context so the reader knows where it's coming from.

"One can never have enough socks --" "Bollocks." "Harry..." "You're really old, Headmaster. Everyone around you has died and you're telling me you don't wish to see any of them again?" "Harry, I am old enough that, in all's honesty I probably will soon."
