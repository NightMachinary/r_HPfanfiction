Sirius being acquitted in Book 3 seems to be a common deviation from the main plot in fics and Harry going to live with him is also often accepted. But I am wondering now, would Dumbledore have accepted it considering it wasn't in Harry's best interest considering the canonical circumstances? Harry still needed to be protected by the blood wards and Sirius, despite his rebellious streak, still trusted Dumbledore almost blindly even accepting his imprisonment in his own childhood home because he said it was for his own good.


** there are more stories where he gets acquitted but Dumbles doesn't let him be guardian than ones where he becomes guardian

** Legally, as a godparent, Sirius had no rights towards Harry. Also, Sirius wasn't cleared until after his death in the books, which would have made adoption impossible.

On the other hand, if Sirius managed to clear his name, and adopt Harry, Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to do anything about it. Sure there's the blood ward argument, but 12 Grimmauld Place was under a fidelius charm with Dumbledore as secret keeper, so it would have been a pretty save place for Harry.

As godparent, no, but he's also the designated guardian (he says so during the climax of POA) separate and apart from being the godfather. It's the guardian thing that likely would have given him legal standing if he hadn't been on the run.

*** Dumbledore was a secret keeper of 12 Grimauld Place when the order started using it as a headquarters. Why he chose not to be a secret keeper of 4 Privet Drive (maybe so not to disrupt the daily life of the Dursleys) or the Potter House is unknown. Likely for drama building but in-world there is no reason given. Lazy writers choose to create a manipulative Dumbledore who for some reason chose to get rid of his equivalent to Lucius Malfoy in order to replace him with an unknown.

** I mean, the usefulness of the blood wards is strongly debateable - it only stops him being harmed by Voldemort and the man was a spirit, plus he had a couple dozen followers that could've Killing Curse'd him at any point on the way to and from school - but you're probably right about the in-world sentiment and trust of Dumbledore. There are a few stories that try break that trust first, usually with Sirius getting the full story of Harry's life and getting pissed that it all happened under Dumbledore's nose, but without that work to change the situation first, I'd probably agree with you.

*** Both canon and fanfiction put so much emphasis on those blood wards, but there is not a single known attempt on Harry's life.

**** Indeed. And that could equally be the Blood Wards being really good, the Blood Wards being really feared, random chance, or just authorial fiat (the likeliest of options :D).

**** Well that's because they fulfilled their purpose. Voldemort was waiting near the house in DH in order to attack Harry.

**** That's because Voldemort, by his own admission, couldn't through the protections, which is why he was waiting a short distance away in DH.
