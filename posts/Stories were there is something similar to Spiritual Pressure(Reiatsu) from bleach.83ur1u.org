Stories with something like Spiritual Pressure from Bleach, were Just being in the presents of a powerful magic user exerting there power is enough to incapacitate and kill weaker wizards and Muggle.(were powerful wizards like Dumbledore, Grindelwald , Voldemort and harry when flaring there power have a similar effect to Bleach captains)

would prefer harry to Be more like Zaraki Kenpachi or some other Blood knight that enjoys a good fight, were the closer to death he gets in a fight the more fun he is having


** Not really related but now that Harry's grown up, how strong is he ? Does he even compare to the likes of grindelwald voldemort and Dumbledore in terms of skill and ability and magical power to actually manage a spiritual presence to the point of it being oppressive when directed at someone?

*** I don't think that Canon harry is anywhere close to being as Powerful as grindelwald voldemort and Dumbledore even when we see him in the epilogue, mainly because he was infected by the Dursleys Fetish with being normal.

**** That, and he wouldn't have had much reason to "keep going" as far as power goes. No one "big" to directly fight, and his "legend" would scare off the small fry who would otherwise think of killing him. Complacency, lack of ambition and a desire for a simple life doesn't exactly aid in the gaining of power.

***** The thing about that is that because of harry fame one day someone is going to try and his Family is most likely going to suffer because of that. Harry really isn't anything special he won threw plot device.

really I'm almost cheering them on because harry won in such a bullshit way.

****** That is the sad truth. As soon as another "big fish" shows up, Harry and or his family is going to be assassinated, targeted, or kidnapped to force someone's hand. And Harry likely won't be up to the task since he's more medium fish, and most everyone is small fish, for analogy's sake.

******* yep although unlike Harrys Family I won't for sorry for him, for the same reason I don't feel sorry for Gohan in Dragonball super they both choose to be weak so they are suffering because of there own choices were as everyone else dosnt have a choice in being a weakling.

******** Yeah, Gohan and Harry both lost sight of what life really entailed for those like them. Harry only had to look at history to see that Voldemort won't be the last Dark Lord. And Gohan only would have to look at his own life to realize there would be more threats to the earth or his family.

  It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on. Harry is taken before he can make that choice and is thrown in an unexpected afterlife. Now he is on a mission to fight his way back to his own world.
