Edit: Possibly any fanfics where the villain is a character you wouldn't expect, or completely original. Of course, the fanfic has to be well-written.


** The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs. Voldemort is still a villain but is a side plot to what they are facing. If you've never read anything by him before, then you are in for a treat. linkffn(8629685)

** Though it was unfortunately never finished, the Lightning Speaker series by AntaresTheEighthPleiade has a seriously evil Dumbledore, as in 'dark lord spoken of in ancient prophecy' evil. Voldemort is still an antagonist, but relatively minor in comparison.

linkffn(5142024) is the first 'book' in the series, it manages to get up to a completed book 4 before crashing to a halt in book 5.

  Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.

** linkffn(A Second Chance at life)\\
Between this story and the sequel, Voldemort is a problem, but you learn of much greater things that are significantly worse. Unfortunately the 3rd and final story in the trilogy was abandoned.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has LV as a sort of mentor to Harry. He's not exactly an antagonist, but there are a few parts where he and Harry "fight." Dumbledore is also sort of an antagonist, but at the same time, he isn't exactly an antagonist, either.

Shame it isn't (and likely won't ever be) finished.

** Most of the "Evil Dumbledore" stories have him as the main villain while Voldemort is dealt with within 5k words. You should be a little more specific if you are looking for any of those since there are hundreds of them.
