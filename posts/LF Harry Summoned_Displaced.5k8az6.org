Fics in which Harry gets summoned into another world in order to help and assist with a task, whether it's HP universe or not. An example would be being summoned as a Heroic spirit in the Fate universe, or in the Naruto universe as an accident. I prefer if it's an experienced Harry or MOD, as long a he is competent and didn't end up winning the war by chance.

EDIT: The summon doesn't need to be intentional. It can be unspecified on the part who is being summoned, but there would be probably prerequisites that need to be met that Harry turns out to have. For all you know Harry, being bored, can intentionally get himself picked and hijack a summoning.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse by Hyliian)]]: This appears to be dead. The Order summons a MoD Harry who was basically a god.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief]]: This appears to be dead. This fails the experienced part of your request, but everything else fits. Unfortunately, this story chose to die at a cliffhanger that everyone wanted to know what happened afterward.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6320683/1/Yet-Another-Universe][Yet Another Universe by Silverfawkes]]: Complete, and basically your request word for word, unfortunately, has a bunch of bashing.

*Crossovers:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg]]: Mass Effect crossover, complete. Arguably not summoned, rather thrown forward in time and dropped on a planet, but he gets a task from the Geth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger]]: LotR crossover, actively updated (today actually), also MoD Harry. I haven't read this in ages, but iirc it was Harry fucking around all over Middle-earth about a thousand years before the plot kicks in. I am not doing it justice.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10695216/1/Fate-s-Gamble-Round-Two][Fate's Gamble: Round Two by Lupine Horror]]: Sequel to Fate's Gamble, Fate crossover, and on Hiatus (the author is working on Naruto stuff at the moment). You'll have needed to read the first (which is 930k words) to follow the characters in this, but you mentioned Fate so there's a chance you already have. Still, this is exactly what you asked for, summoned by the order to kill Voldemort.

*Every single Familiar of Zero crossover.* They are all someone is summoned into that world because that is the actual plot of the show.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8373937/1/A-Pet-Wizard][A Pet Wizard by Qaint]]: Familiar of Zero crossover, really good story imo, unfortunately dead. The plot is a generic Familiar of Zero plot which means *insert character here* is summoned by Louise. Unfortunately, it died before the plot really kicked off, but the potential was there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9278475/1/Gnosis][Gnosis by AngelicSentinel]]: Skyrim crossover, still updating just slower than it used to. This is Harry being transported into Skyrim, while he has no task at the start he gets one from a daedric prince. It's not quite what you asked for but it's a good read. I'd also suggest checking out the Skyrim/hp section, it has a fair amount of Harry is transported to Skyrim and the reverse.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10832447/1/Harry-Potter-Vampire-Hunter][Harry Potter - Vampire Hunter by FalcoSubbuteo]]: Hellsing Crossover, appears to be dead. Not summoned, rather transported via Veil of Death, oh and MoD Harry. This is basically Harry just being a member of Hellsing, it was good while it updated.

If you want I also have a good list of other stories that fit this bill but aren't Harry potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12168885/1/Queen-of-Conquerors][Queen of Conquerors by sakurademonalchemist]]: Fate crossover, actively updated. This is femHarry is summoned from her time by the goblet of fire, mind you, her time was back in the glory days of Alexander the Great.
