Now, I don't mean if you read the first chapter or even the first paragraph and said "Hell No!"

I mean if you got a good chunk into the story, liked what you were reading then got to the part where you just couldn't go on.

For example. I just Noped out of "The Accidental Animagus" for 3 reasons

1) The Language of Flowers theory was used leading to Snape giving Harry (Gryffindor) 2 points, which led to

(2) The twins telling Harry that was the best prank they have ever seen and they weren't worthy. Now the Twins said the same thing because Harry Potter was going to read stories about Harry Potter in an earlier chapter. I'm not getting into why I hate this if it isn't obvious

3) After chapter 12 the kids don't talk like kids anymore. 11 year olds start talking about politics and "pulling rank" and house names and Lords and alliances...


** "The Black Heir". Interesting Dumstrang!Harry story that was pretty good until the moment Voldemort randomly pulled down Harry's pants and had his way with him.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, and I did it far too late. Somehow I wasted hours on reading two thirds of this pile of rubbish. The characterization is horrendous, especially Snape, Neville and any female character are unrecognizable. Female characters mostly play the roles of love interests, victims to be avenged or at best healers. The story claims to be canon-compliant, but that only means that it doesn't outright contradict any of the events Neville describes in Deathly Hallows. Some plots were downright ridiculous, like the infamous execution chamber scene, in which Percy was actually a polyjuiced Viktor Krum. With all these flaws mentioned, most of all I hated the constant glorification of child soldiers.

I always hear about how it starts weak and bashes characters, but only in the beginning, so I gave it a try. I couldn't handle the cringey dialogue. Characters that the author is fond of constantly give long victorious/malicious monolouges that all the passerby are incredibly impressed and frightened by and everyone is retconned to hate the characters that the author is not fond of.

I know that it's an AU, but I had to nope out when Madam Longbottom was like "Frank always said you were immature and horrible," in response to James being like "Howdy, how have you been? I was Frank's friend btw."

I was interested when I saw Sirius hated James in the first chapter because they were the best of friends, so how could that happen? But I didn't want to find out anymore after reading the above chapter because there probably wasn't a good reason at all.

*** PoS is... a mixed bag. It's plotted well and takes pride in subverting a lot of HP fandom tropes. I appreciate how it's tried to flesh out the world and explain so many inconsistencies and oddities of canon.

That said, there's something irritatingly smug about the whole thing. Like, HPMOR smug. The author seems to take pleasure in pointing out how unexpected this plot point was or how clever this character is. Maybe not helped by the constant wordy infodumps.

I sometimes return to that fic because it is so good.

***** I agree with [[/u/PM_ME_BABY_PANDAS]] here. It's pretty smug, especially the author notes. He constantly claims that he brilliantly subverted a cliche here or there, while most of his fic has the most cliches I've seen in a while. When is he actually going to subvert the bashing, the slytherin!Gary-Sue!SuperSmart!Harry, wrong-boy-who-lived shenanigans of the worst sort... etc? Maybe it's just a language problem, but subversion means undermining it, not blowing it up to the max (For example subervting the "Harry confronts Evil!Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche would be Dumbledore laughing in his face and killing/obliviating Harry outright, because it's stupid to openly confront the evil Dark Lord. Of course that ends a fic, but I couldn't come up with a better example on the spot).

****** It's already done.

In the author notes,the author doesn't "claims that he brilliantly subverted a cliche" he simply explains what he's done. Not necessarily the best of ideas, but not what you say either.

The wrong boy who lived plot is subverted. Harry isn't the boy who lived at all in this story, his brother is.

Gary stu/super smart, didn't notice. At all. There are a lot of smart people in this story (pettygrew for instance) besides Harry. Harry himself has an evolution during the story. He doesn't seem invincible or better than everyone either.

There's no evil!Dumbledore in the story either. The reason why Harry has been sent to the Dursleys does seem a little farfetched, but I never seen it done this way before (a mistake that is recognized as such by his parents very early in the story) and really avoid the bashing.

The evolution of Jim (harry's brother) throughout the story is interesting. I find this Snape really cool, also.

If you want to subvert some cliche, you need to have some cliche first.

Subverting a cliche is indeed undermining it. For example, if Harry is sent to the Dursleys by parents that seek to protect him (and later admit their faults, at least to themselves) this cliche is undermined to me.

Evil!manipulative!Dumbledore kills Harry during their confrontation isn't a subvertion. The subvertion would be, harry confronts Dumbledore, and it turns out that Dumbledore isn't evil, is really on Harry's side, and really does everything he can considering the circumstances, despite having seem evil and manipulative before that point in the story. In your idea, the trope evil!manipulative!Dumbledore is played straight, no subverted. Or even Dumbledore could have a good reason to act the way he does (for instance, Dumbledore isn't evil, harry really is manipulated by the Horcrux and cannot be saved anymore so Dumbledore really acts for the better would be another subvertion, although maybe a little tough to pull off).

A really badass Pettygrew that betrayed the marauders for other reasons that cowardice, is another subvertion.

I'm sorry, but I'm really under the impression that we haven't read three same "Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin. Because I never seen as much tropes being subverted in another HP fanfic.

**** Because James had friends, but the author retcons every single one away from him. I wouldnt be surprised if in later chapters, his wife and (other) kid said they didn't love him. Because why would James lie to Madam Longbottom? There isnt a reason, the author is just trying to make James seem as horrible as possible. And then right after she said that, Neville, who was with her, was like, "OOOOHH BURRNNNED" (basically :P). So James face turns super red and he's really angry and embarrassed.

I just cant take that this happens in EVERY single scene James is in in the entire story. There can be bad and evil characters in the world, but even they are respected by ignorant passerby. Even they have friends and families and redeeming qualities. The author also makes sure to tell us that /she is not, in fact, bashing James even though they obviously are.

The scene right after that is Lily running after Snape to explain her part in the crime that has everyone hating her and her family. Imo her monologue was well placed and well written because she barely spoke in the story previously. However, everything that Snape ever has to say so far is conveyed is a cringey speech despite him being one of the quieter characters. And of course he goes off on Lily about not being his friend and what she did to Harry (its a twin boy who lived story) even though nothing was even her (or James!) fault. Snape even says "I'm over you," which is the most out of character line I've ever seen from him.

** Can't remember the last fic I honestly noped out of, but I had one I was very, very, close.

I read the Inquisitor Carrow series, and in the beginning I honestly loved it. I found it very funny having Harry come back after spending centuries in the WH40K Universe.

My problem with this story came late into it, when the author brought in a personal pet peeve of mine.

It comes out later in the story that something like 5-10% Muggleborns leave Britain for greener pastures, the rest however, are either Janitors, Magical Criminals or Prostitutes.

First, there's the fact that Dumbledore is a true leader of the Light in this, not some manipulating Dark Lord, yet he has apparently never noticed that he doesn't see or hear from graduated muggleborns much.

Second and most importantly, THEY HAVE MAGIC, HOW CAN THEY BE SO POOR THEY'RE WILLING TO SELL THEMSELVES.

This is an incredible pet peeve of mine. In canon Harry Potter, the Weasley's are somewhat poor, but that can be explained by the fact that they're Purebloods and know next to nothing of the muggle world.

Also, in canon we're told that the Ministry have some magic detectors, which are used to search for underage magic, this is why when Dobby uses magic at 4th Privet Drive, Harry is the one who is found guilty.

What does this mean? It means, most likely, that there are very few of these magic monitors around the country, that would mean muggleborns can perform magic freely, so long as they aren't seen.

Now, all of this was leading up to that I can't understand how muggleborns, people who lived in the muggle world can somehow loose their collective intelligence and not use magic there to earn money.

They can visit scrapyards and use the Summoning Charm to find gold, or the Mending Charm to fix broken things which they can then resell.

And let's not forget, shouldn't it be so simple to steal from muggles using magic? Some kind of switching charm or something else?

Anyway, sorry for the somewhat rant but I get frustrated when authors try to create a grimdark setting, but they fail to actually put in the effort to make that grimdarkness make sense.

**** I've pushed my boundaries, and I have to draw the line somewhere. One of the first fics recommended to me was this Hermione/Snape story( Pet Project I think), and I was okay until the moment they actually did get together, and then it hit me how creepy it was with the age difference, and how most others in the story were "understanding" or temporarily frothing at the mouth. I finished it for the plot, skipping the rest of the romance, but that was the first and only one I read. Even timetravel fics make me slightly wary, but I will skip the romance if I have to.

The Alkahest also made me uncomfortable, being a Draco/Hermione story, but that was mostly because I didn't feel like the older Malfoys deserved the level of trust and acceptance they were getting, especially from Hermione. Apart from a couple of paragraphs, we don't really see them earning their good end.

The problem with Firebird's Son is that I have to read the creepy stuff to understand what Harry is, what his powers are and what's going on, I can't skip the smut like I do for almost all stories.

In a way. I'm not there yet (so not before the first sequel). It isn't a set up for wish fulfillment, though. It's really about a totalitarian state dominated by a few witches, where wizards are considered dangerous and so are bonded to witches (the bond happen to weaken the wizard for some reason). It's a smart but really creepy distopy.

Not quite. It's actually inverted. The girls are trying to grope the guys, who do their utmost to avoid them. It's really messed up, there's nothing you could find attractive in there.

I'd say nothing stops you from reading a few more chapters to see if you like it. It's a very unusual fic.

** I'm in the process of noping out of Debt of Time, which is apparently a hugely popular fic. And I'm almost done with it, so given how long it is of a story, I feel like I wasted so much time.

Hermione is weirdly possessive and the growth that her character makes doesn't always seem very sincere, but rather forced. Seems like, toward the end, the author simply was trying to make a statement with this new found character growth, rather than trying to make it believable.

I simply got to the point where no amount of otherwise good writing or plot could keep my eyes from rolling out of my head

Yes, he was mistreated in canon, but not that badly. It always makes me a little angry because there ARE kids out there that those things are happening to, and the authors always just put it in their stories to make Harry pitiful but then he goes to visit the Weasleys and suddenly he's perfectly happy and well-balanced. That's not how it works. It's a cheap trick and I have yet to see an example of an author treating the subject with the respect it deserves.

I'm not sure that's the only reason (I noped out at the same point). I've read other fics or even Novels with underage sex (A Song Of Ice and Fire for example) that didn't disgust me in such a profound way. It would be interesting to find out why that scene feels so sick/perverse to so many people... probably has something to do with the fact that she is trying to reward Harry for rescuing her (if I remember correctly) and /that's/ the first thing she thinks of? I think that's a big red flag for a child that has been sexually abused. There's just something profoundly wrong with that scene.

** Casting moonshadows

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows]]

A hugely popular story.

I got far into and just started being more and more freaked out.

I haven't read it in years. My memory is that the story starts to derail and goes from fluffyish to dark and meandering very suddenly.

Vague memories of Sirius becoming an alcoholic when he's like 13.

Remus starts dying and his friends hide him in a toilet and he has all these creepy weird fever dream type things.

They're all just kids but there's like no adults involved at all.

I think there's creepy somewhat non consensual under age sex scenes.

Really derogatory themes about women being vapid sluts.

If anything, after I got a few chapters into the crazy it was his popular the story was that wigged me out.

I kind of want to reread it now.

Some of the forced marriage law stories are really weird too.

I read disguised affections more than once for some reason, and that's pretty fucking grizzly at times too.

***** I feel like that's a poor reason to drop a fic. The idea of fridging is something you would find in the TVTropes school of literary analysis - they would tell you that the work was poor because it was exclusionary and the author was being tasteless. But, I've seen cases where this trope is executed flawlessly and tastefully, and the work is /still/ labeled as poor or lazy. The only sin of the author in this case was taking advantage of his reader's protective instincts.

(I'm not saying that it isn't an adequate measure of a book's quality, but using it as your metre stick might be a little excessive. And sometimes good books can have elements that you might consider strange or esoteric.)

I'll leave you with a question:

The justification for this and the Bechdel Test is that a book that doesn't meet these standards is /lazy/ - that the author could have employed another device at that moment that wouldn't be gender exclusive. (whether or not this trope actually /is/ gender exclusive is an argument for another date) But do you think authors did it to be cheap, or that the did it because it was expected in the genre? What exact device, in this case, might they have used in its place?

I have seen stories that kill the person a man is /in love with/ in a brutal and unforgiving way, which then makes the protagonist sad. But I've also seen stories kill or maim a person that the /female protagonist/ is in love with, and the gender distribution of this trope is generally getting better as time goes on. I feel like you're trying to shove gender into a trope where no gender honestly belongs, because this juicy morsel of misrepresentation is too good to pass up. You're focusing on "brutally murdered" and "helpless" like the author isn't sad about killing off their character either, like these things aren't /supposed/ to provoke an emotional reaction in the reader.

Is /The Hunger Games/ suddenly a bad story because Peeta spends most of his time injured or brainwashed? Is /The Fault in Our Stars/ awful because Augustus has fatal cancer? Do you have a problem with the /trope/ or the /gender/ behind it?

That's the question I'm asking.

Much more than a rephrasing. In the first case, you need to have read at least two stories in which a female character was killed off in a tasteful manner. In the second, you must not have read any stories featuring fridging. It's the difference between "somewhere exists that isn't Cambodia" and "I've never seen a place that is in Cambodia".

The trope is depressingly common in video game plots.

#+begin_quote

That's not this trope. If it were, it would be a gender inversion of it, which is an improvement. Context matters.

Again, that's not the same trope. Nowhere near. That entire story is about Augustus and the fact that he is dying of cancer and the effect it has on him and those around him. He's given the characterization that is nearly absent in most cases of fridging.

/The Fault in Our Stars/ is about characters with long-term, often fatal illnesses. The character mentioned was the main love interest, features prominently throughout the work, and dies in the end. At his introduction, it's made clear that he has a probably-terminal case of testicular cancer. In the end, he dies, probably peacefully. (I haven't read it.)

Is cancer an antagonist then? And he dies but isn't killed by another person and it wasn't solely to affect the protagonist, and he was well characterized beforehand.

** I now absolutely soured on time travel fics trying to maintain the "time line". I tried to reread *Backward with Purpose I* yesterday, and had to stop because the protagonists appeared awfully stupid to me.

For example, they let Dumbledore and Snape in their plans right from the start, and they knew the nature of Quirrelmort. So instead of playing out the 'time line', a better and far less risky solution would be to capture Voldemort, force him to spill all his secrets, obliviate him back to infancy, douse him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.

Other Year 1 actions should include:

- Capture Wormtail and free Sirius Black
- Buy a few Goblin made weapons, open the Chamber, use Harry's Parselmouth ability to control the Basilisk, and imbue those weapons with its venom. They didn't necessarily need Gryffindor's Sword.
- Send anonymous tips about Barty Jr to Amelia Bones, that should get Jr kissed and Sr locked up forever in Azkaban (as payback for Sirius)
- Having established credibility with the Barty Jr tip, send another one about Lucy's secret stash under his drawing room. That should net them the Diary and Lucy's extended vacation with dementors. Force Narcissa to sell out Lucy for Draco's sake, and confiscate significant amount of Malfoy assets.
- Next, Dumbledore worked a little politics/magic to have the Lestranges killed, with Bellatrix being the last. Sirius and Andromeda would then inherit the Lestrange vault, get the Cup, and pay compensation to the Longbottoms.
- With most horcruxes and Lucy gone, they now had some time to enjoy Hogwarts a little bit and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- Harry, Sirius, Andromeda, and Longbottoms should control large amount of resources by now and would influence Fudge to behave better. Getting rid of Umbridge should also be easy. They could further invest their money in tech stocks just to maximize future returns.

If you have advance knowledge, you better put it to good use instead of trying to repeat the "time line".

*** /Backward With A Purpose/ has no mistakes. It is amazingly well written both from a plot mechanics point of view and from the raw quality of the prose. On the plot: the author was obsessive, planned out everything in advance, apparently overhauled the whole thing several times before releasing it to make sure the entire thing was internally consistent, and there are /literally no plot holes/. (Any hole you think is there has an explanation by the time you hit the end.) If you think a character in that story is doing something stupid, there's a reason for it, and that reason is [[/spoiler][that they're all being manipulated by another time traveler, which becomes obvious as the story progresses and is confirmed at the end.]]

The alternative story you describe, btw, would be horribly boring wish fulfillment as there would be no conflict in it and it would be over in thirty pages. For a story to be interesting, there needs to be conflict and struggle, or there is no suspense, no reason to continue to read.

If that's the sort of story you want, there are, of course, literally hundreds of poorly written Peggy Sue fics with similar plots out there. Half of them start with Harry buying a special magical trunk and somehow charming the Goblins by knowing their culture. /Those/ are stories that I "nope" out of, btw.

By contrast, /Backward With A Purpose/ is probably the best Peggy Sue fic ever written, and coming anywhere close to it in quality would be damn hard.

That's certainly not true of /any/ work of fiction, let alone an unpublished fanfiction.

Just because silly decisions/plot points are justified at the end doesn't make it a perfect fic. For a more extreme example, see HPMoR. The protagonist is arrogant and cold; the reason for this is explained at the end in a rather intriguing way, but that doesn't excuse the reader having to sit through 100 chapters of a horrible protagonist.

Generally, I think that if a story is going to be interesting, you have to fear for the ability of the characters to succeed. If you know in advance that they're going to be fine, that they're going to achieve all their goals and there will be nothing in the way, then there's no point in reading since you already know how it all turns out.

If you want your heroes to have an easy time achieving their goals, then yes, there's loads of wish fulfillment fic out there, but again, to me it's boring stuff with very little to recommend it. However, if it's the sort of thing you like, hey, enjoy. Everyone has their tastes.

******* That's far more interesting than 'keeping the timeline ' bullshit. I want to see protagonists coming up with a good plan and encountering unexpected problems. The plan they had in BWP was utterly insane, risky, and stupid.

Although I made an outline of potential actions that sounded good, things still could go seriously wrong:

- Voldemort made successful escape (not likely though if Dumbledore was on the ball. He could just invite Quirrell for a chat in his office and trap him there)
- Wormtail got away (not likely if AD and Harry were on the ball)
- Amelia Bones was not cooperative, such as going after Barty Sr or searching Malfoy Manor (likely because she might not be such a good person described in many fics)
- Lucy got inside tip and managed to hide his stuffs, now the location of the Diary would be a mystery (very likely)
- Goblins were not cooperative and refused to yield Lestrange vault under any circumstance (very likely)
- The good guys were having major differences and falling out among themselves (likely if the main threat had diminished)
- Protagonists had major psychological issues after getting rid of their main threat (very likely).
- Past friendships might not form again, such as Ron failing to make friend with Hermione because he was different now (likely)
- Good guys from previous timeline, especially the kids, had new experiences and might turn out the opposite way (likely)
- Harry and Ginny couldn't control themselves, and Harry alienated the rest of the Weasleys (likely)

I mean the possibilities for new problems are pretty much endless, and none of them would involve 'keeping the timeline' nonsense.
