Serious, angsty and sad, calling out canon, happy and fluffy, humorous -- doesn't matter. I actually have a file where I save some quotes I especially liked and I was going through it recently. There's some of them:

“...she doubted that the members of the room needed to know that the three of them broke into a high security government building to steal a priceless family heirloom from a high ranking ministry official and managed to cause general chaos and carnage as a result... When Hermione thought about it like that it actually sounded rather illegal...”

“Looking back the idea that Hogwarts was completely safe was utter rubbish, in first year there was Fluffy, Quirrellmort and the troll, second year was the obliviator extrodinare and the Basilisk; third was swarms of dementors and an "escaped mass murderer" who managed to penetrate the grounds; fourth was dragons and death eaters both visible and in disguise, while the fifth year was Dolores freaking Umbridge and her bloody quill (pun intended). Oh yes, Hogwarts was safe, safe indeed.”

“...in one night six underage students were able to capture more death eaters than the entire ministry and their auror corps has in six months.” -- all from some reading the books fic I've read a long time ago

"Let Albus deal with it," Severus advised. "He will anyway, and then you can say you know no more about the matter, and he will twinkle everyone into submission." -- from Escape, I think

"Snape was once more wondering why the world hated him so much, the first ever Weasley sorted into Slytherin and he brings a pet death eater along to keep him company!" - some crack?

  "He just threatened me!" Ron said frantically to the professors.

  Before Flitwick could say anything, Professor Snape addressed Ron directly. "Mr. Potter no longer goes to school here, Weasley. What would you like for us to do? Take twenty points from Durmstrang?"

  "Remus isn't plain, or beige-“ Lily started to defend her friend, but was cut short by Severus.

  “The man is the walking definition of neutral,” he said. “Once, I was in the library, and I was leaning against a shelf, when it was actually Lupin in a brown sweater,” Severus said. “He just stood there for ten minutes, and then he goes, ‘Alright, Severus?' Damn near have me a heart attack!”

** “20. I am not allowed to make lightsaber noises with my wand.

It was the first meeting of Dumbledore's Army. Harry was nervous about the beginning of his teaching career, and it didn't help that he had so many students watching him as if they expected, well, magic.

"Right," he began. "So, you might have to duel in the future... and, er... it's important that you know how to use your wand." He waved Ron forward, signaling that he wanted to duel him as a demonstration.

The two best friends stepped into the middle of the room, holding their wands at the ready. "So the most important thing..." Harry muttered as they bowed. "It's simple, really..." They looked at each other, concentration across both of the young boy's faces. And then the duel began. "Schoom!"

Eyebrows went up as Harry waved his wand around, sending absolutely no spell towards Ron. "The most important thing is the sound effects." Harry said, waving his wand around again as Ron stared in surprise. "Schoom! That way, Sching! You can confuse your opponent. Sching! And do this."

*And with that, Harry punched Ron in the nose, proving once again how important the lightsaber noises are to a duel.*”

** My favorite lines come from [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** “I began the mental litany of curses I had developed countercurses for. Full Body-Bind, Jelly-Fingers, Entrail-Expelling, Fiendfyre, Lycacomia, Sectumsempra...

That last one had made Snape absolutely livid, of course. I smiled, remembering the scowl he wore when he first heard. His pet construct had been quite a beautiful thing -- such lovely angles to it, and a gorgeous winding, intricate shape. But so easy to invert once you could really see it fully. Snape had incredible talent, it was true. I simply had more.”

#+begin_quote
  Aftermath of first Gryffindor/Slytherin first year potions class, September, 1991

  "Neville Longbottom requires remedial potions classes. The boy's confidence is so shot, and his self-esteem so low, that he's awalking disaster zone in the potions class right now. If he were one of my Slytherins, I'd be investigating his home-situation forcircumstances of abuse by one or more of his relatives, but he's a Gryffindor, so that falls within Minerva's purview. What is my concern, is that right now I can't afford him to be anywhere near a cauldron in the middle of a class. He turned a simple boil-cure into something which melted a cauldron earlier today, which took a particular kind carelessness. He requires one-on-onetuition, with a reassuring presence."

  "Hmm, yes, Severus. But what about Harry?"

  "I am unaware, headmaster, of any student attending Hogwarts this year of the surname of 'Harry'."

  "Harry Potter, Severus."

  "Ah: Mr. Potter. As with many Gryffindors, he seems to regard it as reasonable to mess around in my classes because theyare Gryffindors -- and I am the head of Slytherin. I was pleasantly surprised that he seems slightly more subdued at the onsetthan I recall his father being, but I dare say that that will wear off. If he becomes overly disruptive, I shall simply eject him from my lessons, which I wish that Professor Slughorn had done with his father and his gang. However, getting back to NevilleLongbottom..."

  Albus sighed.

  "With respect, Headmaster, there is no 'I' in teacher and I am reliably informed that I never loved Lily Evans, but merely had an unhealthy obsession with her.

  “Harry, no one is taking Professor Snape from you.” Dumbledore replied, his voice strong as he stood still. “The curse in my hand is slowly killing me. When the time comes, if Draco chooses the light, I need someone who will show mercy to an old man.”

  Harry stared at the blackened shrivelled hand, and then at the objects on the table he now had a name for. Horcruxes. He looked back at the man he used to regard as his hero, and was reminded of people too lost in the details to see the bigger picture anymore.

  “Will you deserve it?” Harry asked quietly, feeling like a complete arse. He didn't dare meet the headmaster's eyes as he left the office.

​

I really, really like a super-long quote from from "The Fifth Act" by oliver.snape (ffn 5706309/17/) , where Harry finally agrees to talk to Dumbledore's portrait, and takes him to task for the way he used Snape.

#+begin_quote
  Harry leaned against the edge of the desk as he studied Dumbledore's portrait. He knew it had been hanging there since the day after Snape had killed him; he'd even talked to Dumbledore in the hours after the battle. Harry couldn't remember much of what he'd said though, as he'd been completely exhausted at the time.

  Dumbledore sat quietly and watched back, seemingly waiting for Harry to start first.

  "I am not mad at you." Harry finally stated, becoming slightly uncomfortable in the silence.

  "That's a start." Dumbledore said, keeping his gaze. He seemed to want to say something else, but then thought better of it.

  "I'm disappointed." Harry continued, feeling a bit more courageous. This was not the same man who had leveled the prophecy down on him when he was 15.

  "How could you send him to die?" Harry asked, his voice wavering a little.

  Whatever words Albus Dumbledore had been waiting for, those were not them.

  "Pardon?" Dumbledore thought back on the past years of war, but did not remember sending anyone to his or her death.

  "You sent him to die. You knew Voldemort would want the wand, and by asking him to kill you, you sent him to die. What did Severus Snape ever do to you to deserve that?"

  Harry crossed his arms as he leaned against the desk, his eyes fierce with determination and...protectiveness. Dumbledore found he could not keep his gaze with Harry, a first in his many years.

  "Harry, I only hope that you can forgive an old man once more." Harry scoffed slightly at this, but did not interrupt.

  "I confess that I took advantage of Severus. When he first asked to join the light side, he was overcome with guilt and I wished to show him that he could wash the blood from his hands by helping in the war." Dumbledore kept his eyes trained on Harry's, and Harry could see tears sitting in the corners of them.

  "Over the years he became my most trusted soldier in the fight against Voldemort, taking a larger risk with his life than anyone else in the Order. I loved him like a son, and placed my faith in him."

  Dumbledore took a breath, and noted that Harry did not move a muscle. Living with Snape had changed his temper, it seemed.

  "When you came to school it became obvious that Voldemort was gaining strength, and after the Triwizard tournament, I asked Severus to go back to the Death Eater meetings. I knew how dangerous they were, but after years of having Severus by my side, helping the Order, I knew he would pull through. He knew the risks, and I assumed that he would be safe. He is the most gifted occlumens I have ever met, and I knew he would be able to keep himself safe from Voldemort. I knew that he could complete any task that needed to be done to end the war."

  "And what did you do to ensure his safety?" Harry asked, softly.

  Dumbledore looked away, and Harry got his answer. Nothing.

  "Did you think that Voldemort wouldn't kill him in the end?" Harry started, still not moving from his position.

  "I had hoped that Sev..." Dumbledore was cut off before he could complete the name.

  "If he survived, had you no thought as to what the rest of the world would think of him? Where he would live without being persecuted? He lived here for sixteen years before you ordered him to kill you. This was his home, where he felt safest. And you made him shed blood here, you made him live here after you were gone, after the only father figure he had ever had abandoned him."

  Harry's voice was cold, and Dumbledore was eerily reminded of a conversation in the September before the war had ended, when Snape had leaned against the desk in very much the same pose, and had accused him of using Harry as a means to an end.

  "Worst of all, you let him believe that he was only important for this bloody war. He knew that for all your planning, you didn't have a safe way out for him. He fully expected not to survive." Harry finished, before standing up straight.

  Dumbledore had absolutely nothing to say. He'd been so occupied about planning to leave the wand where Harry could get it, to leave the stone so Harry could summon the courage to end... oh blast. Harry did not like to be kept in the dark, and he'd not even told the boy all that time he was alive that Harry was to die by Voldemort's hand.

  No wonder they had been reluctant to talk to him.

  "I did not want him to be killed." Dumbledore finally said, sadness in his voice.

  "But you didn't try to prevent it. Sometimes..." Harry pressed, wanting to make a point, "it's not just trust in a person that makes them feel loved. Sometimes it's a little thing, like a simple gesture of taking care of them."

  Harry and Ron quickly scarffed down some scrambled eggs before they were hurried outside to two Ministry cars.

  "Whoa!" Ron said with an excited but shocked face. "How did Dad manage to get these? I thought Fudge would never, ever -- "

  "That's part of the reason why we're hurrying, Ron. Dumbledore can't keep fifteen missing cars a secret for long." Mrs. Weasley hurried them all into the cars.

  "Fifteen!" Ron shouted, but Mrs. Weasley had slammed the door before he could say much else.

** Survival is a Talent is a treasure trove when it comes to great quotes, but I honestly can't pick. Most of them are so great because they are hilarious, but it also has one of the best character arcs for Draco Malfoy's character that I've ever read, so I guess I should go with a part of that.

  “I don't care that you're a werewolf!” he says, furious, “We were down there with Pettigrew and dementors, and you were the least monstrous of them all, even when you transformed. It's -- terrifying, and awful. But I don't suppose you can help being a werewolf any more than Millie can help having a muggle mother, or Hermione being a mudblood, or Hagrid a half-breed. So -- so I've decided it doesn't matter.”

**** Except for the fact that the killing curse can go through shields, which weakens my argument a bit, I feel that it makes sense for a wizard society to ban the curses.

There's no reason for torture or mind control when you've got other ways to compel people to divulge information (Veritaserum and Legimancy, for instance).

As for the killing curse, it's as easy to fire a killing curse as it is to fire a non-lethal curse to incapacitate someone, in almost all situations. It's not like real life, where in self-defense the only real quick acting options are lethal. Especially with a gun.

  "I find a small pot of good tea can reduce many troubling problems to a manageable size," the Headmaster commented when a house elf had delivered the tea tray and poured them both cups.

  Rigel swirled the tea pensively, watching the little twister in the center of her cup with detached curiosity. "Would that tea could reduce an entire nation's pride and folly to a more manageable size," she said after a moment.

  Dumbledore hummed thoughtfully. "You'd have to poison a great deal of tea."
