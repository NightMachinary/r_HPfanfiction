We've all seen those fics where Harry finds that he has a family vault in addition to his trust vault and in it is a mind bogglingly massive amount of money. I'm quite certain I've seen fics where the Potter vault has more gold in it than humanity has ever mined.

So I'm looking to see if there are any parody/comedy fics where Harry discovers this and immediately goes about drowning his big problems in money. Huge bounties on all the Death Eaters. A clan of vampire assassins hired on retainer to hunt them until they're all dead. Rent a massive vault in the depths of Gringotts, build a mansion in it, fidelius it, pay someone to agree to be the secret keeper then transfigured into a galleon and hidden a vault in a different country until the Voldemort thing blows over. Buy a huge plot of land or something to give to the centaurs in exchange for regular prophetic updates on Voldemort/Death Eater movement.

Over the top stuff like that.

Do any fics like this exist?

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry is fed up with the lies of the ministry, the slander of the prophet and the inaction of everyone around him in the face of Voldemort's return. After careful thinking he has come to a conclusion: find Peter Pettigrew and you find the truth. Hence Harry puts a 100,000 Galleon reward on Peter's head and watches as the entire magical community goes mad in the race to find him.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Hogwarts' Dawn]] by Jeconais is a bit of a stretch as the impetus is different, but it probably qualifies. Definitely starts off with that money/fix-it theme.

**** To be fair, FFA has a large collectiion of the best classic authors from HP Fanfic. It's worth registering, even if you create a throwaway.

Alternatively, a lot of those fics are posted elsewhere
