****** Stalin and Mao starved untold millions of people (estimates around 60 million, the number that died in WWII).

******* Stalin was far more malicious though, as he intentionally starved millions to death.

Mao's catastrophic "Giant Leap Forward" was mostly the result of failed and misguided policies.

Mao's "Anti Rightists Campaign" and "Cultural Revolution" were directly targeting his political opponents. However, the death toll was nowhere near the level of the "Giant Leap Forward" or Stalin's many atrocities.

But regardless, Communism failed in Muggle world because of its abysmal economic productivity. However, could it have worked in Magical world, since Wizards are many times more productive than Muggles to begin with?

******** Maybe, but I honestly don't think so. Any system is open to corruption and communism has proven time and again to allow a dictator to take power, from Castro to the Kim family. I don't think the wizards would fair any better.

********* I would argue that the British Ministry of Magic in the Books was even worse than a dictatorship. It was more like an oligarchy bordering on failed state. A (benevolent) dictatorship can actually get some good things done, as today's China shows.

The more interesting regarding Magical Britain is its postwar form of government. Is a democracy made up of stupid British Purebloods really preferable than a benevolent dictatorship by Hermione Granger?

********** I have to go with a quote from Legend of Galactic heroes here: a good dictatorship is far better than a bad democracy and even preferable to a good democracy, but even a bad democracy is preferable to a bad dictatorship.

In other words, democracies are mediocre and can be bad, but dictators are extreme. A good one is great, but a bad one is so horrific it can destroy millions and send civilization crashing down.
