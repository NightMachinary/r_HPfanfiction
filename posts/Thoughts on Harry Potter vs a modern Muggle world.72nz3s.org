  has not seemed to change for a long time- magically, technologically or culturally
#+end_quote

You know, besides the war in 1939-1945 where people wanted to take over the muggles which isn't a thing anymore. Oh, and you know the movement of Voldemort that is pro-traditional pureblood that apparently was so needed it gained followers. They had two semi-revolutionary wars in the last 100 years, and participated in World War 1 as well.

I don't think it's as stagnant as you make it out to be.

#+begin_quote
  but there is a consistent theme in Harry Potter of the fact that Wizards are simply less powerful than they used to be
#+end_quote

Actually, I'd like to have a source for that. We get often told about the historical figures and sometimes how powerful they were, but if we look at some old artifacts they are easily reproduced by modern wizard. Take the ancient sorting hat for example, I'd say that it's no more or less powerful than the diary. And talking mirrors seem to be the standard in modern wizarding society.

Sure, the ceiling of the great hall is impressive, but the modern wizards at the ministry manage to do the same things with the enchanted underground-windows.

So I'm not particularly seeing that.

#+begin_quote
  In my opinion, it is down to a lack of willingness to learn
#+end_quote

No, it is more than unwillingness and much more complex than you make it out to be. The wizards *can't* interact with Muggles in a normal way. They can't make friends, because they had to lie all the time to any muggle friends. Imagine you want a few Muggle friends:

- Hey, what is your job? (You have to lie.)
- What are your hobbies? (You have to lie.)
- What was your day like? (You have to lie.)
- Where did you go to school? (You have to lie.)
- Where did you go this Christmas? ("The Dragon Reserve in Romania.")
- Favorite Subject? Favorite Book? Favorite Song? Opinion on politics? ...

All things were you either have to lie, and can't be entirely truthful. If you can't answer the most basic questions about yourself, how can you expect a good friendship with anyone? This taints every single interaction they have with Muggles. You could go to your Muggle friend that you can tell nothing about anything and you'd feel even worse for lying... or just talk to your wizard friends.

Is it such a wonder that a lot of them don't interact often? It's uncomfortable to lie, and hard to keep lies like that straight - and that doesn't even include the factor of how many people would end a friendship when they would learn that the one they are talking to can alter their memories.

Listen to [[https://youtu.be/tD-hzFTifww?t=29][Grindelwald's speech here]].

--------------

*MADAM PICQUERY*\\
He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj. He risked the exposure of our community. He has broken one of our most sacred laws---

*GRAVES*\\
^{(laughing bitterly)}

A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter! A law that demands that we conceal our true nature! A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear lest we risk discovery! I ask you, Madam President---\\
^{(eyes flashing to all present)}\\
---I ask all of you---who does this law protect? Us?\\
^{(gesturing vaguely to the No-Majs above)}\\
Or them?\\
^{(smiling bitterly)}\\
I refuse to bow down any longer.

--------------

This is a common theme in Grindelwald's message, and it has gathered followers. They are the ones that were attacked (Witch Burnings) because of Muggle religion, and /they/ hid. They aren't at fault, but they are the ones who have to live in secret. Is a dislike for Muggles and Muggle-Culture really so surprising and bad as you make it out to be?

Do you *want* to accept the culture of the monsters who killed innocent people at stake? The ones who started both recent world-wars, and built weapons that could literally end the world as we know it? The ones who want your children dead?

Do you want to copy that culture to wizards, where potentially everyone might be able to build the equivalent of a nuclear bomb? Or do you want to keep a conservative, heavily regulated culture that prevents people blowing each other up?

#+begin_quote
  protego protects from other spells, but I am not sure if it does from a rifle round
#+end_quote

Protego protects from solid objects. Wizards can put up shield-domes within seconds: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGNi64PkhzE&feature=youtu.be&t=67][Scene from FB]], and you have to assume that it can easily block bullets and similar. With magic like that, wizards could probably keep up in a muggle fight if they are given minimal time to prepare. (Have a few people throw up a temporary shield with protego, and raise a dome. Apparate out from time to time under invisibility cloaks and fire bombardment curses at the enemy army. Repeat.)

I doubt it's easy to test how wizarding vs. muggle combat would look like, but you have to keep one thing in mind: The current Muggle society is /fragile/. You know how you could keep a muggle military incredibly busy?

Take 5 wizards. Apparate to important points in the energy-grid (transformers, ...), explode them and put up strong muggle-repelling charms. Keep that up for for 5-10 days, and watch Muggle society collapse. This isn't a joke, but a guerrilla war with the intention to destroy the modern Muggle society would be incredibly disastrous. I'm not saying that the wizards would /win/ in the end, but it is a cold-war situation. And that isn't even considering imperious and other measures wizards could take.

#+begin_quote
  [wizarding world is stagnant]
#+end_quote

But developments /do/ happen, but at a slower pace. Look at Fred & George for one example. Another example is from Pottermore, about wandlore:

#+begin_quote
  Early in my career, as I watched my wandmaker father wrestling with substandard wand core materials such as kelpie hair, I conceived the ambition to discover the finest cores and to work only with those when my time came to take over the family business.
#+end_quote

So even with things as old as wands there is still some innovation happening!

*** Good points all around- thanks for sharing! So with your first point, I am talking about when the books are happening (I probably should have made that clear), but still, the point about Voldermort's followers is a very good one and one I should have thought about. I still think they are stagnant- at least that's the impression I get from the books (but that may be down to the fact they are written in Harry's point of view, where a lot of the time the ministry, for example, come off very badly.

Interesting point about the reproduction of magical artifacts- my interpretation is the diary is a different form of magic to the hat and one that is harder to craft. In terms of the wizard power levels, the proof is really the implicit stuff in the books- Voldemort's reasoning for discriminating against the muggleborns is based on a 'They are polluting the bloodline and thus we are less powerful now' (at least that is my impression.) As far as I know, something like Hogwarts could not be replicated.

Definitely a good point with the Muggle-Wizard interactions- one that I again should have considered. I do understand, especially based on your explanation, why the Wizards are as insular as they are. I haven't seen fantastic beasts, so I missed out on the Grindelwald stuff and should look more into that. HOWEVER, there is one big issue here in my opinion: Muggle-borns. Muggleborns generally have been attached to both worlds, and some wizards and muggleborn wizards definitely develop 'Muggle' interests away from the Wizarding world- see Colin Creevy and his photography. Ultimately, with many people in the real world, when we meet new people from new cultures, we try to learn about them. This is absolutely not universal I admit and is often reversed into bigotry, but that can again often be stopped by interactions with people from other cultures. We are, in the end, a social species, and the seeming large-scale lack of interest does strike me as odd. Ultimately, the heavy regulation can be argued both ways- and some have commented on it with a (VERY CONTROVERSIAL) theory that the Ministry of Magic was muggle-designed to keep them downtrodden. The dislike of Muggle culture is not that surprising (as you said), but, on the other hand, human memory fades quickly, and the 200+ years since the witch hunts will have softened the memory a bit. Also, stylistic point here: I probably made the wizarding community a bit too negative here, but I was essentially writing in response to a few forums I had read that declared 'Wizard roflstomp muggles are idiots' and these were a few impressions that came into my head. Im not an expert on Harry Potter, so the sort of clarification youve given is much appreciated.

Just crunch wise here- I am saying with my rifle point that modern weapons simply travel too fast to react to. In firefights, either they hit and you die, or they miss and you can react. You don't really have time to think beyond that. I agree that muggle society is fragile, and the cold war idea is the best way to imagine it in my opinion, especially now you thought of it.

#+end_quote

Except photography is also magical already. And Muggleborns spend the majority of their time at Hogwarts from when they are 11 on, in the time where social acceptance of your peers is one of the most important things.

Keeping a friendship alive is definitely very hard, especially if you can't tell your old friends the most important things in your life.

It's not as easy as that, and even if: Voldemort isn't a source of truth. Read about Hitler, he said similar things about Jews.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, but keep in mind that Dumbledore is 115 when he dies, and has still a leading government role /and/ was headmaster. For wizards 200 years might be different, and there are no 'new memories' to replace the old interactions with Muggles. I mean the last devastating Muggle war ended in 1945 (and yes, Grindelwald was active there too, but we'll have to wait with the details there).

Let's look just at Dumbledore personally: The last witch killed in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_executed_for_witchcraft][Ireland was in 1895]], 14 years after Dumbledore was born, and in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witchcraft_trial_(1878)][1878]], only ~3 years before Dumbledore was born there was a witch trial in the US.

But both of these aren't even the worst: His own sister Ariana was beaten up by Muggle boys that saw her do magic, and was so scared and broken afterwards that she never could control her magic again, and ended up having episodes that were so bad they killed her mother. She was probably an Obscurial (a new thing introduced in Fantastic Beasts), but that is only giving it a name, so largely irrelevant. Dumbledore's father went to Azkaban for attacking the Muggles that literally destroyed his daughter.

At least for Albus Dumbledore attacks by Muggles weren't history, but reality. And yet he is one of the most forgiving characters around, pleading for less hate, but I digress.

In the Harry Potter universe there is the "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ6X2ehOz0Q][Second Salem Church]]" which has a goal to expose the wizarding world and stomp the magic out of the wizards and witches, and that was in 1926 and later. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGBeWqMN8hg][Other video about them]]), both videos aren't spoiling anything.

I mean I can imagine Tom's hate for Muggles starting during World War II. Remember how Dumbledore had forbidden Tom to stay at Hogwarts during Chamber of Secrets? This was a few months after the devastating German Blitz ended, can you blame Riddle for not wanting to go back to London, living in an orphanage - being hated by all the other Muggle children?

#+begin_quote
  I had read that declared 'Wizard roflstomp muggles are idiots' and these were a few impressions that came into my head.
#+end_quote

I have read the converse sentiment in far too many fanfics. In truth, if you read the source material you'll see that both sides have their flaws and failures. Like Azkaban is of course horrible, but so is Guantanamo. There are many similarities in failures and qualities, which is one of the major themes Rowling tries to emphasize. Humans are Humans, even if they have magic.

And while I'm not sure who would win in an all-out war, I can tell it would be devastating for both sides.

#+begin_quote

If the gun is fired then it is too late. However, if we take the not very big assumption that people actually need some time to level the gun and aim it vs the flick of a wizards wrist and fingers then the wizard should have some time. Not much, but some. If you want to argue that they wouldn't see the bullets coming then that's a whole other argument, one that will never be helpful simply because wizards can cast spells at people's backs too.

#+begin_quote
  Wizarding culture is, as far as I can tell, relatively stagnant.
#+end_quote

The entire premise of the first part of your post seems flawed, because this is simply not true. For example, the Wolfsbane Potion is a relatively recent invention with huge implications for one of the wizarding worlds main diseases, lycanthropy. Dumbledore himself is known for a discovery in alchemy and potions by his work on dragon blood. The Unspeakables have an entire department dedicated to the research and discovery of obscure magic. In short, there is research going on. This world is moving forward (even in a century of war). But I will admit that their progress is probably slower than the muggle's, for two reasons. Magicals can live /extremely/ long, even without help from Philosopher Stones or Unicorn Blood. Dumbledore would've probably still had some decades in front of him, had he not found his demise on the Astronomy Tower. Old Age probably hinders fast, or even revolutionary reforms. Social progress is probably slow going. Second, the magical world is a post-scarcity society. There is no need for discovery in order to survive. Its only curiosity that drives the researchers of that world. So magic will develop steadily, but slowly, instead of technology that makes jumps and leaps whenever the need for invention arises.

#+begin_quote
  I also do not know if the reverse is true, but there is a consistent theme in Harry Potter of the fact that Wizards are simply less powerful than they used to be
#+end_quote

You make these claims without any sort of reference. As far as I could tell, Voldemort, Grindelwald and Dumbledore are seen as exceptional wizards - even compared to historical figures. The second row of powerful witches and wizards also packs quite a punch. Bellatrix Lestrange, Minerva McGonagall, Alastor Moody,... My point being that in terms of ability and power wielded, I don't see a downgrade from previous generations.

#+begin_quote
  Technology and Muggles
#+end_quote

I never get this argument. If they have magic, why would they want technology? Literally a first year student of Hogwarts can do more to trick the laws of physics than the entirety of the muggle's technological industry complex with a swish and flick. If we go with the laws of physics, then the sheer amount of energy that would have to be used to conjure a chair - scratch that - to conjure a drop of water with /Aguamaneti/ would be enough to break this planet apart. Mindcontrol, instant Death, undead thralls, sentient fire that consumes everything,... The question should be a different one. If Voldemort deemed to present himself to the muggles, does anyone really think a majority wouldn't kneel before this demon of hell and beg for mercy?

#+begin_quote
  Warfare
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if taking the Battle of Hogwarts as an example is representative of wizarding warfare. On the one side was a small guerilla group and a bunch of students, on the other side a psychopathic killer, surrounded by his posse of psychopathic killers who commanded a small army of people trained to kill. I seriously doubt the command was anything else than "Go and kill something", plus Voldemort was still trying to bring the purebloods in there to heel in order to command them, not necessarily just slaughter everyone.

Wizarding warfare seems more like two mafia families fighting each other, than any other sort of warfare. Guerrilla war, would also fit. From what we could discern from the books, we could think that all the Death Eaters did was pinpoint attacks on important figures and terror-targets, while the Order and the Aurors fought a defensive in an attrition war - something you can't really win, just postpone the defeat. Its mostly a positioning fight. The real battle in that war was won when the Ministry was ripe for takeover, which in itself was a governmental switch, not a battle.

#+begin_quote
  since spells are not only heavily linked to emotion
#+end_quote

Not true. Most spells are simply a result of upholding the "formalities" of casting it. Wand movement and incantation. The only spells we know of that need emotion to function are the Cruciatus and the Patronus. I'm not saying that emotion plays no role in other spells. After all, Molly Weasley ended Bellatrix Lestrange with a Stunner in a bout of rage, but you will always get your run of the mill Stupify out if you do the wand movement right and speak (or think) the correct incantation.

#+begin_quote
  how the two combat forms interact.
#+end_quote

They don't. In the theoretical situation of a rifleman standing in front of a wizard, yes... the rifle would probably win a 1v1 of speed and accuracy. But why would the wizard stay? Assuming both sides know this is a combat situation, the wizard (I'm thinking of an Auror or similar) would be an idiot to stay and let the rifleman just shoot. First off, apparate away, disillusion yourself, blast the guys head off from a stealth position. Then, why go against armor? Transfigure it into cottonballs or rubber ducklings. Then shoot a Bombarda into it. The thing to consider in muggle vs magical warfare is that any halfwit magical would quickly figure out that there is absolutely no need to ever stand in front of muggles. Just throw a Mandrake into an FOB - kill the entire platoon. Magicals literally grow their weapons of mass destruction in their gardens.

#+begin_quote
  Conflict
#+end_quote

I said it before and I'll say it again and again and again. The only way muggles could win against wizards is if other wizards help them. Magic is above matter.

#+begin_quote
  /I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening./ - [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability][Rowling from Pottermore]]
#+end_quote

So here is an idea: If the muggles get cranky, portkey some Ebola into their biggest cities. Or revive the black plague. You know... something fun like that. You can just take a potion and be done with it - maybe even take one that makes you permanently immune. Muggle London, however, will crumble under the deaths that are caused by an actively spread Ebola virus.

Thinking nukes? First off, nobody would ever nuke their own cities. The biggest amalgamations of magicals seem to directly correlate with the biggest gatherings of muggles. Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are good targets, I presume. But have fun explaining to Den Haag why you deemed it fit to nuke a school of children. Not to mention that a nuke seems relatively tame against a fire that can seek out living targets by itself, cannot be extinguished by non-magical means and is even hard to control with magic.

Or if you don't want to fight just obliviate entire cities. This is, of course, depending on what you consider to be canon. But we see the Aurors in Fantastic Beasts obliviate the entirety of New York. And even if you miss someone, they'll just be called tinfoil hat wearers.

And something that I alsways like to point out: Assuming you win and kill the magicals. Miss even one capable wizard. Only one. And human civilization as we know it is doomed. What keeps him from just apparating around the world and unleashing Fiendfyre /everywhere/? Vincent Crabbe - one of the mentally weakest wizards we know of in canon - is capable of fiendfyre. Now take an Auror, or Death Eater, or Order member with a vendetta. Everywhere he apparates to, millions dead. If there is no other wizard to control the flames, say goodbye to every city on the planet - within a week, if he's in a hurry.

** The issue with a muggle/magic war is the fact that both sides can strike the other with little defenses to stop it.

Magic cannot hope to stop a 120mm tank shell or a 1000 pound bomb dropped during a low altitude supersonic attack. It won't prevent cruise missiles and artillery from razing magical manors. The reaction time part is correct too. Wizards cannot react to bullets in time. In an open field, wizards would be annihilated by attack helicopters, air strikes, and high caliber shells.

But, wizards can do the same. There is no way to stop someone like Bellatrix from apparating into an army base, throw around a couple blasting curses before unleashing fiendfyre and apparating away within ten seconds. The other tactic would be using the imperius to either create massive fights between soldiers of the same side or cripple the military and political leadership, leaving the armies without a command structure and the ability to coordinate.

The war would be decided by the first strike. If the aggressor manages to deliver a crushing blow like the Israelis did during the Six-Day-War in 1967 then the other side is done for. If the first strike turns out too weak to break the other side then the retaliation will be lethal, possibly turning into a bloody stalemate similar to the Western Front of WWI.

Besides the obvious aiming issue you have to consider that the attacked has to realise that he is under attack and actually see it in order to do something.

During the 90s AP shells fired from 115-125mm guns were able to punch through half a metre of solid steel. Somehow I don't see a magical shield withstanding such forces, especially not concentrated on a small part of the shield. Maybe Dumbledore or Voldemort could pull that off, but certainly not your average wizard. About permanent spells:

I think of magic as energy. If you levitate something you compensate gravity with magic. Weight seems to matter as first years work with feathers and not with anvils. So if you want to create a magical shield that can withstand the impact of a shell you need to pump enough magical energy into it. The larger the protected area, the more magic you need. The power requirements are simply too large in order to make such things viable. Shielding against arrows should work but I would draw the line at pistols for your average wizard and at 20mm ammunition for anyone short of Dumbledore and Voldemort.

** OP wanted something more corrective and creative. And well, I don't pass opportunities to tell people that they are wrong on the internet so:

#+begin_quote
  Wizarding culture is, as far as I can tell, relatively stagnant. There is heavy regulation of new magic and the society, in general, has not seemed to change for a long time- magically, technologically or culturally.
#+end_quote

Mostly false. The true part is the one about regulation and it in itself help prove that the rest isn't true. The regulations, the existence of The Committee on Experimental Charms, Ludicrous Patents Office and similar prove that there is a need for them. From various dates given it seems that the height of magical was somewhere in XVI-XVIII century, but it doesn't seem that wizarding world is currently stagnant. There are at least three scholarly journals: Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer (all mentioned in DH in context of submitting papers), Wolfsbane Potion was created in the second half of XX century (Pottermore: Werewolves), and Twins managed to create magical protective gear (DH).

In social matters the females among being chosen as Ministers for Magic from end of XVII onwards, choice of muggleborn Nobby Leach as a Minister in 1962, pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, and the pure-blood side that gained traction after ISOS reduced to such a state that they had to throw their lot with a terrorist in an attempt to keep their influence.

#+begin_quote
  This does make sense on multiple fronts. The entire society, as far as we can tell, is educated in the same institution- something that does not promote much in the way of competition
#+end_quote

There are multiple magical schools in the world, and while most of the British students attend Hogwarts not all do. But you also have to consider an international exchange of information. After all "Various modes of magical travel -- brooms and Apparition among them -- not to mention visions and premonitions, meant that even far-flung wizarding communities were in contact with each other from the Middle Ages onwards." (Pottermore: History of Magic in North America).

#+begin_quote
  Technology is rendered unusable by the fact that it simply does not behave itself around magic
#+end_quote

Simply untrue, and one of the biggest proofs that you don't even remember the books. You know what appears in the first chapter of the first book? Deluminator - a magical tool used to manipulate technology? What happens in GoF? Arthur gets electric fireplace connected to floo and later he repairs it. Electricity and technology in general work with magic.

The only place mentioned having problems with those is Hogwarts, the same Hogwarts where the same place can end up being somewhere else depending on the day. And even there electrical devices can be adapted to be magically powered. (F.A.Q: Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?).

I have no idea where did you get the Ford Anglia needing sentience to work around magic from. It was a clear case of enchantements going haywire similar to the clock which started shooting bolts at people (OotP). Especially that it had multiple spells cast on it and as shown by the fight on the train in GoF those can interact with each other leading to unpredictable results (Pimple jinx combined with Jelly-leg curse led to tentacles sprouting all over Crabbe's face).

  there is a consistent theme in Harry Potter of the fact that Wizards are simply less powerful than they used to be
#+end_quote

Untrue, wizards as a whole progressed heavily, there are only some singular examples of some amazing artifacts from the past.

#+begin_quote
  Another point on the technology front is that so far, they really have no need for many of the technologies we have created to make our lives easier (because of Magic)- something that does not promote development.
#+end_quote

They develop magic instead.

#+begin_quote
  Wizard battle on a large scale seems incredibly akin to World War One-style combat. The evidence we have to go off of large-scale war is from Book 7/ Movies 7 and 8, where the attack on Hogwarts seems to mainly consist of a human wave attack with large creature support (like trolls and giants). This is an effective strategy mainly through luck. There simply were not enough defenders in Hogwarts to illuminate this as the tactical mistake that it really is.
#+end_quote

It really isn't. Magic doesn't lend itself to the same method of fight the modern muggle combat does because it's too individualistic. Due to that, even the bigger fights like the Battle of Hogwarts end up being a collection fo duels between individuals.

#+begin_quote
  It is also telling here that they do not simply apparate into the castle (I do not know if it has defenses for that)
#+end_quote

And that's the second thing that proves how badly you remember the books. Through the whole school year in HBP Draco was working oncreating the backdoor into Hogwarts, specifically because Death Eaters had no way to apparate inside.

But ok, enough of that. Time for my favourite quote from Pottermore - "I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature." (Pottermore: Illness and Disability). I generally describe HP magic as a separate layer of reality ruled by its own laws and interacting with mundane layer and that quote proves that magical layer is more important than the mundane one.

Okay, so we have magical reality overwrite physical one. And we have that neat thing called Shield charm. Spells can break through it, as magic's ability to change magic is limited. But it also protects from physical damage, and we can assume that the Shield charm is not limited here. The Shield charm that can be adjusted in terms of size, the Shield charm that can be used to protectively enchant place, the Shield charm that can be enchanted on clothes (as of HBP).

Assuming, my theory is true, wizards could just walk through muggle city wearing shield hat and just slaughter everyone in their way.

And even assuming it's not true, then wizards have concealment methods that due to their magical nature aren't understandable or penetrable for muggles. How will you fight someone who you cannot see? How will you fight someone who can manipulate your mind? How will you fight someone who can perfectly assume anybody's look?

Wizards would probably lose a lot if the war ever started, they would probably have to cause unimaginable destruction in the result, but they would win.

** Well thanks for the comments, ladies and gents. All were definitely informative and I am glad to have them.

I don't have the time to address everything- these are very well thought out and I appreciate it, but work has really picked up. I'll address some points I thought that should be known on a personal level;

First is I wrote this over half an hour when I was a bit bored- it was just some thoughts that occurred to me at the time. I never claimed to be absolutely RIGHT, and made every effort to keep that attitude through the essay.

Second is yes- I don't remember the books that well. I recently started looking into the world again after last reading them around 5-6 years ago, and just had some (now I realise less than informed (?)) thoughts on the world. I also tried to come at it from a 'series overview' point of view from the dominant impressions I got from the books and movies.

I really just wanted to get some more nuanced perspectives on it more than “herp x side stomps”. I definitely got that...but I won't delve into this hornet's nest again. I appreciate your collective passion A LOT (its fantastic to see), but imagined a more multi sided discussion. I personally do not think my arguments are entirely wrong, but I absolutely see I could have more than likely done more research. Again, this was just some random thoughts I had while procrastinating, and I was told to go here.

Thank you all again for at least taking the time to read my little piece, and again I appreciate the feedback/counters/correction. Just to reiterate: I don't want to have offended anyone, so if you are I apologise. Otherwise again thanks for reading.

How about actually knowing stuff you analyse, before analysing it?

*** Look, I do apologise. Feel free to correct (and be proactive, instead of simply critical-part of this exercise was to learn more for me) However, I do know that technology DOES misbehave around magic- in order to get a car working, it has to almost be given sentience. It is very inconsistent in the books- after all, radios do work, but not (and I quote): “All these substitutes for magic Muggles use- electricity, and computers and radar, and all those things- they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air.” (Goblet of Fire).

Hogwarts also has an anti disapparition jinx placed on it. I knew this, but was looking for more clarity if it was available from other people- who tend to be a good resource.

I do not claim to be an expert, I never said this argument was the be all/end all for Muggles vs Wizards, I just wanted to share some thoughts and see what others think. I wrote this in half an hour, it's based on mostly my own thinking and was ultimately for fun. I don't mean to offend you or anything- please next time offer corrections etc.
