Also, be logical.

I read it again and again, high numbers and multiple houses. These do nothing for you just sitting around empty. If your character has seven mansions and a castle, and only lives in one of those, then have them rent out or the rest.

If your character is heir to a dead house, give it some thought. House Slytherin for example doesn't have any assets, that's why the Gaunts were so destitute. Their last heirloom was the amulet. There isn't a castle or a manor or massive money mountains in their name, otherwise they'd have lived there.

On the topic of dead houses - why is there always a Peverell vault or properties in that name? That family split in three, and all three parts were integrated into other families. There isn't anything left of it, because all the assets were rolled into other accounts. The same applies to all other dead houses and names.


** I thought it was established long ago that giving HP more gold than what exists in the world and all the castles and mansions was the author's way of writing a moneywank fic?

Agree on the case with the Peverells - the Potters are their only descendants. Any money or property they had would have been absorbed into the Potter family.

I think that's also the reason Dumbledore wouldn't use it, because he didn't trust himself with such a powerful object and such a temptation. Doing it even once would probably lead to it being an even bigger temptation. And I also believe that Dumbledore had made his peace with death; we see him emphasise that death is just the next adventure. Using the stone to disturb his sister or mother would be selfish.

I have to agree. I mean, I just don't see how a pureblood based society would be possible given this. Inclusion/Exclusion dynamics rely on being able to be exclusive.

A more pressing issue is that any such tests would immediately prove or disprove the question of where muggleborns come from.

***** Nope.

Nobility is not at all an appropriate comparison to pureblood society.

Consider, for a moment, Winston Churchill's family. His father was Lord Randolph Churchill. His grandfather was the Duke of Marlborough. These are three people who were at quite different levels of status even though they are all in the same direct line.

Abraxas, Lucius and Draco are all of entirely equal status. Ah, we see immediately that we're talking about a very different phenomenon.

Now, let's throw in, say, some random Baronetcy. If we look at the title holders, they're all of the same rank. They're also all nobles. However, they're simply not even close to being in the same discussion as a Duke. Not sure how they'd do in relationship to the third son of a Duke, but there you go.

There is no distinction between the Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, Crouches etc. etc. except the whole Sacred 28 thing, but even that is premised only on the idea of the most pure. You could also chuck in blood traitors, but that's actually a political idea... the closest you get to party politics in canon.

Purebloods are Aryans and muggleborns are Jews. Not nobles and commoners.

He yearns for power and control. It's why he dislikes his name - it's too normal. It's immediately validated, even in the WW, when he finds out that his parseltongue is a special power.

** Authors also need to consider how their protagonist finds out about their wealth and land and power and harem and ten thousand secret abilities (because let's be real those basically always go hand in hand in fanfics). Those fancy blood tests that reveal everything there is to know about the character? Stupid. If they existed, everyone would use them to find a tiny link to rich families and mooch all the money off them, not to mention goblins hate wizards and want to keep the gold so why would they openly administer a test to give people more of that money? Why not have the ministry administer the test instead of a bank? Or why not have the protagonist find out about their money and land etc in a creative way that provides character development?

Also, if a family went extinct, they wouldn't just have billions of pounds worth of assets just sitting around in vaults and properties across the world, because any organisation that the family owed money too would reclaim and auction off significant amounts of it, distant relatives would claim some of it, and the government would get the rest. That's literally how it works. You could do something along the lines of leaving a will where things had to be left alone for a “worthy heir” or shit, but then you need to explain that, or perhaps the property was recognised as a national landmark or heritage listed location, or was claimed by the ministry/British government who auction it off and the protagonist comes into ownership of it by buying the property and finds a vault key in the property or something, all sorts of more interesting and believable ways to give the wealth and land to the protagonist instead of just making them do a little blood test and being handed a hundred vaults and ten thousand acres of land.

*** I've seen some fics take the wealth/land approach on its own, actually - and work that in fairly well. Though, as you mention, the ones that go well over the top of it with listing out massive lengths of assets are almost invariably powerwank.

For families, a lot of the Wizarding World's wealth seems to be locked in at Gringotts, and I could see some of the families being a bit more magically... paranoid. With their own magical wills, defenses, etc - all layered upon the Gringotts ones. It's not clear to me that the Goblins necessarily have to follow all the laws of inheritance of the wizarding world, particularly not in fanfic.

It definitely shouldn't be an easy 'inherit everything' button, but I think it could be rather neat to have a Slytherin vault that requires parseltongue to access and then proving worthiness, or esoteric blood rituals for a defunct dark house that everyone's just been too scared to try their hand at, or the Peverell vault requiring showing all three Hallows to claim, etc. You had some other good ideas there, too - though it would be a bit convenient to have a key get found in some garbage :P

**** If you think about it all your points combine quite seamlessly.

First, exclusivity. Just add taxes. Taxes are always the main tool to protect power. That way you as., the government (controlled by purebloods), get a lot of money out of a newly enriched person in a time where anything is more than they had. If you are a pureblood then you already knew you were to inherit, so no need for the test. And the amount of money needed would dissuade muggleborn but still leaving a legal nook for those extinct lines to be amalgamated by other purebloods or solve legal issues.

Second, Gringots being the only one to give out the tests and keeping the WWs money. This is one of the simpler ones. Its all based on the accords between the goblin nation and the Wizarding World, were upon the Goblins get exclusive rights to money handling and keep their own laws in exchange for not revolting and not stealing said money. This makes them a neutral party, (best option when in constant political and sometimes magical war).

Whats so important about this? Goblin NATION, meaning its own laws. No Blood Magic classified as Dark magic. Meaning that while the MoM can't do it due to its own laws, they can. Also, confidentiality.

As for Riddle...I never thought he was the heir. A descendant of Slytherin, sure. But never the heir. Parseltongue only proves a blood connection. If the Slytherin name is as important as it's shown in the books, they would have kept that name. Especially seeing their pride on their supposed connection to the founder. Plus, as many fics go, there can always be other clauses to inherit. If Slytherin really was a megalomaniac racist bastard you can bet being a pureblood would be one. Making Voldemort ineligible.

Like a dew drop from the petal at the exact 3'o clock position on free-range daisy in the shadow of an ancient oak tree that lies on top of a hill during a coinciding blue moon and blood moon at precisely 7am.

Something like that. Which would mean that many generations of a family would need to scrounge their whole lives in order for one of their descendants to be able to take the test.

Of course by that time needing to take the test is pointless, because they will either be a well established family in their own right, or wealthy enough for it to not matter.

** Ideally, if you're giving your protagonist that much power, it should come with a /cost/ and with a /reason/.

Most tend to have that as a very meta-level reason - namely, to illustrate Harry being wealthy and powerful. That's a valid one, sure - but it's not a very /good/ one on its own. Instead, make it more important to the narrative - or, conversely, make that wealth and power /required/ for your protagonist to achieve their goals. For instance, in the case of Harry, if he were even richer/more powerful, you'd likely need to bump up the challenge Voldemort or the Death Eaters faced, to warrant giving Harry better resources. Alternatively, making it a key part of the narrative to juggle those resources and use them effectively (as in Novocaine) makes them feel more integral.

Cost wise, it shouldn't be as easy as 'gets ton of gold, possessions, and power' - that sort of wealth should make your protagonist a target, for instance. It might set up other obstacles - if used politically, now more people who would have once ignored them now sees them as an enemy. Etc, etc.

To slightly push back on some of your points, though, the Gaunts were not necessarily 'official' descendants of Slytherin - they might not have been able to make a strong enough claim on the House's possessions, should any exist. For the Peverells, it's likely because they're a known, and formerly wealthy, house that we know Harry is connected to it. While it's logical that they would have had their assets rolled into the houses they married into, it's not a /given/ that it happened. For instance, a possible (hand-wavey) explanation could work in a magical will that specified that it'd only go to whoever managed to get all the deathly hallows back together, as a symbol of re-uniting the Peverells. It's not that hard to come up with stuff like that ;)

** I always prefer a rich Potter route than heir to all houses in existence that each have massive fortunes. The potters of the past were massively successful, they never stuck to one branch and never prohibited any profession so they amassed a gigantic fortune. James Potter either didn't have time to access that fortune or he wasn't allowed to, his father saw his blind faith to a man wiling to sacrifice everything but himself and cut his access to the fortune but for a small amount until he proved himself. I remember reading a fic where all past potters were military generals, that they were a massive part of the roman empire, and that it was tradition for each Potter to join muggle militaries and experience war.

** I agree and disagree. Many people have pointed out already why I'd agree so I'll mainly speak about why I don't fully hate this trope.

It essentially comes down to, the economy of the wizarding world and specifically the fact that we don't really know it (and the fact that even thing we do know are normally ignored or forgotten etc. by authors). When in fics that Harry leaves the Dursleys as he realized he has enough to make it on his own, I don't think it particularly matters if they make him rich and don't really show him using it. It's a matter of you simply know that this is how he's providing for himself. He doesn't need to use it on screen for investment or other things because it's a plot device designed to make it so the entire book isn't about him getting a job that he somehow manages to keep whilst being at a boarding school for the entire year (not saying these books are bad, but I find they normally don't give any sort of explanation why he keeps it without working the entire year) and that kind of stuff. It makes it much easier for the character to do stuff outside of school, which i would argue to be the reason most authors move Harry from the Dursley's in the first place.

*Chapter 11:*

#+begin_quote
  In order to test their potions, that afternoon Professor Snape took the class on a short field trip to the nearby Hogsmeade Farm. A small fleet of horseless carriages awaited them outside the entrance hall; they scrambled into them with raucous squabbling, everyone trying to get a seat with their best friends.

  Victoria sat with Pansy, Daphne and Tracey. The four girls had even managed to smuggle some lemon drizzle cake out of the Great Hall, the sharing of which was made considerably more difficult by their lack of a knife. Crumbs flew everywhere as the carriage wobbled down the cobbled path, past the school gates and towards Hogsmeade. They swung off the main road just as they were approaching the train station, heading down a narrow track that took them south, clear of the village and into the wilderness. The view on both sides of the lane was obscured by a wall of gnarled Scots pine, their evergreen canopies forming a tunnel through which the carriages traveled. The cold winter sun glinted through the leaves, and here and there a break in the trees afforded them a view into the fields beyond, full of unnaturally huge cabbages and leeks.

  “Look!” Daphne said, pointing out the window to a field of grazing animals. They looked like shaggy-haired cows, only twice as large and with a pair of long, dangerous-looking horns. “Bicorns! Oh, they're so cute!”

  Victoria laughed. “Sure, from here they're cute. Bet you wouldn't want to get near them, though. Those horns look vicious.”

  “They're quite harmless, really,” Pansy said, causing the girls to all look at her in surprise. She had never before shown /any/ interest in animals. “What? One of father's tenants has a herd. Back when I was little, we used to help them collect the horns after shedding season... they're perfectly friendly, so long as you don't let them see you taking the horns away.”

  Eventually they pulled up outside an old stone farmhouse. It was set back from the lane in a clearing surrounded by weeping willows, their drooping branches bare for the winter, and chickens roamed the yard freely.

  Snape walked along the line of carriages, banging his hand against the sides. “Out!”
#+end_quote

*Chapter 19:*

#+begin_quote
  A hippogriff-drawn stagecoach awaited them outside. The coach was tall, black, and sleek-looking, with little in the way of decoration other than silver door handles. It had pulled up right next to the entrance, where the Muggles were forced to divert themselves around it with looks of irritated confusion.

  [...]

  They turned off the M4 where it met the North Wessex Downs, rapidly passing from smooth, straight tarmac onto winding country lanes. Here their journey became much more erratic, and Victoria's heart was in her mouth as they rocketed between tall hedgerows, almost certain that they would collide with a Muggle car approaching from the opposite direction.

  [...]

  /“Aparecium!”/

  The spell had been cast by Bertrand, just as the hippogriffs looked like they would gallop straight into a thick hedge. The greenery parted before them, forming itself into a tall arch, and they passed through onto a long dirt track. Fields stretched out on either side, as far as the eye could see, each one divided from its neighbour by a low stone wall. To their left, tall strands of golden winter wheat swayed in the wind; to their right, the field was dotted with burrows, out of which poked small reptilian heads.

  “They're mokes,” Draco explained, seeing Victoria's curious look. “Their skin's used for shrinking things... bags, shoes, stuff like that.”

  “One of our most valuable livestock,” Lucius said. “Sometimes I think Crabbe spends more time fending off poachers than actually looking after the mokes.”

  Victoria blinked. “The Crabbes live here?”

  “Indeed,” Lucius said, “they've been among our leading tenants for several centuries.”

  “The Goyles, too,” Draco added. Suddenly the way Vincent and Gregory followed him around made a lot more sense.

  They continued for several miles down the track. Wheat gave way to peas and broad beans; the moke field was followed by herds of hippogriffs and cattle. Here and there the track would branch, the side paths meandering across the rolling landscape to barns, stables, and rustic cottages with smoke rising from their chimneys.

  Finally, the fields ended. A stream cut across the road, which they crossed via a stone bridge, and then they were passing uphill through a small wood populated by strutting peacocks.

  It was near the top of the hill that Victoria had her first sight of Malfoy Manor. The track curved in a horseshoe shape cut into the hill just below its ridgeline, and occasionally a gap in the trees would allow her a view across the valley. There, on a plateau right at the heart of the horseshoe, a sprawling, elegant building loomed.

  They had arrived.
#+end_quote

*Chapter 20:*

#+begin_quote
  To Victoria's surprise, in the afternoon Narcissa would frequently turn her attention to running the various farms the Malfoys owned. It seemed that while Lucius was responsible for the Malfoys' business dealings, Narcissa took the lead when it came to managing their land. She made regular visits to the Crabbes, Goyles, Gibbons, and Greybacks, all tenants who deferred to Narcissa as their landlady. She inspected crops, listened to complaints about a knarl infestation, and discussed planting for spring. Sometimes she even got involved with the farm work, on one occasion going so far as to help Mr Gibbon accept a delivery of mooncalf dung.

  Unfortunately, that had meant Victoria was required to help too.

  “There should be another shovel in the shed,” Narcissa had said, eying the wagon of dung with satisfaction. She'd come prepared for the job, wearing a very practical---though still fashionable---quilted robe. “You can't levitate it or it'll just fall apart. We're going to have to do it the Muggle way, I'm afraid.”

  Victoria had dutifully retrieved a shovel and, very hesitantly, began to scoop up small quantities of the dung. Unlike Narcissa, she had worn a dress robe to the Gibbon farm and she was rather concerned about getting it dirty.

  “Come on, girl!” Mr Gibbon called cheerfully, “put your back into it!”

  Narcissa sent her a knowing smile. “Beauty is all well and good, my dear, but no one will thank you for airs and graces. Just imagine you're in Herbology class.”

  Victoria thought back to her first year, when she'd happily got her (then unpolished) fingernails dirty in Herbology. Hadn't Pansy stood to one side, refusing to get involved and making Tracey do her work for her?

  She scowled, gripped the shovel firmly and dug up a large scoop of dung. She /wasn't/ like Pansy.

***** I'm pretty sure that it's been stated somewhere in the books that Harry can speak parseltongue because of him having a piece of Voldemort's soul, not due to lineage. Lily is Muggleborn and there's no way that she has Slytherin blood, whereas the Potters are descended from Gryffindor and are often known to be sorted into that house. I doubt that the bloodlines of Gryffindor and Slytherin would merge with the Potters - then we would see more signs of dark magic within that family. The Potters are known for being accepting and open of muggleborns and creatures like werewolves, which Slytherin would greatly disagree with. If the Potters were in his bloodline, he'd probably be writhing in his grave.

As for mentioning that parseltongues aren't exclusively Slytherin's bloodline, I found out that you were correct with that, at least if we look at Fantastic Beasts. It's noted that the first basilisks were bred by Herpo the Foul, who was a dark wizard from Greece and also knew parseltongue (he also created the first horcrux). However, aside from him and Harry, who can be linked to Voldemort, all other known parseltongue speakers are linked to Slytherin. Although it could potentially be guessed that Herpo is one of Slytherin's ancestors, we don't know that for certain, so that's really just me guessing.

If you want my opinion on this, then I'm guessing that it's a mutation that occurs in families who tamper in the Dark Arts - that's what all of these individuals have in common (aside from Harry). However, if that was the case, then why were the Malfoys not parselmouths? The Blacks? And if it wasn't hereditary, nor linked to dark magic, how come there were absolutely no other known students who could speak parseltongue before Harry's time at Hogwarts aside from Voldemort?

Plus, if the Gaunts aren't from Slytherin, then how did they get his amulet? I don't see an ancient heirloom like that being lost or removed from the family.

******* No, they couldn't because Canon primarily states that. Lily Evans is a muggle born. Anything other than that is fannon. Additionally, the whole point of the blood purity war is that just because muggle borns aren't purebloods, doesn't mean they can't be good magicals. Saying Lily's just descendant from squids negates the whole point. Maybe we'd like to believe Hermione Granger is related to the Dagworth-Grangers next, huh? Or that Colin Creevy is related to Dolohov lmao.

******** I was under the impression that Rowling had stated that Muggleborns were descended from Squibs, hadn't she? So, maybe Slytherin had a squib and they were the one to marry in to the Evans family. I could be wrong - my canon knowledge is very limited - but it's what I've found on the wikis and such.

********** I mean, yeah, kinda. And apparently she said in an interview that Muggleborns 'will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back'.

But that's not out of canon for Rowling to break her own world. Basically everything she added after the first book contradicted at least one other thing. She's like the writing version of that amnesiac Adam Sandler flick - she has no idea what she wrote earlier, no matter her genius in the current thing she's writing. She really needs to sit down with a D&D DM, get her world to make sense. :D

************ Honestly, I sometimes actually think it makes her kind of slightly more impressive. Despite writing something utterly full of holes and contradictions and more self-sabotage than a slapstick comic, she captured the imaginations of an entire generation. She made her nonsense feel magical, like a place we'd want to be. And there are people in this sub who've been playing in her narrative sandbox for more than a decade. That's no small accomplishment.
