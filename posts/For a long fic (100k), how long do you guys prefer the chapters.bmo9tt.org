*** Yep, like a variation on Chekhov's Gun. It's fine for little details in a story to not have any importance since worldbuilding and imagery are still useful and fun to read. But the chapter as a whole needs to have a reason for existing.

**** Take the total of the Words and divide by chapters

I also only read on Mobile but I can't enjoy long stories with such low word counts. I prefer lower word counts for one shots

***** I guess that makes a good average and is probably close enough. Just wondered if i may have overlooked a word count feature on ffn.

edit: did some math, I prefer chapters that are between 2k and 5k. If its more than 9k I nope out.

** I generally like it with several major scenes per chapter. I personally write with three or more per, depending on the length and how they relate to each other chronologically within the story's timeline (i.e. Scenes that take place around the same time are grouped together, more or less regardless of their relevancy to each other).

As a result, my chapters are generally 5-9k-ish in length.

Truthfully, as long as the author is consistent with the organization of their chapters I don't really care. If they have one chapter that's 2k and the next is 15k+ that's just irritating, but otherwise just go for it.

*** That's about what I'd say. Anything shorter than 3-5k and there really just isn't enough room in that chapter for anything of significance to happen. But if you get past about 10-12k, the chapters start to become a bit much to get through all at once, imo.

** If I feel like I'm spending as much time hitting next as I am scrolling, it's too short. Some people use chapters as scene breaks, and it gets annoying.

Maybe 3-4k? I don't know how many words are in a typical chapter, but I want to spend at least a few minutes reading it. 10k+ though is a bit much. If it's that long and you haven't found somewhere to split the chapter, you must be very verbose...

** That's actually a question I've never thought of. I definitely prefer longer chapters, it just allows you to become more imerced.

I would say 3k would be my minimum.

I know when I write my goal is to get it somewhere between 4 and 8k (I know that's very broad) if it goes 9k or above I'll usually divide it, unless it's a prologue or there just isn't a good place to break it up without ruining the pace.

** All of my chapters are roughly 2k (and I've written over 200 chapters)\\
The reason for that is when I started writing, it because a challenge for me to write a chapter a day under an hour. Turned out that 2k was duable that way and made it able for me to post every day (which made my readers happy). If there was a part in the story that required more words, I'd just end up writing /Chapter Title part 1/, following the next day by /Same Chapter Title part 2./ It's also easier to read on mobile if the chapters aren't too long, which most readers seem to be doing opposed to reading it straight from the website.

*** I also tend to chapters between 2 and 3K long, but in my case it's because I have a tendency to concentrate on the structure of the chapter rather than trying to pad it out with turgid purple prose.

Spending a thousand words describing how someone's hair rippled and waved in the breeze as they walked through a door is not the sort of thing I do.

On the other hand, I once did a non-HP story in which one chapter was 15 words (no, not 15K, just /fifteen/) and got loads of positive reviews for it.

**** I hear ya. I'm not too keen on all the prose and frivolities either. Especially with writing HP fan fiction, I see no reason to be super descriptive about everything as we already know what the characters and environment look like in our minds. I'd much rather write a lot of dialogue.

** 5k-10k depending on the writing quality. Some fics can pull off a 10k word chapter and keep interest. But if I see a fic that's 200k words and 47 chapters I nope out real quick.

**** Fair correction on basic math, I guess I should have said 300-400k words. There are some stories that have 100k words but 30 plus chapters. Generally that means it reads more like a collection of one shots by the author than a cohesive story. That's what I dislike. If each chapter is a paragraph or two from one character only instead of just mixing them together with page breaks or transitions. Personally it's a turn off.

** As long as the author wants to make them. I follow one story where the author updates once or twice a year with 30k-50k chapters, but that's about as high as I've seen. Doesn't bother me; short, long; I'll read it either way.

** It depends on how often the fic updates. If it updates weekly or monthly, I don't care about the length (beyond having a slight preference for longer chapters). If it updates once a year, then the last thing I want to do is bring myself up to speed on what the story is about, only to have a short chapter.
