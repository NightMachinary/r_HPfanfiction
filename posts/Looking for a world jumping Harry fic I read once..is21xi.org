:END:
I read this a while back, but can't remember the name, it may have been on aff though.

The core feature of the storry was, that harry somehow got the ability to jump worlds, replacing/inserting into his local counterpart, while being able to carry stuff and people with him.

I remember at least one world where Harry was female. There was also one realy dark one where canibalism was commonplace, in which Harry ended up killing the Dursleys and a lot of other people.

The last world I remember was a Buffy Xover where some other time looping shenanigans happend.


** Found it, not on aff though.
