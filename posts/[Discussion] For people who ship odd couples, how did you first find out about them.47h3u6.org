I'm curious because i'm not really a fandom person or a shipper (is that the correct term?) but if I were to ship a couple it'd be Haphne, and tbh I didn't know that existed until randomly stumbling upon a random fic and loving it.


** I ship young!Tom Riddle/ Minerva, but it only metaphorically because no one writes the pairing. So there haven't been any fics in the fandom to ruin it for me yet. If Tom wasn't such an evil maniacal sociopath, I imagine they'd get along swimmingly though that would be no fun. So, instead, I like the idea of them having an antagonistic but strangely involved powerplay with the occasional twisted display of pseudo-affection that very thinly borders romance, but lacks any prerogative to really take form.

They'd crash and burn but it'd be really interesting to read about. No one's ever going to write it though, so meh -_-

*** I'd never thought of Tom Riddle/Minerva until you brought it up, but I fell in love with the idea almost instantly and had to go look up if this existed anywhere. And it does. And it's quite good. I'm only on chapter 9 (out of 34), but if it continues the way it's going I would most definitely recommend it. It fits your description pretty well, too.

** I like the idea of Luna/Charlie but don't think I've come across any. I can see Charlie being so excited about traveling and exploring with her, hunting for her creatures, and Luna is one of the few characters who I can see happily moving to Romania and trying to make friends with his dragons. I know a relationship needs more than that, but a mutual love of the outdoors, and travelling, and unusual animals is a damn good start.

Some pretty good related pairings:

It's a pretty good fic even without the relationship though. If you don't mind that you won't get to finish it you should give it a try.

** Harry/Daphne isn't what I would call an odd couple. Sure, it's something you'll only discover once you're reading fanfiction, but there's pairings that are a lot rarer or odder, like Harry/Angelina, or odder and weird, like Harry/Lily or Harry/Rowena Ravenclaw. As for finding them... mostly just browse. Once you filter out all the bad pairings, some of the odder ones will pop up.

If it doesn't exist, someone should really make a comprehensive list of do's and don'ts of characterizing Luna in fanfic. Luna centric as well as H/L fics would be much more numerous.

Id expect H/Daphne or H/Susan is next most prevalent as a blank slate named character, and H/L is somewhere below H/Tonks on the amount written scale.

One must only look at harry/Luna main ship requests on this forum to see how few there are: i think the last one i saw got 4 fics listed, where H/G and H/Hr can easily get 15+ in a broad request, and H/Tonks at least 6

Conversely H/Tonks is not really that popular generally, but it definitely is very popular in fanfiction.

So there is an obvious discrepancy between the popularity of certain ships and how many fics you can see of them.

If we were to talk 10-15 years ago (when no ship had been confirmed yet) then you would be correct. But now that we're almost 9 years since DH was released, H/Hr has gradually faded. Hell, even Dramione (which is definitely more unrealistic than H/Hr) is more popular now, which I've never understood the appeal of.

You'd be surprised how dominant H/G is in the wider world among book fans. There's a poll on Goodreads that shows H/G close to 60%, while H/Hr and H/L are around 20% each, where 1300 people have been polled. Not even the Donald can do better than that lol.

On the flip side though H/Hr is absurdly popular among movie fans, an MTV poll for DH1 shows H/Hr absolutely trouncing R/Hr by like 90% O__O

Also I didnt want to touch Harry/Snape with a ten foot pole for the longest time but after reading it I definitely shipped it. Though I often prefer them in a mentor/mentee relationship or something similar.

I once read an awesome Harry/Percy too. But I think thats like the only in existence, lol. And I think normally its just a nono.

Hermione/Krum is not very weird but I havent read any good ones - I think Hermione/Ron is too cliche so I really love this one ship at least in my head canon hehe.

I've been eyeing a few Riddle/Bellatrix ones lately, havent read them yet but it actually might work, in an insane murder spouses kinda way. Though I prefer dark-but-not-evil Riddle, so it might not. Anyway, i think thats it from the top of my head.

** If you are looking for a specific pairing, fanfiction.net generally offers a nice filter. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2&c1=546&c2=1&_c1=6][this one]] gives the result for Harry/Bellatrix while excluding Draco Malfoy (avoid Drarry slash stories).

The top of the list, *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), makes a very convincing Harry/Bellatrix Black ship.

Sometimes you find odd pairings just by chance. *Patron* for example, linkffn(11080542), is doing a nice Ron/Pansy job.

Then sometimes you find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2298556/Wanda-Ginny-Greenleaf][a author]] who has some really interesting ideas. Her stories contains some truly rare, but well written pairings (Ginny/Flora Carrow, Harry/Astoria). She could become a great writer if she were to cut down typos in her stories or find a beta.

** I guess it depends on what you consider odd. Harry/Fleur is probably my favorite, but I dunno if I really found out about it. I just liked the characters and started searching for fics.

Most of my other favored pairings started out similarly (Harry/Luna, Harry/Tonks, Harry/fem!Blaise) or happened from just searching by exclusion (Harry/Daphne, Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Narcissa).

Mildly related, it still kinda bothers me that Blaise became male in canon. I assumed the character was a female for five books, and I still assume Blaise is female at first blush--takes me a minute to remember.

** Voldermort/Gilderoy Lockhart

I read one fic with it and it had barely any chapters, but it was enough for me to love this pairing.

** I'm actually writing a fic featuring Neville x Pansy as one of the main pairs. Unfortunately I lack the time and talent to do it justice but it came about as me thinking how canon wrote off every Slytherin student as (basically) evil and I wanted to challenge that. Plus, Neville ends up being kind of a badass in canon so I think more people should be into him, lol. Which Haphne fics do you rec?

** I ship Draco/Ron. Draco is shipped with just about everybody, so it's not the rarest rarepair out there, but of the Draco/MC ships it's definitely the least popular.

Basically, back when I was first getting into HP fanfiction I went through cycles of favoring different pairings. (Today, when I go in to a new fandom I've usually already got a pairing in mind, but it was one my first fandoms so my shipping goggles had yet to develop.) I was briefly into Draco/Ginny, Draco/Harry, and Draco/Hermione until I came across a Draco/Ron fic. I fell in love, and the rest is history.

I think it's mostly because Ron is my favorite character, so he's going to be half of my OTP no matter what, and I really like enemy-to-lovers.

**** linkffn(The Tapestry of the Red Horse) is one of my favorites and the one that got me into the pairing. I'll admit it doesn't have the best writing, but it's good enough to handle. The main attraction is an asshole, controlling Draco that's closer to canon than a lot of other Dracos, and it's honestly probably the most realistic depiction of how their relationship would /actually/ be.

Others that are fairly long and mostly cute/funny:

linkao3(The Better Part of Valor)

linkao3(Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy)

linkao3(Archipelago)

  Weasley: You're snobbish and rude, but sometimes you're not, and I think that not gave me plenty of room to assume you felt more than lust. Is Ron right? RD Slash. Violence, Sexual Content, etc..

  There's a difference between being lonely and being alone. Draco Malfoy is alone. Ron Weasley is quite probably insane.
