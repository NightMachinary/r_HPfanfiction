Dumbledore frowned. "Win a war? What on earth are you talking about? My boy, this is about Hogwarts' OWL results. Getting a D in History of Magic... results like that could have ruined our ranking. No, I'm afraid you simply must be sacrificed, before you can take your NEWTs and lower our average further."

*** I like this idea. If we take JKR's series and separate out the biased viewpoint of Harry we can start to see how /weird/ the magical world at large is on a wide range of things (for a lack of any better terms to use, /weird/ and /things/ is about the best I can use to talk about how widespread the stagnation of the advancement of human progression is in the magical world). Of course it's possible that the viewpoint of Harry being skewed has caused information loss that we have to make incorrect assumptions about. Having said that, by looking at the actions/reactions of characters deemed knowledgeable and "/great/", we get the impression that there is something amiss with the way people think in the magical world. I would even say that it's probable the average IQ in the magical world is lower then the mundane.

Hermione as a benchmark for /smarts/ is interesting to think about. Lots of FF will take Hermione and make her a /super duper smarty/ instead of her just being a bookish A-type personality with a lot of determination and work ethic. In the magical world she's said to be /'the brightest witch of her age'/ but I don't think we could say that in the mundane world from what we see from her. Hogwarts grades aren't going to be a good metric for comparison because it's entirely possible that a 100% grade in the magical world could be equal to an 80% in the mundane world.

There must be some pretty big differences between the high, low, and average IQ of the magical vs mundane worlds if Hogwarts is considered such a great school while having such a horrible track record for half of the subjects offered. * History of Magic---it's similar to having a substitute teacher wheel in a TV to the classroom and pop in a video taken from the history channel instead of interacting with the kids. * Divination---seen as a fraud by virtually everyone * Defense---kids have no idea how to do anything most of the time because of constant changes in curriculum and teachers, teachers who torture the students, teachers who *are* frauds. * Potions---Snape is just a horrible teacher even if he is a brilliant Potions Master. Hard for a kid to learn from a teacher you're afraid of harassing you I would assume.

Edit: How can one of the best schools not realize that at least two students of prominent families are using wands not suited for them? Their pureblooded families don't even realize the importance of a suited wand which just makes it even weirder. How does Longbottom even pass each year if he has a wand not suited for him *and* messes up a lot of potions? I think the only reason Longbottom does well in Herbology is because he doesn't need to do wandwork and he doesn't have Snape giving him a panic attack. It makes sense why his only interest is Herbology since that's the only subject he actually /gets./ If Longbottom can pass every year then there must be some *massive* issues with the performance of the average witch/wizard.

That might be a cultural thing: in British schools the year-group you're in is based /solely/ on your age, there's no holding back or advancement based on grades as a standard practise (there might be some of it going on as ad hoc arrangements made by particular schools, but it's not standard.)

#+begin_quote
  Snape is just a horrible teacher even if he is a brilliant Potions Master.
#+end_quote

Again, a cultural thing. 'Master' is an old-fashioned way of saying 'teacher' - Snape is a Potions Master /purely by virtue of him having a contract of employment with a school/. By the same token, for the year he was there, Gilderoy Lockhart was genuinely a Defence Against the Dark Arts Master, however fraudulent his curriculum vitae might have been. The usage persists in the more old-fashioned (see also: snobbery, pretentiousness) British schools even though the teachers are the same PGCEs that less favoured institutions hire.

More generally your points are good ones about the quality of Hogwarts education. It's probably quite good for the naturally studious self-starters (looking at you, Ms. Granger) who can exploit the resources on offer to get more than the teachers are delivering.

And the History teaching is even worse than you're suggesting. The substitute teacher is wheeling in a TV and assigning a single textbook (you /can't/ learn history in any meaningful way out of a single text) /written by Hitler's Great-Aunt./

Define 'safe'. Adults should definitely not be encouraging a bunch of sixteen year-olds to be having lots of sex with each other.

Consider all these problems: Angst, drama, early pregnancy, magical STDs, coercion, love potions, relationship fallout, /serious/ distraction from studies, (I don't know about the AU Hogwarts, but canon Hogwarts certainly is) EXTREMELY dangerous environment, gender segregated dorms which is going to highly complicate things, and a level of expectation reinforced by the adults when people feel that they are not ready for such things.

And you think that encouraging promiscuity among the student population is the mark of a good school.... Why exactly?

#+begin_quote
  People -- especially women -- who have multiple sexual parters before tying the knot, report unhappier marriages down the line.

  [[http://nationalmarriageproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NMP-BeforeIDoReport-Final.pdf][The study ]]comes to us from [[http://nationalmarriageproject.org/][The National Marriage Project]], based off research from two University of Denver professors, Galena K. Rhoades and Scott M. Stanley, who looked at relationship data collected from 2007 to 2008 of 1,000 unmarried Americans ages 18 to 34. During the following five years, 418 of the participants got married.

  Rhoades and Stanley took a closer look at those marriages to see if factors, including participants' sexual past, played a role in current marital quality.

  Couples' relationship quality was measured using a four-item version of the [[http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=cli&prod=das&id=overview][Dyadic Adjustment Scale]], focusing on relationship happiness, thoughts about separation, frequency of confiding in one another, and a general item about how well things are going (the full scale, however,[[http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=cli&prod=das&id=overview][contains 32 items]]).

  According to researchers, the 23 percent of participants who only had sex with their spouse prior to getting hitched reported higher quality marriages versus those who had other past sexual partners as well.

  They claim this finding is especially true for women, writing in the report, "We further found that the more sexual partners a woman had had before marriage, the less happy she reported her marriage to be."

  On top of that, researchers say that participants who lived with an S.O. -- who did not become their future spouse -- also reported unhappier marriages
#+end_quote

As premarital promiscuity increased, happiness and marriage stability decreased.

And that's just one of the studies, and just one part of this - not even talking about the medical consequences (I assume there are none with magic) or the effects on educational achievement.

I'm sorry, this story sounds like it was written by a brainlet. And the idea that "we just need to be open and free sexually, and show those prudes" is absolutely smolbrained and asinine.
