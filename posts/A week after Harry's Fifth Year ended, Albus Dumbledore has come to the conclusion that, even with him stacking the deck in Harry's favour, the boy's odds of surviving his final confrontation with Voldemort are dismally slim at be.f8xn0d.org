** Starts dark, because all the best fics do. Enjoy or don't but here's my start.

...

Albus Dumbledore never thought that Petunia Dursley would be a factor in the war, but Harry Potter, and ultimately the wizarding world would most likely succumb to Voldemort because of her actions.

You see Harry Potter was in a coma.

.....

A week into summer Hedwig had shown up to His office without a letter, screeching indignantly and battering him about the head with her wings. He immediately called for Fawkes and with a flash they had appeared into an empty living room.

As he looked around a vacant first floor the wizard had realized with sinking dread that there was no sign of anyone living in the home. Petunia and Vernon Dursley along with their son Dudley, had done the unfathomable and vanished from Privet Drive.

Rushing up the stairs, following his whispered point me, and simply vanishing a door secured by 7 muggle locks, his heart had broken at the sight he revealed.

The poor boy beaten and unconscious, tied to a chair. A gag in his mouth and his wand broken on the floor before him. The fingers of his hands twisted to unnatural angles. A beam of light from a hole in the ceiling shining down on a note pinned to chest...

"Let the Freak do his magic now."

With a sob and a flick of his wand the ropes had disappeared. Scooping up the child, and with a burst of phoenix fire they had returned straight to the hospital wing, startling Poppy who immediately rushed to his side

.....

That had been 3 days prior and now physically healed but still unconscious, Harry Potter lay before him, and Albus felt nothing but guilt shame and remorse. As Poppy walked towards them he vowed he would do something to help the boy find some measure of peace and joy, but what?

"How is he Poppy?" asked Albus, as she wove her wand in patterns around the child's head and torso, a slip of paper unfurling from it's tip.

Clicking her tongue she looked up at him with barely veiled rage. "The skelegrow has succeeded in regrowing his hands from the radius and ulna down, as well as the 3 ribs we vanished. Swelling to the brain is down and all of his vitals are strong. His core appears replenished from whatever accidental magic he used to create the hole in the roof, but I still can't wake him Albus"

As she walked away he hung his head and silently reaffirmed his vow. Looking at the boy again he made a decision, and with one word the Headmaster, the boy, and the bed he lay in vanished from view

"Fawkes"

.....

3 years later

.....

Harry Potter woke to rythmic rocking and the sound of a woman singing in French. Patting around and finding his glasses aside him, he looked up and was immediately confused. There sat Dumbledore in a garish tropical print and Bermuda shorts, a straw hat on his head and flowers woven into his beard

"Headmaster?"

"Albus my dear boy, you see we are far from Scotland and I am no longer running the school"

"Huh?"

As the old wizard stood up and started making his way toward the bed Harry's mind started whirling. The last thing he remembered was his Aunt Petunia swinging the cast iron towards him. Where were they, where was Hedwig, how long had he been unconscious.

A hand on his shoulder brought him back to reality. "Don't worry, be happy Harry!" announced Albus with a grin "We're on vacation!" He slipped away "Let me get you a Margarita!"

Dumbfounded Harry sat up and wondered at once if he was dreaming.

"We have so much to talk about Harry"

After placing a drink in his hand, Albus sat down in the chair beside him and crossed his legs. Slowly sipping his own drink he started humming to the music and Harry was left with only one thought.

Albus Dumbledore had the ugliest, pointy, hairy, wrinkled knees he had ever seen. .....

"Are you and the lovely young lady over there going to... do the do, as the young people say these days?"

Harry groaned. "Dumbledore, no!"

Albus grinned. "Dumbledore, yes."

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** 'Harry.'

'Headmaster.'

'I have grave news.'

'Really,' Harry said, mildly sceptical that anything could be worse than Sirius' death.

'Well...,' Dumbledore took a deep breath. 'You know that line about how one cannot live etc? It means that, at your final confrontation, both you /and/ Voldemort, will die. I've tried to prevent it, believe me, but you chances of survival are abysmally slim.'

'No different from the snake then,' Harry laughed, slightly hysteric. 'Or the 100 dementors you let me up against because the great Albus Dumbledore couldn't possibly be seen defending S- Sirius.' He very nearly seemed to choke on his words before continuing. 'Or that bloody tournament you could have gotten me out of.'

Dumbledore /very nearly/ defended himself against that unfair accusation (he couldn't subvert a signed (magical) contract!) but he knew Harry would need to let this out before he could continue.

'Goddamnit, Dumbledore! I could be so. Much. More! I have -had- my whole life in front of me!'

He threw some stuff off the table, pacing around. 'I- I don't want to die,' Harry ended tearfully.

'I know, Harry, I know. Which is why I've got a surprise planned. One last holiday with this old man here, in which you shall have everything you could possibly ask for.'

**** "Potter, Is that you?" Draco asks a completely inebriated Harry, who in question was downing some sort of muggle liquor. Harry just raised an eyebrow and offered him the bottle of harsh smelling alcohol.

The morning light stung Draco's eyes. He rolled over only to encounter a warm body. Draco buried his head in the stranger's chest to block out the offending light and noise. After a few minutes of blinking and squeezing his eyes shut the blanket of sleep started to ebb away from his mind. The heaviness that dragged his eyelids down started to disappear. When his eyesight focused enough to make out the features of his one-night-stand, a very familiar mop of unruly black hair and tanned, wind-bitten skin greeted him. Right as it registered that he, Draco Malfoy had just slept with, and most likely fucked Harry Potter. The hotel door slammed open, causing Draco to bolt up to see Dumbledore in flowery shorts barge in and yell "Harry? Harry! You need to get up, my boy, we'll be late to the L'ourve. Har-?" Dumbledore was stunned into silence as he realized that a) Harry wasn't in bed by himself and b) that Draco Malfoy was in bed with Harry.
