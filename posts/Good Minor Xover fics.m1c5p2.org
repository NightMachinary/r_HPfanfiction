I'm looking for fics similar to "Harry Romanoff Barton" and "Wands and Claws". In short crossovers where Harry is raised by or related to a character from another fandom. I would prefer a bit of length. Also I still would like him going to hogwarts so I'm not looking for the "he's raised by the avengers and becomes one while ignoring that hogwarts exsists" kind of fics. NO SLASH. A fic with a pairing is preferable though


** Linkao3(Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death) Has an interesting scenario where Harry is raised by Natasha without being aware of the fact that his real parents are alive.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. Killed lots and lots of people? Done it. Been killed herself? Done it. But meeting Death himself and being introduced to a universe where it isn't alien invasions but baby's who stop dark lords? Now that's a new one. And who is she to refuse when Death hands her an orphan whose being hunted by terrorists? Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her.

** while technically not 'raised' from birth, this one is good and does involve parent/child relationship:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm]]

This one is also great. Bruce Banner raising Harry.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11397437/1/Fates-Be-Changed]]

Hogwarts-education is part of both of them, albeit in CotS there is 'avengers raising'\\
in FbC it is more 'bruce on the run raising Harry'
