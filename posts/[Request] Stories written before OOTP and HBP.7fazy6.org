I would like to read stories made before OOTP /OR/ HBP because it would be interesting to see how people solved the war with Voldemort, without the Harry is a horcrux and horcruxes revelations! And also to see what people did with Dumbledore, did they make him live longer than in canon? Was Snape written as a real bad guy the whole time? And also what about all the romances? :)

People made shit up. A common solution (the most common maybe) was, Voldemort being the heir of Slytherin and so on, /only/ Harry could defeat him because he was the heir of Gryffindor.

#+end_quote

Actually those kinds of fics often had a more well portrayed Dumbledore compared to more recents stories. Nowdays, it's almost always either full-on bashing or whitewashing him completely.

#+end_quote

Lol no. The Snape worship was real. I'd say it was after 2012-2013 that the Snape illusion began to crumble.

  And also what about all the romances?
#+end_quote

Interesting question.

I'd say H/G was, paradoxically, even more popular back then. There were like a dozen web archives that didn't even accept non H/G stories.

H/Hr was probably about as popular as now, though a lot more vocal. Shipping wars anyone?

H/D I don't know about. I've read maybe a couple of stories with this pairing over 15 years. It's probably still growing in popularity. Same with HG/SS

H/Snape started to decline massively after the last movie got out - it was /disgustingly/ popular in the 2003-2007 period.

H/Tonks had a booming period after OttP, another after HBP, declined after DH. It's rarer today (but still my favorite pairing!)

Harry/MarySueOC was a lot more popular back then. Especially (American) transfer students, Voldemorts (grand)daughters, other characters hidden daughters and so on. I think all those people moved to canon OCs like Daphne or Susan.

H/Luna I think is as rare as it was back then. Everyone wants to read it, noone is capable of writing Luna well - she doesn't lend herself as a proper main character.

H/Bella Nonexistant before HBP. I think I read a couple before DH came out, but the pairing really took off after 2013-2014.

*** Many ships didn't exist prior to OotP because the characters didn't exist prior to OotP.

H/Daphne wasn't a ship since Daphne didn't exist yet. Bellatrix was only a mention in Harry's pensieve visit in GoF, so she wasn't much of a ship target. Tonks wasn't a character until OotP. Luna wasn't either.

**** I'm pretty sure she wasn't even mentioned by name in GoF. Harry recognised her as /that/ woman when Sirius told him that she was caught together with Crouch Jr (iirc the day before his disciplinary hearing).

*** As I recall there was a brief fight over whether Blaise Zabini was a boy or a girl. With quite a few H/Blaise stories where Blaise is female being published before it was determined that Blaise is a male name.

** Suggestion:

Go to FFN.

Set up a sort by publish date. Then click/tap “last” to get to the earliest published stories. You can find some pre-GoF fics that way.

Beware of filters on that search though. Many of those fics were written before FFN used character tags, pairing tags, or even genre tags. Just leave it an open search. If you really want, sort by word count. You will be more likely to find completed fics that way - but the Complete tag didn't show up in FFN until about 2005, so don't filter out completed only either.

  This is a Draco/Hermione fic. Basically, they're forced together for a class project and things take off from there. It's awfully long. **FINISHED!!!!!**

** Pre HBP: linkffn(2162474)

Probably my favorite fanfiction. It's a HG/SS story, but not much is outright physical relationship and I don't think they even get together that way until over half way through the story.

I like how well it is written and how they handle taking down Voldemort.
