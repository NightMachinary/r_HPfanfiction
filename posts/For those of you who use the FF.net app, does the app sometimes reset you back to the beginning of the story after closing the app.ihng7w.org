Pretty much the title. If I'm done reading a story for the night, I'll close the app completely. When I want to start reading again the next day it will sometimes reset my progress back to the info page. This seems to be dependent on the story as it will do it every time on some stories and not at all on others. It also doesn't change if I have downloaded the story to my device. Have any of you had any experience with this?


** I have had that happened to me before, but only if I had opened the story up from another link (I.e. opening a Reddit link then opening it into the app). To get around this is that I just back out to the menu and reopen the story. Never had a problem after that.

*** Now that you mention that, I think this is it. I can't remember if it's every time I go to it from an outside source but I lean towards that being the case.

**** Yup, it's kinda annoying. Especially if end up forgetting what chapter you were on and stuff. Like I said, you just need to go all the way back to the main menu and open up the last read fanfic (or library if you have to) to avoid it from happening again. A bit tedious but I like reading from the app more than the browser

** I sometimes have this problem, and what I noticed is it happens whenever I swipe (instead of tap) from the summary(?) page. I really don't know what you call it, but it's the one that features summary and comments/reviews. If you swipe from there instead of tap, you'll be directed to the first chapter, even if you're already on the nth chapter. But when you tap in the general area of the summary or title, you'll be directed to where you last stopped.

** Constantly. The only reason I even still use it is to avoid ads on the browser.

** that happens when while you're reading a fanfic you suddenly close the fanfiction app. You should first go back to the homepage of fanfiction app by pressing the back button so that the app remembers where you left off.
