It began with a birthday party for Harry at Grimmauld place, iirc, later events triggered a Snape-installed emergency escape system which badly burned most of Harry's body and deposited him in a basement safe room, leading to his being in St Mungo's for the remainder of the summer where he was frequently visited by Cho, who quite mistakenly believed that her presence was helping our comatose hero... any help would be much appreciated


** What site? I think I read one a bit like this...don't know what it was called. Sorry!

Please tell me if you find it. I'd love to read it it.
