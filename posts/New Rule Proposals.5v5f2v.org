I'd like to see what people think about two possible new rules.

+The first is "no sexual content between adults and minors", inspired by a recent Harry/Lily Luna fic search where the fic in question featured Harry and a young, teenage Lily Luna. I don't know where this stands legally, but I'd prefer not to allow it here.+

People have sufficient issues with this one that I'm dropping it for now. I still reserve the right to remove blatant pedophilia.

The second would enact stricter moderation in request threads. We've had complaints about people going to into request threads just to insult the OP or dismiss whatever it is they're looking for as stupid. Comments in request threads would be limited to recommendations or constructive discussion.


** +Since people are wary of the wording of the first one, what do y'all think of "no sexual content featuring minors and people significantly older than them"?+

+The intent of the rule is to catch things like the Harry/Lily Luna fic I mentioned in the OP or that creepy pedo fic where Harry and Luna groom a younger student.+

*** A couple of thoughts:

- Would /all/ sexual content involving minors be banned, or just outright smut?

- Would the rule also apply to pairings where Harry is the underage party?

I'm asking because Harry's the older one in your examples, but if the same rule applies when the situation is reversed, it should spell the end of Snarry, Honks, etc.

*** I think that implementing that would spell the end for a LOT of different fics, and a blanket ban on fics that explore controversial topics is a very dangerous territory. What would you consider 'creepy'? What is the 'right' way to explore these topics? What is the age of consent that you'd stick to? And so many more questions.

Despite that, I will add that I've got nothing against you removing stuff that you think might get you and the community into trouble. I appreciate you being honest about your reasons instead of trying to cloak it in some ethical or moral argument.

I agree with the second one, since comments on Fic Request threads almost invariably end up having more than a few karma-grabbing one liners that either diss or joke about the fics instead of giving any actual help.

*** Honestly, I think such a rule would be huge headache to implement. Sure, it would be easy to catch when people are doing fic searches but people rec fics outside of those posts all the time. And unless the mods are familar with every fic posted to sub, then smut between minor/older is bound to slip through from time to time.

Plus, this rule would seemingly allow fics like The Real Ones (i think thats the title) that featured graphic sex scenes between first years.

Enforcing it will also require people to read such fics to check if they actually violate the rule, or if some troll just reported a post because they don't like the poster, topic, or whatever. And if people start deleting threads on hearsay "because they trust the report", or whatever the excuse will be, then that's even worse.

- The mods will go read the entire story, subject themselves to whatever you aren't willing to subject yourself to, judge if its 'appropriate' or not, and then either remove it or ignore you. This is at best ineffecient and at worst downright useless.

- The mods will ask you to send them the paragraph or section that set you off, and judge the fic from just that section. This is judgement without any context, and when it comes to stories it's just not fair to judge the entire thing off of one paragraph.

Either options seem pretty unusable.

Go nuts, just don't start writing about a forty year old male fucking a fourteen year old, it's highly disturbing. Tonks is at least relatively close to Harry age by the time he reaches his fifth year, she's twenty-one or twenty-two depending on her birthday, he's fifteen. But then you have Harry/Bellatrix and Harry/Narcissa, I get just as disturbed with those pairings as I do with Hermione/Lucius or Hermione/Snape.

** The first is tricky because of what constitutes an adult and a minor. Even just by using say, the Wizarding World of Britain's '17 is adult' point, you could be technically violating ti if say, a seventeen year old and a sixteen year old hook up.

Obviously that's not the intention of the rule. Setting something up like that is opening a can of worms. I agree that I'd rather not see it here; but like most things I rather not see here I typically just ignore it when it comes up. I feel like moderating it in a way that 'fair' opens up far too many loopholes over other things that people find less problematic.

I mean arguably my own story Letters features an implied sex scene between a 17 year old Fleur and a 14 year old Harry Potter. The Pureblood Princess has a 17 year old Daphne and a 16 year old Harry engage in such activities as well. Although the only actual activity in the text occurs when both are 16.

Technically if it's 'no sexual content between adults and minors' neither of those would be 'allowed.' Of course, they're far from 'smut' scenes. So there's that too.

The second one I shrug at knowing it comes in reaction to what was actually, in my mind, a perfectly legitimate request that the author felt insulted about.

There is probably something to be said from perhaps moderating comments that aren't directly related to the request. But if someone said 'recommend me your worst Harry/Fleur fanfictions' and the top recommendation was 'Letters' I'm not going to throw a fit about it.

It really just is what it is. It's an opinion that is quite often based on something. Silencing that user doesn't seem right to me. But maybe moderating away things that aren't directly related to the request could be useful.

I think I mostly just rambled and didn't say anything of note.

*** It's not about your own fic being recommended in a thread asking for worst fics -- sure that requires a tough skin as an author you're bound to get criticism anyway :)

The second rule sounds like censorship , but it really isn't -- discussion threads exist for a reason and if it really irks you that there are some people out there requesting fics that you can't fathom how anyone could possibly enjoy ... that's where you should go to talk about it. Not in the thread where someone's requesting for fics and not discussion. Maybe they could say discussion welcomed and whatnot if they're up to trying to convert /defend their likes, but this just sounds distasteful, not everyone is polite when it comes to handing out their opinions.

Making posts with the express purpose of not fostering a discussion because we should create a safe space for people who request things widely considered, at best, strange, seems backwards to me.

******* No, I shouldn't have to subject myself to your judgment, and ordinarily I would try my best not to care, but the fact is that some of these discussions derail the thread. And maybe you haven't been a mod or something, but it's literally the job of a moderator to lock / close threads that are getting derailed. Sure, we are arguing about when it gets derailed or not.

And of course I feel bad when someone else expresses disdain for another person's /personal likes/. It's like you've got nothing better to do than to go around judging people for what they like. You know who does that? /Haters/. If the rule doesn't get enacted because haters gon' hate, fine. But I hope you know that if I am advocating for censorship, you're just advocating for hating on other people's tastes.

I don't know your tastes, but you're being unfair when you say that the requests are "widely considered, at best, strange". Dumbledore bashing is the one that I've gotten heat for. Yes, I like to read fics where Dumbledore's is portrayed as a meddler instead of a helper (though not where he's evil). This subreddit /hates/ that. A couple months ago there were 3 threads on the front page on that subject and one of them was a fic request thread. The discussion on how bad these fics are were /upvoted/, and the recs were all at the bottom.

To piggy back on an analogy by another redditor here -- it's like if I posted a request asking for suggestions for a good burger joint in town for date night, and someone else comes into my thread telling me that eating meat is bad and I should feel bad. And I'm telling them to get out of my thread if you don't have any recommendations, except now, they've got people on their back and are continuing a discussion on /my request post/ about how I like bad food and must like killing animals or something. This kind of thing shouldn't be encouraged, /especially/ not in a subreddit for fanfiction --- fanfiction meaning all kinds of fan-written fiction, not just the ones you personally like.

******** Any time you are advocating for the silencing of other people's opinions you are in the wrong.

Any time you make your opinion or tastes public you need to accept that other people may not share your opinion, and are allowed to make their opinion public as well. Again, this is a public forum. No one is immune from criticism because it might hurt their feelings. I've had reviewers spout vile things to me on multiple occasions. They have a right to do so because I have made my work public.

As for strange requests, this post came about because of a blatant request for pedophilia. In the last few weeks there have been multiple requests for what amounts to love-potion induced rape and pedophilia.

Yes, these are things I would rather not see. However I have argued in other posts on this thread that they have the right to make such requests. But in doing so they are opening themselves up to criticism about those requests. That is the nature of a public internet forum.

No. I'm advocating that opinions are allowed. Silencing an opinion because someone else finds it distasteful or dislikes the manner in which it was expressed because it hurts their feelings is inherently wrong. I'm already on record as saying that I think a lot of it is a waste of time. But it is their time to waste.

You cannot legislate away bad behavior. History has shown that repeatedly. Open discussion is more likely to stop the behavior you dislike rather than banning it.

You also do not account for the Law of Unintended Consequences. I've seen multiple request threads where the requested topic didn't exist, and someone, after discussion in the request thread, went on to write that story. Most recently it was one related to Oliver Wood using performance enhancing drugs or magic (didn't read the fic, only half remember the request) to gain an edge to win the house cup. If you do not allow for discussion, that fic does not exist. You are saying you would rather have a front page of request threads with no response rather than discussion. Because if we can only post responses reccomedning fics, then threads like that Qudiditch one, would have remained empty.

Also, most request threads are inherently lazy. There have been successive days where identical request threads are made. Just wait until the top four 'request threads' are 'give me your best Harry/Daphne!'

Have been but that's irrelevant. The Mods exist to enforce the rules on the sidebar of the sub. The rules do not state 'do not share an opinion in request threads. But either way you didn't seem quite as adamant about the moderates rules when, in your post history, you request a copy of a fic that has been removed by the author, which technically could be violating rule 6 of the subreddit.

Again. You cannot legislate away bad behavior. There's already an in place reddit system to enforce this. You're up in arms that discussions of how bashing is inherently bad writing is more upvoted than fics requesting bashing. You're on a subreddit that is interested in good writing and interesting stories. There's been countless discussions of why bashing is bad writing and makes for a bad story so I'm not going to waste words with it here.

Your analogy is more akin to if you went on a vegetarian forum and asked for a burger joint reference. While you can probably get a reference for a burger joint from a vegetarian, you shoudn't be surprised when the public sentiment of that forum is anti meat. The same holds true with this subreddit. While you can request smut, rapefics, pedophilia, and sound bonds here, and while you can get recommendations for all of those, it shouldn't surprise you when people interested in higher quality writing and plot point out why these things often make for bad stories. And frankly, it's a good thing that these discussions happen.

The two rule proposals look related, but they are not. I could be wrong here, but I don't believe that's the case since it's possible to enact a rule to remove disturbing content while also enacting a rule that limits request threads for recs + constructive discussion only. If they were related to the same issue ("strange requests"), then I don't see why 2 different rules would be proposed.

The 2nd rule proposal came about as a result of me bringing it to the attention of the mods months ago (and probably others as well) for things that are not rapefics or pedophilia. Dumbledore bashing is one, but I've also sent them ones where I wasn't involved in (a recent fic requesting Grey Harry and someone talking shit about how people who think in terms of dark, grey and light magic shouldn't be writing fic). The 1st rule proposal came about due to the recent posts like you said.

That's why this post is a rule proposal. Are you following?

Plus, the proposed rule is not "don't share an opinion in a request thread", because opinions/discussion on /recommended fics for the request/ is completely fine. What the rule proposal is covering is to stop people from going into someone else's request thread and talking about OP's tastes. It isn't censorship if you can already do that in a discussion thread on the same subreddit.

** On the first rule: I'm new to this subreddit, but this is always been a subject that fascinates me, so here is a brain dump.

I'm generally against blanket bans for the same reason I am against laws that attempt to ban such content: You tend to draw in issues in the grey area which do warrant discussion. It becomes a question of which would you rather: Do you want to avoid certain content so much you are willing to sweep up content that would otherwise be ok, or do you find the content that would otherwise be ok to be important enough to tolerate content you would otherwise wish to ban?

(I'll admit to being a rather free-speech absolutist in this issue ;) )

Regardless, there are quite a few ambiguities in how it is currently proposed.

Is this only about content actually on the reddit or *linked content* as well? If it is linked content, it would be the only rule on linked content correct? At least how I read the rules something like 'no hateful speech' is read so that say, a discussion on the stereotypes used in fics/cannon would be appropriate, but you have to maintain a certain caution when discussing those topics. I think a similar rule would be completely appropriate for sexual content (honestly, with or without the minors) (on a side note, if this is about linked content, why doesn't rule 6 cover this already?

This is already a contentious and *unclear issue* in a world without magic: Legal age differ significantly, most places have Romeo/Juliette laws (if couple is within x age of each other it isn't statutory rape), as well as double-standard laws (Older Male -> Younger Female is looked down upon but Older Female -> Younger Male is not. A holdover from a more medieval time I suppose. This is complicated because a lot of fics place HP in a world that has an outdated standards. It is actually interesting to discuss Harry having to deal with a magical world that still finds betrothals acceptable, might allow marriages as early as say 14, or other standards that the modern world has moved away from.

Sci-fi/Fantasy fiction *blurrs lines* in ways that are not even applicable to the real world. This is certainly applicable to HP fanfiction, which uses magic to do all sorts of things that might be considered.. problematic if they ever came true. Just look at love potions. If someone actually made a potion like that it would be called a date-rape drug and (hopefully) quickly banned.

Let me put it another way: Here are some issues I could see getting caught up in such a rule that I think would have merit in at least exploring:

- Adults go back in time or deage, stuck in child's body. Having to deal with the fact their bodies are immature.

- Creepier, is if you have a single adult go back. Having them go through puberty, particularly if they are around people who are actually kids. Yea, I know, creepy, but an interesting outcropping of having 'de-aging' magic

- Still on de-aging magic, what about someone who gets stuck permanently in the body of a child. Not exactly a new topic, there are a few works (outside of HP) that explore it. Most take a cautious tact with the subject, because of this very issue.

- On the notion of soul - bonds (or really soulmates in general), there is a lot of creepy stuff here due to the fact it is forced upon the participants. It is hard to imagine how our world would cope with such a thing, since we have nothing like it.

It is an interesting problem. I note that it isn't one that is readily solved outside of fanfiction. Most of the rules around this pertain to the visual medium, and they are generally not consistent. Two adults in children bodies having sex would be repulsed (banned or shunned), while a kid being forced into an adult body and having sex isn't (see: Big)

A note on the legal side: Obviously one should consult a lawyer related to anything legal, but my understanding is that in the US content must already be obscene (in the case of writing, really graphic sex) for it to be illegal, and in that case child porn modifiers can be added. However, most virtual child porn (content where minors were not involved in the production) bans have been struck down, congress passed another (clearly unconstitutional, IMO) one, that has yet to be struck down.

And that is only US, other countries (without the first amendment) certainly do ban such content. Pretty sure Canada is quite harsh about it.

Anyway, I come back to: How does rule 6 not cover this case? If it was graphic enough and contains underage characters, don't all of our linked archives ban such content? And if it wasn't graphic enough, is it still something we don't want to talk about?

(I'm all for requiring such discussion to be behind proper NSFW or Content warning tags though)

*** I see that we are dropping this one, but I want to toss on a hypothetical that I hope illustrates my point (the one about the value of content that pushes lines being worth tolerating content that crosses it).

Imagine a hypothetical author Bob. Bob hates soulfic. He finds them cheesey and creepy. As a response, he chooses to write a parody: Harry/Dumbledore Soulfic. He intends to poke fun at the dearth of soul-fics out there and point out how horrifying such a bond would actually be.

Bob puts a sex scene in his fic. Nothing explicit, he knows he is treading on hallowed ground. However, most soul bond fics tend to make sex a requirement of finishing the bond (often times with the participants drawn unwillingly into it). Since most soul bond fics are used to put two people together who wouldn't normally be together, he can't say they are in love beforehand. .

Even if Bob handles such content in a taste-ful and non-explicit way, in order for him to accomplish his goal of parodying soul bond fics there wouldn't be ambiguity that sex happened (lots of fics avoid sexual content by merely implying it, you can't say it happened), and discussion on it afterwards (since it isn't a parody if you don't make fun of it).

Would such a fic be worthy of discussion on this subreddit?

Would it matter if the fic was a well-written parody? Fanfic writers are not always the best, if Bob was intending it to be a parody but is a bad writer and it doesn't come off as such, does that matter?

What if the subject was originally intended to be a parody but after he started writing bob realized he had a story here and fleshed it out into a full drama. This certainly happens to fanfiction all the time,

We get that lots of people don't like slash, but if I'm looking for a Drarry fic, I don't want a response like "why would anyone read that disgusting pairing?" It just devolves into a dumb argument that isn't changing anyone's mind.

Such fics hurt absolutely no one and no one is under an obligation to read them. As such, the suggested ban serves no purpose other than moral masturbation for those who get off on their own righteousness and disapproval of others.

As much as I dislike Hermione/Snape etc, I will vigorously defend people's right to post it. Complimentary to that, I will equally vigorously defend the right to call it bad in a civil manner. It seems to me that such a situation is more open, vital, honest and diverse than banning large swathes of fics and also banning calling anything bad.

Such a situation would basically amount to creating an authority that mandates acceptable fanfic. So long as a fic is deemed within the bounds of acceptable by that authority, you cannot criticise it. That does not sound like a healthy community.

***** I agree with [[/u/Taure]] and wish to further state that it's preposterous to declare a consensus on a rule proposal after only a day. Some of us work for a living and don't visit the sub twenty times a day.

I'm not in favor of the second proposal as it seems more an excuse for God-Modding and heavy-handed speech stifling than an attempt to solve a real problem. Frankly, if someone comes into a public forum and requests perverse, oftentimes illegal material in a public forum, they shouldn't be coddled. They should live with their choices like the self-styled adults they are.

And as a practical matter, where do you draw the line? One can easily editorialize a recommendation post to skirt the rules. (A quick perusal of the extant request threads shows multiple instances of this.) And are the Mods /really/ going to go remove comments on posted stories that might be perceived as mildly critical? Because if they are, then this basically defenestrates all hope of meaningful discussion in these threads. And if they aren't, then you open up the following dynamic:

Request: Snape/Ginny - preferably with an underage Ginny + non-con.

Reply: [Link to whatever, maybe Ginny's Punishment by Slytherinjunkie20]

Reply to reply: Yet another example of the wish-fulfillment rape-fantasy rubbish that seems to inhabit this fetid corner of the fandom. Yes, Alan Rickman was an inspired casting choice, I get it, but it's left us with a ton of fics that we have to nope the heck out of lest we never digest again.

Which means the rule solves nothing.

Why not instead make a rule that nothing but links can be posted in request threads? That way no commentary can be provided, whether positive or negative? And while you're at it, why not make an option for subscribers to opt out of ever seeing any more request threads on their feeds? I know could do without in this vapid world of non-thought.

If someone is posting a request on a public internet forum, past whatever direct violation of the forum rules the responses are, there isn't any reason that people shouldn't be able to comment on it.

Discouraging them from doing so in a civil manner is wrong. And expecting people to create discussion threads instead of commenting on it seems backward and logistically annoying.

A public forum is not a 'safe space'. Many of these requests are asking for people to find them a specific fetish that is oftentimes not only distasteful but illegal. Granting them immunity because they feel bad when people point that out, is the wrong way to go about it.

** As someone who has complained about the second, you know my thoughts on this but I'll reiterate what I've said:

There are discussion threads and there are fic request threads, and I really don't like it if I'm looking for something to read and then someone comes in and tells me that I like bad fic etc. That's personal, but it's also quite distasteful to join in on a thread from someone who has similar tastes of your own, and also seeing comments on that. Sure, I can try to ignore and not engage in the discussion, but seriously, why have a difference between discussion and request threads at all if this is going to be allowed?

Discussion threads exist for a reason. You can start your own discussion about how bad a certain trope is and like minded people (and the occasional brave soul) can go talk about it. I don't want to have to defend myself in my request fic thread, or defend the fics that I like. I don't want to be belittled and called stupid or whatnot, even if it's very thinly veiled -- it's pretty obvious what's a recommendation and what's not.

I understand it's possible to want to discuss if a recommended fic may not fit the request, and so long as one's respectful about it, that's unavoidable. But I feel that the top level comments in a request thread should really only be recs as requested, or requesting clarification on the OP's specifications.

And for the first rule ... ...As someone who also recently requested for Sirius/Hermione and Remus/Hermione fics (with no time travel), I understand why I didn't get a lot of response now ... hah. I should have specified an of-age Hermione (with older men), and even that is squicky to some but at least still legal... anyway, I agree to this rule as well, it's fair to draw the line, in RL it isn't legal after all? So I feel it's okay to set that rule to be on the safe side.

#+begin_quote
  OP: "I'm in the mood for this kind of fic please"

/It adds nothing to the request/. Why even have the distinction between discussion and request threads if you're going to allow one to derail another?

If you're legitimately wondering, then what's wrong with starting a separate discussion post? If you're making it a point to tell me that I like bad writing, in a non-personal attack way, then that comment just sits there distastefully and if I try to report that it just looks silly to the mods probably since it wasn't insulting.

It misses the rather more fundamental point - does discussion on a particular matter related to a request enhance this discussion forum for HP, and does artificially inhibiting discussion for the sake of categorisation enrich the life of the forum?

It seems to me thst all this rule would do is reduce the number of interesting discussions happening on the sub. Telling people to make a duplicate discussion thread for every request thread feels impractical and excessive regulation. Forums often live or die on ease of discussion. Heavy regulation tends to just kill off activity.

I'm sure I could definitely be called one of the special snowflakes you've alluded to in another comment somewhere, but some of these "interesting discussions" you're talking about is certainly subjective.

I certainly don't find it interesting to read about why people don't like the type of fic I like -- it's not going to change my mind. It's only going to make me feel bad about what I like. Furthermore, if that discussion is going to happen anyway because what I like is unpopular, there's a place for that to happen and it would be in a discussion thread.

Either way it boils down to: a) preferring that people can say whatever they want on whatever thread , thus "not killing off activity by heavy regulation" --- which would lead to people like me not feeling like this community is a welcoming place at all if I want to post a fic request thread --- which would lead to less participation/ activity anyway

or

b) a new rule to make everyone play nicer. If opening up a discussion thread based on a fic request thread you browsed through for /fics/tropes you don't even like/, is too much /hassle/ then surely it must not be very worth it at all to even post it in the first place.

I've been a part of this community for a long time as a lurker and less than a year as a subscriber, but one thing I've always admired was that there was little judgement in /peculiar/ request threads. Sometimes the OP will say something like "please don't hate me for asking this" and people here will still find the fic for them.

** A few commenters seem to think the second issue isn't a problem. Here are a list of times from the last week (not exhaustive, but threads I could recall it from) where a commenter ridiculed or responded something totally non-constructive to OP's request.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5uwueu/request_lf_fic_where_harry_wakes_up_in_au_in_bed/][OP asks for a fic they read before where Harry wakes up in bed with Draco.]]. One commenter suggested it was TURN, their favorite fic, and then a commenter wrote “False, main characters aren't gay, thus, this is not your favorite fic.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5usm44/harryxfemale_george_and_fred/][OP asks for a female fred and george fic]] and first comment was “LOL”

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5uepg3/lf_creepy_disturbing_stories_that_make_you_wonder/][OP asks for fics that are so disturbing you would wonder why the author isn't on a watch list.]]. A few commenters had comments and not recs, but the only really unnecessary comment was “ANYTHING voldemort x harry or snape x students VOM you need to go get therapy” and then a few other commenters agreeing.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5u8cvp/lf_harryandromeda/][OP asked for Harry/Andromeda pairings]] and the top comment is a joke about Harry's dick not being big enough to fuck a galaxy. (To be fair, this and the comments were pretty funny but not meeting OP's request at all.)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5u39x0/looking_for_good_fics_written_within_the_past/][OP asked for good fics that came out in the past two years]] and one commenter wrote "No good fics these past couple years. The SJW movements have caused a slew of keyboard warriors to push out "women empowerment" Hermione-centric fics, where she is essentially a mary-sue that makes ignorant changes in the wizarding world, and suddenly it becomes a utopia that defeats the entire purpose of the books.”

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5tz2xx/harrymerope/][OP asked for Harry/Merope]] and one commenter wrote “Isn't Merope older than Harry's Mother?” and the thread devolved into a discussion about time travel pairings and if they are still gross.

** I'm not sure about both issues.

If the first would target things like "The Real Us", I'd be all for it. I think just blatant pedophilia is a safe ban.

The second issue is also rather simple to solve. If the discussion started in a civil manner, where is the issue? There is no harm done in asking someone why he likes something or what some particular trope does for him. When people call OP stupid, or insult him outright, they wouldn't be welcome in any thread anyway. Though, I do admit that i'm rather annoyed when I made an request and the next time I see that little mail-symbol being red it only turns out that someone wants to talk about the trope/pairing/... in the request.

I'm happy with how you've worded this, but I'd suggest 'constructive discussion' should be a fairly broad label. If I request Harmony, people should be able to, say, point out why good Harmony fics are surprisingly rare, without falling afoul of the rule.

EDIT: Changed my mind upon reading your discussion with [[/u/Taure]]. I'm not in favour of limiting discussion, as it seems this will do. Rules 2 and 3 already forbid insults and 'inciting arguments' and could simply be expanded to forbid low investment content, if that's really an issue.

On the topic of new rules, could I suggest making flaired posts mandatory? Most people flair up now, which makes browsing and searching the sub a /lot/ smoother, to the point where I find myself mentally 'tripping over' flair-less posts (which tend to be pretty crap anyway).

** The first rule has already been shut down (for good in my opinion, are we going to start removing H/T fics?), but I wonder about the second rule.

While I've never insulted someone for asking for a certain type of fic, I've been guilty of seeing a recommendation, and say that I think the fic recced is shit. I always try and say /why/ it's shit, but I haven't hesitated to call a spade a spade either.

I wonder if that type of comment would be disallowed under the rule. There are people in this sub who (in my opinion) are far too quick to take offense when they believe their opinion has been insulted. In a sub dedicated to fanfiction, generally we look to push up high quality work, and avoid the shit at the bottom of the barrel. I think it would be counterproductive to make a judgement call about a fics quality against the rules. This is doubly true in request threads, where people are almost always asking for things worth reading.

It's rude, for starters, and ultimately just mean. It might not be their cup of tea, but that does not give them right to go in and act as their preferred pairing is somehow superior. As juvenile as it sounds, /if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all/.

** Stricter moderation is great. There's a lot of trolls here, and it's not hard to ignore stupid threads (see whatshisname, GryffTom) and move on.

I'm actually really disappointed that the mods didn't stand up for the first proposal. This subreddit being used to pander pedophilia, and even worse, underage rape, is disgusting. There should be a strict rule to not post any kind of sexual material featuring minors. HPFanfiction is a hive of scum and degeneracy in comparison to other Fanfiction boards, like Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity. There any kind of sexuality with minors is harshly beaten down, as it should be.

There are other sites for spreading this kind of filth, I think the majority of people here come for quality fanfiction. NSFW stories should only be asked for, and linked to, in NSFW marked threads, and underage stories should be blacklisted from ffnbot, and kept up to date with community moderation.

It is, in fact, illegal, in many countries to keep and consume pornographic material about minors. /Yes,/ that includes the written word. Only "cultural historical" stories are accepted, like Nabokov. Filthy masturbation papers about 11 year olds is not.

** As has already been mentioned /ad nauseam/, the first one becomes difficult to enforce, in no small part because the vast majority of the characters are minors for much of the original storyline.

As to the second one, I feel that it is already covered in rules 2 and 3 of this subreddit. The enforcement of said rules and their particulars has always been subject to the moderator discretion; as such, it would be simpler merely to enforce the existing rules more strictly. Creating such a wide set of rules for comments in request threads is likely to result in some sort of fight wherein one side misuses the rules against the other.

Should further complaints arise, I highly recommend the DLP forums to the complainers, where they will no doubt be treated with a more appropriate level of respect and kindness.

2., wherein the specific genre that the poster requests is critiqued , whether it be for common tropes, et al., but no actual criticism of the OP exists.

Someone will almost undoubtedly take the second one as a violation of the proposed rules (perhaps because they like it and do not want to hear any criticism about it whatsoever) though it is in no way a criticism of the OP.

Rather, a discussion of the merits, tropes, and various problems might occur. Request threads can be superb for generating such discussion. Nonetheless, it is entirely possible that someone might take offense at critiques of the genre, and complain about it as a violation of the rules. Criticism can both imply that the genre is a pile of trope-ridden tripe, and be constructive. It's there that difficulties will occur, in distinguishing what crosses the line.

By your own logic, you ought not be supporting this, since it does in fact support discussion in request threads. In fact, I rather agree with you in this regard - discussion thread ought to be kept completely separate from request threads, with only responses containing links or recommendations being allowed in. However, that's not what the proposed rule would accomplish, instead forcing a fine distinction between criticism and vitriol on the posters. And if that's the case, I see no reason not to stick to the old system. Now, if they only allowed recommendations, I'd support it.

** I like the second suggestion, as request threads can get easily derailed from what I've seen (but I haven't been around here too long, so who knows).

The first one, though, is /much/ trickier. Wouldn't there have to be a lot of wording on what constitutes sexual content, and if things like clearly implied (but not directly featured) sexual content would be omitted from such a rule?

I would personally just leave the whole issue be - as distasteful as some of the content that features adult/minor relations is, there are a portion of the readers here that seek out stories that might fit this overall group (for example, Hermione/Snape if the former is still under the age of sixteen - the legal age of consent in UK - or seventeen if we apply a "wizarding consent" rule).

The only way to really implement a rule like the first suggestion would surely require a lot of work and policing, and I can't see that it would be worth your effort to put together.

** Censoring requested stories is entering tricky territory, as a thread about censorship affirmed recently. The first one essentially is telling the authors of quite a few Harry/older person stories to screw off. I do not agree with censorship of any form, no matter whether the censored content is agreeable to me or not. There are always going to be fans to niche groups of fics, and we shouldn't demonize people who like niche stories we might not be agreeable to. Don't turn this sub into the SJW shitstorm that is many other subreddits. As compared to other subs, I think [[/r/HPfanfiction]] enjoys a very relaxed and friendly environment. It should stay that way.

/I still reserve the right to remove blatant pedophilia./

To me this is a slightly watered down and reworded proposal #1. It's no different.

Full steam ahead with the second proposal, however. If people are going to criticize a request, then they should create a discussion thread about the pairing or situation requested in the request fic. That way the request thread is clean of unnecessary content. The discussion thread would provide a more relevant and more "within the rules" place to discuss the pairing/situation requested. Request threads should mostly contain content relevant to the request and the stories presented.
