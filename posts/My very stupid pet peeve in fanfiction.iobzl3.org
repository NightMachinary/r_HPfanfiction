I don't know if this a foreign thing or something but I have never heard the word cousin used like it is in most fanfictions. Where the characters says 'Cousin Sirius' or something like that. It just sounds stupid to me.


** It's a posh people thing

** It's something you see in BBC period dramas, used as a way to indicate a character is upper class. Who knows if people from the Regency era actually spoke like that.

** It's a combination of posh manners and the fact that Brits (and well-brought-up children) do not call people by their first names alone unless they're quite good friends --- and sometimes not even then. It's actually quite rude to just assume that you can call somebody by their first name unless they invite you to do so. (One of the many ways Americans display rudeness in foreign countries, because in our culture everybody is on a first-name basis as soon as they meet, especially when somebody is trying to establish a "relationship" to sell you something.)

  Not sure where you've got this from - you'd address people you barely know by their titles, but peers, friends, colleagues, etc would all be addressed by their first name without invitation and that isn't considered rude at all!

Personally I refer to peers by their title until we have established a working rapport.

** My cousin over uses the word because there are so many of us she can't remember all of our names so I'm kinda use to it

** Using just the first name suggests friendship, using Cousin denotes not only the familial relationship, but reminds the person (in this case Sirius) that there are rules for interacting with family members, especially if their from cadet branches of the same house. (IE: Cissa or Andy). This is why you often see people referred to in the books by surnames alone. "Malfoy" "Potter" "Granger" etc, because first name is to suggest you approve of them and their behaviour.

*** Yeah, I agree. Canon only establishes a 90s British way of speaking- Surnames for peers you aren't close with, first names for friends, designations for your superiors (Minister/Professor), mister/miss/mrs for everyone else (Weasley elders, teachers addressing students). It seems reasonable for cousins who aren't close to address each other as Cousin
