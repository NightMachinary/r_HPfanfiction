** There was one I read on harrypotterfanfiction or hpfandom called "Run" I believe. Showcased the afterlife and there was a regular (yearly?) competition with various tasks and the winner got to spend a day on earth. The story began after the battle of Hogwarts with the sudden influx of new people. There was also a mystery subplot because not all dead people were arriving there, and there was a miserable prison island where bad people went but at least once they were escorted to watch one of the competition tasks.

*** Yes! Love this fic! Can't recommend it enough; I rarely find good mystery/action fics but this one nails it. The author writes the fic really well, IMO, too. I think I cried at the end, ha.

**** Not really, the Harry Potter Universe isn't the J. K. Rowling Universe.

In the HP Universe, souls definitively exist, and therefore, so does an afterlife. Regardless of what you think is true here, what is true in harry potter is that there is an after the end.

***** You realize this is a discussion on fanfiction and alternate universes happen? I didn't expressly say "better be canon" which means someone could pen "and his eyes closed.

"His next great advemture was as the worms worked his corpse into mulch."

  It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on. Harry is taken before he can make that choice and is thrown in an unexpected afterlife. Now he is on a mission to fight his way back to his own world.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
