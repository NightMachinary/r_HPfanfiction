I am looking for any Harry/Ginny, Harry/Daphne, or a combo one of those pairings. It can also have other people pairing with Harry, Ginny, and/or Daphne, as long as in includes either Daphne and/or Ginny in the pairing as well. I think I've read all of the ones on FanFiction.Net, but am not positive on that, and to be honest if they are really good stories I am not opposed to reading them again, I just want to see if others have found stories I haven't read yet. One last requirement, the story can start before or during Harry's Hogwarts years, but it can't start after, unless it is a continuation of the author's previous fanfic. I also prefer if they were long fics or a series of fics or both. Thanks guys.

*** I've read that once, but I believe it has been awhile. That the one where Harry has a brother, and Sirius has a daughter which joins Harry's group?

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** I write mostly Harry/Ginny. I have several one-shots and some chaptered works, including a 39 chapter adventure. There are a few Ron/Hermoine one-shots in there as well. All of my works exist in a persistent AU that I started after OOTP came out.

I have a Teddy-centric WIP, but everything else is complete. Be advised, adults being adults ahead.
