**** You can't separate the story from the relationship - Harry's character growth is tied into his relationship with Draco, and thus affects his actions and the course of the story.

So you couldn't just cut out the relationship and be left with the same story.

But at the same time there is tonnes of stuff going on beyond that relationship. Harry's relationship with his brother, his parents and Snape are nearly as important as the relationship with Draco. There is lots of mystery, an intricate plot and so much world building it can be hard to keep track. It also has the best cast of OCs that I've seen in any fanfiction - filled with unique and fascinating personalities.

Also worth mentioning the actual smutty scenes have been cut out of the ffn version, but they can be found on the author's own website for anyone interested.

Nonslash, Lucius ends up (semi-grudgingly) working with Dumbledore. The Malfoys are very much Malfoys still, just on Harry's side. 6 years complete, the author recently posted about brainstorming for Y7 on facebook.

Now the Hermione thing, well I can't say much about her due to it reveling some spoilers. /Ron/ however is antagonistic due to Harry being Slytherin but he's not a doormat. Ron gives as good as he gets from the Slytherins and some of the things he does in response gives characterization and development to Harry. It's not bashing for bashing's sake.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
