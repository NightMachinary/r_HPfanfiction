I am looking for crossovers with the Avengers in which Harry is paired with Maria Hill or has a close relationship with her. I have always felt that she is a very interesting character that is overlooked in favor of Natasha. I am not saying Natasha is bad but it has becoming very common to pair Harry with her. So any fic with Maria Hill being a more prominent character and is paired with Harry or has a very close friendship with him.


** ...good luck.

** That.. is probably going to be a tough find. It doesn't help that most Harry Potter - Avenger crossovers are either abandoned, one-shots or unreadable due to too much grandstanding. Heck, I can only remember one fic that even has her as a character, and even that is largely minor.

Ps. I will say to those interested that Heroes Assemble! By Stargon1 is probably the best crossover in this genre I've come across. Also has some pretty interesting ships that I wouldn't have expected to enjoy as much as I do.

*** Loved Heroes Assemble! but it got so boring and repetitive around chapter 70 that I stopped following it. Maybe I will give it another chance if it ever gets finished. Luckily "Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe" came around to fill the void as far as HP/Avengers crossovers go. Enjoying it a lot and so far it is making much better use of what a wizard could do when thrown into the Marvel universe. Honorable mention is "A third Path to the future", a guilty pleasure fic for me and probably not for everybody as Harry is approaching godlike power levels. But somehow the author still managed to keep it interesting for 1.8 million words :D

**** I'm still enjoying it, but that may be because I'm mostly a DC comics fan, and most of my Marvel knowledge comes from the MCU. This story allows me to learn more about the other parts of Marvel, and let's be honest - there aren't a lot of good crossovers that merges the worlds nicely. I'll check out those other to you mentioned, and also recommend Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest; it's more of a 'alternate dimension' crossover rather than a dimension where both the magical world and Marvel world coexist. Pretty good, although it's been 4 years since an update.

***** Then "A Third Path to the Future" should be interesting to you too. Many rarely used Marvel characters are sometimes heavily featured throughout the story and the MCU is really not close to being the main focus.

"Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe" on the other hand has the MCU as a focus, but done so totally different than other crossovers that I am loving the crap out of it. It is hard to explain why its different, you just have to try it for yourself. And it gets updated every few days too!

And yea, Wand and Shield was I think the first marvel crossover I read but as you said, it is probably abandoned forever :/

****** I tentatively still hold out hope for Wand and Shield since the author is still updating some of his other stories.. maybe just a creative break?

Also, kind of hate you for telling me about Third Path To The Future. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty great how it focuses more on the X-men and other minor teams (F4, Inhumans) and I like how Post-Apocalyptic Potter has him willingly join up as a Shield agent, rather than almost coincidentally falling in with the Avengers.. both are pretty new takes on HP-Marvel crossovers. No, I hate you because I can't stop binge reading them and I'm in the middle of final exams!

******* Ah, I know that problem, I had plenty evenings spent on reading fanfiction instead of learning for university exams... I would say set yourself the limit of finishing Post-Apocalyptic and leave Third Path for after the finals. 400k words is less time "wasted" than 1.8m :D

******** No no you misunderstand, I was writing an exam TODAY.. so naturally I finished Post-Apocalyptic Potter and then read to about chapter 15 of Third Path To The Future. They are damn good fics though.

****** Got a link for "P-APfaPU"? (I really wanted to see that acronym)

I loved Heroes Assemble and Third Path to the Future.

Damaged Defenders was another great MCU fic, but there was no HP crossover in that one if memory serves.
