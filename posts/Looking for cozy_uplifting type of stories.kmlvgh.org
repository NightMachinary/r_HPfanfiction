Just a good vibe feeling.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/threesomes etc

NO! Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion etc.

** /Faith and Understanding/ is one of my very favorites. It's Ginny and Luna's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Link]]

As a final note, it has my favorite passage from any /Harry Potter/ fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  “Luna, who's your favorite person?”

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  “You are.”

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely---nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is a nice slice-of-life with Harry and Ginny and their children moving into a new neighbourhood in the countryside, told largely from the point of view of one of their non-magical neighbours (whose children attend the same school). The author has a bunch of short stories, too, set in the same world, some of them a bit more dramatic but many just fluffy.

For a bit more angst, yet still strong themes of Harry having emotional support that he didn't in canon, I quite like The Meaning of One: linksiye([[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833&textsize=0&chapter=1]]). I was a little dubious at first about the soul-bond angle, which seemed initially to be a bit saccharine, but the story turned out to do a really excellent job of exploring each of the characters' reactions to what's happened. The characters are fleshed out with both strengths and weaknesses, no one-dimensionality here (well, maybe Draco, but he's a minor character). There's tension in the Weasley household with Ginny being basically married at age ten, and it causes conflict, but it's not bashing; no-one is present just to blame everything on, they all have understandable (if sometimes flawed) motivations.

Edit: The bot isn't working properly for Meaning of One; you can just ignore it and use the link.
