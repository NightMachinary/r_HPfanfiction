I like to read it on my phone, and when people ask what I'm reading I never really tell them. Cause, come on. Reading this sounds ultra gay, lets be real. Do you tell people? What were the reactions?


** I will take the secret to my grave being into FF instantly marks you as a teenage girl or a raging pervert (possibly both).

Honestly FF is its own worst enemy in this regard seeing as most of it is a poorly writen attempt to sleep with the characters through writing usualy slash or severus snape (or again possibly both).

edit just thought of an analogy it's kind of like being overwieght and into anime only worse (disclaimer not into anime)

** Oh yes, I'll talk about a good piece of fanfiction like I would a good book. I've actually met a surprising number of other people who also read fanfiction that way! It's a great thing to bond over, especially when you can say you know the person who wrote a particular story.

Both my parents also know that I like to write fanfiction, and I've shown my mum my stories because she's interested. She's always been super enthused about reading them.

So the OP asked how do people react when I mention fanfiction? Honestly, the worst is just a 'huh' and it's ignored. The best reaction was mentioning it to a colleague whom I worked closely with and finding out that he reads fanfiction too! We nerded out over Game of Champions by Lamora, and from then on at work I had a buddy I could talk about good stories with.

Usually, people just seem interested in the novel conversation topic, and ask some questions about it. It's easy to see who has tried it before - the ones with the strongest negative reactions are really going to be people who have tried it and never found a good story. Then you can laugh with them about the hordes of bad stories out there and explain how the bad is godawful, but the good is /amazing/.

I used to feel like it was something to be embarrassed about, when I was younger! But why should that be the case? There's a lot of stories out there that are absolute gems, enthralling or poignant and so very worth the time to read. I trust in my own tastes enough to think that whoever I'm talking to would agree with me, if they were to read the story themselves. So how could I be ashamed of that?

Ultimately, fanfiction's been a huge part of my life for eight years now - and I've met many of the best friends you could hope to have through it. So, yes - I talk to people about it. If my opinion can encourage anyone else to try it, that's a plus in my book.

** I'm in graduate school to be a mental health professional, so everyone in my cohort is super validating and supportive. I don't go super into it, but if they ask, I answer. Everybody's got their thing: some people play fantasy football, some rewatch Gilmore Girls for the umpteenth time...me, I read and write fanfiction. I think it's pretty well known that there are higher caliber fanfictions out there, especially in the Harry Potter universe. There are quite a few published authors who readily admit that they started out as fanfiction authors...and I'm not just talking about Fifty Shades of Gray. I like to use Naomi Novak as an example. I want to actually publish something some day, so if people ask me what I'm writing, I usually say something along the lines of: "Oh, just a story based off of Harry Potter. I'm waiting for the perfect story to come along, but until then, I just write fanfiction. That way I can practice writing and still have fun." Most of my friends think it's a pretty cool hobby, and if they don't like it, they've never said anything to me.
