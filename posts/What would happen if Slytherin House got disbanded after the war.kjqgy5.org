  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** The idea that children can be irredeemably evil at the age of 11 and just written off with no prospect of rehabilitation gets reinforced in the minds of all the supposed "light" characters.

Children who would have preferred to go into Slytherin end up in other houses, and each remaining house suffers as people speculate who are the "slytherins" in their house.

The sorting ceremony has to be overhauled as the hat refuses to co-operate with revisionism that excises one of the founders from history, and undermines the goal of inter-house school unity.
