Dark magic, wandless magic, anything really.


** With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat. HEAVY emphasis on ritual and runic Magics. Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys and is picked up by street rats headed by a muggle that knows about magic and has been looking for a muggleborn to get a man on the inside of the magic community. The Magic in question is the ritualistic carving of runes upon the body under different celestial bodies for permanent magical effects depending on the runes used. 11/10 one of the only fics I've read that really goes into ritual magic I love it 719k words and 38 chapters

** A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold first installment is 251k words in 35 chapters. After a failed assassination Harry realizes he's thoroughly fucked if he has to fight Voldemort as he is and happens upon a brochure for a secondary school Magical Briton has tried to stamp all knowledge of out because of its harsh and dark nature. He learns about blood magic and eventually necromancy and soul magic. It goes in depth about Vampire culture as he befriends a few and learns from the original blood magic user/creator one of if not the oldest Vampire still alive. Everyone at the school is exceptional or they die there is no dropping out and even getting admitted is a trial in of it self. 9/10 wonderful Fic only reason it's a 9 is because the last of the trilogy hasn't been updated since ‚Äò09 nor has the author still highly enjoyable though.

** Mistakes and Second Chances by lisbeth00 399k words in 55 chapters. FemHarry falls through the Veil of Death and gets sent back in time because Death doesn't want to do paperwork because of his technical death he gains an affinity for Necromancy and Blood Magic, Dark and Grotesque not necessarily Evil. Not much else to say without spoilers but it is Harry/Fleur.

** Fair Lady by kideaxl it's just shy of 100k words Harry doesn't use ‚Äústandard‚Äù magic much at all used through a book he was given. It is a crossover with Neil Gaiman's Sandman though the emphasis is mostly on his interactions with his love of magic and his own spells mostly as a plot device. All in all I do recommend it highly it was a good read and doesn't require any knowledge of Sandman or its characters.
