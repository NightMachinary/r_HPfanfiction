It was a dream so things come together a little weird, The plot had something to do with trying to track down an Elixir of Immortality or at least people that have been revived by it at some point. This Elixir and people there being tracked down but a group of monsters called the Tengu.

The Tengu are the rubber suited monsters that the Tokusatsu Superhero have to fight, but these Tengu don't look like the Japanese ones they there covers in black and red thick rubber feathers with their eyes covered by their feather leaving an exposed lower half of the face as they talked they nodded their heads and pantomime because their where rubber suits and that just how they move and talk. Tengu also carried around fan themed weapons.

So in the dream Harry, Ron and Hermione have to fight one of the Tengu monsters in combat and have to do a magical transformation from their normal school uniforms into cooler looking battle uniforms using their wands and a transformation sequence . Basic theme of their battle uniform school blazer open up getting longer tails and a yellow gold trim, and their neck ties turn into large scarfs that hand over their shoulders like little capes. Also because these kind of super heroes have different colors in their theme the three students weren't in the same house of Gryffindor. Harry of course wore the Gryffindor red, Hermione was Ravenclaw blue and Ron was Hufflepuff yellow.

There wasn't much else I gleamed from dream other then Harry, Ron and Hermione where indeed from different house in this version of the would. There was a scene where Hermione was fallowing a strange woman who turns out to a resurrected Harry's mother, who was indeed immortal, as soon after she gets stabbed through the chest by a monster and not just recovered but healed with the wound sealing in moments. Later Ron get mortally wounded and she turn up in the infirmary wearing a disguise of large sunglasses and wide pink hat and scarf and heals him. This makes Ron a target of the Tengu.

When I woke up, I just felt like there was so much potential in this kind of alternative universe, It kind of makes me think of Sailor Moon, where in Sailor Moon they had face a new group of villains each year with the last season everyone graduates high school. Like have the Tengu be like a year one enemy or something. This kind of plot would mix will with them being the ones after the Philosopher's Stone. As for how they get their powers I could their being maybe some kind of artifacts allowing more free flow of magic. I'm note what the power scaling would be, I'd imagine it would take the three powered up kids to fight one Tengu monster, but one to two teachers could fend one of depending on the teachers. then the kids get stronger as they get older and better with magic. By that logic by the time year 7 comes around the power scale and the level of bad guys they have to fight might be nuts.

*Any ideas of what something like this could do and where it could go?*
