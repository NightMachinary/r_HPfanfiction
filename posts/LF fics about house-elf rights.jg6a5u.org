Any fics in which SPEW/House-elf rights is actually taken seriously? Enslavement is not really my cup of tea and the common trope of hous-elves having to survive on a wizard's magic and doing chores being some kind of output of their magic is....kind of stupid to me tbh

Any fics about this would be appreciated, if it is a side-plot next to a pairing or something that's fine too. I prefer slash and femslash, but I'll definitely check out any recommended fics.


** There's linkao3(The Boy Who Lived, The Brightest Witch and The Boy Who Wasn't)

There's a whole subplot about the Elves and what advocating for them will look like. Great worldbuilding. The work-for-magic thing still exists unfortunately, but it does talk about contracts and what it'd take to give them more agency.

  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash. She knew all about it because she asked a lot of questions and her aunt and uncle believed in answering them.Why is the sky blue, auntie? Why are b's and d's like in the mirror? Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) has Harry and Hermione advocate and achieve house elf rights by passing a law that stops abuse, gets them a salary, holidays, pension and the right to leave a job.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** The House-Elf Dilemma - linkao3(24452869)

I just found this fic, and I remembered you! It covers cultural differences and how that relates to advocacies. It also pretty much calls out the White Savior trope, and the world-building is just amazing!

** I dont think so. Cos house elf chose a life of servitude to wizard so much so that they dont understand not having a master and might die due to lack of magic.

The closest i have read is convincing elves to wear proper clothing in a very round about way
