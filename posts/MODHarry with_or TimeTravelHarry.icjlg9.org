Hi guys/girls/and everyone in between.

I've probably read lots of MOD!Harry fanfics now cuz its my favorite tag & stories to read. The thing is that there are a lot others which don't really tell you on the summary what its going to be about so a lot of stories got passed upon as a ‘nah. Not what i want' category.

You guys are great when i see someone ask about recommendations so its time for me to do one too.

Can you guys comment some fics which are tagged (or include) MOD!Harry with/or TimeTravel!Harry?

Thanks for the help!

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable. "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.”At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts an undercover mission to assist in his search for the Hallows. Only, the young wizard finds himself involved in far more dangerous matters than he could have ever imagined.

  Riddle's undivided attention snapped to him with the swiftness of shattering glass. His turbulent magic receded from where it had besieged the shop."You,” he breathed.Coiling in leisurely motions, the eager tendrils of his magic reached for Harry, swathing about his limbs and neck and chest with a liquid, flowing fascination."I've been looking for you,” Riddle continued, tilting his head to the side and sweeping his gaze over Harry. It was an appraisal that felt simultaneously like the raking of iron nails and the tender drapery of silk.It was so familiar, and yet... so foreign.In the winding streets of Knockturn Alley, an intricate dance of mutual obsession unravels between twenty-three-year-old Tom Riddle and a time-travelling Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter is Master of Death and contemplating time travel. Should he prevent Dumbledore's influence, adopt Tom Riddle as soon as he's born, rescue Merope Gaunt, or save his own family? So many possibilities, but he has time to do them all if he chooses to, he is Master of Death after all. Canon through DH, but not epilogue compliant. Pairings HP/MG

So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic.
