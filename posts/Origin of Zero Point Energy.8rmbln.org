Is there a source for magic being zero point energy in HP lore. I have seen it in a ton of fanfiction but not where it may be officially referenced. If not, would be cool to know who came up with the idea that everyone seems to use as a scientific explanation to magic.

Thanks.


** I first saw it in a Stargate Crossover Fic. Sam Carter was doing the whole "Magic is just Science you don't understand" thing and dissected it into having an extra gene that allows you to use a crafted device to manipulate Zero Point Energy.

** Tangential, but I don't know why some would gesture at zero point energy to be the source of magic. I mean, magic can do work (in the physics sense of the word) whereas zero point energy could not (not to a useful level anyway), even if could be harnessed. It's incredibly weak.

*** Even if that is true, every stargate crossover i have seen uses ZPE as the explaination, and i think maybe a few non-crossovers.

**** I know, I've seen it as well. I just think it's weird, heh.
