I just had a thought pop in my head about Molly and the love potion comment. Maybe she was actually talking about a potion that enhances bedroom fun times? She could have been toning down her language because she was talking to teenage girls. Could this "Love Potion" be a Weasley Family secret and the real reason why there are so many Weasleys? :)


** The biggest problem with Molly Weasley and Love Potions is that everybody seems to remember something completely different than what actually is the canon:

#+begin_quote
  [Harry and Weasley boys] headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly. (Chapter 5 of PoA, “The Dementor”)
#+end_quote

That's it. There is nothing more on the topic. We don't know what kind of potion it was, we don't know if she ever used it (and certainly we don't know that she used it on Arthur), we don't know whether she was succesful in making it, we don't even know whether it was some fun concoction she made even before Hogwarts (note that “a young girl” doesn't feel like a Hogwarts-age teenager). We know almost nothing about it.

*** Huh, so it could well be a "look how dumb I was when I was a kid" story. Possibly even in response to Hermione's story of the polyjuice potion brewing. This was, after all, probably the first time Molly could get some more of the details about what happened to Ginny the previous year from other people's perspectives.

**** Yup. I think there are more versions of love potions. Yes, Amorentia is on the top as a rape drug, and it is quite horrible (see linkao3(14164617) for a rather horrific treatment of the matter) to something which Weasley brothers were selling (which I would expect could just persuade a girl to enjoy her date more or something of that kind) to some complete nonsense. I am a bloke so mysteries of young girls' play are still mostly a mystery to me (although, I have a daughter), but I know there are various silly girly games about whether she will find a boyfriend or not via kind-of-divination from flowers and such. Why shouldn't there be in the magical world something similarly silly for young girls?

And yes, that giggling feels more like “we are all idiots sometime” than Amorentia.

***** I read that fic ages ago and it's one of the most heart-rending things I've read in my entire life. It's so true to life- the author got the portrayal of eating disorders spot on. So many people think that EDs are a vanity thing but it's very commonly triggered by sexual assault. It's an incredible story of how rape can literally ruin someone's life in every way possible, from food to friends to academics. It made me cry multiple times but reading it is essential.

**** Hard Disagree considering JK's writing style. Look at the other things JK Rowling litters around and never uses (which incidentally often make great Fan fiction when a writer picks them up.)

-the Accountant Second Cousin -Flying Lessons (mentioned once as part of the curriculum and never again, at all) -the fate of Florean Fortescue -students are allowed cats, toads or owls- why is Ron allowed a rat? Never discussed. (As a kid reading the first two books I genuinely expected that to come up, then I suspected maybe someone at Hogwarts was working with Pettigrew and hiding him from the relevant staff, but it came to nothing)

A few of these are throwaway jokes or devices used once and then once they have been used they are disregarded. I think the love potion story here is both, it explains what the girls were doing (listening to the story and not paying attention to Harry) and it works to show Hermione can interact with women and occasionally talk about silly, funny things instead of always bring intellectual.

**** It didn't have to be the same potion. See above for my other comment: “A little girl” Molly Weasley could brew something silly, just to introduce to the idea of love potions present in the magical world, to be confronted later with Amorentia in the class of Professor Slughorn, and then really used for plot purposes against Ron.

BTW, just thinking about it: we actually don't know what Romilda Vane used. It was pretty awful, but it could be that Amorentia is even worse: really a rape drug in the style “spreading my legs, do it NOW!” like in linkao3(14164617) (all warnings against triggers and such fully apply, it is really a rather rough story).

And since Molly says as a young girl, I doubt it was consensually used as magical viagra.

** I think one thing that seriously taints the fandom's view of love potions is that the two times we know for a fact they were used, it was given deceitfully... once to the wrong person after aging amped it up and once with recurring dosing until the woman was pregnant.

Obviously that sort of use is not acceptable.

But consider consensual use, and not even just as a marital aide:

A bunch of 7th years, all legal adults by Wizarding Law, staying at the castle through their Easter Holiday studying for NEWTS but by Friday night they are burnt out and need to relax. Everyone goes up to an empty class room / a boys dorm if it's just within one house, drinking and dancing and letting off some steam, and at some point the best potions student pulls out a few bottles of mid-grade Love Potion.

"Who's up for spin the bottle?" (turns out the Muggle idea is a shoddy knock off)

Anyone who doesn't want to participate leaves or stays out of the way, and the rest get to have some fun without the pressure of figuring out who to ask.

And perhaps in the late 60's, a certain pair of redheads who everyone knew liked each other got 'matched' this way, resulting in a funny story for their daughter / future daughter-in-law.

Love potions are date rape drugs.

Even the ones in the twins shop. Creating artificial attraction for an hour or two? That's more then enough for such kind of crime. And with the "attraction" they felt before? It would be too easy for themselves and others to blame the victim. And with the 'behind the times' society they seem to have? An easy way to claim/snatch/whatever an more or less unwilling husband/wife. Or just to ruin reputations.

Ron reacts like an idiot to an aged one but considering that, not only did he not rush to the girls bedroom to fuck Romilda, and likely the ageing aspect was not anticipated, the intent of it was more to make the guy act like an idiot rather than as a rape drug (which seems to be thematic to the WWW products). So, yeah, Molly might have made a love potion but it's never specifically mentioned as Amortentia.

** That's almost exactly what I imagined when I wrote a fic to deal with the problematic nature of love potions in the HP universe. In my headcanon, there is a whole array of love potions, lust potions, and bedroom aids, /and/ they are all legal when consensual but it's a criminal offense to give a noncon dose. I've got Hermione on board with them as an intimacy aid, right up until her boyfriend doses her /without telling her/. It makes sense in that context of Harry's perspective having a slight misunderstanding of Molly's real meaning and Hermione's ability to read between the lines. Ron would be similarly positioned as a daft teen boy, seeing Molly and Hermione were giggling over the possibilities and so Ron takes it a step too far. The rest of the fic involves her spending her potions apprenticeship working on a universal theory of love potions and antidotes.

From the final chapter:

#+begin_quote
  It was the day before Valentine's. They had spent their lab time yesterday brewing her new love potion antidote, anticipating the holiday shitshow. Juveniles were not subject to criminal charges for love potions, but a mere warning and a cleared record when they came of age. While in theory this protected minors from being punished too harshly for stupid mistakes, the reality was that most adult offenders had experienced giving or receiving a love potion as a minor. There had to be a better way to prevent the non-consensual use of love potions.

It's supposed to be funny because it's women using it on men. Do it the other way around and it would be a PR nightmare /at best./ The HP fandom would've been tagged as rape culture faster than a firebolt.

** Fanon and canon treat love potions differently.

There's /amortentia/, which is pretty much skeevy on its own given what we know about it. That is most definitely frowned upon, and it's more a /rape/ sort of thing (mind, free-will, et cetera).

But there are a lot of commercial and /weaker/ potions out there that are either easy to brew or are commercially sold (hell, even George and Fred sell them!). This is most likely what Molly was talking about, not some amortentia-type thing that enslaved her future husband (I'm honestly eye-rolling at this).

Weaker love potions, going from what I read in canon, are like giving someone you like chocolates or flowers -- it's treated the same way. It's to say you're showing interest in them.

You act like a dope for an hour or two over the one who slipped you it, and it likely wears off. And you get the biggest clue in your life, heh.

There's also a bit of gender bias there, I think -- it's likely seen as fine if a witch does it to a wizard, but not a wizard to a witch... just like how traditionally a man giving a woman flowers and chocolate is the norm.

If Harry were slipped a weak potion by, say, Katie Bell or Lavender Brown or (more realistically) a girl that he doesn't interact with all that much (maybe a lower year in his House or someone from Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff), his acting dopey for an hour would most likely have him amusing his friends and being ribbed for it... and they tell him after "she likes you, you dope! Are you interested in her? Ask her out!"

If Harry, in this example, acted on this after by asking her out, great! If she doesn't get him coming to her and not asking her out, she knows he's not interested.

However, I can't see Ron doing this to Hermione or vice-versa, for example, because of how close they are already/how much they interact already. Same deal with, say, Angelina and Fred (or was it George?) during their Hogwarts years.

It sounds bizarre, but that's the magical world for you.

****** I suppose you'd have to look at the Magical World as not being a purely British culture/society with adaptations but a subset//cousin/ of it (well, inbred cousin, I suppose) -- kinda like closely-related countries in Europe having similar but also different values.

I daresay we "muggles" have values they find just as strange.

******** The Wizarding World is a bit barbaric in some areas by our standards, yeah. IIRC a lot of values actually seem familiar to what life was like back in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially Azkaban (except the soul-eating demons part) Prison's conditions being much like how our and American prisons were like back then.

******* If you think about it, a lot of things are justified by how 'not serious' they are. Newt Scamander says it himself: "Your [Jacob's] skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force." Hermione's teeth grow fast because of a hex (or jinx?) and are reduced back to what she wished they looked like just as fast, when her dentist parents had never fixed them. The Stinging Jinx makes Harry's face swell, causes him pain and IIRC he can't see either, but it isn't a big deal - it probably that takes a couple hours to wear off and you go back to normal. The only instances Muggles get to look that bad is when we get a beating, for example, and it causes much more damage than looking bad. Hags literally eat children and the narration makes it sound like Harry could take one down at the age of twelve.

This is why quidditch is so brutal, for example. Not only do they have um... backwards principles, but also breaking a bone is almost like scraping your knee. Many physical injuries seem to be easily treatable with magic, even though we Muggles take months to heal. It's only natural their society looks barbaric sometimes. I suppose regular love potions work the same way, they aren't so frowned upon because it's like getting someone tipsy, not drugged. Granted, getting someone tipsy is wrong too, but that's when their backwards beliefs show. They just aren't thaaat backwards as they sound like.

******** Don't forget when Neville's Uncle Algie accidentally dropped him out of a window and he bounced -- I daresay if he hadn't, they'd have been able to treat any injuries with a wave of the wand or a quick potion.

Also, Neville falling from his broom from the height of a small building? Broken wrist because he landed wrong. Probably a quick sip of skelegrow or something to fix it, and he'd be back in class in an hour.

********* Yes, I'm obviously not saying impairing someone's judgement in any way to get together is right, but you mix their backward beliefs with the fact that magic often "turns" brutality (in our perspective) into mild injuries, and it looks like they are barbaric.

I think the best example is that when Filch began working as caretaker, he still was allowed to hang misbehaving students by their ankles as punishment. That's the wizarding equivalent of hitting a student with a ruler. It is wrong indeed, but it isn't as wild as it sounds like when your body is more resistant and you have access to quick and effective ways to heal big injuries.

And you have to take in consideration what they intend to do with a love potion. Wizards could easily rob anyone just by apparating into someone else's house. Not only do they /not/ do it, but they also choose to knock on the door even when they just want to pay a visit. They could stun and rape each other too, but the Stunning Spell seems to only be used in combat. They could literally set people on fire with a spell, but it seems like they only use Incendio to cook and light up a lamp.

A love potion could be a way of making your crush say cheesy stuff to you or act all silly and in love around you. Maybe they intend on getting a kiss too, which is beyond wrong, of course, but not every love potion is used with the intent to rape. Maybe all regular love potions do is making you confess your "feelings" for the other person, maybe it varies according to how much potion you use. The possibilities are endless.

*** Given how Ron used what amounts to a 'pick-up artist' handbook to woo Hermione, I have no problem believing he'd consider a love potion. He was obviously aware that he treated her poorly, given how he relied on a 'how-to' manual to try and seduce her instead of taking an honest look at whether they were a good match (they aren't).

**** Your inner-fanon is showing.

Ron was a dumbass teenage boy. Hermione was a dumbass teenage girl. Teenagers and young adults at that age are dumb when it comes to relationships. But they're still people, not tropey caricatures or pawns for die-hard shippers.

He wasn't trying to "seduce her"... he was trying to get her as his girlfriend. He was taking cues from the book to try and get her interested in him. Heck, if he didn't have the book, he'd likely have asked advice from his older brothers and would've done some dumb shit that the book would have likely paraphrased in some context.

We've all done shit like this as teens/young adults, much to our later embarrassment (some of the shit I did as a teen/guy in my early twenties makes me wince now on reminiscing).

But, personally? While I could see Ron taking dumbass cues from books or older wizards trying to advise him (e.g. his brothers again), I can't see him using a potion in the context of my original post because of the individual dynamic he and Hermione have.

If he didn't know her that well e.g. she was Harry's friend and not his instead of their being close friends together, then sure, he might have tried it.

Could it have worked? Yeah, it might have given Hermione a huge flag that Ron likes her like she does him deep down. But, it's also likely that her reaction as an /individual/ would like likely be anger, despite her apparent views on them (e.g. giggling while Molly was talking about her own shenanigans). Because it's /Hermione/, and not that girl in another class that you vaguely know and have no idea beyond "wow, she's pretty".

Ya gotta think of individual reactions and relationships then a cookie-cutter reaction for every character out there.

heck, I could see a younger Ginny trying this -- nothing insidious as in a typically shitty Indie-Harry story, but a young girl trying to get her crush to notice her with a harmless effect for an hour or two.

***** No see buddy what I think your forgetting is that ron is literally Satan you might just be remembering Canon wrong and might not have noticed but its obvious he's literally Satan and regularly tried to make sure harry tortured atleast 3 puppies and raped 3 babies per week /at least/ now I understand what you ron lovers are like always "forgetting" that time he said he wanted to love potion Hermione and rape her but the proof is in the books he is Satan and here's why

Book 1 he sacrifices himself in the chess game you wanna know why he knew getting hit by a stone object twice your size getting send flying into a wall and hitting your head wasn't that much an injury and he was obviously faking being unconscious he also had to get that voldermort fellow out of the way cant have other evildoers out there killing all the babies before him after all

Book 1 again making Hermione cry he set her up from the damn beginning he was playing 4d chess from the very beginning and onky one bo- sorry Lord can stop him Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend of the goblin nation" only he an 11 year old who learned about magic 3 months ago was competent enough enough to beat it not the war veterans not dumbolddork or dumb old coger no it was Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend of the goblin nation"

Book 2 that bitch ginny tried to love Potion him but with the power of his soul mate the godes- i mean Hermione he realized and was able to stop the bad weasley bitch

Book 3 ron clearly set up ctooshanks and scabber situation and was somehow involved in sirius being arrested

4 satanic ritual accomplished mortal form shed ron is now free to rein terror upon the world but Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend if the goblin nation CAN stop him

5 rinse and repeat until book 7

6 now I know what you dumb ron lovers are gonna say "thats not what happened in Canon ron never ever did that and was a loyal friend" well your misremembering you filthy fanon readers

**** The worst you can do with a book like this is lying to your teeth and pretending to be someone you're not. This is different than taking away someone's free will, which is what I believe you're implying. Ron can be a dick sometimes, and Hermione too to be honest, but I don't think any of them would just try and rape each other.
