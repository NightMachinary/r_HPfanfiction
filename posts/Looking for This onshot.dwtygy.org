:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for this one shot that i read a long time ago that i don't really remember.

â€‹

It had Harry and Draco as Auror partners, they were really good at it, and the title of the fic was this sentence that was exchanged by them a lot

Something like i hate you potter, not really sure, but it was decent length, and it was non slash


** i wish to know this as well, i think i read it awhile back but can't remember it either

** It could be the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5190766/1/The-Elite][The Elite]], a one-shot from 2009 that has Draco and Harry as partners. The phrase "I hate you" is exchanged several times between the two of them. It could just be a similar concept as this fic is only 10k word and gets it's title from the last paragraph.

  Why did Harry Potter nod in greeting to Draco Malfoy when he saw the man on the platform 19 years later? Ron and Hermione were clearly not on such terms with the man. What secret did the two men share from even their own families?
