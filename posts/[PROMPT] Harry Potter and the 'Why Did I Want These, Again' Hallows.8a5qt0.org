Write a short scene where Harry gains mastery of the Deathly Hallows - but he's a Squib and none of the magic works for him.

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Shortish Scene, 200+ words long
- Harry is a Squib
- Harry gains mastery over the Deathly Hallows

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- Harry uses them to kill Voldemort anyway
- Harry sassing the Three Brothers story
- Hermione questioning everything she stands for
- somehow working a solidly non-OOC Luna Lovegood into the whole mess


** Harry stared at the thirteen-inch long stick of Elder wood that lay in his hand in complete disbelief. He was the Wielder of the Deathly Hallows, Master of Death, but the stick wouldn't even shoot a /single bloody spark!/

/Surely/ domination over one of the Aspects of Reality would grant at least a modicum of magical ability? But /no/, the Elder Wand sat like a dead fish in his hand. A /dead fish/. How does a stick of wood even /feel/ like a Merlin-Forsaken dead /fish/?

He heard footsteps behind him.

"Ah, so you have beaten me to the Elder Wand, /Harry/. A treasure you could never hope to use, of course."

Harry snorted. "Go eat a dick, Tom."

Voldemort gave a high, cold laugh. "I should kill you for that."

"Sorry that you'll have to add 'disrespect' to the end of your 'reasons to kill Potter' list I'm sure is lying around somewhere."

"/Enough!/ Let us duel. May the best wizard win - ah, wait, you /aren't one./ What a shame. /Avada Kedavra./"

Harry stepped to the side of the green jet of light, before blinking at the wand in his hand. /'Never lose a fight, eh? Time to test that out.'/

Harry raised the wand and carefully took aim, dodging the bright green spells ricocheting across the room. He took a deep, deep breath and shouted the word that would change everyone's lives irrevocably.

"YEEEEEEET!"

The stick of Elder soared through the air, before striking the Dark Lord directly in the eye socket. It penetrated all the way into the once-man's head, somehow severing the spinal cord at the base of the brain.

Harry stared at the motionless Voldemort lying on the floor in front of him. A light, ethereal voice spoke into his ear, startling him.

"A wand in the eye socket is worth two in the hand. At least, that's what my mother used to tell me."

"Luna, I don't think that's how the saying goes."

Wide, silver eyes blinked at him. "I don't see why not."

** The cloak wouldn't hide him, the stone wouldn't raise the dead for him, so why is he so hurt that even Death's wand won't work for him. Ask him and he would tell you that no, he wasn't tearing up, the sun was in his eyes and it was dusty and he had just stubbed his toe, so shut up thank you very much. There was a slow, mocking clap.

"Impressive Harry, truely. The Chosen One is truely a wizard to be feared."

"I can still do magic with this wand, want to see?"

"Please, dazzle us with your skills."

Harry beckoned Voldemort to come closer. "You are going to want to be close to see this spell." He approached, confident that there was nothing the Squib-Who-Lived could do to harm him.

"I am going to make this wand disappear. Ready? On three. One. Two. Three!" Harry jammed the wand up under Voldemort's chin into his skull. "Tada!" Harry exclaimed, complete with jazz hands, as Voldemort dropped to the floor.

Hermione stared on in a mixture of wonder and horror. "You just killed Voldemort."

"Yup!"

"Worst Dark Lord in living memory Voldemort."

"Sounds right."

"You killed him by copying a scene from a movie!"

"And you said they would rot my brain! Hah!"

Hermione sat down as she tried to process what had just occurred.

*** Hours later, Hermione slowly pulled out her 'Magical Artefacts' notebook and opened it to the 'Deathly Hallows' page. She touched the page at the 'Elder Wand' header and dragged her finger down, stopping about halfway down the page. She pulled her quill from her bag and wrote a small, shaky checkmark next to the entry 'wins every duel.'

** "It's over, Voldemort," Harry said, "I am the Master of Death."

"Master?" Voldemort laughed, "You may be the rightful wielder of the wand, but you cannot cast a single spell with it. The stone? Will you set powerless shades against me? The cloak? I suppose you can hide... while I conquer the world unhindered. As 'Master of Death', you're a joke."

"NEVERTHELESS"

"Who said that?" Voldemort asked, startled.

Death was surprised. Most people had little difficulty recognizing a seven foot skeleton wielding a scythe.

"GUESS"

"You cannot touch me, Death. There are rules."

"THERE ARE RULES," Death agreed, "AND I AM NOTHING IF NOT DUTIFUL. STILL, YOU HAVE CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY FOR ME, TOM"

"That is not my name."

"AH. THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THIS." Death drew a pair of lifetimers out of his robe. They were connected by a faint blue cord. One was ordinary in shape, labeled "Tom Marvolo Riddle" and completely devoid of sand. The other read "Lord Voldemort" and had glass warped in dimensions human eyes were not built to perceive.

"That," Voldemort said, pointing to the Riddle lifetimer, "has nothing to do with me."

"SHALL I SEVER THE CORD, THEN?"

"Yes! Sever it. Let there be /nothing/ of my filthy muggle father in me."

Death slashed the cord with his scythe. It parted easily.

A moment later, Voldemort fell to the ground. He tried to ask a question, but only incoherent noises came out. Nevertheless, Death understood.

"IT WAS TOM WHO KNEW HOW TO STAND UP. BIPEDAL MOTION IS DIFFICULT. LIKEWISE, IT WAS TOM WHO KNEW HOW TO TALK. AND HOW TO EAT.

"AND HOW TO LEARN THOSE THINGS.

"I'M AFRAID THESE NEXT FEW CENTURIES ARE GOING TO BE RATHER UNPLEASANT FOR YOU. I WOULD END YOUR SUFFERING, BUT THERE ARE RULES."

** Harry was honestly starting to wish that senile wizard had left him being a +relatively+ normal person living his life in London, instead of what they called a squib with a megalomaniac terrorist after him. /So I have this cloak, a ring and a stick... and I can't use any of these like they're meant to be.../

"Congratulations, Potter, it looks like you've become the so called /Master of Death/." The snake faced man drawled as he drew his other, original wand. "Are you prepared to meet your /servant/, young squib?"

Harry looked up at the madman, looked back at the items in his hands, looked at all the other people around them, some holding their breath, others rooting for one or the other, and some already losing hope, then back at the madman.

"You know what, sure." He shrugged.

The red eyes actually blinked a bit in surprise while everyone else gasped. "Very well. At least you're not trying to draw this out. AVADA--!!!"

And that was as far as he got. Thanks to the last few months of pitching pebbles at the birds outside his apartment, Harry fast balled the ring decorated with a large stone right into the man's open mouth, upon which he started choking. Not wasting any time, the young man sprinted forward, kicked him to the ground, wrapped the cloak around the bald man's neck even as the bony fingers clawed at the blocked throat, and tied a quick noose, pulling it tighter the more the two struggled.

He saw the yew stick start to point at him, but was having none of that baton waving anymore. Freeing one hand, he hastily grabbed the beaded stick the senile wizard had been so on about, and used it to swat the other man's stick away, with an added wack to the hand to help loosen the grip enough to drop it.

Finally, Harry grabbed the cloak with both hands again, even as the madman was on his last breath, and yanked, causing a crack to sound before the "Most Terrible Dark Lord in Living Memory" went completely limp and the roving, bulging red eyes went eerily still.

After a long period of silence, the bushy haired brunette that had helped him for the past few weeks after the senile guy died, managed to speak everyone's mind, as he started to untie the clock from the corpse's neck.

"You just killed the Dark Lord with the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility... and you barely even used the Elder Wand..."

"Yup, now could you help me cut open the throat? I'd like to not find out that hunk of jewelry can do /exactly what it says on the tin/ while it's in this bloke."

** Okay I went over 200 words.... a lot over haha.

I actually couldn't fit it into the 10,000 character limit for this text box, I actually... wrote *3,668* words.... sooooo I uploaded it into WattPad:

[[https://www.wattpad.com/557868751-master-of-death-why-did-i-want-these-again]]

Hope I satisfied the more serious tones of the challenge as I see a couple people have explored the more humorous tones.

feedback?

EDIT:

*This is either going to be a case of the student doing 18 pages when he was assigned one, and getting an A+, or the case where the teacher fails him for not conforming to the requirements.*

Haha, I just finished proofreading it right now, so no more spelling errors or huge grammar issues.

** He stared down at the wand, the ring and the cloak with confusion. "Run that by me again?"

The bushy-haired girl shrugged. "Apparently, your mother assembled all of them and became the Mistress of Death before dying. She left them to you in her will."

"Cool." Harry said, deciding to drop the whole 'giving his mother Lovecraftian titles for no obvious reason' thing for now. He eyed the cloak and put it around his neck. "And what do they do? I mean, no offense, but this tatty old thing would not have made it into the bargain bin at an antiquities fair. And the less said about the rock and the fancy stick, the better."

"That's the thing. They're immensely powerful magical artefacts and you're, well, a squib." The girl said with a shrug. "It doesn't really do anything for you."

Okay, magical super-artefacts that look like they came out of a bin, check. Magic he can't use, check.

Now, what the hell was the deal here?

Maybe he should ask the weirdos in the corner.

"And the Death Metal album cover posse over there?" He asked, pointing to the Snake Man, the middle-aged depressed Goth with glowing stains speckled over his clothing and the woman who looks like she'd just wandered out of the local lunatic's asylum to attend a seminar on making serial killings fun for everyone involved, victims included.

The girl palmed her face. "They're Death Eaters-"

"Never heard of them. Are they a new band?" Harry asked. "Only, I've got this mate, Trev, he's very into avant-garde metal these days and works for a records company, so if you hook him up with an EP-"

"Ssssilence." The snakey-looking fellow growled. "We are here to take these itemsss from you. Ssssurrender them to me willingly or die." He threatened.

"Wait, seriously?" Harry asked as the bushy-haired girl surreptitiously put some distance and solid-looking furniture between herself and the funnily dressed carnival escapees. "Oh wait, I get it! This is a LARPing thing, right? He asked, smacking his forehead and feeling quite silly. "I'd forgotten that was this week! You know what, since you asked so nicely, here, you can have the op shop rejects." He said, folding the ring and the wand into the cloak.

"Wait, what?" The girl said with bulging eyes. "No, they're evil!"

"Wow, great dedication to your role there." Harry congratulated her as he handed the bundle to the befuddled snake man. "You even got the panicky desperation down perfectly."

"They're evil and want to kill me and you just hand them the Deathly Hallows?" She shrieked.

"Well yeah, it's a fetch quest right? Oh man, I can't wait to see you guys at the ren faire!" He exclaimed. "Hey snake man, if Dudley turns up as a bard again, beat the shit out of him for me please. Tell him his cousin sent you."

"That's the Dark Lord you insolent brat! You're as bad as your father!" The goth guy shouted.

"I'm better at driving than he ever was." Harry said with a grin. "Still alive, see?"

"Continue mouthing off to the Dark Lord and that shall be rectified." Goth guy said with a sneer.

"... You wouldn't happen to be related to Alan Rickman, wouldn't you?" Harry asked. "Only, you're doing a great job acting like him."

"Alan Who?" The Goth guy asked.

"Never mind." The bushy-haired girl said in resignation. "As for you, you are the perfect example as to why it doesn't pay to meet your heroes." She said with venom. "You're the Boy Who Lived, for Merlin's sake, how could you hand over the extremely powerful artefacts to the man that murdered your parents?"

"Hey, getting a bit personal in your acting there. Cars don't murder people, people murder people." Harry muttered. "Look, if you were expecting me to go on a LARP unprepared, then you really should have done more than just walk up to me and hand the thingummies to me. I mean I won't say no to a session with you guys if only so that I can get the name of your group's makeup artist, but you really have to tell people what you're playing before starting to play."

"Uggh!" She said, raising her hands above her head. "I give up!" She shouted.

"Uggh!" The Snake Man went, clutching his head and moaning. "Make it stop! Make it-"

The Snake Man's head exploded.

As did the heads of his two companions.

Harry started to scream until the bushy-haired girl shot him with a red beam, sending him to sleep.

Looking between the Boy-Who-Lived and the dead Death Eaters, Hermione shrugged and helped herself to the Deathly Hallows. Honestly, how a man that had feared the touch of Death his entire life had talked himself into uniting the Deathly Hallows she would never know.

And now the owner had given away the Hallows, the new owner was without a brain and the Hallows weren't bound to anyone in particular. She was sure she could find a good use for them... after she got the hell out of dodge.

"Oi, what happened here-" A voice said from behind her before gasping. "You! What have you done to these poor people!" The voice shouted.

Hermione turned around. Oh joy, an auror. And there she was, standing in front of three corpses and a stunned squib.

"You are under arrest! Drop your weapon immediately young lady!"

She'd worked hard to get through Hogwarts intact. She'd worked hard to secure a job and carve out a life for herself in the wizarding world. She'd fought hard to keep the Death Eaters off her lawn and dispose of the bodies without giving the Ministry any reason to want to lock her up in Azkaban. It had been a bitter slog since she'd entered the Wizarding World close to a decade ago.

And now she was about to be sent to magic prison hell for playing courier because the executor of Dumbledore's estate had asked her nicely through the magic of blackmail.

She looked down at the Elder Wand humming in her hand. She looked up at the terrified-looking Auror in front of her. She looked at Voldemort's corpse cooling not ten feet away from her.

"I said drop it!" The Auror's voice said with a warble.

Fuck it. There was a vacancy for the position of Dark Lord/Lady that had just opened up for all comers.

Being partially responsible for killing the previous incumbent wouldn't hurt her chances.

A twitch of the wand and the Auror was fast asleep before he'd even noticed her move.

Now, to find out what a successful Dark Lord was supposed to actually /do/.

It's not like her predecessor was any help in that regard.
