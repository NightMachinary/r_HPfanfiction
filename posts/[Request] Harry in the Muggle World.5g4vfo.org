I'm looking for fics where Harry spends time in the Muggle world. I prefer pre-Hogwarts and during Hogwarts stories. Making friends with them, dating, joining a gang, learning martial arts from the local master, I don't care. As long as it has him spending more time with Muggles than he does in canon.

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.

** Harry Potter and the Wizarding World is the best fic I've seen that makes Harry's pre-Hogwarts experience of Muggles a major plot point.
