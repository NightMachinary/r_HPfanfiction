E: Oh great, the transphobes are here. Piss off if you don't like the request, don't come in here and flood us with downvotes for /daring/ to discuss a form of fiction we like on a fiction sub!

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

** Yes, you can find some here [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Trans%20Harry%20Potter/works]]

Also, I read this one that has a lot of fanon cliches but somehow managed to be an enjoyable read anyway, call it a guilty pleasure: linkao3(24707731)

Also there is this one that I think is good even though it is arguably a bit too mopey: linkffn(11862560)

  A look at how things could have gone if people were human, adults were adults, and if Harry ended up in an actually supportive environment when he got to Hogwarts.Also, Harry becomes a girl, because fuck you JK.Pairings are eventual, I plan to take this clear through 7th year.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** I never thought that I would enjoy a trans Harry Potter story until this one but I guess that's the thing about unconscious biases. I hope you give it a try its a MOD Twilight crossover fanfic

Another Life, Another Love, Another---oh, whatever AverageFish

Summary: On her first day in Forks, Izzy Swan walks into Carlisle's office asking him to be her shrink. On her second day at school, Edward realises she smells of lightning---and that she's crazy, because no, no he does not have an identical twin called Cedric. Watch events unfold for two people who have better things to do---but fall in love anyway. A humorous odd love story that vaguely follows (parodies) canon, from the perspective of Carlisle Cullen. Mild swearing. Very little angst. Edward being creepy. Surprisingly healthy relationships. Teenagers. A gay/trans relationship. Oh, and MOD!Harry, in a rebirth cycle, as a girl (Not Fem!Harry). While Izzy is a trans character it's not central to this fic. There's no angst, either.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."
