Been looking for this fic for a long time. Harry ends up being adopted by Snape, who ends up adopting Draco as well. A scene I remember vividly is Harry losing his ability to cast spells using latin, and finds out the only way he can cast is using Parstletongue. He discovers this while searching for his pet snake and trying to cast Lumos, it's super powerful and almost destroys Snapes quarters. Please fanfic fans, help me find this amazing story!

***** I too read this years ago, and it's been one of my favorites of all time. I like to go back and read it every few years, but I lost it when my last computer crashed.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
