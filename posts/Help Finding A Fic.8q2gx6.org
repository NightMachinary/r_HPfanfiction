Sooooo, a while back I read a story (H/HR) but I can't remember all of the details for it. There are only two scenarios though.

1. Harry had just completed the 3rd task, had talked to Dumbledore and had been "comforted" by Hermione. Ron saw them in the morning but said nothing. Harry didn't seem to remember the night in question and Hermione never brought it up, she just continued to be the steadfast friend that she always is. They end up together much later in the story as parts of the truth come out.

Or

1. Harry had just come from Dumbledore's office after the Ministry of Magic and Hermione "comforted" him. The rest is the same as above.

Most of me believes it to be scenario #1. Any help would be appreciated!!!!!!!
