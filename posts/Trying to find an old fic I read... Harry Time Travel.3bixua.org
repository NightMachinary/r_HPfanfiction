I've looked in all the fanfiction.net communities for time travel and I couldn't find it. Not sure how I ran across it other than that it was on FanFiction.net.

The premise is that Harry is in the DMLE after the war (DH compliant) and one day he receives a letter from the late Severus Snape which throws him back in time. Mid way through the year it becomes apparent that Draco had also been sent back as well.

Draco and Harry aren't friends, but they do get a rivalry going. The story goes from first year right through to the third challenge in the Triwizard Tournament, before it was abandoned.

Does anyone know what this one was called, or could you link it? It was a great read.


** This sounds interesting, if you find it would you send me a message please?

*** Nope the first chapter deals with him as an adult, talking about him in the DMLE, and then receiving a letter from Snape. Boom he wakes up as an 11 year old. It's longer and better written than my summary, but it has those key points.

** Er....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2519321/20/Harry-Potter-and-the-power-the-Dark-Lord-knows-not][Harry Potter and the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not]] involves Harry getting sent back via a letter from Snape, but it only goes from third year to the first task, and I don't think (although I may be mistaken) that Draco was sent back.

I really don't know any fanfics that fit all the criteria. I'm sorry.

** I know I've read this, and it is in on my alerts list. Any clue when it was abandoned, so I can try to find it?

Its one where Harry wanted to improve the time line, Draco wanted to keep it the same, but they drifted closer as friends due to no one else being their age while being their apparent age.
