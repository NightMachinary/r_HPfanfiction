** Haven't read that one, but sounds a little obscure so not sure you'll get a lot of responses from anyone who has. So take this one with a grain of salt, but sounds like you might like Prince of the Dark Kingdom. AU if Voldemort had won the first war. Lots of amazing worldbuilding, especially around werewolf communities, and a bit of vampire communities in there too. Long af and abandoned right before the end it seems, but really amazing for the ride.
