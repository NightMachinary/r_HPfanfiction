** That part just blew me away:

#+begin_quote
  The memory grew brighter. “Professor Slughorn,” Hermione asked brightly, “What if someone wanted to split his wealth into multiple offshore accounts? Say...seven?

  “Good heavens, seven?”

  “Well, isn't seven considered a magically significant number?”

  “Merline's beard, girl! Isn't it bad enough to consider doing it once? To dodge their tax bill seven times...This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Hermione? All academic?”

  “Of course, sir,” Hermione said, smiling. “It'll be our little secret.”

  Inside Hermione's library was a book Ron knew without being asked he was never to be allowed to read. It was an old edition of Treasure Island. It was not by Robert Louis Stevenson.

***** Oh right, yeah. Accounts are free and easy to make, though, and it's a pretty cool site, so you might as well sign up. I first found it when I made an account in order to read a Star Wars fanfic posted on there.

***** It's a huge leak (at least to the uninformed public, offshore tax evasion by the rich is nothing new), but definitely not the most significant and the way things are going, nothing will be changing. The deteriorating environment and ecosystems of the world will be, by far, the most significant news of this century.

****** Right now, only capital is globalized, governments are slowly moving into that direction, and labor is hopelessly stuck in the 20th century national mindset.

As long as this condition persists, people and businesses will keep playing the capital, labor, and tax arbitrage games.
