I honestly think it would be just hilarious if Harry ended up with a soulmate who couldn't be attracted to him, such as a lesbian or a straight man. Him trying to figure out how to become friends and share a life together in a not so traditional sense. No such romance tied into it, just someone to be there for him, but in typical Harry-ness he's baffled.


** This story covers various types of relationships soulmates can have (or not have).

  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?
