Does it bother you as a reader when characters (barring old purebloods like the Malfoys and Weasleys) wear muggle clothing? Do you not mind it? Do you even prefer it?

In terms of canon, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it mention specifically that Wizarding children usually wear muggle clothes? I think I remember reading that but I'm not sure. When it comes to adults then, does everyone wear robes?

The movies have really addled my mind when it comes to clothing, so I thought it would be interesting to discuss. I personally don't mind when characters like Harry or Hermione who aren't purebloods wear muggle clothes in fanfiction. How does everyone else feel about it?


** I'm fine with it when it makes sense. Ginny and the trio wearing muggle clothing when driving the kids to King's Cross? Perfectly fine. Doing the same for Harry when he goes to work at the Auror office? Probably not.

** I don't recall canon saying that magical children wear Muggle clothing, and to me that wouldn't make much sense- if (many) pureblood adults can't do it properly, how would they show their children how to?

The way I see it, magical people who haven't been surrounded by Muggle fashion aren't going to dress in Muggle clothing (and certainly not well). If, however, they have been, then they might adopt it. Half-bloods, muggle borns, purebloods that have dealings in the Muggle world (and are also more open minded), purebloods with half blood/muggleborn friends.

The robes can be fancy or plain, but we get a silly scene in GoF regarding muggle dress for a reason, and it's pointed out in PS that they look /odd/ out in public.

(This would also explain Molly making sweaters/jumpers for her kids. Arthur's relatively obsessed with muggles, and sweaters are relatively easy to make, possibly even more so w/ magic (it's three tubes pretty much).)

...jumpers have been a clothing staple in Western Europe and the British Isles in particular for centuries. They're tradition.

It's almost as if the wizarding world is just a subculture and not another planet entirely

**** But I'm talking about a subset of people who go out of their way to distance themselves from the Muggle side of their history. Electric power had been a thing in most homes for most of the last century (and known about for far longer), yet we get purebloods who can't pronounce electricity or telephone.

Even though they're all required to try and blend in with muggles according to the statute of secrecy, they go out of their way to not do so. Pants stifle magic use, wearing deliberately inappropriate garb. This comes from the Pottermore article on clothing.

My point was that the Weasleys are comfortable with the idea of Muggle culture, even if they don't fit in with it. The convenience it provides compared to an outdated fashion sense, and the relative ease of providing clothing that would easily comply with the requirements for their children.

***** The wizarding world has been separate from the Muggle since the late seventeenth century, which is when their cultures would have begun to diverge. In other words, nearly two centuries before electricity and the telephone were anything close to widespread.

Jerseys and jumpers, on the other hand, date back to the freaking middle ages. They're as "outdated fashion sense" as it gets, not to mention an extremely traditional item with long-running regional variations and cultural ties. I mean, I'm not sure there's any way Molly could scream "I'm a very traditional old-fashioned British wife" any louder

** In canon, adults are pretty much robe rockin'. /Fantastic Beasts/ might end up retconning this, seeing as it is Rowling's direct brainchild.

Out of sheer aesthetic preference, I've taken somewhat of a middle ground in my fics: most European wizards and witches generally wear the "robe, shirt and hose" ensemble, or at least two out of three (not counting accessories like hats and scarves, etc.), so Diagon Alley might resemble a Ren Fair or something if you squint hard enough.

** I've said it before, but I don't mind the inclusion of muggle clothes. Especially because it lets us, the readers, connect better with the characters because its something we are used to.

What I can't stand are the parts of magical individuals being completely confused by muggle clothing, even though that is canon. They may live in different societies, but they still do live relatively close to one another. Plus, the separation between magical and muggle only happened relatively recently. In my mind, robes are worn for strictly "magical" situations like class or going to the ministry. But just going into town seems like wearing some pants and a shirt would be easier.

In my opinion, the idea of wizards not knowing how to blend in to muggle cities was an aspect introduced because they were children's books and it offered a clear separation of societies. It may not be practical in a real world, but in a book it is helpful to paint a picture of two clear, distinct cultures.

** I think that wizarding robes are common, but that muggle clothes are an accepted part of wizarding life. I also think that the younger generation tends to wear more muggle clothing than the previous generations. Harry mentions that the Weasley children "might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness."

Wizards are certainly supposed to wear muggle clothes in muggle areas, and that includes people like the Malfoys. Professor McGonagall complains that people are walking around in muggle clothes in broad daylight the day after Voldemort's downfall. The characters repeatedly change into their clothes on the train, and when Harry hides in Malfoy's compartment in HBP, even Malfoy says, "we better get our robes on." Which could mean that he's wearing a different set of robes and needs to change into a uniform, but muggle clothes are the correct dress for King's Cross.

I think that some people wear muggle clothes under their Hogwarts robes (though it's probably comfort and weather-dependent). Obviously if Ron is wearing a t-shirt/jeans under his robes, he might enjoy the chance to take off his robes after a long day of class and lounge around in t-shirt/jeans. And if students are allowed to walk around Hogwarts in muggle clothes outside of class hours, some students might chose to do so. Other students, like Malfoy, would be more inclined to exclusively wear robes during their leisure time.

So it doesn't bother me when wizards wear muggle clothes, especially when it's people in the trio's generation. And even Death Eaters need to wear muggle clothes on occasion, though they really shouldn't be enjoying it too much.

What does bother me is when a character like Harry or Hermione is somehow fashionable despite spending most of their time at an isolated boarding school with a uniform policy and being part of a socially isolated community.

** Honestly, it generally doesn't bother me at all. With the exception of the Malfoys since they obviously have certain beliefs regarding their superiority. Even then, you can excuse it.

The thing is, given how the nervous system of the UK magical world is damn near in the center of /London/, muggle fashion should have had strong affects on magic fashion. If their clothes are a bit dated, that's fine, but I don't really expect them to be wearing linen shirts and breeches under their robes and cloaks. I see the robes and hats as fashion that's persisted as part of an identity, not as something they think is up to date with the outside world.

I thought the movie did a good job of this, actually. With a handful of exceptions later in the movies, there were some very strange outfits that were obviously inspired by dated muggle clothing. Arthur's earlier outfits, for example. There's a muggle professionalism in them, circa 1930 or so, but with robes and weird bits like the keebler elf hat. I especially think the later Hogwarts uniforms were fantastic. Take off the robes, and you could go out into the muggle world without anyone noticing, but when the robes come on, it still looks right. They didn't look as overtly magical, but they looked like proper uniforms.

** I have any magical character over the age of 20 wearing robes, even the trio or muggleborns. But I always imagine kids, except for very traditional pureblood kids, wearing muggle clothes because I imagine robes would be inconvenient. But even the traditional ones I imagine dressed like little Victorians.

** Generally, I assume the pureblood wizards and witches wear robes. I also assume they don't really meet muggles though. In "Patron" though, "robes" covers actual robes, as well as illusionary flames surrounding the wearer and similar exotic "clothes".

** The books never really game me an idea of what robes were supposed to look like. When I imagine robes, I imagine something along the lines of a Thawb or the cape/dress thing Gandalf wears. But the books never really gave specifics, so I don't mind it much when they have characters wearing muggle clothing, especially since there is mention of sweaters and stuff (Mrs. Weasley knits them all sweaters).
