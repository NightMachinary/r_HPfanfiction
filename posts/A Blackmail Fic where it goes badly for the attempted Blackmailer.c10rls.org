Seen so many fics where Harry or someone else is blackmailed into doing X, usually to set Harry up with their favourite character (often Daphne Greengrass, the practical OC) and Harry just accepts it like a dumbass.

I want to see a fic where someone tries Blackmailing Harry (or another character) and it ends badly for the Blackmailer. Imperio hand over all blackmail material and tell me who else knows. Obliviate. Voila, a few more necessary obliviates and no more blackmail. But it could end even worse for the Blackmailer than that.


** I agree. Or the goblins fine Harry and try to confiscate his fortune, despite them abetting an illegitimate government and known terrorists.

Luna and Harry are in a relationship and somebody tries to leverage Harry to marry someone else. Its short and sweet, like everything else AzarDarkstar writes.

  One Shot. AU. A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.

**** OP asked for a blackmail fic. This comment begins with "It's not quite blackmail..."

***** But the idea of 'x tries to force y to do something and it goes badly for x' might still stand (i dont know, i didnt read it). so maybe even though op requested 'blackmail' he or she might be interested in the story. and if op /only/ wants blackmail, "It's not quite blackmail..." is sufficient warning to not read it.

  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.
