Albus doesn't have to be the main character, he can be a side character to the story, or a minor character, or whatever, but I'm just looking for some great characterizations for him instead of just bashing/hiding things from people Dumbledore.

Like he can still be hiding things, I just want to focus on more great moments, even if they are minor.

Like if there's a great talk with Dumbledore, between him and someone else, or a fight, or something like that, or something bigger than that is good too.

Can be any Era, as long as Dumbledore is in it, of course.

Can be as Canon or AU as possible.

AM fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

If it's set in the Golden Trio Era: NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

If set in Golden Trio Era: No Evil Harry, though he can still be dark.

** He is not the central character (or not more than in the canon) in linkffn(12155794), but I really like his description there.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Dumbledore is my favorite character and I've spent a lot of time over the years searching for fics that get him right, so I hope you don't mind getting a bunch of recs. These are sorted into roughly chronological order, and several assume familiarity with the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17933951][The Duke of Hogsmeade]] linkao3(17933951) - a (literally) sweet coming-of-age fic. Gen, complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16586783][dear forgiveness, i saved a plate for you]] linkao3(16586783) - Dumbledore/Grindelwald, but a (truly excellent) character study at heart. Angst, oneshot.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8629234][nobody else but me]] linkao3(8629234) - Dumbledore/Grindelwald, angst, oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10994679][The Hog's Head Salon]] linkao3(10994679) - a little more crack-y than the other fics on this list, but still has solid characterization. Gen, oneshot.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17500265][Falling bodies]] linkao3(17500265) - the first half of this fic focuses on Leta, but the second half on Dumbledore. Background Leta/Theseus and Dumbledore/Grindelwald, angst, oneshot.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18723142][Requiem For Love]] linkao3(18723142) - Dumbledore/Grindelwald, angst, oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) - gen, angst, oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/platonic_teacher_student_fics/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343) - gen, WIP

And, well, I've written several fics with Dumbledore as a main character; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21423970][just be friends on the way]] linkao3(21423970) is my most recent. Gen, angst, oneshot.

  "The school greeted Minerva McGonagall's return with delight. Minerva threw herself into her work, proving herself a strict but inspirational teacher. If she kept letters from Dougal McGregor locked in a box under her bed, this was (she told herself firmly) better than keeping her wand locked there. Nevertheless, it was a shock to learn from the oblivious Isobel (in the middle of a chatty letter of local news) that Dougal had married the daughter of another farmer. Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late that evening, and she confessed the whole story to him. Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, and told Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship." - Pottermore
