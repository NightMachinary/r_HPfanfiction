While Voldemort is mostly a self-obsessed prat, Grindelwald saw the danger the wizards were in. In many ways I agree with him that war is the only answer to survive in the long term, at least while keeping wizarding independence intact.e no chance if the muggles had the first strike.

I am primarily looking at fictions that deal with this and I would enjoy fictions that center on Grindelwald or maybe even an OC or time traveler etc who wants to save the wizards. I'm also partial to fictions set in times before the story setting or maybe set in alternate countries. But I'll take anything really. Length should be 100k+


** Bump I am greatly interested if anyone knows of any.
