Can't find this story anywhere, but it had chapters like harry and Tonks going to a party and harry getting super drunk trying to keep up with her but she's using a sober up potion in a flask and there's a diner scene where they get attacked and harry manages to save her, also there's a scene where Tonks partner helps harry with legilamense for a memory for a trial against Umbridge of some kind, and also there's a scene with Tonks playing weird marriage breakfast with the partner really would like to find it


** Sounds like Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=163000&chapter=0]]
