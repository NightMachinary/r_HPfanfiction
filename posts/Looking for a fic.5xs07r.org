Hi, I'm looking for a particular fan fiction. Voldemort was resurrected earlier than in the books by Lucius using the diary. The diary had a large portion of Voldy's soul so he was saner. Voldy decides to figure out what happened the night he was defeated so he spies on Harry. Voldemort figures out Harry is a horcrux. He rescues Harry from his relatives. Voldemort does some ritual to remove Harry's shadow and sends the shadow to live at the Durselys. Also Nagini tells Harry he is a Horcrux and Harry starts calling V, master.
