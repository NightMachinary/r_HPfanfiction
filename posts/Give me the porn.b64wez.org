I do admit that grooming is a possibility, but it is also a possibility among any two people given one is at least a decade older. If the slight chance that a babysitter of many years groomed a child is slim enough to pass, then why is the admittedly higher chance of it from a relative suddenly too much? Should we not look at each case on an individual basis?

Further, I don't see why you're bring grooming into this. You may as well be bringing up domestic violence as a reason to stop all relationships. Why are you judging an entire group of people based on the illegal actions that could have been done? In the situation of grooming, then the child obviously can't consent and doesn't belong in the same category as consenting relationships. What issues do you have with consenting relationships?

********* Ah, I had gotten your reply mixed up with someone else who was staying a different stance. Forgive my mistake.

Grooming is indeed an issue, I agree. I just think that preventing those things should be the priority rather than preventing a side effect. Preventing the relationship is just a reason to hide it. As the saying goes, the strict parents raise the best liars. If we taught the children about recognizing and avoiding abuse at an early age, then it would definitely be a good deterrent and catch for such grooming. Forbidding incest to prevent grooming is a bit like forbidding a theif from selling stolen items instead of just forbidding the theft of said items.

I didn't know that not being given food daily or being forbidden to sit on furniture was abuse until many years had passed. Of course, another issue that will be needed is a system to prevent and hold those accountable. Even after learning and telling various authorities, I was still subjected to it for many more years.

I am extremely opposed to child abuse given my background, but I am also extremely opposed to violating human rights such as putting a blanket forbidden stance on incestuous relationships.

********** The problem is there is no effective way to monitor for grooming nor is there the social or moral infrastructure to set up such monitoring. Ideally, incestuous relationships between consenting adults would be fine.

Additionally, I would not put it as "forbidding incest to prevent grooming." I simply mentioned grooming as an example of an uneven power dynamic.

Adult consensual incestuous relationships are legal in New Jersey, and the laws elsewhere in the US, when they are enforced, are almost always as a result of parent-child relationships.

Second: Consent is agreeing to it. That is consent. If a employee is capable of "consenting" to a relationship with their employer, then a child/sibling can be said to be capable of "consenting". However, this individual (assuming consent is required in a provable manner) has likely spent their entire developmental years looking up to their "higher" partner.

Even ignoring the child abuse that the word "obey" implies, an eighteen year old is still able to decide what they do with themselves even if they parental figure says otherwise. Heck, the teenage years are nearly synonymous with not doing what your parents tell you. As for respect, respect is something a healthy relationship needs. A relationship without respect is abusive by its very nature. Or do you mean a different form of respect?

Consent isn't just agreeing to it in sexual or medical situations. Consent is an informed, noncoerced agreement. Some sources feel the need to use the "enthusiastic", but that seems to be used in the same context as "not made to" which is why I used noncoerced.

As for humans being trained like animals... No but actually yes. Humans can be trained to react in ways, but those training methods get less effective over time given our very nature. Further, we have methods to recognize and overcome negative training.

Humans are definitely something weird. We evolved like everything else, but the circumstances leading to our survival made us very strange to the point of altering our very evolution. Evolution still affects us now, but it is in a different way than it has in our history. I personally see the future of human evolution to stop entirely. I think the closest thing to evolution we'll be affected by will be the discovery of better processors for our virtual brains to run on.

This reminds me of my favorite examples of humans being humans. Where humans would rather hurt themselves over being bored. They tested it by locking them into a room for a while with only a button that will electrocute them when they press it.

I'm a future optimist though, so I have a tendency to see the best in the future. Which is really weird as my opinion on humanity has been incredibly low since I watched that New Zealand video a few days ago.

I am an example of being trained to act in a certain way - to have a blank face. It naturally weakened over time for me with mild effort. It is actually kinda fascinating from an objective standpoint. I won't forget the time my old friend told me that I am scary to talk to though. She said it was just hard to get a read on me which makes sense. I wasn't exactly allowed to show much emotion, so I got pretty good at having a Stone face for that very reason. It is both amusing and sad looking back on it. The training was only from around six to sixteen though, so I imagine it would be far worse if it occurred earlier. I recall an experiment back before ethics where a scientist trained a child to be afraid of mice/rats that persisted for the life even if it was only as an infant.

********************** Indeed. Theoretically, the younger you start the "better" your results would be. I have a personal example, not anywhere near as bad as yours but just as valid, involving static shock. When I was younger, for some reason the door knobs at the school I was going to would always shock me when I touched them. This eventually caused me to be hesitant to touch them, and I'd either wait for someone else to do so or I'd have to force myself to do so. This stuck with me for the longest time, and even now I'll occasionally find I have to force myself to touch certain doors, especially if I've recently recieved a static shock. Theoretically, you could do something similar to a younger child, only with something like a shock collar. The human mind is amazingly good at avoiding things it knows hurts (if you need an example try to put your hand in boiling water or something similar, and observe how you'll hesitate) So eventually, you could train them to act exactly how you want. Theoretically.

*********************** I see it as the first moment you realize you're stronger than your father. That moment when you have to tilt your head down to see your mother. That's actually why most corporal abuse stops when the subject reaches puberty - they can suddenly fight back and /win/. It's also when they typically gain the ability to report abuse, but that's atypical.

Fear responses diminish every time they aren't needed. Exposure is one of the things that removes or diminishes phobias. If you touch a door knob a few hundred times without being shocked when you expected to be, then you'll generally stop thinking about it. Combine that with the fact that the child realizes they don't have to listen to their parents over a few years... It is an issue that it could happen, but it is an issue that most kids grow out of even if the grooming is for complete control rather than for sexual reasons.

Grooming can also backfire. You might get them to obey you, but they could be a spiteful bitch like me. Even after a decade, I openly ridiculed the poor excuse for a man and all but spat in his face when he got excessive. I may have even done that, I think. Rebellion may be just as likely as obedience. Ironically enough, part of my rebellion was hilariously to not do drugs like the rest of my family. I rebelled by not doing drugs which is hilarious to me when I'm this tired.

***** Just as incestuous relationships can be filled with rape, the same can be said for regular relationships. As long as all parties are consenting which requires both being of age, then it is no different. If it is indeed rape, then I would vehemently agree that it was horrible. I would even go so far as to agree that there may have been abuse given the power dynamic that previously existed. The issue is that the relationship doesn't require said abuse, and we shouldn't punish someone for the crimes of another. The secondary issue is that we shouldn't assume it is rape until proven otherwise just as we shouldn't assume it with a standard relationship.

Imagine a scenario where Jim and Beth are dating. Beth is 55 while Jim is just the young age of 40. They don't have kids nor do either have any medical issues. The relationship is healthy, consensual, they are too old to procreate, and they are mother and son. If the only part of this scenario that you have issue with is the final part, then there is something irrational going on.

If we do find that someone has groomed their child for it, then that is a horribly complicated issue that probably doesn't even permit the person to consent to the relationship. Also, in this example the relationship was described as healthy who would think would say no grooming took place, but your idea of grooming has merit. Do you agree with the relationship if no grooming was performed and Jim was raised to be as functional and mentally healthy as any other child?

I'm not saying that it is completely healthy in every situation. I'm just saying we shouldn't punish the population for the crimes of a subset. Even if ninety percent were abusive, we are still obligated by morality to at least tentatively allow the relationship. I would go after preventing such grooming and child molestation before I went to the extreme of a blanket prevention of such relationships.

** Wow I never thought I would see this blatant request.

Maybe if you are not squeaky about underage go try Vacuous Lust, Tainted Soul by Deceptive Sage. It looks tad bit choppy but it's worth a try.

** Anything by megamatt09. Most of his stories are very, very long, but only because a solid half of each story's total word count is just Harry getting his dick wet. The plot, if there even is one, is often brought to a complete halt just so that Harry and whichever female characters are in the scene with him at that moment can get it on. He has more than one story in which, except for Molly, McGonagall, Umbridge, and Petunia, Harry fucks literally every human female he comes into contact with. Usually the same day he meets them. It's madness. Filthy, smutty madness.

I used to enjoy his work ironically, but as this point I think reading megamatt's stories is just something I actually do.

*** Huh, I remember Incubus being a complely different story with Harry/Bellatrix and them teaming up to rape Petunia and some muggles.

'Course, it's a one word title so there's no reason to expect uniqueness.
