How much, if any of it do you view as canon? What about the kids names, who ends up with who, what jobs the characters have, etc. What's your own personal headcanon to Next Gen?

How much, if anything would you keep the same/similar?


** For a long time, I thought Cursed Child was terrible and ignored everything in it.

I still think it's terrible, but the idea of Delphini has grown on me, because “Harry Potter finds out that his worst enemy had a daughter, and adopts her, because nobody should be an unwanted orphan, no matter who their parents were” feels like the perfect capstone for Harry.

If we'd known through DH that Voldemort had a daughter and then Harry finds her at the end and takes her in, I'd even be cool with the flash forward epilogue, because now it'd serve a stronger narrative purpose: demonstrating that Voldemort's daughter had grown into a normal eleven-year-old girl, because nobody is defined by their parents and nobody is just born evil.

*** I mostly agree. Cursed Child is basically the worst elements of fanfic all mixed together, but the /idea/ of Dephini is interesting.

As for next gen in general, I don't really think about it or care much. I like Post-Hogwarts stories, but not ones focusing on their kids, and what they're named doesn't matter to me.

**** I agree in both. Yes, both Cursed Child and “The Augurey by La-Matrona” linkffn(12310861) are rubbish, but [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][the idea still intrigues me]].

** I think, in many ways, I prefer Next Gen (or, at least, post-canon, canon compliant) fics. It's certainly less likely to feature ideas that just clash with my personal headcanons and because characterisation is much more free wheeling, you don't get anywhere near as much bashing (which I personally hate).

That being said, when it comes to Next Gen stuff I do sort of lean into the Pottermore canon than I do otherwise. So, what that means is that I expect Audrey/Percy in the background somewhere, Fred II, Molly II etc. and Charlie to be single.

When it comes to the Cursed Child? Look, there are very few things in there that I think are canonically dubious (basically, just the trolley witch) so personally I just treat it as a Rita Skeeter version of real events. I do think there are some small characterisation problems with Harry (why would he become the head of the DMLE?) but it gets the balance between humour and sentiment in a way that rings true to the original novels a lot more than the movies ever did (most fanfics, I daresay, don't actually try to do this).

In terms of headcanons about the Next Gen characters? I try not to fixate on those because, as I said, part of the fun of a Next Gen fic is that I'm not constantly comparing the author's ideas to my own. That being said, I do have a few Sacred Cows as a result of the Cursed Child and also most of the James Sirius fics I've read:

1. Albus did actually fancy Delphini & Scorpius Rose (although that's a much more idealised attraction since he clearly doesn't know Rose that well)
2. Albus and Scorpius are bisexual
3. James Sirius Potter works a lot better as a romantic hero than his father or grandfather do (this is more from fics I've read)
4. Ginny named the kids.

Also, I've literally only just come across this Harry adopts Delphini idea because of [[/u/callmesalticidae][u/callmesalticidae]]'s comment in this thread, but it's a great idea. Anyone know if it's been written at all?

*** There's a fic called The Augurey, which is a weird combination of “Harmony smut” and “Harry raises baby!Delphi.” There was some other weirdness too (blood adoption stuff, IIRC) but I ignored it because I really wanted to read something where Harry adopted Delphi and the cycle of orphans making orphans was put to a definitive stop.

I can't think of any others and I looked pretty hard, but if I missed any, I'd love to see them.
