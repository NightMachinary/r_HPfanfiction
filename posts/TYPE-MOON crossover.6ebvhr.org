Are there any good TYPE-MOON crossovers that don't involve dumping a nasuverse character into Hogwarts/Diagon Alley. Also if you could avoid putting Matou Shinji as anything more than a sick son of a bitch that should be taken to the gallows that would be nice.

** I've always liked Fictional because it's a really interesting way to do the crossover. Sadly abandoned though.

  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.
