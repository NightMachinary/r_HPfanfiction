I don't want a harem fic. I repeat I dont want a harem fic.

I want a 14, 15, 16 year old Harry who takes advantage of all the Romilda Vane types who throw themselves at him, doing constant pump and dumps.


** I'm interested too... tbf, it became a little tiring for Harry to find the love of his life, his soul mate at 12, 13, 14, 16 or 17 years old...

So I prefer post-Hogwarts fanfics, where he is not marrying Ginny.

But as far as we know, Lily, Narcissa, Andromeda and probably Molly, they all got married early enough to get pregnant before they were 20, so I think that's something in their world.

*** I don't normally ask, but why the downvote? Harry and Hermione get together eventually, Harry /is/ a bit of a Ladies' Man at Hogwarts, and Hermione is no blushing virgin either. (OK, now I am making it sound like a lemon. It's not.)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** Not a piece of shit, a Harry that actually enjoys his youth and makes use of the perks that come with being famous. He would however be a piece of shit, if he dated many girls at the same time or only used them for a little of happy naked time. Dating a lot of people doesn't equal being a shitty person...

**** Yeah, that's true, I suppose. I just immediately pictured a Harry stringing along a bunch of girls at the same time. My bad. However, the OP does imply he's going to be disgarding them as a piece of garbage. That IS a shitty thing to do.
