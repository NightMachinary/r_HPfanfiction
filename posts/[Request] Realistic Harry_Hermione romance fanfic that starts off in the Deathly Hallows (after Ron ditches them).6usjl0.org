**** I figured that if a Harry/Hermione romance was ever going to actually happen, that would be the time. Two 17 year olds in the forest for months on end? Given how close they are I always thought they would have worked out perfectly if Ron hadn't come back

Beware: Blatant Ron bashing, magical cores & magical exhaustion, OP!Harry with wandless magic who can kill people with just a thought then drains himself of his magic

  Ron leaving them stranded on the hunt for the horcruxes wakes Harry and Hermione up to the fact that they cannot continue on as they have. They will have to think things through and not trust to luck or a destiny that may or may not turn out in their favour.

  War changes everyone: Harry resolves to face destiny and struggles to reconcile with Dumbledore's past, fully aware of the price he must pay for victory. Hermione walks through fire, determined to share in Harry's burden. Ron battles resurgent jealousy and soon discovers he may lose far more than he stood to gain. One thing is certain; peace is never cheaply purchased. H/Hr
