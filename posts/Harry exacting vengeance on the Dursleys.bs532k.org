I'm in a vindictive mood right now. So give me fics where it is /Harry/ who exacts vengeance (hopefully using magic) on his dear relatives for the years of abuse. I want to see them physically/mentally/financially ruined.

P.S. I honestly don't care if anyone thinks what he does is extreme, illegal, evil, unjustified etc


** The downward spiral saga. It takes a while to get there, but oh boy it's a messed up fic.

**** Just read all of it in general. The entire story is sooo good. It gets even better towards the end, and there is even a short one shot that was way more arousing than it should have been.

I'm fangirling, but it's still awesome.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

** Linkffn(on a pale horse) may fit the bill

It does happen later on and and it's a bit of a side thing, also the harry that does it to them is not the harry that they abused but it's at his behest and it's pretty close

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) there's a scene later on where Harry (who started a quite successful rune business) invests in Grunnings just to tell Vernon that he's fired.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) the Dursleys get ruined by Sirius, Harry doesn't even realize what's happening. One moment he's in the cupboard with the Dursleys, suddenly they're arrested and he's living in a magical mansion.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
