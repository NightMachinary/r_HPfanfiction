I have never been a fan of this pairing but having seemingly exhausted fics of my favourite pairings I figured I'd give it a shot. Mostly looking for ones set at Hogwarts and with an interesting premise or Harry having interesting powers.


** May I recommend the entire works of Northumbrian? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

They write some excellent canon-compliant (taking canon to be the end of Book 7, not whatever JKR has spewed on Twitter between then and now) post Hogwarts fics. My favourite is strangers at Drakeshaugh. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh]]

Also, Pottermum [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum]]

And FloreatCastellum [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum]] My favourite is probably Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982933/1/Aunt-Marge-s-Even-Bigger-Mistake]]

I personally haven't read it, but The Changeling by Annerb, and it's many sequels, is highly recommended. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Blackboards and Broomsticks by Gilesso is great, if unfinished. The hinny is more background though, and it's much more a Professor Potter fic first. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15813657/chapters/36810339]]

That's all I can recall of the top of my head, I'll update it if I think of any more.

*** The Changeling was not my favorite. It's ok, and has some interesting ideas in it, but not very cheerful on the whole. Harry and Ginny definitely have issues, possibly subscriptions.

I think that in the sequels, they make the mistake of letting sex take prominence in their relationship when what they really need is communication. Perhaps if they had reined in their hormones a bit, they would have been in a better position to properly work on their relationship. Not that it can't eventually work out still, but they're making it harder for themselves.

Northumbrian's stories are great, though.

** Almost all Hinny fans will be telling you that they are keeping up to date with the latest chapters of A Second Chance. An incredible fanfiction where Sirius is released early and how Harry's life changes. However it's a very slow burn Hinny but it's well worth it.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

  A story of how Harry growing up as Tony's brother might have changed things in both worlds. Told non-chronologicaly. But don't worry: the order makes sense. At least in my head. Now with the option of reading chronologicaly.
