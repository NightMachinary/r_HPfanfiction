Dumbledore bashing. I'm sick of how it has become almost universal in Harry Potter fanfiction. Even fanfics that have nothing to do with Dumbledore take pride in squeezing in some jab or insult at him. What are his crimes? "He favored Gryffindor" and "he didn't do enough for Harry". 1. The ending feast in Year 1 is always quoted as proof of "Dumbledore's blatant favoritism". Last I checked it wasn't Draco and Co who stopped quirrelmort. The trio actually did things to earn those points. How about Snape not getting nearly as much stick for actual blatant favoritism 2, and more importantly; he set Harry up to die, abandoned him at the Dursleys, didn't train him, yada-yada-yada. I'm not gonna act as if those aren't unfounded accusations. Was the Dursley situation ideal? No. Fanon spin that into a lot of wild accusations. But JKR made it clear that it was the single safest place for Harry, and that was Dumbledore's sole reason placing him there. JK says a lot of nonsense, but she wrote the damn books so I'm willing to take her word for it. The theories that Dumbledore wanted Harry abused and neglected are fanon, nothing more. Also, the various 'tests' Dumbledore put Harry through over the years. 1st year was definitely him testing Harry, and that's well wrong, but 2nd and 3rd years weren't tests. Goblet of fire is debatable. Harry had to compete because it was a magical contract. That's canon. Dumbledore bashers treat it as if it isn't. Could Dumbledore have been letting things he could stop happen to Harry? Probably. He was trying to solve the mystery while not tipping his hand. Did he succeed? No. But he wasn't purposely letting Harry suffer just to get off. Honestly, the "incompetence" of Dumbledore and Hogwarts staff and the Order is kinda JKR's fault. In Dumbledore, she basically created a Superman and had the Justice League in the Hogwarts teachers and the Order... Then had the Teen Titans do all the world saving. Dumbledore is painted as the second coming of Merlin and as a wizard on the magnitude of Gandalf. Where is he then, when Harry and Co do all the work and have all the adventures? That is a more than valid question. But it's not Dumbledore being deliberately evil I have no ill will towards Dumbledore bashers, this is fanfiction and anything goes. As much as I love HP, God knows I'll never be able to write a Harry Potter story. Even a bad one. What fanfiction writers do isn't easy and kudos to all of you for your work. What I'm tired of is how it's now viewed as canon that Dumbledore was a bad guy, as if between Voldemort and Umbitch there aren't enough villains. Dumbledore wasn't perfect. Of all the 'good guys', he and Snape were far and away the most flawed. But he was good. I'm not here looking for another Dumbledore argument, which is why I tagged this Misc. I've suffered through 15 years worth of forums and discussions on why everything I wrote in this post is a pile of dung and Dumbledore is actually the reason Voldemort was evil, enjoyed watching Harry suffer, killed the Potters, tortured Snape, and ate chaos for breakfast. Fully 95% of all HP fiction I've ever seen is Dumbledore bashing. Any comments here going that route will kindly be ignored, please. Down vote all you want, but I wrote this because if I have to go though another "evil! Dumbles, manipulative! Dumbles, ... Harry escapes from under Dumbledore's thumb..." story, I'mma freaking invoke the gods and ancestors on somebody(I'm Nigerian, that's definitely a thing)

Thanks for coming to my unnecessary rant, and stay safe folks. Unlike Harry Potter, Covid19 is real and dangerous. Wear those masks.


** Dumbledore's first priority was Harry. Dumbledore admits himself that he tried to remain detached from Harry, for Harry's good and everyone else's, but was unable too. Dumbledore loved Harry.

Dumbledore did his best to ensure Harry had as normal as a life as he could while preparing Harry for what Voldemort would do. Harry always had a choice. Harry was the one who chose to go after the stone.

If Dumbledore really was all about the greater good or his own selfish good, he'd have raised Harry as a child soldier, brainwashing him with simple psychology and magic.

**** Also, everyone conveniently forgets that while Dumbledore did /act/ as though he was raising Harry to be slaughtered, it was just an /act/. He couldn't reveal anything more to Snape than absolutely necessary, because Harry had to /believe/ that he was going to his death.

Harry surviving was Dumbledore's plan all along. In Harry's 4th year, after the events in the graveyard, Dumbledore gets a very out of place, very brief look of /triumph/ on his face, when Harry describes the ritual that was used to resurrect Voldemort. Dumbledore knew immediately that Voldemort taking Harry's blood would tether him to life and allow him to come back after Voldemort destroyed the horcrux Harry carried.

Sure, it was a farfetched plan and Dumbledore could not have /known/ it would work, despite planning and hoping it would. However, the people who complain about that are removing all agency from Harry himself. Dumbledore loved and, more importantly, /knew/ Harry's personality. He knew Harry would never accept abandoning his home to Voldemort. So, knowing Harry would eventually have to face Voldemort one way or another, he put as much planning and contingency into it being setup so Harry could survive as possible.

Dumbledore is manipulative. Dumbledore is extremely clever. Dumbledore knows how to mess with people's emotions to get a desired outcome, and he knew when to keep his cards close to his chest. No one is arguing that. But for all his manipulations, his goal was to save the fucking world and keep one of the few people who he truly loved and cared for alive in the process.

***** WELL ACTUALLY the only reason because Harry survived was Voldemort mixed his blood to Harry's blood in Goblet of Fire. So, what was the plan before than that? Dumbledore wasn't a prophet omniscient, he didn't know for sure it would work any way. And he damn sure couldn't know Voldemort would mix his blood with Harry's before he did.

****** I said as much in my OP. Harry survived because Voldemort took his blood in the ritual. I dedicated my entire second paragraph to this.

#+end_quote

I feel like there's no possible way you read my message. I addressed this point specifically in the entirety of my third paragraph. No, Dumbledore could not have /known/ his theory would work. However, Dumbledore knew Harry well enough to know Harry was going to face Voldemort, anyways. When the choices are "Face Voldemort and be forced to die because of the Horcrux in your head" or "Face Voldemort and be forced to die because of the Horcrux in your head, but also here's a chance to survive," Dumbledore made sure Harry was armed with the latter option.

#+begin_quote
  And he damn sure couldn't know Voldemort would mix his blood with Harry's before he did.
#+end_quote

Just like Dumbledore couldn't have possibly known Voldemort would use the Philosopher's Stone to recreate his body? Oh, wait...

Obviously, there are only so many ways available to a wraith-like being to be resurrected. It's not exactly a stretch that Dumbledore was aware of the possibility of Voldemort using this ritual. Counted on it, even. Again, read my first paragraph. When Harry describes the ritual to Dumbledore, and how Voldemort used his blood, Dumbledore gets a /triumphant/ look on his face. He was /immediately/ aware of the potential life-saving ramifications of Voldemort's shortsightedness.

Voldemort used Harry's blood, specifically, to bypass Lily's protections. Voldemort could have used anyone's, but Dumbledore planned on Voldemort wanting a way around it.

******* Exactly. Dumbledore counted on voldemorts arrogance. He didn't know exactly that he would use a specific ritual that specifically had Harry's blood in it but he hoped he would. Dumbledore made a lot of really good guesses. He didn't predict the future he just made extremely well educated guess because of how well he knew voldemort.

In all honesty dumbledore was probably hoping harry sacrificing himself would be the last last last back up plan. And was probably researching his ass off with other ways to help him. He first and foremost loved harry like a grandchild and would have done anything in his power to save harry if voldemort didn't use thay specific ritual.

Dumbledore /does/ favour Gryffindor at the expense of Slytherin here. Mind you, this doesn't excuse Snape, who is even worse when it comes to blatant favoritism, but what he did at the end of Year 1 feast was just wrong. Sure, some Slytherins, like Draco, are genuinely wanting to become a Death Eater and oppress all Muggleborns, but I believe a large portion of Slytherin are just normal kids caring about their own business and friends who don't look up to wizarding Hitler. What message does the end of year debacle send them? "Gryffindor is the best house and there's nothing you can do about it".

I don't believe for a second that this is some weird scheme by some master manipulator, I just think what Dumbledore did was very misguided. A better solution to me would have been to give the Trio a trophy for services to the school. Something that doesn't send a message to the entire school that Gryffindors are the best.

** Like every Fanfiction trope Evil Dumbledore can be both good and bad, but I have to agree with you that it is one that tends to be bad. When every inner Monologue of Dumbledore ends with its for the greater good, after all, it gets annoying pretty quickly.\\
My problem with Dumbledores Character lies in JKs Worldbuilding and the paradox she creates with Dumbledores Character. On the one Dumbledore is the greatest Wizard alive defeated of Grindelwald, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, supreme Mugwump, etc. etc.. Dumbledore is painted as the most influential figure in the British wizarding community. On the other hand, we have a society which is bigoted to its core, the most important Subject in Hogwarts is taught by a boring ghost (yes I consider history to be the most important subject at Hogwarts), the Potions Master is outright abusive of the children in his care and makes eleven-year-olds cry regularly and you all the things that don't make much sense in the Wizarding World.\\
When one would look at how Dumbledores character is depicted in the books and how many of those problems he should be able to solve, and how little he apparently is doing to solve them is what makes his character a paradox because, according to his characterization he should try to solve them.

** I think the reason is there are so many holes in the original stories that its easy to take whatever path you want. Some of these questions take a little more creativity, but there are still questions there that can be open to interpretation and filling in details without changing canon up to a divergence point. We also just saw the highlights of each year, so alot of details about how much teaching/learning would have been at Hogwarts just aren't available.

Were the dursleys behavior abusive? Did Dumbledore endorse the abuse? Did he know Sirius was innocent? Did he have a trial? How much power did he have as Chief warlock to get a new/first trial? How complacent/controlling/corrupt was the ministry? Did Dumbledore have the power to change? How controlling was he about Harry's home life? What would he have done if Harry had resisted? Was Dumbledore testing nature vs nurture theory? Harry and Tom had VERY similar living situations. How much training was Harry given? In the ultimate fight especially in the movies Harry holds on for himself well. How much leeway was in the TWT contracts? Was there a way for Harry to have been released from TWT? How poorly did Snape/Binns/Trewlandy really teach? Is the teaching at Hogwarts stagnating? How comprehensive is a Hogwarts education?\\
Could a 15yo really stand up to an adult wizard (5th year ministry battle)? How aware was Dumbledore of the infiltration of the school (quirell/moody)? Was the Sorcerer's Stone real? How safe was the stone in the final room/mirror? Were there other safeguards in the final room? If the kids had listened to McGonagall about the stone being safe would Tom have been restored? Could the stone have been stuck under Fidelis? Could the Fidelis have been more widely/effectively used? How effective was the order truly?\\
How many people were truly sacrificed knowingly? Why allow the petrified students to remain petrified so long? Did/how much did he know about the basilisk/cos? Were blood quills illegal? How involved were goblins in Inheritance/Wills/Vaults? Was there a Potter Will? What were the Details?

These are just what I can think of right now. Im sure there are plenty of others. But how you answer these questions determines how manipulative/evil/complacent Dumbledore is on things.

Most people forget that the intended audience for the Books were readers that were the same age as Harry. (11yo for HPSS.... 17yo for HPDH) Not full adults who would really come up with these types of questions.

Like all things in life, fanfiction follows cycles. For whatever reason the conrolling/manip/evil dumbles is the trend. Although the time of the truly good, prolific HP FF is past. There are still good stories being written, but they are harder to find, and get updated on less frequent schedules.

*** This is exactly it. JKR created a mistake in Dumbledore having all that power in his numerous official positions, authority in decisions over Harry's life as well as power over Hogwarts and in his influence over the general Wizarding world. HP is a children's series before all else. The children had to be the ones having all the adventures and saving the world. But Dumbledore having so much power and not doing anything was an error.

Someone posted recently here that Dumbledore would have been easier to sell across if he had been portrayed as feeling every one of his 100 odd years. If he had been weaker after Grindelwald and the 1st war against Voldemort. If his positions as Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump had been entirely ceremonial. The spritely, sharp as a whip Dumbledore in canon couldn't get away with the bare minimum. I understand that. But the bashing has become too rabid and excessive

** I love it when people act like Snape is a good guy, Dumbledore is a bad guy, and Dumbledore always gives points to Gryffindor "because Harry", even through he wanted Harry to die. Like, people likes to conveniently forget the entire past of Snape, from his actions as a notorious, Inner Circle Death Eater, to the many times he decided to bully young children to satisfy is ego. But, little did you know, he liked Lily and gave some of his memories to Harry after he died, so I guess he's a good guy ?

Now Dumbledore, ooooh Dumbledore ! This pesky Dumbledore, always giving points to the Golden Trio for risking their lives ! I mean, 50 points for having faced a giant army of magically animated marble pawns in Chess ? How dare he ! Fortunately McGonagall is there to save the day, by withdrawing 20 points to Slytherin but 50 for Gryffindor for the same reasons, these reasons being "being caught outside after curfew for the first time".

I mean, almost dying is worth the same than getting caught after curfew, and that's good ! Right ?

This damnable Dumbledore, who DARED trust the Dursleys to treat their own kin as family ! He could have checked regularly, even despite the fact the Dursleys hates all things magical and Lily must have said so multiple times ! I mean, it wouldn't have made things worse, right ?

And how dare he not do anything after Harry was chosen as a Triwizard champion ? It was only a magically binding contract, to a tournament that was stopped ages ago !

For fuck's sake, he killed his sister ! Sorta, kinda. That means he's evil, even tho he regretted it - alegedly !

And look, the shady dude that's also his brother told the golden trio that Dumbledore liked to control things ! That means he's true evil, right ?

​

All in all, yeah Dumbledore made mistakes, but I really hate how he's treated as a monster yet people that bash him seems to like Snape and Draco, who are quite worse.

*** This is exactly it. Snape gets a pass because 'aLWaYs' and because Alan Rickman was so perfect in the role it hurt. People call his maniacal obsession with Lily 'love' and use it to excuse his prejudice, savage pettiness, cruelty and just plain meanness. And don't get me started on the Malfoys. Draco was nothing more than a schoolyard bully with zero courage and even less cunning and ambition. But Tom Felton is handsome and the Malfoys are a cute family who switched sides at the last second so they're alright.

I don't even hate the Malfoys or Snape. But people are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and give em a pass but apparently Dumbledore is Evil von Evilson, Lord of the Greater Good and Manipulation

Except there were 3 days between the Leaving Feast and Harry & Co stopping Quirrelmort. Dumbledore waited the very last moment, after the banners had been changed to green and silver and the Slytherins thought they had won, to give the points.

Why couldn't he give the points during the 3 days between the Feast and the trio stopping Quirrelmort?
