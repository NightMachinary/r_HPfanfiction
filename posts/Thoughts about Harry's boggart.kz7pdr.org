Harry's boggart, as we see in PoA and GoF is a dementor, and it is stated that is because of hearing his mother die. However, in PoA it is also mentioned that boggarts get confused by having multiple targets in front of them.

But Harry isn't the only soul in front of that boggart - there's also that fragment of Voldemort's soul in Harry's head (although this is totally a plot hole caused by a retcon).

Therefore, is the dementor the best way to affect two opposing souls or is Voldemort's horcrux occluded against being read by the boggart?


** Or maybe Voldemort is more afraid of dementors than Harry is of anything else. If you can leave your body as a posessing soul when it's damaged, you'll be more afraid of things that damage souls than of things that damage bodies.

*** But it wouldn't make sense. Voldemort works along side the dementors. He technically had control over them, so why fear them?

Of course, if you think about it, what you're saying might be right as he could've been afraid of losing his horcruxes to a dementor, but I don't think he would be so scared of them that they would turn into his boggart. I think that what Voldemort fears most is death, so in that case his boggart would be Death itself

**** But how would one represent death? I highly doubt Tom would pescribe to the cloak and scythe image we muggles have cooked up. And anyway, just because he somehow brokered a deal with the Dementors doesn't mean he shouldn't fear the idea of them being able to consume souls.

And anyway, it does not really matter if you have Horcruxs if your main soul bit is going to be consumed by a random soul sucking monster.

***** What about the Deathly Hallows? In the story, they created an image of Death. It could be used to represent his boggart, as I'm sure he read the story

*** True, I hadn't thought of it like that

** Harry is not afraid of fear itself. Remus was dumb. He's afraid of the big monster with a taste for his soul or being forced to see the instance that put his life down the drain on loop. These are perfectly legitimate fears. Dementors don't represent fear. Boggarts do. If Harry was afraid of fear, wouldn't he see a Boggart?

** Maybe the reason that it knows both fears is exactly why is the dementor!! The dementor make Harry relives his experiences with Voldemort and his parents murder, but it also makes Voldemort relives his own death! Harry's greatest fear is Voldemort and Voldemort's is death. So the dementor is the representation for both of their fears
