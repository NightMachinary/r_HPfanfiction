Why do so many authors write Ron as an idiot? Even in some of the fics without Weasley bashing he's still an idiot. He got 7 OWLS out of the 8 classes he took , that's gotta count for something.

*** I hate how many of Ron's positive character moments just straight up disappear in the films, for no good reason.

Ron does a lot of small things in the books that show he's got something in that head of his - almost all of which are omitted from the films, given to another character, or in some cases /inverted/.

An example, in the books when Snape lays into Hermione for "speaking out of turn", Ron starts yelling at Snape and earns a detention for it. In the film, his reaction is "he's got a point".

***** Agreed. I used it as an example because it makes it /painfully/ obvious that the film-writers did some of it on purpose.

If he'd said nothing, it could have been just another small thing that was "cut for time" - but the fact that he still has a comment, and it's pretty much the direct opposite of what he said in the book, means the only reason is to make Ron seem like more of an arse.

*** The injustice done to both Ron and Hermione (characters are better with flaws, movie!Hermione is flawless) in the films is one the main reasons I'd be all for another adaptation one day. Hopefully as a series as they would be able to include a lot more materials that were cut out due to the running time.

***** And it works out really well with a book per season, and if there are no gap years between seasons you've got consistent aging amongst the actors. The first three seasons would be shorter due to the length of the books, around 5-7 episodes, but from the 4th season on there would easily be around 10 episodes, maybe a few extra for the 5th.

And with technology improving a series like this which would have quite a lot of effects is far easier to do. I can easily see them applying the Stagecraft technology they've been using in the Mandalorian for a lot of scenes.

** I think its two fold. One like already mentioned many fanfic authors either dislike Ron outright or dislike the fact that he ended up with Hermione. Therefore, they make him out as a worse character than he was portrayed in the books.

Two, while Harry and Ron weren't all that motivated I always felt that Harry was a better student than Ron. For one thing he often buckled down with less nagging than Ron did. Remember in PS that it was mentioned that Harry Loved to read and went through most of his books right after he got them. Where in many cases it seemed that Ron never liked to read. So in my mind while they may have both received EE's in a subject I always thought that Harry's grade was closer to the higher grade, whereas Ron's was closer to the lower. Now there is nothing specific in canon to support this feeling but I would believe that there are a lot of fanfic authors that feel the same way.

In a way he is. Or at least he was in the 1st 2-3 books. There's a moment after the CoS is opened in which Ron is trying and failing to finish his History assignment and Harry walks in to do a last minute length check. I was very surprised by it. I guess the scene of them bsing their Divination dream book just stuck out more.

I'm not convinced this example is . . . pertinant when trying to prove that Harry is a better student than Ron.

In this example, it is true that Harry read all his school books in advance during th Summer Holyday, but he is a Muggle raised kid who just learnt that Magic is real, and these books were his only link with the Magical World before the start of the school in September. These books where also (with the rest of his school stuff) the first item that were truly /his/, and not some Dudley cast off which may have motivated him to read them.

In comparaison, Ron is a pureblood kid. He doesn't need to have a link with the magical world, he is living inside. His school books are also second (if not third) hand and first belonged to his big brothers. Ron has way less interest toward magic than Harry (since he never had this sence of novelty toward it), and had ample occasions to read this book way before this summer.

Also, PS is the only year where Harry read his school books in advance (at least where it's explicitly said by the narration, though he clearly discover his Defense text book during the 1st class in OotP), and factually, the only 2 books that truly got Harry interest were "Quidditch Through the Ages" (which is probably is favourite book that he reread several time during the serie) and the "Book of the Half Blood Prince", neither of them would show him as a better student (though the HBP book inflated his potions books thanks to all his advices).

The way I see it, Harry and Ron are both very talented student who are not motivated to work (which is easy to understand since they are just kids/ teen). The only "true" difference in their grade is Defence where Harry is better, either thanks to being more talented, or just his experience with surviving assassination attemps almost every year.

** As someone who uses Ron in a variety of different ways, I would say that it depends on the story. Ron is not an idiot but booksmarts are also not necessarily his thing. He's clever in his own way certainly, but for a lot of FF writers, that kind of thing is difficult to grasp.

In the books, Ron is clearly written so that he understands the world around him. Of the three, he's easily the most socially aware and tactically, he's brilliant. But it's really hard to figure out how to use those things. Harry's brave and Hermione is brilliant and those skills are just easier to show. Therefore, it's just easier for people to write Ron as a moron.

TBH, Ron is my barometer for how well a story is written. If they get Ron, then they likely get the characters.

** I think a lot of it comes from his characterization as not intellectually minded. In particular:

- Picking the "easy" classes
- Not having any class he excels in
- Not really caring about how he did
- Willingness to 'mooch' off of others if it makes classes easier.

In short, he seems to have a "dancing through life" attitude.

Harry avoids this ire because of a few things:

- He has so much shit going on it doesn't feel like him not focusing on academics is unreasonable.
- He has a subject he is enthused by.
- He comes from a broken household, and we generally have a lower bar for kids without support networks
- He does not appear to actively seek short cuts in his work (but takes advantage of them when offered)

Thus the view of Ron as a bad influence on Harry.

My personal headcanon is that magic is so focused on rote memorization to the exclusion of other academic skills. Thus, when compared to a regular high school /, University, Hogwarts students are woefully unprepared. Gives a bit of background on why the wizarding world stays so backwards: The students are not learning critical thinking, criticism, individualism, time management, creative thinking, reasoning, analysis or persuasion the way one does at University.

Following this train of thought, Hermione isn't some savant wonderchild, but just someone very very good at memorization. If she was going through a traditional schooling path, she may even struggle as memorization starts being less and less important when you leave primary school.

Similarly, Ron might be very good at some academic skills that would have served him well at University, but does not take to repetitive rote memorization, and is this turned off by most wizarding academics.

** Most of the problems with Ron, at least in Fanon, is that he appears as lazy and jealous. When his character is bashed, at best he is wasting his time and his talents (not idiot but clearly unmotivated that thinks magic can solve everything) and at worst he is an idiot who expects that everything will land in his hands and gets excessively angry when something does not go like how he wanted.

In canon for what I remember, he gets sometimes really jealous about Harry's fame and wealth (sometimes illogically, sometimes Harry does not help by making it no big deal, for Ron it is big)

He is complaining about Hermione's way of studying (to be fair, at his age I was just as bad in term of slacking and Hermione is just insane with homework) maybe Harry thinks the same but Ron is the most vocal and we don't have the point of view of other students to compare.

I can't remember its name but there was a reincarnation!fic where it was Ron who died and woke up in his younger body just before his first year and decided to get things done !

**** Lmfao, I know it's like stating the obvious, but I feel like it's not so obvious. Or at least a very understated reason. Yes, film Ron is bad and yes, Harry and Ron are lazy, but they're, by and large, treated very differently and not just because Harry's the BWL.

Case in point: Neville isn't a good wizard and I'd have Ron beating him in a duel, but the fandom /loves/ Neville. Why? Because Neville killed Nagini and stood up to Voldemort. That's his big moment. That's his claim to fame.

Ron doesn't have a save the day moment like this. No one remembers Ron rescuing Harry from the lake. No one cares that he stood between Harry and Sirius on a broken leg or that he's the person Harry would miss the most. They remember Ron abandoning Harry twice and they note the reason is jealousy.

There's a list of reasons why Ron is disliked, but tl;dr Ron is bashed because they dislike his character and being given proper lines in the movie wouldn't have helped.

Objectively speaking, every other Weasley spawn have a unique quality that distinguish them : Bill works for Gringotts, Charlie with the dragons, Percy is probably the most studious (or perceived as such), the twins have amazing creativity (they use it for mischief but still) and Ginny is the last and the only girl. Ron displays incredible talent with strategy but beside in the first book, I don't remember this talent being shown or used, I don't even remember if his chess-playing habit where he trounces every opponent is shown in the books as much as in fanfictions. The rest of his flaws can be attributed to being a teenager in a poor family.

** Actually the way JKR uses Ron in the books does make him come across as an idiot at times.

In the books Ron is used an audience stand in during the mystery solving conversations. So he'll come up with theories which the audience usually comes up with and then the author stand in, almost always Hermione, rejects it. Classic example Ron will say "maybe they've apparated" and Hermione needs to remind Ron that you can't apparate in Hogwarts. Some of these theories gets repeated each book because JKR needs to assume that someone is reading a Harry Potter book for the first time. In other words Ron needs to be reminded every year that you can't apparate in Hogwarts. Sheesh. And sometimes the theories reach absurd levels like for example Ron thinking a patronus goat or stag is a doe. (or maybe Ron needs some glasses?)

Besides this Ron sometimes also asks stupid questions or perceived stupid questions so that the author can explain things an example is in GoF where Ron asks why the death eaters Disapparated after seeing the Dark Mark after the world cup finals.

Academically we've never see Ron excel in class. In fact every time Harry observes Ron in class he's always performing worse than Harry. Later books it feels like he's outright failing the classes. Despite the fact he got some decent above average marks in his OWL exams e.g. he definitely has an E in transfiguration and potions or else he wouldn't be attending those classes in book 6.

All in all this wouldn't be so bad if JKR decided off set this with more competent Ron, or street smart Ron but she doesn't or at least nowhere near enough.
