I know that casting a patronus has to do with having hope for the future, and the patronus comes from the soul/has to do with the soul. Voldemort (either because of his actions or his biology) does not have the same emotional abilities as everyone else, and he's messed with his soul. Do people think that this may have impacted his ability to cast a patronus? I assume that if he has a patronus, it would take the form of a snake.

I don't think any of that's canon, unless it comes from something Rowling said outside of the books. A Patronus just requires a happy memory or some positive emotion. If Voldemort can't cast the spell, it would probably just be because he doesn't have any truly happy memories.

Of course, Voldemort doesn't exactly need a Patronus anyway.

  o because morsemode isn't used to fight off dementors (but then we also see patronus's as communication devices/to send messages, and I

  guess

  morsemode's primary usage is as a form of communication). Also, wasn't it stated by the author that Riddle isn't able to love because he was conceived with a love potion? So wouldn't his soul/emotions have been damaged before making the first horcru

Yeah and it was also canon that really bad things could happen to a dark wizard that tried to cast a patronus and failed. If I remember right, dark wizards are at risk of being consumed by maggots when attempting to cast it.

That's something like Pottermore-canon, not book-canon, so it can be safely ignored. And it's pretty stupid anyway.

** If he did, it would've been as Tom Riddle. As soon as he thought about splitting his soul, I have to assume that he lost that ability, which begs the question: could Morsmorde be his way of creating an evil Patronus?

*** Interesting take. I'd say no because morsemode isn't used to fight off dementors (but then we also see patronus's as communication devices/to send messages, and I /guess/ morsemode's primary usage is as a form of communication). Also, wasn't it stated by the author that Riddle isn't able to love because he was conceived with a love potion? So wouldn't his soul/emotions have been damaged before making the first horcrux?

Not necessarily. I think that it's due to his mom giving up after his father abandoned her, but that wouldn't damage his soul. He could've learned it from the caretaker.

And the Dementors feed off of negative energy, so it could call them to the scene

** I may be remembering incorrectly, but I thought JKR once said that Snape was the only Death Eater who could cast a patronus.

Then again, it being so long ago, it's also possible that was in a fanfic and accidentally became headcanon.

** No. Pottermore:

  However, most such men and women, who become desensitised to the effects of the Dark creatures with whom they may ally themselves, regard the Patronus as an unnecessary spell to have in their arsenal.

  As a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope (the recollection of a single talisman memory is essential in its creation)
