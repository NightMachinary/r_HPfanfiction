I have a couple ideas for AUs that stretch out over long periods of time (past seventh year). Does anyone have any advice about starting to put it all down on paper?

Also, what chapter-to-chapter style would work well? I haven't ever read a series that I liked that covered all 7 books. I want to make it a decent length (at least as long as the actual series) but I've never been good at writing longer pieces. What techniques do you use when you're writing, both in the actual writing part and in the planning (summaries, timelines, etc...). How much thought do you put into subplots like quidditch?

All you help is appreciated. :)


** I love reading 7-part AUs. Two recommendations...

First, outline most of the story before you start. Take all your ideas and make a really comprehensive outline. Honestly, this is how JKR wrote... Not that it's the only way, but it certainly might help prevent you from pulling an Inverarity. (He's "been writing" the 5th book of his AU for 3 years now.) The more you have written before you begin posting, the better, actually. Nothing is more frustrating than starting an AU and having it get halfway through 3rd year before the author goes MIA.

Second, find someone to ruthlessly edit your text. Not just a beta to check plot continuity and grammar, but someone who will accurately and mercilessly tell you that you're being ridiculously long-winded. The Saving Connor 7-part AU comes to mind; Lightning on the Wave /really/ needed an editor to cut down on his endless descriptions and soliloquies.

edit - oh God I just saw your Quidditch question. I realize that was just one example of a subplot, but I skip 99% of written Quidditch games; it's the most boring part of fanfiction in my opinion.

** Work in single story lengths- you can have an overarching plan for the whole show but each season gets it's own sub-story.

For focus characters, try to pace what they will have become at the start and end of each year/substory. If you decide to shift focus away from the usual characters, you don't need to demonize them; just make it reasonable that they wouldn't be involved.

Each year has a different challenge, leading to change. The last story completes the evolution of the main character and of the plot.

** This probably won't go well. Starting out like this is incredibly hard for anyone, more so for someone unexperienced.

Consider if you could write it in parts - does something really cool happen in 4th year? Write that story. Starting out wanting to write an "epic" is a recipe for tears and frustrations.

But if you insist, and you aren't some sort of savant, you'll want notes. Summaries. Timelines. Bring a notebook to bed, in transit, on the toilet - you'll need it.

Make timelines. Write down the class schedule for your characters if Hogwarts is a focus. Character biographies.

All these things are demoralizing to make. You feel like you are wasting time, or you are losing the excitement of writing by pre-plotting and meticulously planning. This is true. But if you want to write a long series, as long as the actual Harry Potter series, you /will/ need this, or it will just be another of those /fics you don't like/, as you mention.

You'll have to plan out plots carefully - in such a big work, readers expect consistency and forethought. If you fail to introduce something as a Chekhov's Gun first, someone will be upset. Writing a long series is a *lot* of work.

Subplots are important to break up the monotony, but these too need to be worked into the main plot and story, and they need to be consistent. If you are writing a political Slytherin story, positions on the Quidditch team probably matters a lot to student inter-house "politics" and dynamics. Gobstones club? Not so much.

Bashing becomes far less tolerable in an enviroment such as this - we'll see the characters a /lot/, after all. You have to make sure every character is /in character/, and they need so stay *consistent*. This is a major problem with long stories, fanfiction in particular, consistency. *Constant consistency!*

Characters need motivations too, and this will interfere with your plot. If you shunt aside character motivations to advance the plot, you are doing something wrong and the result will be showing. You *can't* have a truly evil, manipulative Dumbledore in a serious story. There's no way an eleven, or hell, seventeen year old Harry could do /anything/ against that, so you'd either have to dumb down Dumbledore or bend reality and introduce deus ex machina at every corner. Same goes for other powerful and influental characters.

Voldemort is a prime example. J.K had to do some serious suspension of disbelief to have our teenage protagonist not perish by the end of Philospher's Stone, much less Deathly Hallows. You can't have the villain have a stupid moment just for the plot, it needs to be *consistent.* See; Sauron. His err at the story's climax wasn't just a momentary onset of stupidity for the heroes to succeed, it was an established character flaw manifesting itself at a critical moment. And that brings me onto the next point, which is;

The protagonists needs to be human, too. Too many fics (and stories too, but that's not as relevant right now,) has the hero do something uncharacteristic just because it benefits the plot. If your Harry doesn't normally cast /Homenum Revelio/ when he enters a room, he can't suddenly do that so he can discover Pettigrew at a critical plot junction. And no sixth sense either, for gods sake.

Are you building on canon, or are you going AU early? Even if you diverge at the very start, characterization is still a bitch. Yeah, you might not have to keep your characters consistent with canon because they have different motivations and experiences now, but they still need to be consistent with your story. Consistency! Always!

To sum it up, take lots of notes, draw some timelines, write down everything you think about the story - "I'll remember it when I get home" *is NOT good enough!*

Finally, remember to stay consistent. It's the most important thing of all - even a terrible story isn't as terrible if the author manages to keep their characters consistent.

So true. "I'll remember it when I get home" is the fastest route to Hell. And Hell /burns/.

** So, I also have never written a fic this long, but I'm a writer by trade. My tips will be based on good writing practice in general, and my observations as a reader.

Depending on how long you go between updates and/or how many things happen in a chapter, post a quick recap every so often. Fanfic is published serially, so you need to account for the possibility that people won't remember what happened last time. In general, you want to stop and ask, if I had to wait over a month before I started reading the next chapter, would I be confused, or is there something that helps me remember what's going on?

I know that some people prefer to write a complete story before posting, rather than writing it chapter by chapter or a couple at a time. Just remember that there's something to be said for incorporating reader feedback or at least acknowledging it. Don't be so married to the idea of where your story is supposed to go. You'd be surprised at some of the ideas readers come up with, not to mention that sometimes the story or character will take a life of its own.

If multiple people tell you that a character is unlikable, and they're not supposed to be, then you should be concerned.

Your characters need to grow, because people change in real life. The only time you should have a character that consistently makes the same mistakes is when they serve as a point for another character, i.e., they should drop this person who isn't willing to change.

People don't have frequent several paragraph monologues on random topics in real life.

Spelling and grammar are important, as is overall organizational structure. If you need a beta, get one. Get one even if you don't think you need one. The occasional mistake is fine, it's when it becomes rampant that there's a problem.

Don't make silly spelling mistakes of things included in the books. Saying "Privat Drive" doesn't inspire a lot of confidence - if you can't even be bothered to get that right, then there's not that much hope for the rest of the fic.

It is perfectly fine to keep referring to someone by their name. It's not repetitive to say "Harry said..." over and over. It's best actually, since most readers won't notice it - they'll gloss over that and focus on the actual dialogue.

On a related note, don't refer to a character using a phrase that you would never actually say to that character. You wouldn't actually call Harry The Chosen One in real life, would you? "Hey The Chosen One, how was your weekend, hey The Chosen One, pass the potatoes." So don't replace Harry with that phrase in non-dialogue portions. That goes with any character. It's just fucking weird to keep reading about the bushy haired beauty instead of Hermione.

If you're not from the UK, spend some time getting familiar with how people from the UK act. The common terms they use, how they tend to phrase things, the type of humor, hire emotional they tend to be, how individualistic the society is, etc.

There's nothing wrong with a filler chapter. In the alphabet, you have to go through b to get from a to c. That's true of this as well.

When working on subplots, ask yourself how they tie into the larger plot. I think it's OK if it doesn't - not everything in life ties into some grand narrative, and some stuff goes unresolved. But, regardless of whether a subplot ties in or goes nowhere, you still want to have an idea of where it's going.

When planning, it's a good idea to write down how magic works in your story, even if you're relying on canon explanations. That way, you'll be consistent in your explanations.

In general, check your later work against your earlier work for inconsistencies.

Don't say "bad summary" or "I suck at summaries." Don't have spelling or grammar mistakes in your summary. These are other confidence killers. A summary is literally 2-4 sentences. If you can't get that right, or adequately describe your story, I'm not very inspired to read your fic.

While HP is a fantasy series, it's still rooted in real life. I need to have a suspension of belief to get through the magic part, but not to understand the larger issues of bigotry. Similarly, your fic needs to be somewhat realistic. Yes, sometimes people have a lucky week, or it seems like everything bad that could possibly happen happens in one day. But when that always happens, or one group always wins with little effort or minimal losses, or everything is solved by a deus ex machina out handwaving - it becomes unrealistic or unreadable.

Anyways, these are just some tips I have as a writer and long time reader. Sorry if some of it seems a bit lecture-y. That's more directed at bad authors than you. I'll let you know if I come up with some more tips. Hope this helps!

Edit: I'm surprised there weren't more typos given that I wrote all of this on mobile.

** Hey! So I'm also working on a super long story right now. Would it be advisable to do little sub stories inside the main story? Like parts with smaller plot lines? Mine has one main character - it's basically the story of her life. If you must know, it's Lily Evans, so it's a rather short life. I have a beta. Any hints and tips are appreciated!
