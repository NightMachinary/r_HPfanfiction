Second post today since I really need some reading material.

In the books and most fanfictions, I'm a huge fan of the character Bellatrix Lestrange / Black. There are so many ways people interpret her, its almost always entertaining to read about the First Lieutenant of the Dark Lord. Some make her out as the "maniac with a cause" who truly brings method to the madness. Some make her the product of a broken family ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains we wear]] for example) and others even go so far as to give her innocence by blaming her behavior on spells and potions, ranging from Amortentia to Blood Contracts with the Lestrange family. Since theres close to no information about her childhood and early adult life, people get pretty creative.

In short. I love that Black girl.

But I also enjoy the "broken-ness" of the Black family as a whole.

So yea, *TLDR.:* Do you know some good Bellatrix Lestrange / Black or Black family centered fics?


** You might want to try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]. A rather dark fic with a female not!Harry as the main character. I can't really do it justice, so I recommend reading the first couple of chapters. It is complete and has a sequel.

*** Thanks for the recommendaton.

Unfortunatly I've already read this one and am unable to erase my memory in order to do it again. I am religiously following the updates of the sequel. Jen Black is an awesome character.

**** I've honestly lost count of how many times I've reread it. I can also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] which is Harry and Sirius in a new world and shenanigans, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] which ships Harry and Bellatrix. I gave up about half way through, it is quite long.

***** In reality she is the twin sister of Harry Potter - Jennifer Potter. Due to circumstances she ends up living with the surname Black and acting as such. Her backstory is a /biiiit/ much, but she works fine as a character in the end.

Also, on a sidenote: A lot of authors drop the astronomy names due to the shift in the family. Sirius often breaks with the tradition because of his antipathy towards the Black traditions. Bellatrix' children often get Lestrange names and so on and so forth.

** Passageways by jerrway69 is really good but he has just started a rewrite of it because he was unhappy with where he got to.

This is the link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10934847/1/Passageways-Redux][Passageways-Redux]] which is the rewrite they're six chapters in atm.

Basically hogwarts in all its sentient glory decides that Harry and Bella both have shit destinies and decides to help them out by letting them meet up in some wibbly wobbly timey whimey place. Shennanigans happen from there.

** This is the best one I've read. Harry/bellatrix pairing that not only feels realistic but also focuses on Bellatrix ' s character a lot. Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun

AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?

It's pretty interesting, and the only Harry/Bellatrix story that remains true to the original characters, and their friendship/romance is very well done imo.

*** First and foremost: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]

Great read with WIP sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change][Seasons of Change]] was also something I really enjoyed reading. Its updating rather slowly, though.

For one of the best character interpretations of Bellatrix check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]]. The idea of a Bellatrix/Hermione ship is, on the first glance, rather odd. More so when you begin reading. But I came to like the fic a lot due to its slow pace and the effort of the author to make it work.

Nothing that isn't linked already I think. There are some more, but I honestly forgot the titles of most and can't find the bookmarks.

**** I just started "Those Gilded Chains We Wear" and I'd say that the character portrayal was so realistic in the first two chapters that I gave up because I was reminded that Bellatrix is super loathsome. I guess I need to give it another shot.

***** Bella is the epitome of a bitch in this one for quite a while. Like 10 chapters until you even see the first spark of something you could even remotely relate to.

But then again: I love this fic of being this slow. I don't buy fast paced romance between Bellatrix and ... well, anybody really.
