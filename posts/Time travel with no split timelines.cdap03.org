I was re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]] and wanted some more like that. Time travel where rather than fixing and altering history, Harry had a hand on it all the time and it derails canon until he returns.


** Basilisk-born has to be one of my favorite fics of all time. Was stoked when he released a new chapter today üôè

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh; Strange Visitors from Another Century)

Long Journey Home is exactly what you're asking for, but abandoned. What is there is absolutely incredible though.

Visitors from Another Century seems to be taking that direction, but hasn't quite gotten there yet.

Cheers

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

** Ignoring Cursed Child, that's the sort of time travel that is canonically allowed by time turners, which follows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle]]. Essentially, the past is never changed: any ‚Äúchanges‚Äù that occur as a result of the time travel /always/ occurred.

*** That can't be true. McGonagall says people have killed their past selves by mistake. That isn't possible unless they lived long enough to have a future self in one version of the timeline.

It seems more like how the Pottermore article describes it. Time can be changed, but it's not a smooth change. The results are wonky and people can remember at least some of what happened.

** This has always been my favourite kind of time travel (and you know your a nerd when you have a favourite /kind/ if time travel). I remember reading PoA and just thinking: yep, that makes sense, and only later realising most time travel sucks.

Unfortunately I haven't found any other stories with this, except maybe nightmare man, but I cannot remember if that was time travel or not. He definitely starts in the past and changes the future, but I'll have to refresh myself.

** If we're talking about 'you can't change the past, only re-live it from a different perspective' type thing, linkffn(4009690) has that, and is also a really nice Fred + George + Charlie Weasley fic (in terms of main characters)

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.

** The Of a Linear Circle series on AO3 has this as a main plot point. Unfinished series but on the 10th or so entry into it. Quite good, bit pedantic, but great magic.
