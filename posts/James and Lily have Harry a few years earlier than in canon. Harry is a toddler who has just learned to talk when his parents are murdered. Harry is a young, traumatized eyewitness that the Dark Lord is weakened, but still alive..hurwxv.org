** For this prompt to work you will also need to age up Lily and James a bit.

They are 21 yrs old when they died so canonically Harry was born when they were about 19 yrs old (he was 15 months old on the fateful night).

** students get in broom cupboards really early and most students start taking newts by age 16, some 17 in year 6. I don't see a problem with a bunch of 16-17's stuck in a castle for a year getting together seems kinda right on point. Plus who cares if lilly has harry while she is still a 6th year Jame's parents have house elves, or should.

*** I mean, you say that, but I'm fairly certain that Dumbledore spends a lot of his time before philosophers stone trying to convince the public of this fact, I'd expect him to spend a lot of effort to get it out.

Also, I'm fairly certain Snape and probably Pettigrew see Harry that night too
