LF a fic I read a while back. All I remember is that it was either severitus or just mentor Snape teaching Harry some kind of "soul magic" to defeat Voldemort through the horcrux/link. I think that the "soul magic" was a specialty of the Prince family. Harry uses this type of magic to "enter" Voldemorts soul I think.

Does anyone know it?
