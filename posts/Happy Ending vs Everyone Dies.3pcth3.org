Which endings do you like better? I know for most it depends on the story itself but I've noticed that in fanfiction there's a huge trend towards the happy ending. I realize this is likely because most fanfiction is wish fulfillment and no one really wishes to see a bad ending, but there's still very few Harry died to save everyone endings.

Personally I prefer the happy endings but ambiguous and bad endings have their place and sometimes those are much more interesting to read.


** Personally I always prefer happy endings to everybody dies. The reason is simple, the latter is too much like real life. For me reading (especially in the fantasy genre) is about escapism. I want to be in a different world, far away from the cares of my everyday life.

I like to read stories that have a happy ending because it's nice to believe that everything works out of the best in the end, no matter how dark things get there is always a dawn etc. Stories where everybody dies in the end or key characters die for seemingly no reason is a little too close to real life, and why read about something that is a close approximation to real life instead of just living yours?

*** Amen! I read stories as an escape from real life. In the real world people die and bad things happen to good people and nice guys finish last. When I read a story, I want everything to work out and for everyone to find happiness in the end. It's not "realistic", but that's the point!

** I pick C, an ending appropriate for the style and audience the fic was written for. If I'm reading a fluffy, superficial romance fic, then there's little reason one of the main characters should die. If it's a more substantial fic (romance or otherwise) with heavier and more serious issues, then death and dealing with it is not out of left field.

***** Very true, though I always got extremely annoyed when the story went that way. Also I don't at all agree that Romeo and Juliette is actually romantic, so I'm a bit biased.

******* I prefer it being called anything other than a bloody romance. I can't remember the amount of times in Middle/High school I heard some girl say they wanted a Romeo.

They want a fucking crybaby who kills himself when the girl he's known for two fucking days pretends to die.

What. The. Fuck.

*** This is true. This thought actually came from a mix of reading Backwards with Purpose and thinking about the ending of my own fic and how I think it should end. Right now I'm leaning towards the Waynes World option and just have two final chapters one with the happily ever after and one with the sacrifice to save the world.

**** I read a story like that. It had the happily ever after ending, but for some reason it just felt wrong. And then the story updated again with a real last chapter, and it turns out that the main character was in a coma and would never wake up and just imagined the "happily ever after" in the chapter before. It made me cry, but it was so beautiful. I've re-read the story a couple of times, but there's nothing like reading it for the very first time and having that ending come completely out of the blue and hit you right in the feels.

*** It's funny, tune travel is one of my favorite and least favorite sub genres to fanfiction. I love reading the different plots and characters and all the problems living in a different time (or alternate reality) can have...At the same time, I absolutely hate the too common time travel stories where all the things that happened in the past led to what happens in the future. It's my least favorite paradox because it's just so expected and so many writers do it as if it's this original idea.

What I want from time travel stories is usually a happy ending in the time they traveled too. Not one where they go back to their original time line having learned from their experiences, ghost of Christmas past style.

** I like happy endings, but at the same time I don't want the story leading up to it to be happy fluff. I want angst and injuries, morally dubious decisions and backstabbing, guilt and regrets... All of it leading to an ending where the characters got through the mess and the fog and can have a better life.

** Given the way the afterlife is depicted you could have both everyone die and a happy ending. I remember a slash story that did that. Major characters dead, Voldemort defeated and they all get to be happily together in the hereafter.

** I'm happiest when there are elements of both. Take canon, for example. In The Goblet of Fire, Voldemort achieves a major victory...but this is undone in part by Harry's survival and escape. In The Deathly Hallows, Voldemort is defeated, but at a price.

Anything too extreme on either side needs to be done with caution. A super-happy "everything is right with the world" can work, in the right context (Seventh Horcrux, romance, and so on), just as a dark ending can work out in other contexts (avoiding spoilers, but certain oneshots come to mind).

But generally I'm happier with somewhere in the middle.

** Depends what I'm in the mood for, and as Boomberrybella says, what's appropriate for the fic. Sometimes I want to have my heart broken. Sometimes I want the story to take me right to that painful edge and then pull back, saved by a plausible and hoped-for last-minute twist. Sometimes I want trials and tribulations that end in triumph, or in happiness.

I rarely ever want pure fluff, though. I need the dark streaks and difficulties to tug on my emotions. It makes the payoff even more satisfying.

**** Aw, thanks. :) I have a terrible tendency to go on for paragraphs, and I'm trying to be more concise lately.

One thing that occurred to me: I hope all those types of fic continue to exist and find an audience. I'd hate for writers to only pitch their stories at whatever is most popular at the moment. I'm fairly omnivorous in my reading habits, and I never want fandom to stop writing everything under the sun, including deathfic and tooth-rotting fluff. The variety is half the fun.

** When I read a story, I usually empathize with the protagonist, at least to some point - I walk in his shoes. To have him lose everything and die means that I experience the same sensation of defeat, and I don't like that. I am willing to suffer with the hero, but only with the expectation of catharsis. Otherwise, I am left empty, frustrated and feeling cheated. Not to say that I can't stand endings were bad things happen to the world or to minor characters, but if the hero wins only to lose everything that he lives for, then the entire quest is meaningless.

** I like an everyone dies sometimes, but usually i prefer my bad end fics to end before the bad end is explicit, at a low point, and the happy ending ones to end at a happy ending or high point.

I also like ones that're both. For instance, harry who's working with the voldemort horcrux is partially defeated and limps off into the sunset, frantically fleeing hogwarts, while dumbledore realizes his choosen one is contaminated with voldemort. What happens next?

Or, reincarnated voldemort brings in a new age of prosperity for wizardkind- and meanwhile muggles almost all die in a mysterious accident, for an example of both.

** It depends. One of my favourite fanfics ever, linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty), has a mostly happy ending that is contained within another (sequel) fic, but the ending as originally written is one of the most breathtakingly tragic endings I've ever read, and both, I think, are equally good.
