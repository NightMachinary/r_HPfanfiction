Basically a few days after Harry is delivered, show up at the Dursley household, get your foot in the door, and tell them about the stuff that goes on in the Wizarding World that a small child absolutely should not have to be dealing with. The sales pitch is basically “You don't want to deal with the kid. I can get him out of your hair, get him away from all of the stuff I just mentioned, and raise him properly. Everyone wins.” That done, create something to spoof whatever monitoring there is on Harry and move to a small, quiet town somewhere halfway across the globe. What flaws would there be in this plan?


** As much as Petunia hates Harry I think she'd think twice as to hand him over immediately. You know because of Dumbldedore's letter. Maybe she would write him. But perhaps that's just wishfull thinking. Anyhow, it wouldn't be long until it's noticed that Harry is gone. I can't imagine that no one checked up on him for at least the first few days and if I'm wrong ... well that's sad.

The flaw in that grand plan is, Harry would be a complete different person. So either you'd be causing hell with the consequences or you would be lucky and maybe everything wouldn't turn out too bad.

Personally, I wouldn't kidnapp Harry. What I would do is run to Dumbledore and spill the beans. Though preferably with some proof if possible.

** As much as I like the idea of somebody rescuing Harry from the Dursleys, I always can't help but think of the inevitable Dumbledore smackdown that would happen. Like, seriously, if Dumbledore really is the most powerful wizard of his time, I would /not/ want to get on his bad side like that. I mean, sure, he may not kill you, but that's not to say he won't take Harry back and obliviate all of the knowledge of Harry that you have just to ensure that you won't take him again.

**** I agree, but it's also possible that he didn't know all of the shit Harry went through before Hogwarts, given that he never personally checked up on Harry once. If that's true, though, I also imagine that someone taking Harry would be a blessing in disguise, if only because Dumbledore would smackdown the Dursleys too for their abusing and neglecting of Harry lol

** If you take the blood protection thing seriously, that would be a flaw. Then again, Harry never really considered Privet Drive home, so I don't see how that really worked in canon. Maybe take a sample of Petunia's blood on your way out, just in case. Keep it in the freezer.

*** I mean from what I gathered Dumbledore also had the ability to give Sirius a trail but we honestly don't talk about that. ALSO why hides under fidilus? Wouldn't the Potter wards (which have been around for centuries) be enoughor maybe even the malicious Black wards. Also did the Secret Keeper have to cast any spells? If not why not make baby Harry the Keeper, Cause I'm quite sure he was born before they went into hiding and if the magic of the oath would have had a negative consequence on his still developing magical core then couldn't James or Lily have done it? It's not like THEY were being hidden by the Fidelus it was only their location I'm sure

** I think the Dursleys have a condition that Harry has to visit them in the house a bit because of the thing Dumbledore set up.

Which is all about the blood relation right? So maybe if SI says ok so I need a vial of your blood and then somehow persuades Dumbledore or is somehow able to copy the ward thing so Harry is safe from those who wish to harm him then ye

Also wait somehow now I'm wondering how the fuck do the Dursleys not count as wanting to harm him lmao how'd that work in canon

*** I think Harry was normally supposed to stay there the whole summer. Other than HBP when I think Dumbledore finally acknowledges the abuse and takes him out of there within two weeks and DH when Harry comes of age midway through the summer, his departures are always circumstantial:

- CoS: he leaves because the Weasleys rescue him;
- PoA: he runs away;
- GoF: he only leaves for like a week;
- OotP: Dumbledore realizes he is not safe there and he needs to present himself for the hearing.

** Work in what sense? It's not really working in the sense of "this is an interesting story", for instance. Reading about an average person growing up averagely doing average things isn't an /average/ story, but a boring one. HP works because he's an orphan doing things on his own.

That aside, the protection mentioned by [[/u/herO_wraith]], and Petunia might not even agree to hand him over if she fears Dumbledore, so you'd have to take him by force. But the first is the big problem, as far as I am concerned.

** I would actually tell Petunia how Harry's accidental magic is bound to be 10x worse and more obvious than Lily's ever was. Neither she nor Vernon can or should try to deal with it. After that, I'd move Harry and Myself to America(not necessarily the US), or Australia. The more distance I can put between Harry and Riddle's wraith, the better.

Priority number 1 after that is to remove the Horcrux. Which in turn means this Harry will be completely different from Canon Harry. No Dursleys, no England, No Horcrux. Maybe even No Hogwarts, depending on where we are by the time harry turns 11. I mean, do magical schools outside of Europe even start at 11 years old?

*** Very good points. Set something up in northern Canada both for inaccessibility and fond memories. Fortunately, due to reasons that I'm not going to explain here because they're long and complicated, removing the Horcrux would be fairly trivial. And if Ilvermony's curriculum/school ethos is anything like Hogwarts, it would be easier to homeschool the kid.

** Maybe not retrieve Harry right away but arrange for Sirius's freedom maybe a trial or get Pettigrew (do we know exactly when Wormtail hid out with the Weasleys in Canon?) Then possibly have Grimmaud as a hideout or maybe a Potter property would have better protection than dubious blood protection.

** The flaw is there is now nothing that stops a Death Eater killing Harry. The Dursely's did actually provide protection as undeniably awful as it was for Harry.

Well done, you've given Harry a happier, but much shorter life. Canon knowledge tells you nothing about how the Ministry/Dumbledore/the wizarding world in general trace/track you and therefore nothing about how to prevent it.

Now Lestrange/Crouch Jnr/Malfoy/Any other Death Eater can just kill you and Harry.

*** The thing is the Dursley's protection is another example of Rowling half-assed writing to give Harry an excuse to go to his "horrid relatives". It's basically plot armor and just makes the villains even more cartoonish.

She didn't even specify how this protection work beyond vague words of false wisdom...

None of the Death Eater bothered to go after Harry for 10 years but suddenly they would know that Harry isn't under Dursley's protection anymore and go after him...

**** Yeah he also goes out shopping with petunia and goes to school and sees wizards bowing to him, the protection only works inside the house, not to mention all the summers he spend at Weasley house and Diagon alley sometimes like third year where the blood protection doesn't exist either

The blood protection is a load of shit in my opinion

** Thats just... boring. It's not a reasonable course of action. If you were an OC with canon knowledge, the time you spent raising Harry would be time you /could/ have spent tracking down and destroying all the Horcruxes. The Diadem wouldn't be too difficult, the gaunt ring could probably be handled, assuming it's at the gaunt shack, The locket would be a trick, but that just means you need to arrange Sirius Black's disappearance from Azkaban. The cup would be difficult, but Harry broke into Gringotts with a week of planning, imagine what you could do with ten years to plan.

Assuming I have some level of magical knowledge and ability, I'd pursue a career as an Auror or a hitwizard and engineer it so I could deliver Sirius a newspaper with a staged photograph that had Peter in it(I'd make sure to have already kidnapped Peter from the Weasleys, first). Once he'd broken out, I'd track him down and rehabilitate him, and then We'd hunt Horcruxes together. Once we eliminated all of the Horcruxes that we could, we would move to help Harry.

If there was some way to remove the horcrux from him without killing him, we'd pursue that, but failing that I'd probably toss him into an exploding volcano and then cast Fiendfyre at whatever remained. The needs of the many and all that. Engineering the exact circumstances that would allow Harry to live are complicated and would likely get many other people killed, which frankly I can't see how that's worth the life of one kid.
