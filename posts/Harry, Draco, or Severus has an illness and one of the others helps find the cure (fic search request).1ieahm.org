I'm looking for fanfics in which either Harry, Draco, or Severus has either an illness or has been cursed by something that is either known or unknown and one of the others (not into threesomes) helps them either cope or recover. Harry has to be a main character.

Examples: Harry is mute and Severus helps him find his voice.

Harry has been cursed with a mysterious ailment and Draco has to help him discover the cure.

Severus is in pain after being bitten by Nagini and Harry helps him out of his depression.


** Theres the fanfic Recnac Transfaerso by Celebony in which Harry gets cancer by saving a dying muggle by taking the cancer into himself. Its pretty good. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso]] Although if you're looking at stuff like this you might have already read this.

*** I'm almost positive I've already read this, but it's been so long that I'll have no problem rereading it. Thank you!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1664852/1/Circumstance][Circumstance]] has Snape falling ill from a curse, and while the story is not about Harry nursing him back to health, they have to travel together. Although, Snape doesn't get cursed until around a couple chapters in (iirc). It's a pretty good story, in my opinion, and it gets better closer to the end.

** You could try aspeninthesunlight's immensely long A Year Like None Other trilogy - [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][link to first story here]]. It's a long fic in which through various circumstances Snape ends up adopting both Draco and Harry. From memory, there is an incident (trying not to spoil) with Voldemort from which Harry is left terribly injured and Snape and Draco care for him afterwards. This is a large part of the story arc. Fic is very long but stick with it, it's worth it.

I'm not a fan of adoption stories normally but this fic is truly something special and there are no words to describe just how strongly I recommend it. Possibly the best fic I've ever read. Go read it :)

** You've probably read [[http://www.skyehawke.com/archive/story.php?no=2226][A Thousand Beautiful Things]] by Duinn Fionn. If you haven't...Lucius curses Harry and, after he dies, the curse manifests as Harry being extremely violent/insulting to everyone in the vicinity when the sun sets. Draco takes on the task of curing the curse. It's extremely wonderful.
