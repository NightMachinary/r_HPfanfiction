So, I came across "Enter the Dragon" due to one of the recent threads, and just from the summary, it wouldn't have sparked my interest. But seeing the enthusiastic reaction to it, I gave it a go and started reading. And kept reading. And just caught up this morning (it's a work in progress). And I find myself quite keen for more of it.

On one level, yes, it's the power fantasy that the title suggests. Harry had a magical accident as a child and is now a dragon, with multiple human and animal forms, ludicrous physical and magical strength and resilience, mage sight, perfect recall, intuitive understanding of all languages, and a /totally platonic/ harem that totally wouldn't be platonic if he'd actually gone through puberty. Standard Gary Stu fare.

But all of these things are /played for laughs/. From Harry's reduced mental age (dragons mature slowly) and consequent cheerful innocence, to levitated feathers breaking the sound barrier and embedding ashes into the ceiling from his overpowered magic, to the screams of Quirrelmort's spiritual remains being blasted out of Harry's digestive tract. It's a lighthearted romp through the wizarding world with a Harry who literally eats his problems for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

...Except when it's not lighthearted at all. This is a story that doesn't shy away from the darkness that logically follows on from canon. This is a story where Quirrelmort's attempt on the Stone included a gas attack that killed a whole squad of guards - and we get a segment from their perspective as they are blinded and burned and finally expire. This is a world where the powerful make their own rules, where outright slavery is in living memory and de facto slavery is still rampant. Where Dobby's cycle of disobedience and self-punishment is not just from a misguided desire to protect the Boy Who Lived, but is a calculated campaign to keep himself alert and aware of the injustice of his situation through constant pain, instead of lapsing into mindless submission. While dragon-Harry is consensually carrying off damsels to stop bullying in the dorms, there are much more sinister kidnappings in the world, some of which we see and some have been narrowly avoided.

All in all, this story surprised me with its depth. The humor is a welcome and necessary counterpart to the growing darkness, and the mixture was captivating. 4/5 stars.

** I personally agree with this recommendation, Enter the Dragon is such a good story. I think the best part of it is that for all of Harry's innocence (and he IS innocent, he still has a 10 year old mindset), he still realizes that the world he lives in is a terrifying world where the magical people dealt with forming their own 'world' by /mind controlling the rest of the world/. It's a world where Britain is progressive with outlawing slavery in 1963 and Vlad the Impaler rules most of Europe and the Middle East, and they love him as a Folk Hero for it (he's virulently anti-slavery).

*** The QQ version is both longer, more organized, and not dead. It died but was picked up by a fan (with the authors blessing).

or, in the words of the new author

"This is an expansion and continuation of Doghead Thirteen's story of the same name. I've been working on it, with the original author's permission, for some time now and posting on the CaerAzkaban Yahoo Group where the original author is a member. Given the much larger user base here, I'm hoping to get some additional feedback, as well as a place where the entire story can be read more easily than the increasingly difficult Yahoo Groups interface.

Well, that, and I thought some of you might enjoy the fruits of my labors as much as I do.

In chapter 2 there are some elements introduced from another companion story by Tsu Doh Nimh, Sort the Dragon, mostly a single character and the bones of a couple of scenes. It's a well-written one-shot if you care to check it out."

*** The forum version is over twice as long: the most recent update puts it at about 330k words vs 131k on ffn.

If you're reading it for the first time and anti-forums, Calibre's FanFicFare plugin has zero trouble converting into an ebook.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

**** It's more "mega-corporations rule the world" and it's a cyberpunk setting. I haven't started reading Enter the Dragon, but I saw it was a crossover with Shadowrun so it might take place in like 2050 or something.....or how they plan to incorporate the cyberpunk feel into the story.
