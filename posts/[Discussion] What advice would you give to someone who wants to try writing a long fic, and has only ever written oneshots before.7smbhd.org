Also, I haven't read the HP books for about two years, and been out of touch with the HP fandom in general for about one year. Should I reread the books? They're sort of a hassle to get since I borrowed my copies of PS and CoS to my irl friends, and they haven't returned them yet. (Friends who borrow books and take forever to read them)

Edit: I appreciate all your answers everyone. It seems I have to expand on my outline a bit now.


** It would not be detrimental to at least skim over the books before starting to plan your story. So you can refresh the actual information from the books, and not misconceptions from fanon. But it's not a must.

A tip (from someone who forgot this) to writing a story divided into chapters is: Planning. Write your base storyline and expand on what the major points of your story are. Having an idea for what the end is, is only second to having a good story.

For it is easier to work towards a goal, than to work towards the unknown.

Yes, I suppose I should reread the books. I've forgotten most of the finer details anyway.

I agree on the goal part. Even when writing one-shots, I find it hard to start without a clear end in mind.

*** I agree. It's a turn off when halfway through the story there's a great idea for a new direction for the story to go but it involves ignoring previous scenes in the story to make it work. Consistency is key. If you have better ideas make sure it's used in another story or rework the story.

** The golden rule: *WPD - Words per day.*

Set yourself a wordcount that you want to achieve per day. It doesn't even have to be a lot, it just has to be something you genuinely believe could survive the edit. Currently I operate on 400 words per day for the novel I'm writing. So /in theory/ I would take ~230 days to write the first-draft of a normal-sized novel. But of course, sometimes you write more and sometimes it turns out that several pages of your work suddenly suck, and so on and so forth. Creative Processes. The important bit is to */write X amount of words per day/* that you are happy with when you close the writing software.

If you're shaky with canon, re-reading bits and pieces might help. To be a bit out of touch with the fandom may even be a good thing as you don't get sucked into swirls of fanon.

*** I don't think this works for everyone. I have always found myself much better served by Words Per Week --- for example, for me, inspiration strikes in short bursts where I'll write 3000 words in a row at regular but spaced-out intervals, whereas I'm pretty useless at writing small chunks of chapter bit by bit (I can technically bring myself to do it, but the result sucks).

**** The eventual solution is always a subjective one. There is a reason why so many of these "How to get good at writing" tips of different authors contradict each other. There is some craft in writing, but to actually finish work is a process entirely up to the single person. We can only give tips and tell OP how it works for us.

This is very true. I once tried a very ambitious 700 words per day attempt, and burnt out after a week. Said fic remains never to be opened again to this day.

Since I have a busier schedule now, I'll try 300ish per day, and if that doesn't work, I'll try the words per week method.

****** The story plays four hundred years in the future. Almost all water has vanished from the world and the few people hard and tenacious enough to survive live on the dried out ocean floors, trying to make it day by day.

You follow Umy, a young scavenger hailing from one of the cities of the Atlantic deserts and Bertram, a soldier from the underground systems of US bunkers. The story begins with Umy getting a contract to look for US equipment on european soil, left there during the exodus from the continents. Betram is sent with her as an expert on the technology they are supposed to find. They soon find out that other scavengers are on their toes and a race for the boon begins. However, Bertram has his own agenda, their pursuers are not what she thought they were and the equipment more valuable than Umy had ever imagined.

Hmm... I think I'll have to work on this blurb when I'm done, but yeah... maybe that paints a picture.

If you want to know more, here is a [[/r/worldbuilding]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5ipib9/umys_scavenger_map_a_map_of_my_world_handdrawn_by/][comment thread]] about the world.

The story is about 50% into the first draft, which means around 50k words. Especially Bertram is going to be a tricky character in the edit.

** Make it longer than a oneshot.

Seriously though, I prefer to write after making an outline, detailing the outline, fleshing out multiple paragraphs from each bullet point in the outline then taking all of that and rewriting a story based on it that flows.

Sometimes I cannot stick to it because of characters or events just feeling better going a different direction.

Oneshots to me have always been a random thought or idea or quirk given form. Longer stories have been more about developing characters and worlds based on your starting idea. They require much more fleshing out of everything.

I wouldn't worry about being out of touch with the current fandom trends just write what you like.

Having a good editor/beta can help you with cannon issues, I like to have the books available to read or listen to incase im looking for a particular character trait or phrasing else I use the wiki or just google something.

This advice is similar to the one above except this part -

#+begin_quote
  fleshing out multiple paragraphs from each bullet point in the outline.
#+end_quote

I've never tried this before in my previous failed attempts at multi chapter fics. My outlines would be like half a page in the back of my uni notebook. I'll try expanding those paragraphs this time. Thanks.

Regarding the beta point, my country's native language is not English, so real life friends are out of question. Maybe I can ask the readers after a few chapters.

** I suppose you have an idea for a story which you feel needs more development than a one shot, so you need to plan it. Know where you want to start and finish and what will happen to avoid a 'soggy middle'. I always advise having a story fully written (or at least a complete first draft) before starting to post -- especially if you don't already have a track record of completing multi chapter fics. You might find it is harder than you expect.

However most people don't do that which is why a high proportion of fics are never finished. Some hardly seem to get past three or four chapters before they run out of steam. It really depends how important it is to you to finish.

*** Thanks for the advice.

I struggle with 'soggy middle's even in one-shots, but that may be due to my one-shots being a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing and unplanned. I'll make sure to plan out the middle meticulously this time. Thanks.

I appreciate the tip, but I don't think I can stay motivated enough to write out even the first draft of the story before posting. I know the frustration of following a fic only for it to be abandoned, so hopefully I manage to avoid that pitfall.

***** Honestly, I don't know for sure whether this time will be different, which is why I'm asking for advice here. However, in my previous failed attempts, I made it to like 3 or 4 chapters of the first draft before I got bored with writing. So I then edited those chapters, and when that became tedious, I tried writing again. After a few cycles of that, I abandoned the fics altogether.

I understand the downsides of not having a first draft ready. There can be plotholes, no, in fact, there probably will be some plotholes. Frankly, I'm not too concerned about them in this attempt, only for completion. Besides, reading old reviews always gave me the motivation to finish other abandoned one-shots anyway; I thought about applying the same thing here.

I'm quite sure the story won't flow as well though, so maybe if I complete this fic, I'll try doing a first draft for the next one. :)

** Just keep writing. Even if the words themselves aren't good. The important part is to just get a feel for it. Like, I probably wrote something like 250k words last year and very little of it is actual finished product.

*** For me, the writing part isn't that hard (although I struggle with that too, sometimes); it's the editing that comes after. Since I'm not a native English speaker, the dialogue I write feels clunky and unnatural unless I go through 2 or 3 rounds of editing. It's a rather time-consuming process, and real life gets in the way, so the fics become abandoned before they even get posted. :/

I'll try taking breaks when I know my schedule will be busy though. Thanks anyway. :)

**** Oh yeah, the editing part is the worst. It's really bad for me at the moment, since I'm in the processed editing chapters to my HP/SW fic, and I'm just burnt out on it. I still like what I wrote, but editing 50k words in a short span was really rough. I'm still editing stuff I wrote back in november, but I'm having a tough time putting the finishing touches on the remaining chapters I have ready.

So when I get bored of editing, I got back to writing, and then compounds the issue even more.

***** Yes, this is exactly what happens, except I go through that cycle many times before a fic is even finished (usually 3 or 4 chapters in) until I finally burn out and give up.

Good luck on your fic though. I can't even successfully edit on a chapter-by-chapter basis, I can't imagine what it's like doing a whole story.

** I'm a seat-of-the-pants writer. When I started writing HP fanfic back in 2004, I made myself stick to one-shots because I had a terrible habit of abandoning multi-chapter stories in other fandoms and I didn't want that to happen with HP. So I wrote a boatload of one shots, but kept them all in the same universe and after a while, I felt like I had enough of a world built up to sustain a multi-chapter work. I started it and got a few chapters in, and then quit. I'd never officially published it anywhere, just shared it in a few private groups, so I didn't feel too terrible.

I picked it up again in 2016 and finished it in 2017. I didn't do much planning because in the past when I'd tried it, all of the planning just kind of overwhelmed me and I felt stifled by it. For this, I put together a general outline of ideas and events I wanted to occur, major characters and their arcs and then I started writing. I had no idea how many chapters it would be (39 as it turns out) and I was okay with that.

So, my advice would be to at least plan the major parts of your story, including your final goal. Plan as much as you feel comfortable doing without overwhelming yourself. Don't be afraid to take breaks and write something else for a while. You're not on a deadline. If you're publishing as you go, keep in mind that you don't owe anyone updates on a specific schedule, unless you've said that you will be updating on a specific schedule.

Looking back on my experience with my monster, I wish I'd planned things out a bit better, but that's okay. I've done several chaptered works since then and I feel like I'm getting better at them. Plus, I'm having fun and that what this is all about.
