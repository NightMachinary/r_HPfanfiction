I've read a fair few marriage law fics and a few have been really good but every time I end up wondering what happens to gay witches and wizards during these laws. Assuming they're not trans are they told their sexuality doesn't matter and assigned a match anyway? Are already esbaslished same sex couples considered valid? Or would they be split up and have to reproduce with someone else? Does being gay count as a reason to not go through with the pairing?

I have admittedly seen a couple fics that were slash fics but they used the mpreg trope and im not a fan of that, I'd like to know if there are any fics that do it realistically or just mentions how gay people would deal with that kind of law.


** Closest thing I can think of is the status of wizard sexuality in the Firebird Trilogy. I'll let Rolanda Hooch speak for me:

#+begin_quote
  Finnigan gulped loudly. "That doesn't sound fun."

  "No, it isn't," Hooch said, wearing a smirk oddly reminiscent of Malfoy's. "Many elders of the Wizengamot over the years have learned this lesson when they fail speak according to their coven's wishes. I say this, because this is one of the expectations of being a wizard in our society. You will get married, and will at the have two spouses. There are only forty children in this incoming class. Last year, there were eighty four. Before that, there were one hundred twenty three. Bef one hundred fifty. This school was built to house and teach up to six thousand students at any one time. We have not had a student body above a thousand for generations, and that was when we were one of the only magical schools in all of Europe. Nor are we alone---Beauxbatons and Durmstrang also have experienc population losses, as have most of the magical communities in the world. We will explore many of the theories why in his class."

  She paused and looked at the boys in the room. "Next year's class is almost eighty percent witches. Four witches for every wizard, primarily because of the stre war, and the purposeful targeting of male children by You­Know­Who."

  MacMillan raised his hand until Hooch nodded to him. "What if you're a poofter?"

  Hooch sneered. "You get married and do your duty, and then you go seek whatever pleasures you wish if your coven so allows it."

  Harry sat up---day school teachers did not talk like that. "Make no mistake," the professor continued. "Wizarding society has its expectations, and those who fail those expectations are at best looked down upon. Our population cannot tolerate any behavior that would prevent a wizard from siring children. If someone of alternate sexual orientation fails to marry and produce a child, that wizard will be bound, veiled, and sent out among the Muggles. It is harsh, and for those raised outside modern Muggle society, a facet you may not be accustomed to. However, it is one of many necessities of our society. Now, open your books to chapter one, where discuss just what it means to be magical."

**** Yeah, but I honestly can't think of anything that comes closer to a marraige law fic where sexuality is a sticking point.

You are right, its abhorrent that something like this would exist (marriage laws). Like a lot of tropes, I see it as a shortcut to something else the author wants to happen but neither 1) considered its implications or 2) wanted to do a lot of work to make their story "happen." This is a bigger problem in shipping stories than anywhere else.

There is no incentive for them to leave most of the time except sex essentially, and this comes at the cost of near constant pain, being stripped of your magic, monitored for the rest of your life, and leading a constant double life that you can never talk about.

******** Three books linkffn(8629685;9646669;10373959):

The world is an AU where witches dominate males in terms of numbers but wizards are more powerful. When witches "bond" to wizards, they siphon off their magical ability to a degree. Since the witches are more numerous and wizards are generally more aggressive, multiple bonding are often mandated on wizards because they cannot be too powerful to disrupt society.

Its one of the most developed magical AUs I can think of, and it is one of the only harem fics I find I enjoy, mostly because the fic revolves around the idea of how bad harems are and trying to end their proliferation.

And the fic isn't homophobic; that passage is showing how insane their world is where they force people who have different sexualities to conform. In fact, thats one of the big moral messages of the fic.

***** The fic mentioned *wizards* having children with non-magical people. (Or at least, magical people with the ability to emit sperm. That series is not a good place to be trans.) Magical fetuses need magical wombs, or else they have a very large chance of miscarriage; magical infants need magical milk, or else they have a very large chance of dying.

Unfortunately, I believe the author forgot the possibility that *witches* might have children with non-magical people when writing that passage. Neither of the problems the author mentioned apply to a magical person giving birth to non-magical offspring.

There were enough cases of magic/muggle interbreeding for Professor McGonagall to state that only one in a hundred thousand male fetuses born to non-magical parents survive, so apparently some people aren't terribly squeamish about that kind of thing.

** This is a bit off topic but why is it called a Marriage Law? The whole point of such stories is that the population (for one reason or another) is in a decline and the magical community needs an uptick in the birth rate to increase their population. Last time I checked, you don't have to get married in order to have children, thus you don't have to get married to have in increase in the population. I know for /some/ stories, it is for the author to pair two people together that wouldn't have any realistic chance to get together in the first place if this Marriage Law hadn't been enacted (e.g. Charlie Weasley x Hermione Granger).

However, it would be a bit interesting if the magical communities followed that of their Muggle counterparts in terms of the birth rate. I know England's birth rate is 1.81 while France is at 1.88 (according to 2016 - 2017 statistics), and while both are below the 2.1 replacement level, they are among the highest in Europe.

*** Not just "some stories", but pretty much for all stories that don't treat the rape law as a rape law have the goal of achieving a pairing.

If they wanted to boost the birthrate, then simply offering financial or other incentives for having more kids would be the answer. Fine those without more than two kids, reward families like the Weasleys.

I don't really read this trope, so I don't have any fic examples, but I see no reason two wizards or witches couldn't have a child by some magical means.

Simplest solution seems to be for one of them to temporarily switch genders. I can't imagine there's not a potion for that.
