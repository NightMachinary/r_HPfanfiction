Bonus if Voldemort became the Teenage Tom Riddle Jr though that's not mandatory.

More sane then he was in canon, can still be insane, but maybe not as much? (If that makes sense)

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

For pairings (if any) am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc

NO! Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Would rather NOT have Harry be on Voldemort's side. Either on his own side or on Dumbledore's side.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) has a great Voldemort, but she's female.

Favourite Riddle I've ever seen is probably in linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) but she is also female.

Seventh Horcrux is a good one for male Riddle, and Prince of Slytherin is interesting, though we haven't seen a whole lot of him yet.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** He's very interesting in [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.]]

The Harry of this story is very arrogant, and makes major mistakes, including dismissing Ron as useless. That's not the story bashing Ron, though, that's Harry being foolish.
