** This would be pretty wild.

Hmmm no encroaching death means Snape isn't commanded to mercy kill him, all three Malfoys go into witness protection, Dumbledore maintains control of Hogwarts as the Ministry falls, Harry and company attend 7th year kinda sorta, going with Dumbledore to try and find Horcruxes whenever they can... Harry gets some (a LOOOT) of training so he can go toe to toe with Voldemort and actually win, or maybe tag teams with Albus for the final confrontation.
