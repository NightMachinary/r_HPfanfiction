I was reading a fic and had the sudden thought what if the prophecy was all made up in a desperate attempt to get the job. I don;t know if anyone has written such a fic but if not someone totally should.


** linkffn(Prophecy Smophecy by Driftwood1965) has that. I remember another one that had Dumbledore giving Harry a fake prophecy, but I don't remember if Trelawney had given a real one in that story. I also don't remember its name, unfortunately.

  Starts at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. As Harry stands over the dead body of Voldemort he realizes something. Bad Dumbledore. One shot.

** Remindme! 16 hours

I remember reading one where Harry talks to Trewlaney and she mentions that Snape interrupted her and Dumbledore and Harry realizes she shouldn't be able to remember that since it happens partway through. The author either uses this to show the prophecy was fake or that Snape knew the whole thing. I'll look into it later.

I've also seen a couple where Harry gets upset that his parents' deaths occurred due to the words of a known fraud, but those ones don't really push the fake!prophecy angle.

If it's the one I'm thinking of, it's linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) in which Harry goes over a few memories and realises that the story Trelawney and Dumbledore tell about the prophecy in canon literally cannot have happened the way it did, but that Trelawney's story, at least, is consistent with the presenting symptoms of the Imperius curse. And concludes that, if the prophecy /was/ genuine, it was given /much/ earlier than Trelawney's interview and the scene in the Hog's Head was a Dumbledore set-up. (I forget why, but Silently Watches also has Harry find out that it didn't even happen at the Hog's Head, but Dumbledore had rewritten a few key memories so everyone material to events thought so.)

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** There's actually a fair number of them, usually on the basis of why would Dumbledore hold an interview at the Hogs Head unless it was to deliberately leak the prophecy (sometimes the prophecy is real, other times Trelawney makes it up for the job and Dumbledore takes it and runs with it).

If I remember the titles I'll link them here, but it's not too uncommon in manipulative Dumbledore fics.

*** Actually, the Hogs Head makes a lot of sense. Aberforth is able to provide....some...form of security, and backup, it's private, quiet, and away from Hogwarts. Middle of a nasty war, and Voldemort was sending spies to apply - not a silly idea to protect castle from Death Eaters trying to sneak in.

** linkffn(Broken Wings by Snapegirlkmf) is a SS mentor fic where the entire prophecy sequence was theatrics by Dumbledore. SS knew this, but was, needless to say, not overly happy with the end result.
