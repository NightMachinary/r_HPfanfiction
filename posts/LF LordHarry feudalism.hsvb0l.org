It would likely be at ao3. It's a lord Harry situation, with dumbie bashing I think. The world had a feudalism-like system where Harry owe land that was worked and lived on by other people who where loyal to the lord. These people also had their own council who were hindered from contacting Harry, prob by dumbie.

That's all I can remember. Anyone know what this is? No idea if it was complete or not.


** Oh, I recently read one that had this. I'll have to try to remember the title.

Did Dumbledore also appropriate several houses on Harry's properties for the use of his followers, and the son (grandson?) of the prior steward couldn't afford to go to Hogwarts because Dumbledore removed the steward from his position?

**** I'm still looking. It would almost certainly have been on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], with a slight possibility of ao3. Don't lose hope yet; I posted a "finally found it" about 3 weeks later for another story whose name I couldn't remember.
