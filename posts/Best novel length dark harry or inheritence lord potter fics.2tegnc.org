Hi guys I have read a lot of harry potter fanfics and I'm looking for some good novel length either dark harry fics or when harry becomes lord potter or lord black or both and suggestions would be greatly appreciated


** harry potter and the dark's rise is pretty good and completed. 203k words. harry is a few years older then in canon and is sorted in to slytherin.

** Well... in my opinion, the best Dark!Harry fanfiction is definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey]]. It has 268k words and is complete. It has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][sequel]] too, although that is abandoned (but still has over 200k words and was adopted by someone else).

As long as you can live with the fact that the story contains some HP/TR Slash (although that's not the main focus) I'd highly recommend it.

** Well, there's "The Only True Lords". I thought the set-up was well done, but stopped reading it because I felt like the pacing was too slow to wait between updates. I believe its finished now, and also on A03

** I've been suggesting it a lot lately, but, holy cow I just read both books and I was lazy, had no school or a lot of work, and I just realised the magnitute of how much I read... So you'll be in for the long haul with this one.... [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset Over Britain]] Its the first in a series of 2 about Lord Harry Potter-Black. But so much more. Like wow, each chapter is about 30-35 pages... and about 29 chapters each. So have fun! (Ron and Dumbledore bashing, but pretty well done and it is not what the authors usually do, it was a creative exercise of theirs)
