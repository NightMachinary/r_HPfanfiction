I've been rereading the series and I think it'd be pretty interesting to get inside Ron's head.


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot][Six Foot of Ginger Idiot]]/ by Pinky Brown | linkffn(3637489) looks at the events of /Half-Blood Prince/ (with a few divergences however I believe) from Ron's perspective. It's a decent read all around; it's in an epistolary format, which you may or may not enjoy. (Essentially, it's told in a series of diary entries ranging from July 1996 to June 1997)
