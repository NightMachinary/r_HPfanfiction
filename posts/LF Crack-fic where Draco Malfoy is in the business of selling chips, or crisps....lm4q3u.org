Hello,

It's been a while since I last read this fanfic, but all I remember is that it wasn't very serious, and it included Draco Malfoy getting into the business of selling chips that are magically infused to taste better, or something like that. I'm sorry if that's not a lot to go off of.

Thank you,

IamtheDoc1/That_Guy

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

** Weirdly enough, I actually remember this one.

I can't remember the title, but if it's the same fic there's a whole scene that's essentially the same dialogue of Walter and Jesse's first cook on Breaking Bad, and his motivation is to make enough money to buy an Audi.

He also gets shipped with Ginny.
