** linkao3(Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed) Their daughter is Harry's half sibling and Lily/James die like in canon. Both her and Harry are children who lived and she doesn't find out that James isn't her biological father until later in the fic. She does grow up and live with Snape though.

**** Seriously? That sucks. I found a cached version of part 1 though. Type in google "Red sorrow archive of our own". Then (on desktop version at least) there is a little arrow next to the link where you can select "cached". If you click download from the ao3 page you can get a full pdf or epub version of part 1 (up to chapter 82).

Here is link to part 2 (the 6 chapters that the author posted) [[http://fanfics.me/ftf305528]] It's a russian site, but it has English text, just click on chapter titles.

That's really too bad though. I wish authors wouldn't delete their fics.
