:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am pretty sure it's an AO3 fic I read years ago. Some plot points I seem to remember: Sirius was alone on a reconnaissance mission of some sort and was ambushed; the death eaters brought him to a house; James and another person (Peter?) went to rescue him and caught a guard or a minor death eater; they needed to get information from him and James had to do an Imperius, although he was really really upset and disgusted by what he did; there was a very nasty OC death eater who held a grudge against Sirius; Sirius managed to get out of his bonds by transforming into Padfoot and met the rescuers on the way out; and there was background wolfstar I think? I'm not entirely sure though.

Please help! It stuck in my head and I can't find it anywhere.


** I'm 98% sure this is it

And if it isn't, this is a very similar story you'll enjoy anyway!

  The reality of the war against Voldemort finally hits home for the Marauders when Sirius is captured during what should have been a simple mission for the Order.
