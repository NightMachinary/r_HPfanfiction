** Personally, I don't really care that much either way. However, as the vast majority of fanfic authors are amateur writers, it is much easier to write compelling drama with someone like Draco because J. K. Rowling has already given all the pieces. On the other hand, Ron doesn't have much relationship drama baked in other than his immaturity.

No Ron hate though. He's one of my favorite characters.

*** That actually makes sense, thanks!! Ron is my favorite character too. I still prefer Romione though.

** Personally I prefer Canon compliant stuff but people ship ships like Dramione for all sorts of reasons and they don't have to justify why they enjoy it. Let people fic in peace.

Statements like this:

#+begin_quote
  Canon is the truth, don't fic your way through it
#+end_quote

Are deeply unhelpful and gatekeeping.

**** Just ask why people like dramione then, if you're really interested.

I mean - I do get it, I stick to canon compliant myself and have never really "got" AU but I think the fandom could benefit from people being kinder to one another and not shitting on one anothers ships all the time.

** A ship is a ship, it doesn't need to make sense especially if the ship is Fanon, that means each author writes its own plot to make it make sense.

I don't get why you want to compare two entirely different pairings ? Like what's the point ? Dramione doesn't make more sense than Romione, and Romione doesn't make more sense than Dramione, generally speaking, to each their fandom and to each their fictional works (I prefer to read Dramione because I find that the number of very good quality fanfictions higher)

If you stick to Canon, which i understood from your post then of course Dramione doesn't make sense, just like any other fanon pairing.

#+begin_quote
  (Canon is the truth, don't fic your way through it)
#+end_quote

That's the whole concept of fanfictions,if everything sticked to Canon, it would have been really boring.
