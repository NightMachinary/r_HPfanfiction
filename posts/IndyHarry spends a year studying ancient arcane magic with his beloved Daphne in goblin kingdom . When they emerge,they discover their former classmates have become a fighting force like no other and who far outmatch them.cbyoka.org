** Harry turned to Daphne in exasperation.

"Well damn," he said. "If I knew they'd get off their asses and actually /do/ something the second I disappeared, I'd have done this first year!"

Daphne shook her head in wonder, and replied.

"I wonder why Dumbledore decided to kill everyone? Isn't he known for second chances?"

"Eh," Harry said, his tone conveying obvious disinterest. "Doesn't matter. We trained in the Magicks of the Ancient Arcane, and yet somehow these fifteen other teenagers apparently outclass us, /and/ managed to destroy all of Voldemort's forces."

Daphne nodded, "We must've ended up in some kind of alternate reality. We only have a fighting force of Goblin warriors and Arcane Magicks behind our backs, we're definitely outmatched by this child army Dumbledore has created from your study group."

"Always knew he was bonkers."

With that, they turned on their heels, and walked back into the bank. Things were obviously under control. It was time for a vacation.

*** Hermione: Harry... you studied the Magicks of the /Ancient/ Arcane? Spells and techniques that were obsolete before Hogwarts was founded? Would you pick the very first broom ever made, or your Firebolt? Then why would you study ancient magic, instead of the very best new spells?

Ron: Mate... I told you, you can't trust Slytherins. Even if they aren't lying to you, they are stuck in the past.

**** Harry rolled his eyes at them and said, "Well, I guess Merlin wasn't that great of a wizard, was he? He was using magic so far outdated compared to us, that he must barely be a first year in knowledge. Dumbledore must /hate/ being compared to him."

***** Hermione: Harry, Merlin was the greatest wizard - of his time. But magic was much less advanced back then. And yes, he was using magic that we wouldn't consider impressive - but he was far ahead of his peers, and that's impressive. Did you really sleep through history of magic? Among his most famous deeds were the creation of the precursors of modern Portkeys, for example. Precursors, Harry.

****** "Well Hermione, guess you got me. I'll just go back to studies of the Arcane, and ancient rituals, and all my buddies that hold a monopoly on all the money available to Wizarding kind. Those same rituals Voldemort has been using to make sure he can't die? Those are pretty ancient," Harry responded with a sigh. "Guess that knowledge isn't useful though, because you said it isn't. It's obviously evil, but I didn't know that you had new magic available to you that allowed you to not die."

He tapped his chin for a second, as if thinking, before he responded again.

"You'd best stop taking Ancient Runes, I mean, Ancient is in the name. Sorry that you've been wasting your time there. Hogwarts' enchantments are ancient too, guess they need to be taken down and done up with new stuff. The Sorting Hat, I hear you say? Nope, ancient. Made by people that were around before Hogwarts. He's useless."

******* Hermione: Harry, actually, yes - Dumbledore's think-tank, which I was a member of, found ways to undo all of Voldemort's rituals. How do you think we beat him? Also, did you honestly think he couldn't die? If ancient secrets were so powerful, why aren't we surrounded by hundreds of ancient wizards and witches? And ancient runes isn't really useful unless you like reading old texts and scrolls - which, I'll have you know, I enjoy. Especially now that I don't have to focus on helping to defeat Voldemort.

Ron: Mate, you studied with the goblins? Did you forget that they lost every damn war with the wizards? If they held the secrets to such power as you claim, wouldn't you think they had won a war or two?

******** Harry shook his head at his two friends. They just didn't seem to understand.

He gave Hermione a look of disappointment, and said, "Hermione, a lot of people do know about them. Slughorn taught Voldemort about them. People just aren't stupid enough to go around killing people are ripping their souls to shreds. Muggle board games even mentions the fucking things."

He ran his hands through his hair, /had she always been this difficult?/

"And why do you like reading them? They're full of ancient knowledge, and you've already said that it's useless knowledge. You're not going to convince me that knowledge used to build Hogwarts, enchant it with nearly impenetrable defences, and have it make a room that can be anything you need, is useless. Stop trying."

He turned to Ron after that, this time in actual anger.

"Ron, /mate/, if they've lost every single war they've faught against us," he took a moment to draw breathe, and then continued with a shout. "/Why do they have a monopoly on all of our money?/"

Edit: Also, this is where I stop responding. Ancient magic doesn't have to be outdated. You also kinda ignored most of the stuff I brought up.

********* Ron rolled his eyes

"OK,mate. But the fact of the matter is; all your fancy arcane magic and tiny little minions means literally nothing now. While you were all underground in the hovel you call a kingdom,Bill and his Curse Breaker buddies manages to break through every vault in Gringotts and loot them to help us with the war. The goblins have nothing and if they have another rebellion in mind.."

Hermione cut in

"Lets just say,Ginny is eager to test out her Slicing Curse on some non-human targets. We also have hundreds of trained wizards,fiercely loyal house-elves,dozens of trained dragons,the support of every other magical nation and new combat spells being developed daily. The goblins have axes and rusty armour."

********** What a moronic response. Good try, man. This is why I stopped where I did.

You can try as hard as you want, but you didn't specify any of the stuff you just said. You said the DA was an 'elite fighting force', (Teenagers, remember). The Goblin nation, from all that we know, is the only Wizarding bank in the world. And just because Harry studied Arcane magic doesn't mean he forgot his schooling, or that Goblins don't also have a fucking cutting curse. Goblins obviously have magic, they're just not allowed a wand.

Bill and his Curse Breaker buddies, that all work for Gringotts, broke into Gringotts and stole literally everything? While the Goblins were around? With their dragons? Hope none of the people that have money in those vaults find out the 'good guys' just stole all their shit.

New combat spells developed daily? Uh, no. Where are all these new geniuses coming from? They've been studying the same spells for decades, and all of a sudden they make new ones every day?

Harry has loyal House Elves. Hermione was so intense about freeing them they avoided wherever she happened to be in canon. Not sure they plan on helping her causes.

********* Hermione: Uh, Harry... Voldemort brought down the defences of Hogwarts in a single spell. But that aside, why do you think that the founders of Hogwarts would have kept their knowledge from their students? They made a school to teach all they knew, so the knowledge would spread. And it did. And we improved on it. You'd have known that if you had ever read Hogwarts: A History.

Ron: Becuase someone found it'd stop them trying to start a war every few decades. But if they ever won a war, why do you think they aren't allowed wands? We're nice, but we're not stupid.

********** Sorry, I'm breaking my promise not to respond.

Voldemort brought down the defenses with the Elder Wand. A wand he can't have, because Dumbledore is alive in this prompt. Don't forget, all of his Death Eaters had been trying to bring them down in force.

You also don't give the losers of war a monopoly on minting and holding your money. The people with all the money, and the ability to restrict the money and economy, are the people that win wars.
