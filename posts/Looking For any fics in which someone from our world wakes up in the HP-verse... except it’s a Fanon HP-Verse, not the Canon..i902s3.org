** Our long time sub member [[/u/UndeadBBQ][u/UndeadBBQ]] wrote this piece a while ago and I think it's brilliant:

"You're a muggle!?"

"Yes," I answered the millionth time. At this point I had figured out where I was, as well as when. The why still eluded me, but Rowling was never quite that specific when it came to magical theory. Pity, really, as right now I could've used some intricate knowledge of alternate-universe-magic. However, that had long since gone to the back of my head. Sitting here among people I only knew as fictional characters before seemed to be the matter of greater importance.

Some nameless dude of the Order of the Phoenix was about to repeat the circle of "Muggles can't know anything to help us", so I decided to end this right here and there. "If I understood you guys correctly, you summoned me to help you against Voldemort?"

Some flinches, gasps, some wide eyes. Rowling was spot on with her descriptions. They really were afraid of the name. Odd.

"Correct, Mr...?" Dumbledore asked. Truth be told, the man was intimidating, if you knew what he could do. The realization that the most powerful, defacto demigod stood in front of you took a while to sink in. I doubted it would every truly make sense to me.

"Call me... Undead. Its probably the most relevant name I have for whats about to happen." I took a breath and let it out slowly to focus up. "First off, I need some details on the timeline."

"The... timeline?" Tonks was visibly confused.

"I already told you. You argued that you summoned someone from some kind of Multiverse. I come from a universe in which your story is written down in a seven book series. Now I need to know where in the series we are."

"Makes... sense? I guess." Tonks shrugged.

"No it doesn't." Harry mumbled. Now he was an angsty little shit if I've ever seen one. Was I like that as a teenager? Ugh. But then again, if you've gone through what he had gone through, you kinda earned the right for some little angst.

"Anyway," I began. "Since you guys summoned me into Grimmauld Place, I guess the Triwizard is over and the Big Bad has gotten himself a body, right? Harry has won the thing and Cedric Diggory is dead?"

"So far," Dumbledore nodded. Harry flinched as I mentioned Cedric, so I'm guessing the mental wound there is still pretty fresh.

"Sirius isn't dead, so I'm guessing Harry is about to enter his fifth year, Dolores Umbridge is going to be the Professor against the Dark Arts and the Daily Prophet is running the most obvious smear campaign in the history of journalism to discredit Dumbledore and Harry? Had the trial yet?"

Now that was a lot of information to unpack for them, I understood. I gave them a few moments to chew through it. Eventually Harry answered that the trial was over and he was allowed to continue doing magic. Good.

"Cool. Now lets go and kill us a Dark Lord, shall we?" I grabbed some paper... ehm... parchment from the table and picked a quill out of Hermione's hand. I always wanted to do that. I quickly wrote down some bulletpoints, and thank the Lord I had calligraphy lessons, otherwise that quill would have been utterly useless for me.

"So... the Horcrux," I began just to be immediately silenced by Dumbledore. Silencing spell. Nothing I could do, being a muggle and all.

"Horcrux?" Shacklebolt asked. I felt the spell released. The secret was out, there was no reason to keep me silenced, I figured.

"Yes." I answered the Auror. "Soul containers made by cold-blooded murder, that hold a splitter of the caster's soul making him immortal. Nifty stuff. Now take notes, lads, because imma send ya'll on missions to lay some Fiendfyre. Team 1, Sirius, Harry and Tonks. Go find Kreacher, make him give you the amulet given to him by Regulus Black and destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor. Procure that first, obviously. Then Harry says "Open" in parsel and Sirius cleaves the thing in half. Tonks stuns anyone who may fall prey to Voldemort's soul. Team 2, Bill, Fleur and Shaklebolt, you go to Little Hangleton, to a small hut previously owned by the Gaunt family. Burn it down with Fiendfyre. Team 3, Mr. Weasley and Dumbledore, you need to convince the Goblins to let you into the Vault of Bellatrix Lestrange and get Hufflpuff's Cup. Thats a Horcrux too. Team 4, Hermione, Ron and McGonagall, you need to get into the "Room of Hidden Things" and find a Diadem owned by Rowena Ravenclaw. Destroy it with Fiendfyre or wait for Team 1 to be done with using the Sword. Also destroy the Vanishing Cabinett in there while you're at it."

The room was stunned, of course. No suprise there.

"I think Harry should go to the Goblins." Hermione said through the collective silence.

"Why?"

"After all, he has been named Friend of the Goblin Nation by Ragnok when he..."

"Wait," I fell back into my chair. No, it couldn't be. "Wait, wait, wait... Harry, whats your full name?"

I prayed at this point, but it was not to be.

"My name is Lord Harrold James Potter - Black - Gryffindor the Third, Heir to the Potter name."

"I see..." was all I could say. So I wasn't in Rowling's books, I was in some shitty Lord Potter fic. To be quite honest, that was rather convenient. Yes, when I thought about it, it was truly a strike of luck. "Well, then everybody disregard their missions. Harry go to the goblins and then just do whatever you feel like."

"W-What... why?" the young boy asked.

"Because you're Lord Potter." I said, leaning back. "Who are the girls you're about to marry?"

"How did you...!?"

"Daphne Greengrass, is my first bet. Susan Bones, too?" Both times I got a slight, gobsmacked nod from Harry. "Tell her to speak with her aunt about Sirius or something. For all I know they may even had a fling before."

Sirius blushed. Right about that one, again.

"And third?" I asked, but then just grinned and pointed at Hermione in question. A shake of his head. I pointed to Ginny. Another shake of his head and a very annoyed huff by Mrs.Weasley. Aha. Love potion fic, then. I pointed to Fleur. Harry nodded.

What a shitfest. I loved it.

"Well, mate you got yourself a horcrux in your head. Let that be fixed by the goblins and then just move on along until..."

My sentence was cut short by a green bolt slamming against my chest while Dumbledore shouted some incoherent stuff about the Greater Good.

*** Lol I absolutely love that ending. It's always funny when manipulative Dumbledore fics have Dumbledore do some of the most stupid thing ever all in the name of greater goodness. I mean, he's suppose to be smart right? Especially when they give him poor emotional control

I remember a terrible fic where Dumbledore was so mad that Harry didn't befriend the Weasley like he planned, that he exploded his office. Imagine getting so worked up about an 11 year old boy's friendship!!

** I know there was one when Harry Potter and Daniel Radcliff get switched in their respective worlds. If I recall correctly, Daniel Radcliff proceeds to make fanon Harry decisions as opposed to the canon Harry, but I can't remember its name for the life of me. Maybe someone can help.
