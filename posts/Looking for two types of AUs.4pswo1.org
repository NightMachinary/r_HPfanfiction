1) An AU in which Arthur Weasley dies from Nagini's attack in OotP

2) An AU in which Snape and Lily get together and make Harry, and the divergences that would result from that. Not looking for a Snape/Lily romance, Snape being Harry's secret father, or Lily starting up a romance with Snape after James dies. I want a world in which Snape and Lily never had that falling out in the first place.

  Snape and Lily ... divergences that would result from that
#+end_quote

imo, there would need to be a lot of significant divergences from cannon before that. For one, sorting Snape and Lily to the same house. (Getting Snape away from Slytherin and thereby Voldemort's influence or subjecting Lily to the same pressures). But from there, there would potentially be some interesting consequences, since either Snape would be removed from the spy effort or both Lily and Snape would be entrenched in that. The latter could be intriguing. It might take a bit of wrangling to establish a child in that situation as the prophecy child (with blood protection). But, imagine a Harry who learns that his dead parents were spies working against Voldemort. That's kind of an interesting premise.

  Arthur Weasley dies

I could see this as a beginning to a Percy redemption story, where the ministry hushes up the death and casts aspersions against Arthur. As a result, Percy - separated from his family - struggles with increased isolation and guilt.

*** UrTwiN, he's talking about an AU where Lily never got together with James, where Snape likely never committed actions which would have driven Lily away, etc. Anything you're projecting onto that wouldn't be there because he'd have to be a completely different person.

**** My thoughts exactly. I can't stand it when people trash other people's likes and preferences. Like, how old are you even? Because even my five year old niece knows better than to put down what other people like just for the heck of it.

Again, did you even read the post and can you hold in your knee-jerkiness for two seconds and actually read it

******* Apparently it confuses /you/, since none of that implies

#+begin_quote
  You want Lily to hook up with the man that is responsible for her husband's death, and the man who joined a Dark Lord who wants to wipe out all muggleborns.
#+end_quote

But wait, that would require thinking about it. Sorry, my bad.

In the meantime you might want to look up what "AU" means.

******* The OP is looking for an AU where Snape isn't a jerk and doesn't go down the death eater path at all.
