  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

** linkffn(Witches Secret by Selector)

If the 562k words is too daunting for you, it basically has two stories of about halved length each.

It's also a massive harem...like every woman in the wizarding world...plus two preteen werewolves who Harry bangs in wolf form...plus a female goblin in which Harry also transforms into a goblin to bang...plus a vampire queen...plus banging Fluer as she turns into a bird.

It's definitely an odd one. But it also has Harry & Co. creating their own school.

  The Wizarding World is confronted with a problem they never had to face before. The consquences of their own arrogance and bigotry. After Hogwarts lost dozens of students each year, they try to change things again. But what do you do if you realise that things aren't that easy? Sequel to Screw Them
