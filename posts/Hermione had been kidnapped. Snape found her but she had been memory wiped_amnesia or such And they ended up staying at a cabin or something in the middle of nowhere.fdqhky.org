It was ages ago that I read it. I don't know if it was ever finished, I think it was on fanfiction.net

I don't think it was Death Eaters who kidnapped Hermione, I think it was Snatchers or another group of people? Ron and Harry were really worried and Snape ended up being the one to locate her for some reason, can't remember why exactly.
