The students are near snapping from the culinary monotony. The only person who didn't noticed was the head boy Percy Weasley he was too busy studying to actually realize what was on his plate. Which for his girlfriend Penelope was somewhat concerning, And Mrs. Weasley started mailing parcels daily of whatever food stuffs were available majority of Gryffindor tower was subsisting On corn beef sandwiches made by Ron's mum And whatever the hell Augusta Longbottom Was sending Neville. The Longbottom matriarch was doing a tour of the American south and most of the food packages consisted of something called collard greens and turnip slices it was edible mostly.

​

There were whispers of a coup Slytherin was trying to import their own house elves to do the cooking and the headmaster was awol For most of the year.

​

Finally someone gave and professor sprout took over the Quidditch pitch Before the season even began and Neville helped make suggestions And teach his fellow third years about farming. It made for an interesting Quidditch season as Harry kept crashing into the corn whenever He had to make a dive for it. Draco Malfoy claimed the scarecrow that had somehow taken up residence in the far end of the pitch most likely erected by the Weasley twins was haunted and giving him the stink guy every time he mounted his broom, No one could verify this though they did see it blink a few times so naturally everyone avoided that area at least until harvest.

​

Neville Started doing a weekly progress report along side the Jordan whenever a match was played, He would hear Quidditch commentary and then The farmers almanac update as every goal was made.

​

No one really talked to Hermione besides Harry and Ron until They finally found a pastry chef that was human to take over the Hogwarts kitchens, But steel as the year persisted every potato, Carrot and piece of corn the students ate with some thing they grew themselves. It became something of a Hogwarts right of passage to make the first years grow vegetables themselves. As magic could only increase your food supply it couldn't make it From nothing


** You do realise that the upper years and the teachers can transfigure the food into whatever they want and eat it.. You cannot get it from nothing but you can transfigure it a bit right.

*** And if it reverts (or you're hit with a counterspell - it can be in Saint Mungo's after a transfiguration related accident, or just a general counterspell to reverse a prank jinx) while the food is still part of your body?

It's not mentioned in books, but neither is transfigured food in the first place. But somehow, no one ever does that. Not Hagrid, not Weasleys, not Dumbledore. Only ever replication, never changing, never creation ex nihilo.

**** "It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some --" "Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting," said Ron. (DH pg. 293/241)

I will believe the cannon lore. Thank you very much.
