Such as:

** I don't think you can beat Esama's D.S.S. Requirement linka03(3412346) in which the Room provides the DA with a spaceship. It's pretty amazing.

** I remember one or two where they use the Room to create a doorway into another part of the castle, or even onto the Express. Also creating a sort of window into other parts of the castle to spy on people. I'll see if I can find them when I get home.
