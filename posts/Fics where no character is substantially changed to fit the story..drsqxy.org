I notice alot of fics completely change a character to fit there fic (for instance, Ravenclaw Harry for H/Hr, or flat out EVIL Dumbledore which is like, What?!)

So I'm looking the best BEST fics which don't change the characters to much. Preferably finished or still being updated.

Thanks in advance.

** You may have read it, but I found that linkffn(Grow Young With Me) has excellent canon-compliant characterisation. Although it hasn't been updated in 9 months, it is not abandoned, and the author has said she is close to finishing the next chapter.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
