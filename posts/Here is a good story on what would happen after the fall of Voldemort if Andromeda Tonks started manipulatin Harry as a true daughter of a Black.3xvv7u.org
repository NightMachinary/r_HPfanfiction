** Why the fuck does the author have harry fucking Adromeda in the very fist chapter? why does the author have harry beheading the goblin King as some insane blackmail plan? the answer is because this is a shit story and I have no idea how you would consider anything in it worthy of recommendation.

to all those that haven't read this sorry excuse of a story, don't it represents the very worst of fanfiction

** I'm sorry, but I've only read a few paragraphs and the writing is clunky and awkward, especially the dialogue. It's an interesting concept that could have a lot of potential, but needs a beta.
