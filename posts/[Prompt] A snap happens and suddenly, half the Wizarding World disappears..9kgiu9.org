** Mad have planned power grabs at the ministry, witches and wizards ignoring the statue of secrecy trying desperately to locate their loved ones. Any remaining Death Eaters would take advantage.

** I've been expecting all sorts of crossover from the Snap ever since it happened, is this really not a thing yet?

I spent way too long rolling a die for survival/death of the wikipedia character list ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13074357/2/Not-Quite-What-You-Meant]] if anyone wants to borrow said survival/death list) and will write with it later. [posting from work atm]

**** I haven't time to make it a full-on story, already committed to way too many stories to keep up with, but here's an additional alternate short: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13074357/4/Not-Quite-What-You-Meant]]

Quite a different tone, methinks, but I had fun with it. :-3

This premise really is 'infinite' and I remain stunned that it isn't a cross-franchise megachallenge yet. It feels like it should have been.
