I've always been a huge fan of linkffn(quirrell drabbles and short fiction by jalen stryx), but this morning I discovered [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/488582][Adrift]] which is an MCU/HP crossover and I kinda love it. And I just realized the common denominator is Nagini.

â€‹

So, anyone know other good, or at least decent, stories with Nagini as a major part? I tend to prefer gen, but I'll read just about anything.

Thanks! :D
