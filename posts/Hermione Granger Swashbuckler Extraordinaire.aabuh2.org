While "researching" for my pirates RPG I'm running next month, I stumbled across the name Stewart Granger. He was a Hollywood actor who specialised in swashbuckling films with epic duelling scenes [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kscmk_dusLc][such as this one]]. I had the crazy idea of what if this was Hermione's grandfather, who taught her everything she knows? :') Have fun!


** I thought this was because Hermione's birthday was September 19th, which is International Talk Like a Pirate Day.

** Holy crap, never seen this before and it's so obviously the inspiration for the fight between The Man in Black and Inigo Montoya. Thanks for posting that clip!

** Am glad for you that you discovered Stewart Granger! If you haven't yet, you really ought to watch that version of /The Prisoner of Zenda/ in its entirety. Not only is the duel scene superb, but it's an engaging story, with terrific dialogue and great actors. Not only is Stewart Granger a good swashbuckler, but he can also be extremely funny.

*** I've seen it when I was much younger, so I didn't know the names of any of the actors until today! I would definitely like to find a copy to see it again, though.

** Funnily enough, in linkffn(The Rapier: A Fine Tension by ChelleyBean), Hermione was taught fencing by her grandfather.

*** Thank you so much! I asked a fencer on here a while back if they'd found any fics which include either fencing itself or a fencing-inspired approach to duelling, but no luck. I'm very excited to check this out!

**** Glad to be of service. May I recommend a substantially longer (although sadly incomplete) fic by the same author, linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), which features a fencing-inspired approach to duelling, among other things?

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.
