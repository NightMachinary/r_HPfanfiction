Fics where the trio or just Harry get start training and preparing for Voldemort or any other threat. Where there ‘adventures' have forced them to grow up. No slash no bashing


** In terms of handling divergence from canon and the cohesion of the trio, nothing does it better than that fic. Sorry.

If you're looking for magical training montages without bashing (clarification: not direct montages but a general plot of learning more magic), try *Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* or *The Pureblood Pretense.* Neither feature the trio.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** I was hoping for the preparation and the consequences of such actions being central to the fics rather than a montage and then onto the drama.

**** That's closer to what I mean. Both of these fics are good enough to avoid straight training/study montages. In each there's a reason for why Harry seeks out additional training/knowledge and in both (but particularly Pretense) there are consequences for him doing so. Neither of them are really "montage and onto the drama;" I was using that more to describe the general sense of the fic, which in all 3 cases is a plot of character progression for the sake of necessity.
