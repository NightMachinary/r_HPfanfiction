Looking for good fics that feature a Harry that owns/ rules over hogwarts or has control of the wards. OP is great I love good op fics! Not looking for anything in particular any recommendation is welcome just like this prompt!


** I can think of a few where Harry becomes a lord, but only one or two where Harry owns Hogwarts...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1/Ah-Screw-It][/Ah, Screw It/, by mjimeyg]] - a crossover with /Stargate SG1/, but it largely takes place in the wizarding world. I found it a bit refreshing in that there /is/ Dumbledore bashing, but the plot ultimately moves past that.
