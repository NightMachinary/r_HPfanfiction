Hello there fine folk. As somebody who would like to try out in writing fanfiction i have three questions for you guys.

1. Since i am rusty on lore is there any other site except the Wikipedia where i can find trustworthy lore information?

2. What are some of the common bad things writers in this fandom do that's simply put bad?

3. Style mistakes in writing that can be irritating (not tied to 2nd question because the 2nd is tied to bad cliches and such while this is generally to the writing style)

Thank you in advance


** I agree with refreshing yourself on the books, first and foremost. For research bits, HP Lexicon and Pottermore are good resources. For style, get yourself a copy of the Chicago Manual of Style or bookmark the website.

As for common bad things, search this sub for "pet peeves". Therein lies your answer.

Get yourself a good beta and be willing to take criticism.

Happy writing!

*** I don't think /Pottermore/ is a very good source. It might have a lot of neat stuff here and there but it's very hard to navigate. Anything important on it can be found on the Wiki much more easily.

**** It's interesting for some backstory stuff on some characters like McGonagall. I didn't realize that she is half-blood herself and used to be married, for example. I tend to use it for flavor stuff like that. I agree that if you're looking to see what sort of wood Ginny's wand is (yew, BTW), the wiki is fine.

***** But... as I said, all that stuff is on the wiki. I'm quite sure the wiki's page on McGonagall /does/ include her whole backstory, Dougal McGregor and all, as well as her blood-status.

****** I don't understand why everyone is so anti-Pottermore here. It's fine and everyone has the right to their opinions and favorite resources, but it seems odd to me. Is it because a lot of it was written after the books? Is it because people want JKR to put out an encyclopedia already? I'm bitter about it because I've never managed to get sorted. Every time I've tried it, it says some BS about my email address already being used or something. Super annoying!

Regarding the wiki, I know I've been called out for recommending it as a resource. I forget who did it, but I was corrected and pointed to the HP Lex. So, y'all just use what you wanna use.

******* There are people who dislike /Pottermore/ as Rowling just not wanting to let Harry Potter go already. They think she just keeps adding random, poorly-thought-out nuggets of information to keep the fans happy but it's all running on autopilot.

All this being said, I'm not one of these people. Conceptually, I /like/ Pottermore. What I don't like is that it's very hard to navigate if you're looking for specific information about a specific topic. The Wiki is constantly updated with any new info found on /Pottermore/, and it's actually easy to browse.

  What are some of the common bad things writers in this fandom do that's simply put bad?
#+end_quote

- Making the Death Eater anything but the utter human waste they are. Their ideology and methods are straight from the history books (Hitler's rise to power) and under their reign, Muggleborns were rounded up and sent to a repurposed Azkaban (Concentration Camp), outright hunted (Einsatzgruppen analogy) and subject to arbitrary commissions organising the entire thing. They are not some misguided kids, they are racially motivated terrorists who stage a coup. And there was always the option to grab your loved ones and get aboard British Airways 15 to Sydney via Singapore before making your way to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulo,_Queensland][Eulo]]. But people chose to stay and join him. Even Malfoy could have taken his mother and fled.

- Unnecessary bashing. Let's say you do not like Ron Weasley and want him out of the trio. Instead of some weird plot where he is dosing Harry&Hermione with love potions because he is working for the +Dark Lord+ Leader of the Light^{^{TM}} Dumbledore, simply make Harry stick up for Hermione at the Yule Ball or not take him back after the first task. Or, even simpler, have him drift away because he is +balls deep+ in love with Lavender and spends his time with her. You do not need to make characters cartoonish evil.

- Tropes. Most are repeated to oblivion and beyond. They might get you popularity at FFN, but the common ones do not make a story good. In most cases, they are simply wish-fulfilment (lots of cash, political power, being able to trash anyone with ease, the hot girl(s), a large manor and so on).

- Harems. Just no. Having a collection of girls is an easy sign to spot bad fics, since the girls are always just trophies.

** The middle question is the hard to answer one because everyone has a different taste. People think my story bashes hermione and nope out. But at the same time, other people love how i treat hermione so far. Thats the thing, no one has the same tastes. There are several people on the internet who will hate what you wrote for some reason. So my tip is, just write. Fuck the tropes. Fuck the political landscape. Figure out why you want to write and do that.

I write fanfiction to stay sane and cuz its fun. I write so that my ideas are out there, and i post it because i want to share. I take pride in my work and want to improve yes, but improving doesnt mean i change my story to cater to the fickle wishes of the world. And honestly, thats the issue with fanfiction. Its for the fan. We consume it because we are fans, but in many senses its not just for us. The author is a fan too. And while yes, i get tired of reading every trope out there, its not fair to say their story is shit just because it utilizes those tropes.

Now if you are building a story, do something new. A concept you habent read before... An idea that you expanded on. Use tropes if you want. But as long as you wrote something interesting, it will be read.

Good luck.

[[https://www.harrypotter.wikia.com][The Harry Potter Wiki]] is extremely complete and easy to navigate. I think it's your best bet. Barring that, there is the HP Lexicon. But I still think the Wiki's your best bet.

** I think HPLexicon is the best. There's a lot of information on the HP wiki, but it mixes up info from canon and the movies and games and such, and since the movies usually contradict the books, that makes the wiki pretty useless to me.

As for what to avoid: I would say, don't make the characters one dimensional. The book characters (but not the movies) have their strengths and flaws and are well written, complex characters. Very few writers manage to capture that, so you often see only certain aspects of a character. But it comes down to personal taste.
