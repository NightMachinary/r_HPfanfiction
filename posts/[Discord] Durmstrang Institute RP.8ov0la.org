Durmstrang Institute RP: Victorian Era

Founded by a mysterious witch, named Professor Nerida Vulchanova. Having existed since at least 1294, Durmstrang is one of the three schools that compete in the Triwizard Tournament, and is notorious for prominently featuring the Dark Arts in its curriculum.

We bring you to the Scandinavian wizarding school that is located within the northern part of Sweden or Norway! Set during the 1840s, in which the school year has started with the mystery of the murder of the previous Headmaster--do you dare to live in the darkness, for knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people?

/"Durmstrang is a school for young witches and wizards. The school has a dubious reputation, and is known to put a lot of emphasis on teaching the Dark Arts."/
