No complaints or anything because I'm super interested in his character lately!

But I thought it was funny because I've been seeing a lot Tom Riddle/Voldemort posts on his own, or Tomarry recs and I don't remember seeing this ship be as popular a few months ago.

I am left wondering if I'm noticing this more because I'm also looking out for it, or if we're all collectively going through the same interests üòÇ


** He's the best, of course.

I will note that Tomarry is one of the top 10 HP ships on AO3, so it's not that surprising that there's interest in it here. It's not as big as Drarry, but at just over 5k fics, that's a sizeable community of readers.
