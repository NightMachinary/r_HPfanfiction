I just spent the last 2 or 3 days reading the entire Prince of Slytherin series and now I desperately want to read a fic where the main character is an Unspeakable. The way that The Sinister Man unravels the mysteries did the Unspeakables is honestly my favorite part of the series. Bonus points if the main character is Lily Evans, Pandora Lovegood, or Luna Lovegood!

  Albus Dumbledore was too late. Someone else managed to defeat Gellert, leaving chaos and too many questions behind. Tom Riddle, who recently graduated from Hogwarts, was fully committed to become the greatest Dark Lord of all time, chasing immortality and surpassing Grindelwald's legacy. It's too bad that Unspeakable Harry Potter had something to say about that. HP/TR. Time travel

It's a pretty decent fic overall, one of the few HP/LV fics I can reccomend with a straight face. Despite the word count it doesn't feel bloated.

As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

** These three are very similar fics, though I'd argue Whiskey Time Travel is the best of the three. Basically, angsty, powerful, casually-alcoholic Harry is an Unspeakable who fights things. Whiskey also has time-travel in the mix (obviously).

In this one, Luna is an unspeakable and it's quite interesting. It actually has the Unspeakables as magical researchers and not James Bond/Jason Bourne types for once.
