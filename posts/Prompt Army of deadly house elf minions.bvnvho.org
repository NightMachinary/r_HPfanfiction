House elves are overpowered.

They can apparate almost anywhere, Horcrux cave or Malfoy Manor, are good at doing their jobs unnoticed (most hogwarts students don't know about them) and know exactly how rich purebloods live.

A small army of house elves trained in assassination could probably decide the entire second blood war in just a few days.

Apparate into the kitchen, add some poison, apparate out, nobody noticed, Lucius Malfoy won't wake up tomorrow. Neither will Crabbe Sr., Goyle Sr., Nott or Avery.

Write a story of just how powerful house elves could be if their powers were used for more lethal means.


** Luna Lovegood stared passively at the scene.

Both Carrows had been beheaded and were currently providing the decor for the Great Hall. Snape had also been killed and was hanging form the rafters. Every student believed to be associated with the Death Eaters had been bound and were currently waiting to be administered Vertiserum by Luna's fellow Ravenclaws and then be quizzed by Ginny and Seamus about their involvement with the Dark Lord's activities.

Those who didn't partake in crimes but who believed in Death Eaters rhetoric were Stunned and brought to the dungeons. Those who admitted to crimes ( cough,Malfoy,Crabbe,Coyle,Parkinson,Nott,Zabini,Bulstrode,Greengrass,Pike.... ) had been thrown to the House Elf mob to be dealt with as the little servants wished

Luna stared at the Head Table where Senior DA members and elderly elves sat together.

She raised her glass of Butterbeer with a steely look.

" Today Hogwarts,tomorrow the Ministry and then the Dark Lord. "
