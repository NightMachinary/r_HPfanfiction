I read the fic ages ago, I remember some of the plot, but I can't remember the name of the fic, because it was ages ago and I didn't download it immediately. I have no idea if it's even still around.

The fic was set after either OOTP or HBP. Due to the Voldemort takeover, the Order had to go underground and Moody being paranoid made them hide their identities when they went on missions even from each other so they did not know who the other person was so that if they were caught they could not give anyone away. I think he even wiped their minds at the end of each mission, but I am not sure about that. Al lI remember is that Ginny and Harry in disguise not knowing who the other person was had sex in a hospital during a mission and later Ginny found out she was pregnant and moved away to the Us to protect her kid and the whole Weasley family assumed that she ran away out of cowardice. Later after the war Harry and Ron go to a bar where Ron learns that the barman had a daughter who was Muggleborn and that Ginny helped her escape, but they don't know that it was her. Honestly that's all of the plot I remember. If anyone could find the fic for me that would be awesome... it's been driving me crazy
