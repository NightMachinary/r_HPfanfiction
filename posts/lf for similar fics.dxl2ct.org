i love the romantic scenes and how dumbledore is actually teaching harry magic and was hoping for more fics like this

my favourite parts are at slughorns party and when harry dives into the memories of his parents and are there more like this where similarities between lily and james romance and harry/any female that isn't ginny or hermione are present to those who are close to them and they aren't overt like people who knew jame/lily can see them but dont comment on them like "just like lily and james" or "you two remind me of lily and james" because that just seems weird to me

now i am going to go and reread this


** Probably should have reread your post as well. Grammar is an important thing my friend, makes everything much easier to understand. Nah, not trying to be a cunt, but just add some grammar in there so people who may have what you're looking for are able to understand it. Have a good evening.

*** I mean sure there doesn't seem to be any punctuation, but if you put minimal effort in you could easily understand what heâ€˜s saying. Not everyone can speak english perfectly and since it's pretty much the language of the internet you should expect that there are people with very different levels of english on reddit.
