I'm talking about stories that were released the last 4 months or so. But feel free to post anything you have, especially if you think its something more obscure that should get publicity.


** There's this alternate dimension one where Bellatrix has a daughter and Harry ends up in their universe. Last updated like 2 months ago so not dead.

I'll find it for you when I get to my house

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

  The night Harry summons the Knight Bus to escape the Dursleys, he ends up bringing a new companion---a poor black cat that he decides to take as a second familiar. But this cat isn't any ordinary cat, and it has big plans for its new master. Sirius really should've kept his plans a bit more secret...especially with his cousin so close...

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
