** I forgot what they're called but some people make audios of fics and the original authors link it in their fics (like they would translations). Most I've seen are mp3s/not great but I'd say if you're good, go for it!

Just be sure to get the author's ok first. :)

*** It's called podfics!

** It might work, but you could also look into making podfics as well

** If you're good I would totally listen to you on YouTube. I know it's respectful to get the authors permission, but there are so many that are old and the author isn't around anymore. :(

*** I've read some stuff in german on my profile, if you want a sample. I'll start with the " I know not..." fic by billowsandsmoke since they are still active :) I've already read a quarter of the first chapter and I think I quite like the story - I haven't read it yet.

** I am not sure, the biggest problem would be which story to narrate. Otherwise, I believe I am by far not the only one who let's uses TTS of his EPub reader to let stories be read to him while working.

*** I'd start with the "must read" s of this subreddit (probably seventh horcrux, because well.. Laughter is good in quarantine) and go to my favourites afterwards. Heh, I've never considered tts for fanfictions, does it work well?

**** Reasonably well with some glaring exceptions. For reasons I don't understand, Android TTS decided that ‚Äúsat‚Äù is always an abbreviation of Saturday, so I have ‚ÄúGinny Saturday on sofa.‚Äù Then it has troubles with some real abbreviations, ‚ÄúDrive Granger‚Äù (or is it ‚ÄúPrivet Doctor‚Äù?), and ‚ÄúStreet Mungo Hospital‚Äù are most obvious ones. However, aside from these exceptions it is pretty good, and I don't have to turn my eyes from boring parts of my work while listening.
