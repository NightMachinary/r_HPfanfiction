Ideally he gets struck by lightning or hit by a lorry before Harry goes to Hogwarts.

I'd like to see what the story would look like without his meddling: no over complicated plots? Headmasters, mugwumbs and chief warlocks who actually do their job? Who knows xD


** You can have a non complicated plot with Dumbledore as headmaster. He didn't "meddle" in Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and arguably Half-Blood Prince. There are plenty of fics where he's headmaster but doesn't play any role in the story itself.

*** Depends on how much of a conspiracy theorist you are..

But I mainly asked because most of the fics I've recently read all had dumbles as the most influential person in the story : either for being evil or for being stupid, so I thought it might be interesting to see what would happen without him.
