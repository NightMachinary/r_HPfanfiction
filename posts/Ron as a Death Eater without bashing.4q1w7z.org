Does this exist at all? At eleven Ron's greatest desire it to be better than his brothers. I think there can be a believable circumstance where Ron uses dark arts as a way to greatness. Especially if he isn't friends with Harry.


** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix). A slow burning fic where Ron eventually starts agreeing with Voldemort's ideals over Dumbledore. Story stops before he actually takes the mark, but it is heavily implied that he will.
