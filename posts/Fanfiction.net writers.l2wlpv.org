So, just my opinion, but I believe that most [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] writers should block guest comments. Mostly because they seem to write the worst reviews. Don't get me wrong, plenty of people with accounts do to, but guest seem to be the worse. That way when you see a really toxic comment, you can see his profile and see he is a toxic person. I am only saying this because I am tired of people saying toxic crap and authors quitting when they were doing really good. I agree with constructive criticism, but some of the crap in the comment sessions of some stories is vile. Just my opinion. I also, though I don't use it, heard AO3 has a better community *though I don't know if that is true*.


** Totally agree with you... There's nothing worse than reading a really good story only for the author to quit because of guest reviews... On another note I have noticed ao3 is a much better community amongst authors I've seen in multiple fandoms authors helping each other out, collaborating and giving gifts (stories) to each other and I don't think I've seen many complain about toxic reviews (or they just ignore them)....

** One of the many and sundry 'improvements' offloaded on us by [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] is the inability to automatically block guest comments. In order to block them, you have to intercept them within 24 hours and manually block each of them individually. Honestly who has the time.

I just mock the ignorant gutless blowhards in writer's groups. It's therapeutic for everyone.

** If someone wants to leave a review on something I write, that's their prerogative. I'm not going to take away their ability to do so because some people are mean.

Personally, I do find it a bit cowardly that they aren't willing to attribute their name to it, but, well, I'm not one to cower from my own opinion.

That being said I've received plenty of positive guest reviews too. And plenty of poor signed reviews. But honestly, the guest reviews are the most fun. Most of them don't even make sense! It's great. But even looking through them it's about a twenty to one positive to negative ratio.

And honestly, the dirty little truth of any art is that there are always going to be people that don't enjoy it. If an author or artist does not develop thick skin they won't last. Not every bad review is a personal insult, and most people that leave them didn't even bother to read anyway.

** This may be weird - but my guest comments are 99% okay. In fact, I have some guest commenters that I wish I could reply to because they're so nice.

I will say - yes, bad commenters exist and are more likely to be 'guests' because there is anonymity is being a guest which can lead to people feeling free to leave mean comments. But, even then, the majority of guests are appropriate reviewers. However, for those folks who need to vent about mean comments - and by all means, vent away, I am here to support you - they are probably venting about 'guests' making them appear to be more prevalent than they are.

Of course, this is all anecdotal...

** I think it depends on the author. I've seen plenty of GOOD guest comments too, and some can easily ignore flames. So if an author is getting a lot of guest flames and it starts bothering them, block them, if not, then its more feedback.

** I don't think it would change much. It's really one of the very bad side of this platform, and why I use AO3 instead. Not only are the comments difficult to read through, but everyone is constantly telling the author to do this or that, and this ship, and that trope. It's all so very entitled and rude and pushy. And it's only when people actually appreciate the story. Otherwise, you go through the comments to get a feel for the story and you find « flames » that are so outlandish. It's very disheartening even for a reader, I can't imagine for authors.

But otherwise, yes. And it works for every platform: if a writer starts to feel bothered by rude or spam comments, they should totally filter them.

*** I agree that most comments on FF.net are very rude and demanding

But I think Ao3 actually has the opposite problem and becomes a fluffy echo chamber. To the point that saying anything that could be considered negative or even constructive criticism is seen as 'hate' and as a personal insult or something.

** Idk, I've never had too many problems with guest reviews. Mostly, I've only gotten compliments from them. While occasionally there has been something mildly negative or even insulting, it's been few and far between. As long as I have the option to delete them if they're like spam or whatever, I'm happy to keep myself open to them.

In my time posting fics to AO3 I have had one mildly disgruntled comment in 67 chapters and a oneshot, and absolutely no abuse.

I've been put off posting to fanfic.net because so many writers report receiving abuse there. I might get new readers but I am unlikely to get better feedback than I already had, and I am much more likely to get abuse and spam, while serving up who-knows-what adverts to my readers.
