Think of some completely different ways to interpret this.


** Harry furrowed his brow at the noise coming from the other end of the flat.

He really needed to get his own place soon. Ron and Hermione's roleplays were just getting weird at this stage.

** "Seriously? What kind of babysitters take my children on a round the world trip to Atlantis of all places? Albus doesn't even know how to swim yet, for Merlin's sake!" A pause, more words through the Floo. Harry gapes. "You let Mrs Frizzle near my children? Are you mad? What kind of Nanny Agency are you?"

**** It's now on my list to write, but there's a hundred and forty four other things also on the list (literally, I keep count), so I don't know how quickly I'll get to it. :D

***** Haha, my people! Though I don't have a literal list, just loads of idea-documents clogging up my goodle docs xD

But if you ever do get to writing it and happen to remember me, let me know?

****** I used to do that. But then I realised that I had eighty documents of ideas for stories I hadn't even started writing yet and that I couldn't ever find anything. Now, I just have a list of story names and then a few bulletpoints of description for each idea - until I actually get around to writing them, anyway. Then they get a separate file of their own. :)

And will do. Expect a random message in about three years that you'll have no recollection of asking for whatsoever. :D

******* Lol, I'd love to get that message!

And you've inspired me to tidy up my docs too-- it's desperately needed.

******** I'm glad. It's very useful - being able to ctrl-F find stuff all on one document makes adding new ideas and plot/setting/character point things to the story plan so much easier. :)
