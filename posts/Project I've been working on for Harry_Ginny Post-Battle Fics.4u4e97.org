I am an unabashed fanatic about fanfics that focus on Harry and Ginny after the Battle of Hogwarts. The reason is because Ginny was always one of my favorite characters, but I felt she deserved a bigger role in the story. In fact, I'd argue that Harry and Ginny's story really isn't told to completion. The biggest moments in their story would occur after the battle as they tried to resume their relationship amidst so much upheaval. There were many unanswered questions left by Rowling during the 19 years in between the battle and the epilogue. Fan fiction has overall done an admirable job answering these questions. However, I have noticed that part of the problem of reading so many stories about the same topic and time periods is that the stories often bleed into each other. It becomes difficult to remember which were the good ones and which were awful. Too often I'll start a story and realize too far into it that I read it already. Other

The other problem I've had is I start reading a new story and then something happens that takes me completely out it to the point where I wish I never read it in the first place. For example, I've read stories that started out great but then had Ginny or Harry die suddenly. Now some might like such a story, but I don't want to read about either character dying and it felt like an unwanted gut punch. With that in mind, I set out on a small project. I'd read as many stories as I could that are loosely set on the following criteria:

1) stays relatively in canon (preferably set after Deathly Hallows and stays true to those events and also what Rowling said happened to the characters after) 2) Covers a time period any time right after the battle up until they start having kids (I'll probably review those later, but for now I enjoy just the period where they are starting their adult lives) 3) Not AU after the events of DH. No time travel or crazy cross-overs.

Of course, I decided to break these rules when I came across a particularly popular fic I had never read that still focused on Harry and Ginny. There were a few that were written before DH came out and thus were not strictly canon, yet stayed true to how things would have likely occurred after the end. Minor deviations were ultimately ok in my book.

One aspect I took special note of were potential triggers that readers might want to avoid. There are certain events in stories that completely take me out if it and just make me want to stop right there. I'm not saying this should be universal to every reader, but I have certain deal-breakers. For example, I don't want Ginny or Harry to die. I'll stop reading right then and there. Some readers hate the idea of either Harry or Ginny dating/sleeping with other people so they want to avoid that as well. I took note to include that in my write-ups.

I am currently about 25 stories in and have not touched the more popular authors like little0bird and northumbrian. I'll get to those but until then, I'd like to provide some takeaways from what I've read so far. At some point, I'll share a formal document that will have reviews for each story I read. Keep in mind that, for now, I'm reviewing stories from a filtered search on fanfiction.net. Using certain filters, I arrived at 500 stories focusing on Harry and Ginny. The overwhelming majority could be dismissed outright. I was able to get through 25 stories that fit enough of my criteria. I started and stopped reading about a dozen that simply were not well written and thus not worth my time reading. If someone wants to suggest I take another look, I'm happy to. Here are my scattered thoughts thus far:

1.  there are so many spit takes with pumpkin juice. And so many faces turning red.
2.  almost every story that picks up right after the battle has Harry and Ginny getting together and being overly affectionate/desperately in love. The first couple stories it was sweet. After that, it was redundant and boring.
3.  the Weasley brothers seem inordinately interested in Ginny's sex life in most stories. If they are not upset about the idea of Ginny having sex, they are spending way too much time joking about it.
4.  Arthur and Molly in most stories also all seem to have talks with Harry/Ginny about sex
5.  Seriously, the predominate plotline in the Harry/Ginny relationship is when they will have sex.
6.  Most Harry/Ginny stories do a bad job of creating conflict between the two; either there is no conflict or it's over things that make little sense.
7.  There is a weird dynamic in many stories involving Harry and Ginny where Dean is present and making suggestive jokes towards them. It's odd since he is an ex-boyfriend and would either avoid being around them or just not joke about sex with them. For example, in one story, the Muggle studies teacher is explaining the game, twister. Dean makes a sexually suggestive remark towards Ginny about “other uses for the game” and taps her toe with his. Ginny goes red but based on the rest of the story, he is implying she should play the game with Harry.
8.  Few writers want to try to make a compelling story line out of Harry being away training to be an Auror while Ginny is at school. A very good, natural source of conflict that writers ignore or remove by having Harry go back to Hogwarts in too many stories. It's like the writers don't want there to be any real conflict between the two and know that being away from each other could cause it. So they change canon just to keep them together.
9.  It is an absolute must for a good post-battle story to talk about what Ginny and the others had to go through during that year at Hogwarts. It really demonstrates her strong character while also showing the true impact of war. In fact, isn't that the main point of any post-Battle story, to show the impact of war?\\
10. Another very common plot point is Harry feeling guilty. It's in nearly every fic and I'm fine with that. Totally expected reaction and let's face it, there are certain emotions and plot events the writer needs to hit.\\
11. Along those lines, it is important to show a grieving period. But when you read so many of them, you want to skip over it. Writers have a tendency to draw out these periods far longer than needed.\\
12. Plenty of longer stories don't need to be so long, especially when not too much happens. A story covering the summer after the war does not need to be 300,000 words.
13. The best romance fics are able to balance the fluffy stuff with an actual plot. Too many focus heavily on one aspect and then throw in a murder mystery in the last few chapters. Or they jump right into a new adventure without letting the characters breathe.
14. George is either drunk all the time or moves on too easily. Writers generally have a hard time finding a middle ground with George.
15. No sudden teenage pregnancies, just please no.
16. It is actually difficult to find many stories that start with Ginny training with the Harpies and Harry as an auror. I think the more popular authors deal with that more.
17. Even though I'm a huge Harry/Ginny fan, I actually find myself really enjoying the stories where they have broken up and even dated other people, but wind up back together when they are a couple years older. It makes it seem much realer and the relationships are handled better. I prefer they don't hook up with other people while they are broken up, but understand it is unrealistic. So long as neither are sleeping around. Objectively, I'm fine with them doing that since there is no shame in enjoying sex and controlling your own body. But my gut reaction is I'd like them to keep it in their pants. I guess it makes their relationship more special. But that's me being old fashioned.

Sorry this is so long, but I hope whenever I'm ready to post my results/analysis, people enjoy it and find it useful. Also, I'll post my list soon of what stories I reviewed thus far. Please feel free to recommend others, especially any that deal with the pitfalls of the long-distance relationship Harry and Ginny go through during her 7th year.


** I'm excited to see this list, to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of romance fics, but with the criteria you've listed, I think they'd have plenty to offer me even as romances.

** Here is the list so far. As I mentioned, I have not tackled the more popular writers yet. And some on this list don't fit the criteria I laid out to the tee but I was intrigued enough to read. I also know there are a bunch of good ones on siye.co.uk but haven't gotten to those yet. Please recommend any fic you think I should review:

  "Yes, thank you. You've saved me from a load of embarrassment." Ginny answered, as she righted herself and turned around. The man's hands were still close, making sure she didn't topple again. Her eyes travelled up those hands to his arms, to familiar looking shoulders that held a very familiar looking face. The face of a phantom. "Harry?"

** For Harry and Hermione to get that far in power hierarchy, they had to work very well together, and they had to be politically very astute. There would have been occasions where they had to balance political necessities vs emotional and family requirements. How they handled that would be a good topic in stories. We talked about that briefly in the other thread, and I enjoy keep talking about it.

Ron and Ginny, although leaving main career pushes to their spouses, would have been indispensable in their successes. Ron would have mellowed out some of Hermione's worst personality traits, and Ginny should give Harry crucial emotional support. I rarely see those aspects explored in fanfics.

*** Agreed, those are good potential stories. I imagine there are some out there but since my focus thus far has been on stories in the first few years after the battle I haven't come across any.

The story I'm looking for right now but haven't been able to find is the one that deals with potential relationship issues between Harry and Ginny owing to them being apart. Harry at auror training and Ginny at school would potentially create tension, as it would with any couple. I'm not saying it happens in my headcanon, but conflict is interesting and this is a natural place for conflict.

**** Harry would certainly be the 'Desirable Number 1', and had fend off countless advances. Ginny, who was most likely the Head Girl, would face similar situation at Hogwarts. How they withstood all the temptations and stayed true to each other was definitely worth exploring.

Similarly, Ron and Hermione would be exactly in the same boat.

***** Right? I mean, it just seems like an easy story for someone to write. I know a lot of people would say that none of the characters would ever cheat on each other, and I ultimately agree, but that doesn't need to happen for it to be interesting. Ginny is a jealous person, for example. This is defined in canon. Certainly that could be explored and stay true to the character.
