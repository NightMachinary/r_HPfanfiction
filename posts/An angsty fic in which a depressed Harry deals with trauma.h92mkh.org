Not looking for anything specific, really.

Preferably no pairings, or major focus on pairing, but I'm willing to accept anything, as long as it's well written (!) and more or less realistic.

It'd be great, if it dealt with actual canon events, instead of an overdramatised version of them.

Thank you!

EDIT: Also no bashing, if that's in any way possible. Feel free to disregard any of my requests, should you feel as though a particular story especially won you over


** I'm currently co-writing a fic that does exactly this. Canon-divergent sixth year, angsty and dealing with trauma/PTSD/mental illness, and romance will only ever be a subplot in our story (there's currently no pairings anyway).

If that sounds like something you might enjoy, you can find it here: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Several characters struggle with handling traumatic events in my fic, but it diverges from canon pretty quickly. I don't know if I'd call it angsty; less crying and more panic attacks/coping mechanisms, but it certainly is a woe-fest.

  A Death Eater finds Harry two years before he leaves for Hogwarts, and that assassination attempt sets Harry on a course that will shake the Wizarding World to its foundations. Pulled in two directions by opposing sides, Harry must decide which path to walk. Super!Harry (eventually), pairing still undecided.
