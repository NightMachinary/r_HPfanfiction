So, Groundhog Day!Protagonist, OP!Protagonist, etc, but viewed from another person's perspective.

Consider the Groundhog Day example in particular: if Harry has relived this day a thousand times, Hermione will just see him being super competent for no apparent reason; she doesn't see all the intermediate time looping, only the end result. The universe doesn't remember all of the do-overs Harry has had, it only sees the last iteration, the version that doesn't get reset.

In a similar vein, crazy overpowered characters are... kind of boring? In and of themselves anyway- they become interesting when viewed from one of the normal people being pulled into their orbit, who don't get to see all the dull stuff going on inside the god-mode's head, but just have to deal with the universe which contains the god-mode.

Only relatable example I can think of off the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], where, do to the specifics of the time loop, Harry and Hermione, the two loopers, can remember different events even though they loop together.


** I have two recommendations that you may like as I have a similar problem with the whole op!protagonist thing though they are both still told from the main point of view.

linkffn(11373351) and linkffn(11907443)

The first one is a story where Harry has been being reborn for thousands of lifetimes and is obviously godlike by this point so he sets specific absurd goals at each rebirth ie. 'make draco malfoy fall in love with susan bones, bonus points if they marry before the end of Hogwarts' or that type of shit. anyway on this specific lifetime he encounters a female tom riddle for the first time in these thousands of lifetimes, who, unknown to Harry somewhere along the way also collected the Hallows. she is on her ninth lifetime so is obviously also completely different than canon though not as godlike as Harry. The story is told from both points of view and is tragically not completed, but is imo hilarious as it doesnt focus on their op-ness (heh).

As for my second rec, its pretty much what its summary says.

  The Master of Death brings his 130,000 years of experience to slam down on the unsuspecting head of his biggest and most entertaining challenge yet. Voldemort brings all her cunning and guile to rip open the mystery that is Harry Potter. And Dumbledore, Fudge, and the rest of the Wizarding world, scrabble to make sense of what in Merlin's name is going on. - On Hiatus

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP
