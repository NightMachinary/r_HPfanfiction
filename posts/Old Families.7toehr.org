What are some fics that have explored and expanded upon wizarding culture as it pertains to the older families? I don't just mean purebloods but also recently or longer term half blood families, they couldn't have just dropped their inheritance, their families homes, connections. Their society just wouldn't be functioning as is if all purebloods had been tossed out of the family for marrying a half blood. I've been searching for years for some great examples of this but haven't found much! I want to see some examples of tradition, religious practices, women's magic, courting traditions. And where in the world is their art coming from? Obviously wizards but who are these painters, do they have guilds? Their world would have to be so much larger than JK says to have any sort of artistry and music without bringing in muggle work.

Edit: Also any fics that show smaller, more student centered schools in Magical Britain. I know I wouldn't send my own little witches or wizards to a place with that type of education system, let alone the corruption and safety issues. I could rant all day on how it makes no sense that there's one school for an island of that size.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10789349/1/Black-as-the-Blood-In-Our-Names][Black as the Blood In Our Names]] by TimeAndLife21 does a very good job at this. It does not only involve the Wizarding in Britain, but also the other countries' magical worlds as a well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11664138/1/Renewal][Renewal]] by Azenor Sage might be something you'll like also. It mainly involves the Black family though and old Victorian type of pureblood culture.

  At the point of death, Regulus Black is de-aged. Given a second chance at life, he becomes a new beacon of hope for the nearly defunct Black Family. He is haunted by strange dreams of his past and the feeling that he has an important mission that he must complete, no matter the cost to himself.

Thrown back into the world of the living, He basically plans from thin air to work around the new world he is in now. He will be helping Harry Potter go against the Dark Lord and saves Sirius from dying by Bella's Hand. Looks like Harry has perfect Ally on his side. AU

** ...I'm actually working on something like this now, but the worldbuilding aspect is fun and distracting so it's taking me forever. I have an entire section of my OneNote notebook called "Wizarding Culture" which I've been slowly filling up. Here are some examples of what I've done so far:

- Creating magical traditions/religions loosely based around Romans, Celts, Norse, etc

- Creating an upper class social calendar based on the London Season of the Regency era onwards.

- There is a Guildhall which has a place in governing Wizarding Britain in a similar way to how Livery Companies run the City of London. I've changed the government somewhat for my AU.

- There are other schools in the UK, with the major ones being a Guildhall-run trade school and an Irish school. Hogwarts is the best, most academically inclined (as opposed to vocational) and the oldest of these.

- Music is a funny one. I think Music should have a place in Magic, so I think Music performance would actually be regulated by the Ministry to ensure that it isn't being used for propaganda, incitement or similar.

- I haven't yet looked into women's magic and courting traditions, but if you have any ideas I'd be happy to hear them1

*** I like the idea of trade schools! I think trade schools and apprenticeships just make sense. We know there's plumbing of some sort, they have to have skilled trade workers and it's not something that would be easy to learn especially when you add in magic.

As for music we know there were historic witches that could heal with their song so it makes sense music could be used as a tool for other, more damaging magic as well.

As far as women's magic, as apparently rare as children now are in the old families I see it as something that perhaps had fallen out of favour due to men's, or the ministry's, fear and it had an affect on birth rates in old families (which could mean more muggleborns to keep magic numbers up by some mystical force). Rites of passage, wedding night rituals, birth rituals, fertility. Things that could be seen as straddling a more grey area due to blood usually involved and in a world that became too black and white became a little dangerous to practice out in the open, and these things usually involved a group of women. Esp concerning birth. I definitely see Lily's sacrifice, however she did it, as a remnant of women's blood magic. Things like the wife holding the keys and the handling the household coffers is also a tradition I have always loved. What could be sent with a young wife when she marries in her hope chest? Obviously in a magical household it wouldn't be as simple as plain linens and silverware but magical items, many places have traditions of emroidering and weaving intent and with things like sheets for the marriage bed and underclothes what kind of happy blessings could they be giving with those sorts of items? I can definitely see that as something the Prewett's did, the Weasley's fecundency certainly isn't usual for two people of inbred lines. Unless they had a little magical fertility boost! The knitting Molly does brings comfort and feelings of safety even though they're not exactly stylish, I see that as part of her families magic. Though in my world she knits on her own, not with a spell, lol.

** I am actually planning something like that for the past ~5 years. Not really much has been written because while it is my main project now, my interest ebbs and flows. It's focused mainly on House Black-raised!Harry, who is reaaaaally far from canon. It has a big Game of Thrones feel to it, purposely, with the British Isles being divided in different regions, each one with its “governor”. But aside from my own work which is far from being written, perhaps I can recommend JayColin's fanfics, specially linkffn (8038419) The update schedule is somewhat regular, if a bit sparse. It deals with expanded royals (Pendragon) expanded Wizarding World, plot twists, British Nobility etc. Thoroughly enjoyable, in my opinion.

Edit: fixed typos. :) Edit2: addedt bot

*** I like your idea! I've been writing down things for 10 plus years but never get far in writing, just planning. Always planning. I've always thought it made sense for there to be lords of the old historic regions of the island. Perhaps fallen out of most of their power once the ministry became the propaganda machine they now are but still with some traditional powers they had forgotten about in the last generations with their troubles. I don't see that as something that could be taken away because someone had a muggle parent or was disowned, so a sort of magically inherited position that could be used against some of the blood purity fanatics, perhaps why they put their backing into the ministry to take the power that had fallen into "impure" lines of the old families.

I'll check out their fics thanks! I hope you get to writing yours one day!
