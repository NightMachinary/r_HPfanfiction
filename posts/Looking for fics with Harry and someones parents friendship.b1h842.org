I'm looking for fic recs where Harry has a very good, friendship type relationship with someone's parents. Now that sounds odd but originally I was thinking of Hermiones parents as I've read a few where he gets on very well with them and will watch football with "Dan" and barbeque etc. Doesn't have to be H/Hr.

But then I remembered how well he got on with Greengrass parents in "blue steel" and that made me realize I'd be happy with anyone's parents. He doesn't necessarily have to be in a relationship with their daughters either.

Only completed fics please.

  Hermione and her mother Helen are having lunch one Sunday afternoon when Helen asks a most peculiar question. Just how long has Hermione been in love with her best friend?
