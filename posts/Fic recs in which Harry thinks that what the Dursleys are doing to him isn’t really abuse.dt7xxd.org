*Note: Just to be clear, this post is asking for fics in which the emotional abuse that Harry goes through warps his perceptions of the situation.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

  How the hell can Harry think that it "isn't really abuse"?
#+end_quote

People who are abused deny it all the time. Out of fear, not wanting to admit weakness, manipulated to do so, there are a multitude of reasons.

And that's point of the request, I believe. A hurt/comfort/angst fic of him coming to terms with his abuse.

***** No, that's genuinely what I meant. Yeah, it's obviously abuse, how could it not be? But it's not always as clear when you're in the situation, especially when it's the only life you remember. I recently read a fic that had a really good take on that and I was interested in finding more on the subject, that's all it is. So, I would appreciate it if you didn't go into ad hominem arguments, thank you.
