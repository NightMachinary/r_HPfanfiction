Years back I read a fic where Ron's brothers come over during his honeymoon and find out that he has absolutely no interest in sex and just wanted the great food and the party. To take care of what Hermione wanted and expected, he went to Harry and I believe both Harry and Ginny are in the other room with Hermione but at least Harry is and they can hear her moaning through the door.

My recollection isn't perfect but two points that do remember clearly is that Ron is grossed out by the idea of sex and George in particular is aghast at his younger brother's disinterest.

I would appreciate any help in finding this odd little crackfic because I do remember it being funny.


** Hmmmm... I seem to remember one where Ron AND Ginny where completely disinterested in sex and therefore harry and Hermione got together. Might it have been that? Because then I might be able to find it in my archive.

*** Its possible. All I recall from it was that Ron had no interest, Hermione and Harry got together and George in particular was weirded out by it.

**** I /think/ the one I recall had Molly potioning her brood out of a sense of prudeishness with some sort of long taboo potion to curb their libido and her older kids all somehow managed to counteract this. But I could not for the life of me find it again :/

Have you tried looking on [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][scryer]]? Maybe you will come up with a combination of words and phrases that I did not, or you do mean something different than I recall. Do try a fuzzy search, something like "ron ginny sex disgusting"~15 which will search for those words ocurring in a group of at most 15 words (useful for those nearly but not quite remembered phrases).

And give word if you find anything yourself, I am now as frustrated as you and will probably keep trying to find it on and off for the next few days :D
