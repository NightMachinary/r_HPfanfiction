Fudge succeeded. Harry was expelled from Hogwarts.

To bad things didn't go right after that...

The man at the front who collected the wands for checking was an ally of Dumbledore, and â€˜Ollivander' was actually a polyjuiced Sirius who memorized a description of Harry's wand.

The wand that was snapped was Harry's wand, but it wasn't his Holly and Phoenix feather wand.

It was a toy wand he found when he was three years old. It of course had a flashlight to perform a convincing Lumos spell.


** Reminds me of an idea I've had for an adult Harry where he gets disarmed and his wand snapped, "That's just a stick I use to keep people from freaking out. I haven't actually used a wand in years."

** I feel like a toy wand would just have a light charm built in instead of relying on muggle technology that might not work in areas of high magic.
