:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember is that they spend a lot of time in Africa, Harry is an obscurial, they adopt another obscurial, and at one point Harry rips a dudes throat out with his teeth.

I also feel like there was a subplot with the Empress of China and a bunch of phoenixes, but I'm less sure about that. Anyway, I can't find it, but if anyone can they should totes read it it's great. Thanks for the help (:

  When Newt is called in to remove a creature from a local tribe's sacred grounds, he had no idea that he will come across the most extraordinary creature he would ever encounter. There's just one catch...the dragon he finds is none other than a witch from well over sixty years in the future. Can he mend her broken heart from all the pain she ran away from? Fem Harry/Newt
