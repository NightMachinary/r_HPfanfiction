Because well they are really competent inventors they are actually really smart but they don't really care about being recognized as smart in a conventional so they aren't.

I don't want them to suddenly start caring about grades or anything. In fact I rather they didn't. Just have them be recognized as skilled and smart outside of grades. Maybe something with them as among the major characters or the major characters.
