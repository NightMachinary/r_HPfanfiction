Voldemort was finally killed, Harry was relived for finally being free of Voldemort influnce after all these years. In his hand lies the wand of wands, source of so much misfortune in wizarding world. Rony and Hermione discussed with him what they should do with it. Harry thought about the Tale of Beedle the Bard, and remembered all of the people who died because of this wretched wand and decided the best to do was get rid of this deadly hollow and end the cycle of violence for power...

- HARRY GET DOW....

In a fraction of seconds Harry was in the ground, he was confused, he looked at his side and saw Rony lying dead in the ground, until the end he was a brave and a loyal friend. Even without knowing what was happening, he tackled Harry and receive by himself the fatal blow of Avada kedavra curse. Hermione had a meltdown and started crying over the body of Rony. Harry screamed angrily:

- WHO DID THIS!!! SHOW YOURSELF!!! COWARD!!!

More Avada Kedavras kept coming, but Harry deflected easily all those attacks, the enemy was too far away to hope defeating Harry. So he launch a challenge:

- Find me, Mr Potter, you have something that now belongs to me.

Sometimes the bravery of Harry Potter is his worse enemy, the ideal was find any survivors of the battle to hunt down this assassin, but he was furious, he run towards Hogwarts, were the "shots" came from. He noticed two windows, which faced directly to the bridge, the first was from the supplies room, and the other was from Transfiguration class, which gave an good view to the bridge, he called his firebolt broom, and crashed the window. The classroom was dark, Harry looked at the professor desk were he found Professor Minerva Mcgonagall looking maliciously at him. Harry frozed.

- After all those years teaching brats, i only knew two persons who had the audacity to enter in my class like that, your father and, of course, you, Mister Potter.

Harry was rooted in the ground, minutes early he was capable of dealing with the person who was behind the attacks, but he had never expected to be his ol' teacher.

- A cat eat your tongue Mister Potter? -Harry could only said "y...you", Minerva continued- It was very easy to deceive that gaga bafoon all those years. That decrepit old man LOVED to be flattered.

Harry was furious to hear Minerva's insults to Dumbledore. How could she show so little respect by a men she worked for so many decades. Minerva smiled at Harry face and continued to show her true self.

- I used to admire Tommy, his thirst for power, his intelect and his obsession to uncover all the secrets of magic at any cost. He was, indeed, my best student, my masterpiece. Too sad he proved to be, in the end, just a little whiny mudblood.

Harry tried to disarm her, but she evaded the attack.

- Don't be silly, Mister Potter, do you really think that a basic spell will work against me? A master? For six years you escaped from death, it was stupid of my part beliving in those pawns. I guess

She picked her wand, Harry fought she would attack him as before, but she just pointed behind her, and use some hex to open a secret door in her classroom. She picked a box that looked like a present, and opened, she explained in a sarcastic tone to Harry that it was a present from Tommy. An Anubis statue was revealed.

- Did you know we used to be gods in Egypt?- Minerva cut her wrists- Those muggles feared and served us. -She drop her blood in the statue of Anubis- It's only fair that we go back in the place we belong.- She started to transform in Anubis.

Harry was screaming to himself to move, he just had defeated THE most powerfull Dark Wizard in the world, but he was unable to do something against his old teacher. The day got darker, since an eclipse appear covering the sun.

- Don't need do get embaressed, Mister Potter- Minerva's voice little resemble of what Harry was used to hear, her Anubis transformation distorted her voice making her sound like a monster.- I don't expect a fellow Gryffindor to be corageous against the power of an acient god.

Minerva jumped against Harry, all seemed lost, Harry closed his eyes, but suddenly he moved.

A too familiar voice said inside his head.

- It's not the time to get still Harry.

- Ron!?

Ron get out of Harry's body and revealed to be a ghost.

- Harry, our checkmate is near, you just need to keep fighting against Minerva.

Minerva laughed:

- Don't expect to be saved by a ghost, i will send both to the other world.

Ron vanished, but his presence was enough to restore Harry's courage, he started to fight back Mcgonaggal, but wasn't enough, she was unbeattable in her Anubis form. Speed, power and resistence was too much for Harry. When all hope seemed lost, he knew he would knew to appeal for his last resort, scorched-earth tatic. He pick the wand of the wands and bent it. Minerva screamed of pure anger.

- My wand!!! how dare you, insolent little brat.

Ron came back to the fight scene, and screamed.

- Minerva!!! Checkmate!!!

Hermione crashed into the class and turn on the Deluminator to iluminate the class. Minerva started screaming in pain.

- H....how!!?

Hermione started her monolgue:

- An Anubis transformation require little interference of lights in general, but sunlight is your natural weakness, we just needed to use the deluminator to absorve sunlight (remember that this thing can take out light).

Minerva was shocked, did that old man foreseen her plans, and gave to those brats the deluminator? She lost her temper and scream to Hermione.

- BUT THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT!!! I TAKED THE SUN, REMEMBER?

Hermione maintained her cool, and explained camly in a condescending tone , to Minerva's nerves.

- Surrexerunt Lumium, did you ever heard about it? It's a rose that absoves pure sunlight, is there where herbiologists take the extract of RÃ¡ tears. Madam Sprout would be mad when she finds out about what happened to her rose.

Neville Longbottom appeared carryin the Gryffindor sword, he look visibily upset about the betrayal. Cormack Maclaggen was by his side, looking with disdain to Minerva. She had another meldown and advance against Neville. Cormack hexed her with confundus. She thought she had obliterated Neville, but she missed. Not only that, but Neville was right on her side, she was exposed; he stabbed her in the neck, a dark blood started to come and she falled. Many Gryffendors appeared in the room, witnessing the last minutes of their housemaster. Many started to crying, after all, their years in Hogwrats was with Professor Minerva. She stopped moving, contemplating her life going away, she had an alucination and started mumbling before dying for good:

- Tommy.....Dumbledore..... After all...i was never able to get out of your shadow. Who i was for you both?

17 years later:

- Atention, the train for Hograwats is about to leave.

Harry looked for his son and gave him good luck.

- Dad, what if i'm selected to Slyteryn?

Harry gave his patternal look and said:

- Look son, you've the name of two headmaster in your name, bravest mans i've ever seen, and one of them was Slyteryn, besides, not all Gryffendors are pure hearted, and not all Slyteryns are wicked. In the end, choice is what matters. I believe in you, son, whatever you are, i'm sure you will make the right choice.

- Thanks dad

Harry rembered to ask:

- Oh, and say hi to Hagrid and Ron for me.

- Don't worry dad, i will, bye!!!

- Bye son....
