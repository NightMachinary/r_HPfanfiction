:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cant remeber much of this fic but harry learned to sing and had a beautiful voice and he sings at someone's funeral. In the fic he was abused by the Dursleys. He goes to Hogwarts and is sorted into Slytherin (I think but might be confusing my fics). I cant remeber much if it but he eventually stumbles upon the room of requirements and sits and plys a piano awhile singing and Cedric Digory comes in for choir practice (or at least I think it was choir practice). Harry and Cedric becomes friends.
