So I'm trying to introduce the world of fanfiction to one of my friends, but I'm struggling to find the best fic to start him off with. The story has to be reasonably polished (no horrible grammar or obvious spelling mistakes) and fairly captivating from the start. I've skimmed around the net and found a few suggestions, but nothing that really jumps out at me. Some common suggestions that I don't totally agree with have been:

- HPMOR which i feel is just too technical and slow at some parts to really draw in the audience as a first fanfic

- Seventh Horcrux which is one of my absolute favourites, but I feel that you need to already have read a few fics and understand the common tropes to derive the most fun out of this fic (The same can be said for a lot of the best crack fics I think)

- Pureblood Pretense series which I also really love, but it's quite slow to start off and doesn't really get addicting until year 2/3

Is there anything you guys can think of that sort of jumps straight into the action so to say and really draws you in from the start? I think it would probably best to start with a fic thats not too AU too. Any thoughts?


** I would probably start off with well written, canon-compliant oneshots, such as linkffn(Cauterize; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard; The Wendell that Wasn't; The Last Straw - Oneshot; The Fire Omens)

Then, I would go for oneshots that show a twist, an element of AU: linkffn(Geminio; The Greatest Minister of Magic; Antithesis)

From there, I would recommend canonical divergences, such as linkffn(Forging the Sword; On the Way to Greatness) although it might be better with complete fics at first. By this point, I would also start introducing some common tropes, such as time/dimension travel, dark!Harry, and so forth.

Finally, I would introduce 'milder' AU fics, such as linkffn(What You Leave Behind; The Changeling) and then later, full AU stories like linkffn(The Skitterleap; By the Divining Light; Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I)

Generally, I would advise against linking smut, at least at the beginning, since fanfiction already has a bad stigma. I would also recommend against shipping stories and EWE, as that may turn off readers who really enjoyed the canon.

Or you could just show them the glory that is linkffn(HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)

TL;DR: Start off with canon-compliant short stories and progressively introduce more aspects of fanfiction with well-written stories.

*** I think the oneshots are a really good idea actually. But all the good ones leave me disappointed that there isn't more. I definitely agree that lemons should be avoided until they are more comfortable with the genre.

**** Cauterize that was mentioned would be a really good place to start then, one of my favourite one shots

Sadly enough though, a lot of good ones are not completed like forging the sword etc. So I do recommend those that are completed

If you're looking for some comedy or crack, I recommend A Black Comedy, and the Seventh Hocrux

Other completed works I recommend are

Serpent and the mirror

The many deaths of harry potter by shayneT

The unforgiving minute

E: Blindness - not completed, I forgot oops

A life of smoke and silvered glass on AO3 is a fantastic Snape one-shot

*** I really like your reasoning hear though I don't know most of the stories you suggested even though I've read near a hundred, I assume they fall well in line with how you described them.

On the other hand, I don't know that canon-compliant need to be one of the first ones suggested. The very first fanfic I read was HPMOR and that got me hooked, I would argue that a story being well written and not getting too crazy in terms of wild canon divergence is best to start with. It needs to stick around Hogwarts and it should include a lot of known characters instead of going off into the writer's OC world.

Also, I 100% agree with you on the smut and shipping. You don't want to introduce someone to fanfiction like that, it would be like showing hentai or something really raunchy to someone to get them into anime, it really doesn't make sense.

** If your friend loves the original Series (plot, pairings, characters), better start off with Canon compliant fics. I suggest reading stories by certain authors such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]].

The first fic I finished reading was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867). Its writing is really good, and has almost a Canon like feel.

On the other hand, if you're the sort of person who would appreciate it, you /should/ read it first, or at least very early on. You're less likely to appreciate it once you have more experience with fanfic.

** I think HPMOR is the worst fanfic to get people started on. It results in tons and tons of people thinking it is the best fanfic ever, despite a large portion of them literally having not read a single other fanfic.

One might find it safest to start with canon compliant fics, but I kind of disagree there as well. I feel like that tends to get people too comfortable to stray out of that zone and find something a bit more AU. That only really applies to if you're recommending a fic to someone. If someone is trying to explore fanfic on their own, they will find what they want, like I started with canon compliant fics, wanting to know what happened after year 7 but before the Epilogue. That's what different than someone handing me a fic.

So, I usually recommend A Black Comedy as a first fic. It's got humor, action, and is well written.

** My first anime was Naruto and I loved it. I probably would not have been able to if I'd been familiar with too many of the tropes though, so it's really good as a first anime but not necessarily as a tenth or hundredth.

In the same vein it might be good to start with something epic that suffers from a slight overdose of trope usage. They won't know it's cliched the first time they encounter it right?

I would recommend something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the jungle]] By Jbern.
