Not H/Hr, H/G or slash.

I'm in this drought of fics that is making quite mad. The last good fic I read was Wand and Shield, x-over with Avengers, but it is abandoned, sadly.

I've read so so many fics that its hard to find new stuff these days, and considering I'm really picky with not wanting fics with Hermione as a main character, this limits a lot.

Just so you know what I can't stand in a fic, so you won't need to reccommend is (and the list is fairly big): Snape as a main, Hermione as a pairing, Bashing in general, ManipulativeDumbledore, Good/Sane/Parent Voldemort, Draco as a main, Evil Ron, Harems(unless REALLY well done, which I've never read one that I'd consider that), slash, Goblins as house elves, Independent/Emo/I'm the best and fuck the rest-Harry. I also dislike Cho as a pairing.

Btw, when I say "as a main" I mean as a main character after Harry, not centric. Which I also don't like, because I mostly enjoy Harry-centric fics. Though I do enjoy the occasional newgen fic. Ask Lavender was one of those. Also don't care about rating and about weird shit, as long as it makes sense and its good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.

â€‹

And perhaps this, except it's not /strictly/ Harry-centric, it's more Remus and Sirius centric, but has Harry chapters and it's all tied together nicely.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]

As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.

â€‹

There's also some I can recommend that are adventure/mystery with romance basically not being a part at all, but they are set against an H/G backdrop and you said you didn't want this. However if you want to give them a shot, I'll happily share. :)

*** Well, I've been reading the Bureaucratic from chapter 3 I think. Really really enjoying it so far.

I've seen the other one be recomended a few times here on reddit, but never got my attention. Maybe. Gonna read the first and see if I enjoy it. I'm not a huge fan of SI though, and this feels as if it its one.

My problem with H/G is that there's never that feeling of uncertainty. It may seem wrong of me, but whenver I see a H/G fic, I associate it with canon, which was shit for romance, and it feels as if its already set in stone. Even fics with Harry and Ginny never meeting in their lives before, idk, 16yo, like in Return of the Marauders or Remember, where she went to Beauxbatons after the CoS, it feels as if I already know what's going to happen. There's no mystery, no anticiapation for what's to come. I know it sounds dumb, but that's why I don't usually read romance-centric fics with H/G.

I really don't mind if its background though, or backstory, like in Grow Young with Me.

Ah, if you are worried about SI, I promise it is 100% not that at all. I do have OCs in it, which I like to think are well developed. I'd definitely love to know if you still feel that way after, if you check it out.

Harry and Ginny could have had more of a romantic development in canon, true. Out of curiosity, have you read the Changeling? it doesn't fulfill any of your listed here requirements (it's a Ginny-centric fic where she is sorted into Slytherin) but it's entirely awesome, has great character development, and the writing is some of the best I've seen!

And re those other recs, if you don't mind a background minor Hinny, do check out this one!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic][Harry Potter and the Eversion of Magic]]

It is nearly eleven years since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is content. When a mysterious artefact is stolen from the Ministry of Magic and someone Harry had never expected to see again returns, a new adventure begins.

â€‹

And if you'd like, its sequel:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047159/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Reversion-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Reversion of Time]]

Travelling through Time in pursuit of an unstable Time-Turner made of spare parts should be all in a day's work for Head Auror Harry Potter; it's just what he needs to distract himself from his administrative backlog. But things don't go according to plan. Or perhaps the plan isn't what he thought it was. It's a whole new adventure and Time is of the essence.

***** This post-war fic seems really interesting. I usually enjoy adult-Harry but rarely they are well done. Yeah, I really don't mind if its H/G if its background or if its post-war. There was one fic that is H/G that I enjoyed where she never met Harry in school, and she started her Auror training with Susan Bones as her squad leader. It felt original and believable, so i enjoyed.

I've seen so many mixed reviews about the Changeling and its sequel that I really don't know what to think about it. And considering its in an AU with Ginny as a Slytherin, which in canon she's has almost no traits that I could see as Slytherin material, it seems weird for me. Though, considering the amount of fics with Harry in Slytherin that I enjoy, it seems stupid of me to dismiss it. Maybe its time to read it. Now that I think about it, there's a couple fics with Harry in slytherin where he "converts" her into joining the house, instead of Gryffindor, that I enjoyed.

Just tell me one thing about it. How bad is the "politickids" in there?

I also love adult Harry. They other one I wanted to recommend to you is adult Harry, but I am not sure when it's getting updated again. I guess we shall see.

Speaking of adult Harry and Hinny... would you have an interest in a very old fanfic that was written during the old summer pre-ootp, is Harry centered, and develops its own Hinny different from canon. It has 2 sequels that have a fascinating storyline and span into adult Harry.

Ok this is probably going to amuse you but... politickids?

Politickids. Have you ever read those kinds of fics where there's all that wank about "Most Ancient House of Jesus" shit where the kids (this mostly happens with Slytherin fics) are all little shits with delusions of grandeur, thinking they are their parents and talk about this tradition, or that rule about etiquette, all the while talking like little lords, Apparent Heir Malfoy this, Presumptive Heiress Parkinson that. As if 11yo have any power whatsover over the Wizengamot and the ministry.

16yo+ sure, its possible, specially for orphans or heirs, but not on the first night on the house. Which happens in this types of fics all the time.

Haha ok so, you asked for it! So here it is, with both of its sequels. Keep in mind it is very, very old, very AU now. It's based on knowledge from the first four books and it has basically none of the fanon things popular now, such as politickids. It was written in 2002/2003. Also it has, admittedly, been like a good 5 years since I last read it, but they remain some of my favorites to day. Plot-wise, it was great. By AgiVega.

I don't usually mind old fics, one of my favourite fics started in 2003 and its still going strong, and the author (dunno if its a guy or a gal, but with the way they write, it seems to me like a gal) is really really good with introducing the ideas that came out over the years, like with the Horcruxes and stuff. its called linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) which is a massive fic with great romance, a wonderful Ron, Dean and Ginny, one of the best Tonks/Remus "will they, won't they" and my second favourite OC character in fanon, followed only by Abby from Grow young With Me.

I love fics where Harry has a baby, so this sparkled my interest. Imma save it up for later.

The series has 3 main entries and each is well over 100k words

The Harry/Fleur fic is a little over 500k.

Both fics are well written, well paced, and have complex enough characterizations to keep things interesting and new without going insane (a la "Lord Harrison James Potter/Black/Peverell/gryffindor/slytherin")
