Are there any notable big changes to popular pairings, tropes, or anything else about how the community feels now compared to in the past?

For context I myself also fall into the above category, I'm just interested in others' perspectives and views too, as we'll all have different views and experiences!


** I started writing and reading fan fiction on the internet when I was twelve or thirteen, so I guess I've been involved in the overall community for about twelve-ish years. I specifically remember a huge dust-up for a while about whether Blaise was male or female, since he'd only appeared in passing up until GoF, which was the latest release at the time. Because of this, his character was paired with everyone under the sun as either stated gender, at least on the site I used.

Also, Dramione was just a (fairly) normal "bad boy and good girl fall in love" trope, rather than a way of life like some Dramione fans make it out to be. Actually, I've noticed a huge increase in "dark" pairings, Tom Riddle, Bellatrix, Snape, etc, mostly with Harry or Hermione, since their backstories were expanded a bit more in later books.

#+end_quote

I never understood that. Blaise is a strictly masculine name. I really don't know where the ambiguity comes from.\\
I read a long time ago the book Dead Mountaineer's Hotel, in which the gender of one of the characters is never defined. The protagonist kept trying to have them revealing it by their sentence structure and the other one managed to avoid doing so. I don't know if it works well in English, but I read it in French, and it was very funny.\\
Ever since being aware of this ambiguity with the character of Blaise, I've thought it would be funny to do that kind of stuff and play around with this trope, but I have yet to find a fic doing so.\\
Would someone know of one?

*** What a great answer! Immediately the movie characterization comes to mind as why the characterization of Ron (and perhaps by extension, the Weasleys in general) changed in that period - most of them are quite poorly served by the movies, whether it's minimizing them or /cough/ giving positive Ron moments to other characters like Hermione -_-

I'm a bit of a purist so it bites a bit that a significant portion of the community now discovers Harry Potter and the world of Harry Potter through the movies first - or possibly, /solely/ through the movies nowadays - kind of ironic, given that the Harry Potter series was originally praised a lot for getting kids to read books again. Of course, the movies are their own thing and quite good, but I don't like how some of the themes are missed or eroded in them and, as I say, how certain characters are changed. (making Beauxbatons and Durmstrang a stereotypical girls' and boys' school respectively still really gets my goat in particular! before we even get to movie!Ginny :O)

I never used to read much Harry-centric het back in the day myself so I'm slightly surprised (although, I shouldn't be, in retrospect, they were an official couple and seeded before that) that Harry/Cho was ever a popular pairing! The movies probably are a reason why that one's sunk like a stone over the last ten years, giving Cho's friend's betrayal to Cho herself.

Yeah, fics written before HBP and DH were really something, I think I discovered fanfic around that time too. I also distinctly remember a general feel that the make-up demographically of fandom was changing to have more and more US people in it as the movies became more and more popular and, of course, as each new book came out and the fandom grew in response.

I'm now kind of intrigued as to where it will go in ten years' time when (if) stuff like Fantastic Beasts and Cursed Child come to be accepted as solid canon on a par with the books, or if JKR drops some more bombs in interviews or changes her mind on anything else with hindsight.

The only other movie I watched was the 2nd part of the 7th book adaptation which was a bit ok for me.

** We're more cynical now.

The HP world has been picked over a thousand times. There's a lot to love, and a lot of space for creativity, but the world as Rowling wrote it is fundamentally nonsensical.

It doesn't /work./ The money is weird, the magic is silly, wizards are ridiculous, and the population shouldn't support a giant, bureaucratic government.

That said, all these flaws make for lots of fanfic opportunities. All you need is to pick something at random, decide to examine it, and you'll see dozens of ways to either fix it or explain it.

And because the world is so malleable, these fixes and explanations generally make as much sense as anything else.

That means it's 493 knuts to a galleon. None of these numbers are even, they're just randomly chosen numbers meant to confuse Harry, and by extension, the reader (why she had Hagrid say 'it's easy enough' when it really wasn't). It's JKR's way of showing how whacky and different the wizarding world was from the muggle world, and also how they haven't adapted to the modern decimalization system that we have to make things easier and more sensible, where we have a hundred pennies for a dollar, or a hundred pence for a pound.

But like you said, this adds to the magical, quirky atmosphere and really isn't important otherwise.

The thing about this was that pence could be divided into even more subdivisions because base 12 is divisible by more than 2 numbers. But once inflation made these numbers useless it was more logical to switch to a different system.

What if a baker prices a loaf of bread at one dollar. How is he going to price it if he wants to cut it into 8 pieces? 12.5 cents each?

Thankfully that doesn't matter, because a whole cake will always be cheaper than 8 eights of a cake. It just makes sense to pay less for the bulk item. So most likely, 62 sickles each.

Also a galleon is a lot for a cake. A /lot/.

Insurance doesn't exist in the Harry Potter world.

We already divide numbers by amounts that don't 'make sense'. What happens when an item is 19.99 and is half price? How do you halve that, you get half a cent! You round, of course. Rounding is perfectly normal.

****** Magical, quirky, and fun doesn't cut it as an explanation when certain parts of canon cross from whacky to being downright illogical. By its nature magic should be strange, but not to the point where it causes people to act downright insane. There's no reason for there to be a ministry that is so big as to need multiple specialised departments to handle a population befitting a small (American) city, or big town. They basically have a House of Lords! As others have said, the currency is nonsensical. There are glaring plot holes and inconsistencies everywhere! Who leaves the child of a friend at the doorstep of the child's relatives who have just been described as "the worst sort of Muggles imaginable" by their deputy headmistress? In the middle of autumn at night no less! And doesn't even come around to make sure these Muggles treat the child properly?

You have to face it; there are a huge number of inconsistencies and plot holes. Most could be fixed with probably minimal repercussion. Some big plot holes exist as plot devices. Others are just a result of the earlier part of the series being more geared towards children and being part of the British school series style of books Rowling was trying to write. Regardless, these issues can't be explained as magic and quirkiness.

Aurors must number a fair amount to be able to handle the amount of crime that the British Wizarding World must have to be able to have a street that is all but a black market out in the open. And from a quote from the 4th book, we have at least 500 Ministry workers, if not more:

  Seats a hundred thousand... Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year.

Certainly far more than a paltry 5 per office.

I'm not going to even argue about currency, since others have tried and failed to convince you.

Harry is most certainly abused. Physically? Not very much, beyond being denied food more than is normal. But could you call telling a child that they are worthless, that their parents were worthless drunks, denying him emotional comfort, having him live in a cupboard, doing chores and being denied gifts while his cousin is practically treated a prince who can do no wrong anything but emotionally abusive? Not to mention that Dudley's favorite game is Harry-hunting, which the school definitely saw. Unless Dumbledore was up to some shenanigans, this would mean that the school was willfully negligent.

#+begin_quote
  'the biggest bunch of Muggles I've laid eyes on'

Literally just means they're fat.

And when it comes down to Dumbledore leaving Harry at the Dursleys, it was an initially contrived plot device to start the hero's journey. Beyond the first book, everything else it added came after. With how brilliant Dumbledore was, it would be exceedingly hard for him not to find a way to give Harry some other protection. Furthermore, given warning and what he already knew of Petunia, Dumbledore not checking is immensely illogical. And if someone you're close friends with passes away and you can't take care of their children, most people usually feel enough obligation to check up on them periodically. Dumbledore, or even Remus would have done something if it was actually logical.

** I've been involved with fanfic for a long, long time, not just HP. In a way, aside from major drama, it's been hard to notice changes as they're happening, because I've changed just as much. But I do have my old favourites to go back and re-read, and some of the differences are striking.

And I don't just mean all the weird terms people used to have for things---like those ship names that were so popular but just look insane now, or the fact that anything /remotely/ erotic would be tagged as "lemon" or sometimes "lime" (still cracks me up ahaha why is citrus sexy??). Or everybody being a Mary Sue! Overly perfect/lucky/beautiful/tortured characters haven't faded all that much in popularity (hello Daphne Greengrass), but we've abandoned Mary as a concept.

But attitudes have changed a /lot/. If you look at authors' notes, or even story content, there was this huge defensiveness around homosexual relationships that you just don't see anymore. Authors went to extreme lengths to justify things like Harry/Draco, whether that was a "don't like don't read" mantra or setting up antagonists (to be heroically defeated) who objected to the relationship on the basis of "they're both men/hOw To MaKe BAbiEs" rather than "they're totally ideologically opposed." Now, authors, readers, and characters rarely bat an eyelash at the idea of Harry (or anyone) being gay. Nobody feels the need to defend a gay pairing being /gay/.

There are other things, too, like new fanon ideas gaining popularity and old stuff disappearing (rip the creativity of seventh-year-speculation fics), but to me, the fact that fanfic has changed to reflect the attitudes of society at large is pretty amazing. While fan communities are typically very socially liberal, older fanfic shows how much the pressures they face have changed.

*** That's a really interesting point about slash pairings, you're right of course. Attitudes in general have changed a lot there.

But on the flipside. Maybe it's just a reddit-based community thing, but it feels like there are a lot more straight men in the fanfic fandom now in 2017. One of the most commom requests, it feels like, is to have the qualifier 'no slash', which then goes on to be defended by any number of reasons clarified by internal logic or personal taste, people get very defensive over it.

While authors were more defensive in advance about their slash back in the day, it also felt back then that it was /generally/ an accepted mainstream part of the fandom unless you were a socially conservatibe fan. Now, maybe it's just because I am a longterm lgbt fan myself, but it feels nowadays like slash is more shunted to the side and seen as its own subgenre of AU, instead of something that could naturally just be part of the world that already existed. I find that a little disheartening.

It is rarely "no relationship", "no shipping" or "no sex", is it? Not "gen fic only"? Just, "no slash".

I don't think straight people should feel the need to hide from gay relationships, because that plays into the erasure angle and sends the suggestion that we are just something that can be hidden from. If we truly were perceived as just normal and like any other couple, straight people wouldn't have a problem in getting invested in gay couples, the way that we are /all/ expected to get invested in Harry/Ginny, or Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, or Daenerys and Jon Snow.

To ask for 'no slash' sends the implicit message that /to be uncomfortable/ with reading about gay people is acceptable, normal, even expected, and certainly something that people should be allowed to be, and that the presence of gay characters in the story would completely prevent them from enjoying the story otherwise, despite any of its plot or themes.

Now, personally I feel that this is a lack of exposure to gay people and gay couples, that would cause someone to react this way. And to go back to the original point, back in the day, that was where a pairing like Remus/Sirius felt different, it felt that the whole community in general accepted that as a valid pairing that wouldn't put them off reading about in a story that included it, instead of nowadays people actively requesting stories with 'no slash' - that is to say, stories with no gay characters.

As a gay person it's a little disheartening to see people specifically requesting to read about a fantasy world where people like you don't exist, and no mention of you existing is allowed to be made. It gives you a lot of thoughts about what kind of person would make such requests.

******* You're looking at the appeal from the wrong perspective. From the perspective of someone who's gay, or at least heavily involved in those communities, reading slash would be interesting. From someone outside of that perspective, there's a variety of reasons they don't like it. Perhaps they don't like to read about relationships that have a reputation of being very physical. Perhaps they find the possible slash relationships uncomfortable. I for one, almost always refuse to read a Drarry fic, let alone a Snarry fic (though LV/HP is as acceptable as Tomione, provided is has some interesting psychological elements). On the other hand, something like Sherlock/Watson to me is sweet. Perhaps it's their way of filtering out a particular group of stories they find are generally written by female teenagers with no experience of what a proper relationship should look like. Or perhaps most importantly, most readers have some degree of immersion---some degree of living out a fantasy when reading fiction, and even more so for fanfiction. This means that for a heterosexual, it can be downright jarring to be reading about something so outside their sexual preference (though something has to be said about the fascination of one sex at the eroticness of homosexual relationships between those of the other sex).

******** But all of those arguments fall flat with the fact that gay people are expected to watch, read, and get invested in straight couples and relationships.

It's just a lack of exposure, in my view, that leads straight readers of slash (or, viewers of any gay relationships in fiction and media) to be put off or disconcerted by it, which unfortunately proceeds the issue into a vicious circle.

My point was that we /aren't/ an exciting variation, /we are normal/, just as much as straight relationships and couples are. It shouldn't be weird or niche to think of straight people caring about or getting invested in or even being able to read Remus/Sirius or Harry/Cedric or Blaise/Draco, because those pairings are just as normal and valid as Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny. It's by continually treating us as niche and with kid gloves that sends the message 'gay relationships are for gay people (and some of the opposite sex to those involved) to see, straight relationships are /normal/ and /for everyone/', which I feel is a negative, and even casually homophobic message to send, and it's one I feel should be challenged. Why do straight guys want so much to hide from the reality of gay male couples, and straight women lesbians? Just my personal views on the matter.

*** Lemon came about as a way to escape censorship. From TVtropes:

#+begin_quote
  The origin of the term is obscure, but the most common etymology traces it back to the classic hentai anime series Cream Lemon, by way of an early mailing list for publishing erotic anime fanfic, called "The Lemon List" in its honor. The term derives from the idea that like a lemon, sexuality looks beautiful and alluring, but when you experience it more directly, it's bitter and sour.

Now we've settle into the established tropes and cliches and work around within them. There tends to not be a lot of world building like there used to be. It feels like people now just mash canon and fanon to tell the same story but how they want it done.

A lot of the AUs (which since Harry Potter has 778000+ fics on FFnet alone creates this distinction) are incredibly far out of the established world versus the canon rehashes that diverge. So it makes the readings very...interesting.

But around ~15 years ago, there was a lot of really vitriolic arguing about ships. There were actual ship wars. Harry/Hermione versus Ron/Hermione was seriously vicious. Harry/Ginny vs Harry/Draco was also really vicious, especially because a lot of the Hinny shippers were actually genuinely homophobic. In general there was a lot of homophobia in the fandom. These days there's a lot less homophobia and slash ships are a lot more accepted.

If I go back now to the old fics I used to love I'm often disappointed. I suppose many authors have gotten older, and have more experience. I certainly don't appreciate my own writing from when I was 14. Not that there weren't great fics, just that the standard seems higher. Or maybe I'm just better at searching through drivel :)

Also there's a wider variety of types of fanfic.

Also a big change is that characters seems more defined, characterization wise. Like before Ootp/HBP we had no idea what snape's background was, so there were a lot of authors portraying him as a rich pureblood type etc.

Cousin marriage is marriage between cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents or people who share other fairly recent ancestors). Opinions and practice vary widely across the world. In some cultures and communities, cousin marriage is considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it is subject to social stigma.

****** I read somewhere that the optimum for genetic compatibility was between forth or fifth Cousins. It's closer than I would've thought. There are other considerations, such as the necessity to add 'new blood' to the line every now and then (every 3 or 4 generations IIRC), but it seems that reproducing with people that are too far from your gene pool can also lead to some problems.\\
So is it that bad?\\
If it happens generation after generation then probably, but if you marry your first cousin, you shouldn't face any real problem unless you get unlucky (except of course the social ones), provided it doesn't become some kind of family tradition.\\
Issues are a lot more likely to appear if you marry your brother or sister.

What you are assuming about JKR's personality is contrary to the reality.

What you are portraying as being "the whole context" is simply the media's sensationalist reporting. The interview is a lot more nuanced contrary to your interpretation of it being "H/Hr perfect, R/Hr terrible". She never expounded on the supposed merits of H/Hr - that would be an endorsement. Talking about H/Hr simply as a comparison to R/Hr isn't one. And even if she did mean that Harry is better for Hermione in every single way compared to Ron, that still doesn't matter, because as someone else has said in this thread, the interview was only about Hermione; not about Harry.

Also, Harry may not cause Hermione too much stress, but it seems that Harry wants someone similar to himself. Ginny and Cho were athletes, so they all had the same interests. They know how to engage people. Harry preferred someone who dealt with strong emotions like he did, or at least like how he wanted to.

  She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy.
#+end_quote

Unlike Cho, who let her feelings out in a flood of tears, Ginny was renowned for her violent bursts of anger.

#+begin_quote
  Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room.
#+end_quote

She is independent and intelligent without being overbearing.

In contrast, Ron had been taken care of by other people all his life. Even though he showed some disdain for it, he was used to being led. He could do things on his own, and brilliantly, but he needed someone smart to give him suggestions and support. He also needed someone he could trust.

Hermione liked it when Krum gave her attention and appreciation. When Ron was able to express that, she started to warm up towards him.

**** Harry/Hermione was called "HMS Pumpkin Pie," in reference to a fanfic where Hermione kisses Harry and he tastes like pumpkin pie.

Problem with this? Pumpkin Pie is an AMERICAN thing. Brits have never taken to pumpkin pie at all... this isn't for lack of effort on the part of chefs; cookbook writers have been trying hard to make British people like pumpkin pie for over 300 years, but no doing.

Not sure, but it might be the revelation of this fact that "Pumpkin Pie" stopped seeing so much use and "Harmony" became more popular...

**** Actually, H/G used to be called "HMS Orange Crush" and after /OotP/ "HMS Chocolate". "HMS Chocolate" came from the "Chocolate in the Library" scene, although I do remember seeing people use it before /OotP/ was published, in reference to Ginny's eye colour. I wish that ship name was brought back, considering that what we have now is simply "Hinny" (particularly among more casual fans, or on Tumblr).

Dumbledore because Minister. Lupin headmaster. But the most unbelievable part to me of it was when Dumbledore died and he was buried at Hogwarts. I remember thinking how that would never happen. How wrong I was.

** Before Order of the Phoenix came out, I remember enjoying stories pairing Harry and Ginny together. I felt like the way early fan fic writers wrote the development of the relationship of the two was already good so when the Half-Blood Prince came out, I felt like fanfic was loads better than what happened in canon. Or maybe that was because I was a teenager back then. For a few years, I didn't read fanfics. When I got back to reading in my late 20s, I was surprised by all the bashing. Everyone just seems to hate Ginny and by extension, the other Weasleys.

There is also the Dumbledore bashing has become almost standard in all fan fiction. I miss the way the Headmaster was presented as simply a silly old man.

** I started reading and writing HP fan fiction not too long after OOTP came out. One of my favorite epic stories was by an author called LavenderBrown and I just can't remember the name of either of the two stories. It picked up right after the events at the Department of Mysteries and had Ron as a Seer, which was a popular thing back then along with the theory that DD was a time-traveling Ron. Really fantastic writing and excellent smutty bits.

The thing I miss the most is the close knit community I used to enjoy as part of the Checkmated.com site. I made a lot of RL friends though the fandom, some of which have gone on to have real, actual careers in writing. But the world moves on and I'm glad to see that the HP fan fiction community is still around and evolving.

*** The most bittersweet fanfic experience, for me, is starting a promising but badly-written fic, or starting to follow a promising but rough writer, and watching them improve by leaps and bounds as you read, and then watching the (better and better) updates get less frequent until they finally leave to do something more respectable and profitable with their skills.

** I have been reading/writing fanfiction since I was 12, shortly after OOTP came out. So it's been 14 years (wow!). The biggest change I've noticed is the type of stories you see then vs now. Back then I felt that most stories fell into one of these categories: Founders era, Marauders era, Hogwarts era, and New Generation era. Some were canon, some were AU. Nowadays, the types of stories I come across just blow my mind on how /different/ they are. People really branched out. Makes sense I suppose, because now the series is finished.

Also, I'm way more picky about what stories I read now lol if I'm going to devote time to reading one (because lets be honest, I will probably binge read it and stay up until stupid hours of the morning to finish it), I research them ahead of time and decide which one sounds better lol. And I'm more critical of writing style. Bad writing kind of turns me off of a story ngl.

My writing way back when was atrocious. I've edited all of them to say "warning: bad writing ahead". Heh.

** Back then there were a lot of theories and deep essays on mugglenet and HP lexicon because we didn't know what's going to happen in the books. People over-analysed the names of people and places to death. I remember some genius deduced Snape's entire allegiance and love for Lily after that scene in OotP! The dates and other details like people's names were very gradually revealed on JKR's website and HP Lexicon so we filled in the details ourselves.

The fanfiction community itself is very different, too. For starters, the writers appear more mature and older. Back in good old 2007 there was a lot of Lily listening to Good Charlotte on her iPod. /My Immortal/ really wasn't the only fic that was /like that/. Post-OotP people wrote a lot of stories where Harry is adopted by Snape, or is secretly Snape's son. There also seemed to be way more slash and dumb fics where head boy and head girl share a dormitory, and a lot of the slash ended with men getting pregnant. There was also a lot of de-aging shenanigans, Freaky Friday type fics and Harry going back in time to meet his cool emo parents and looking at their iPods. The stories people write these days are just so much more complex and plot-driven. About 10 years ago there were a lot of serious stories too, but they were gathering dust in the Gen section of FFN.

There were also a lot of communities poking fun at fanfics on LiveJournal, and even at the books themselves. [[https://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=mctabby&keyword=Summary%20Executions&filter=all][McTabby]] used to collect the funniest summaries and it was a whole big thing. There were also numerous sporking communities that seem to have vanished off the face of the Earth. I think authors now write more serious works than /Severus Snape the wereflamingo/ and people would probably get really hurt and offended if something like that was still around.

** I've read fanfics since my early teens, and there are definitely a whole lot of differences in the HP fanfic scene as compared to a decade ago.

Most notably, the fandom opinion on Dumbledore and the Weasleys (particulatly Ron) has soured incredibly...

Back in the day, Dumbledore was almost always positively portrayed, even if he tended not to do much apart from play matchmaker and hold meetings. Nowadays, you can't throw a brick without hitting a Dumblebore-bashing fic.

Same with the Weasleys -- though Arthur and the Twins are a little less likely to be vilified, you're a lot more likely to see fics where Molly, Ginny and Ron are portrayed as utter scum. Ron in particular has been turned into the fandom punching bag.

It might just be me, but I tend to see a lot more "Harry In Name Only" story these days, where Harry has either been brought up differently, or something else happened to change him, and now he's essentially a completely different character... inevitably he'll be a LOT more badass and a LOT more likely to defy any and all authority figures (like Dumbledore), quite often he's totally overpowered.

There do, however, seem to be fewer "Hermione is secretly an adopted Pureblood" fics around these days. Used to be that "Pureblood!Hermione" was as overused as a cliche as "Villain!Dumbledore" is now, but I haven't seen any of them for years. Usually, Hermione would be a pureblood so she could get together with Draco, but the Draco/Hermione fics we see these days tend to find a different solution to it.

Sirius/Remus fics don't seem to be as common as they once were either... really, in the old days of the fandom those two were almost like the "official gay couple" of the HP fandom. You do still see the occasional Sirius/Remus stories, but the pairing is nowhere near as prominent as it used to be.

*** That's a big change I find as well, /so much/ less Wolfstar pairing than there used to be. Because if a character has a canonical het relationship there's no way for them to be bi, bisexuals don't exist?? One of my top pairings so it bites a bit to see it fall by the wayside.

Yeah, non-Harry Harry annoys me a little too, fics then become an OC playing in JKR's sandbox - which is cool, but be upfront about it! I find myself wondering what caused this change, it could be a number of things of course, but it's still something I come back to in my head a lot. Finding out that a lot of people in the fandom find canon Harry boring or unrealistic was really eye opening to me because I've always seen a lot of myself in him - but then, I am a UK person of a similar age so maybe that's not so surprising; other fans with greater distance may naturally have a different reaction to him.

**** I think it has a lot to do with Harry being a reader stand-in, really.

Harry is your classic "kind of bland main character." He has a personality, but compared to almost any other character in the series it's not a particularly complex or interesting one. This is of course on purpose... partly it's so that he can provide a contrast to the more strongly-characterised supporting cast, and partly it's so that the readers more easily can put themselves in his place and experience the story through him.

And as such, a lot of readers (I notice especially a lot of male readers) decide to make him more of a self-insert. "This is how Harry SHOULD have been, cause it's how I would have been, and Harry is me." So we get a lot of Harrys who are essentially thirtysomething American action heroes, just in the skin of a British wizard kid.

Or that's what I think anyway. :)

** Been in the community on and off since 2005, here's what I've noticed as a writer who recently got back into HP fanfic (and I finished my slow burn WIP, yay!):

- There is a lot of common trope recycling now, more than even a few years ago. I find that writers don't even need to explain the plot in their summaries anymore, they just say "time turner fic" or "marriage law with a twist". This is inevitable I guess, but just interesting.

- This may be a result of writers getting older / more experienced, but a lot of the newer smut isn't as cringeworthy. That said, I feel like my quality bar for fanfic is pretty low (as opposed to my quality bar for a published book) so this may be moot.

- I noticed the Blaise female/male confusion as well; in fact some stories I remember from back in the day call Blaise a "hermaphrodite" or mark him as someone under some odd gender switching spell. For the former, I guess the authors didn't understand anything about transgender people or non-binary people...

- Dark!Harry rewrites I feel are more popular; I noticed a lot of these after OotP came out but there seems to be a resurgence, and a lot of reimagining Harry as a master of death in DH.

I'm actually really excited about some of the Fantastic Beasts stories coming out now; Young Dumbledore and Grindelwald stories were fun after DH, and I'm thrilled to enter that world again!

** I feel really old right now, especially reading all these "I started at Harry Potter" fanfic authors/readers. Haha! I started "shipping" and turned to fanfic when I was 8. I read "The Hobbit" for the first time and was so sad that Bilbo and Thorin didn't get to have babies. My mom had to explain everything after that. Talk about embarrassing. That was 3 decades ago kiddies.

Ok. Most noted changes in Harry Potter land are the PLETHORA of girl!Harry stories using the same tropes as everyone else. I normally don't have any problems with it. But they're getting so far away from Harry as person I just can't picture some of them anymore.

Next is there are a rising number of fanfic crossovers in more MMORPGs and popular TV shows. Like the rising number in Dungeon Siege, Oblivion & Skyrim, Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. It's becoming harder to tell the people who love obscurity and those that are sci fi/fantasy nerds. lol That line gets thinner every year. Especially since fanfiction is rather mainstream now.

I personally haven't seen a new trope invented in a REALLY long time. Just the same old ones. This fandom doesn't lack magic but it needs a new shot of ingenuity.

We're obviously getting more violent as a race. It's reflected in the things we read. Like it was pointed out before me. It's pretty disturbing actually. We've always been an inherently violent race but you can REALLY see that in the dark fics. It's in the darkest of them that I can understand why people murder and other squicky things. That's why i read them sparingly. With the lights on.

There was a big run not to long ago on the Harry as a Dad to Teddy fic. Seems it's still popular.

The thing i've noticed most of all is there seem to be more acceptance of Slash, less in fighting than there was and less shipping wars. But, the problem with the last is now that everything is said and done in Canon, the fandom is not as entertaining as a whole. That just makes me sad.
