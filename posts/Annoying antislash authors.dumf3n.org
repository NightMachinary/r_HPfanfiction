** YEs! I feel like a lot of people put these stories up that try to have a serious plot interspersed by smut (like, 50/50 balance), and I just... why. It feels like if you logged onto pornhub and the video had a random part in the middle where they discussed politics. Like seriously. If I want to read porn, imma read porn. If I want to read plot, I don't want to stop the story every time the author gets horny.

If a character--especially a love interest--exists solely as a fucktoy, they don't belong in the story. Strong female character doesn't mean girl who punches things, it means girl who makes choices relevant to the plot and has her own story going on.

** Yeah, I agree that smut should be labeled as such fairly clearly - having it in a story is an important element to know upfront, I'd say. At least if it's going to be anything more than a simple cut to black/implication, or if it's the focus of the plot.

On the matter of slash, I wonder how much of it is from people who think that slash = same-sex smut. Personally I know that's what I always assumed - and I'd react differently to a fic labelled "Harry/Draco slash" than "Harry/Draco romance".

I will disagree about this section:

#+begin_quote
  I cant even remember a story where a male character dated one girl, then broke up in an amicable fashion, then dated someone else. It's all TRUE LOVE, or the author skips the trouble and just goes straight to that godawful harem trope. No subtlety or ambiguity.
#+end_quote

It's not easy to build up a romance believably. It's even harder to do so twice in the same story - if it's included, I think it has to be written (from the author's side) as fairly easy to see that it's not the final pairing. For instance if the pairing is Harry/Hermione, having him date Ginny earlier is not going to be a problem - but if you build /that/ one up to be 'true love' or an amazing relationship for 10 chapters, it'll run into a brick wall when you try to switch it over to the 'real' pairing. It's a tough one to do.

*** Yeah, not sure what OP is smoking, but it is almost impossible to write more than one good relationship in a fic. Which, funnily enough, is the same reason why harem fics feel shallow. If you want to develop a relationship, that takes words. If you want more than one done well, you will need a lot of words and end up bogging down the other story elements. It doesn't even matter if the relationships are sequential or simultaneous.

I don't read fics that say "no slash." Not because that's all I read, but because it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm bisexual, and those words just... really rub me the wrong way. I'll read ANY pairing provided it's got a interesting plot (don't really care about smut), but that phrase makes me hit the back button instantly.

** "No slash" is a good tag to filter out because it's really unnecessary since you can tag your fics with "M/F", "M/M", "F/F", etc. It's mostly the sign of a writer that isn't using the tools Ao3 has already built in. It also most likely correlates with an author that has more than a few unnecessary tags, thus cluttering up their comic with 'tagspam'. Said authors should be avoided, as the intersection between "authors that write well" and "authors that tagspam" is very, very small.

** The thing is that it's very difficult to write a friendly break up because many things which break a relationship are obvious from an outside perspective. So either the relationship will not convince the reader, or the breakup will feel like an asspull. It is not easy to sell one relationship in a convincing fashion, nevermind two or three. It'sbbasically the same issue as with harems, only that the relationships are not simultaneous. You still need to make two, three or even more relationships impactful, and then you need to break them up without demonising anyone. And if you do it, it will take a lot of words. So the other plot elements will be bogged down.

While this isn't unrealistic, and common in real life, if you start building up a relationship as "the one" but don't actually intend to ship those 2 people in the end, you're inevitably going to leave some people unsatisfied who stop reading the fic once the first relationship dies. I'm probably one of them, with a few exceptions (which mostly just boil down to personal ship preferences). It's not bad writing, but it might explain why this is very rare. That, and it's hard to write well in first place.

One thing I've been tempted to look for is a fic that builds up an early after-school marriage (for example, Ron/Hermione) but over time, they realize that they simply aren't compatible in the long term -- too much fights, too many things they disagree on, etc. Ultimately, they divorce, without any hard feelings. However, I doubt I'd finish reading the story if I did find a fic like this, because I'm a sucker for HEA and have never taken shipping failures well in fics.

** Yeah, I know what you mean. So many people just disregard slash but there are so many good stories out there and even some where the pairing isn't even the main focus. Personally I've come to only use Ao3 nowadays to read fics because of the tags. You can just search for the things you want but you can also just filter the fics out with the tags you don't want to have. So you can filter all the porn what plot stories out if you are not in the mood for that and you get all the romance storys you want. You have to get to know the tags a little to know which most of the authors use but then you really can search for what you want.

I honestly don't care how good a fic is going to be otherwise, if the author considers the usual suspects (Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort) shipable with Harry, I know that I will not be enjoying that fic. Because we have a fundamentally different read on the characters in the HP universe. If someone wrote a decent Harry/male Muggleborn (other than Dean), I might give it a shot.

But I can't comprehend why anyone would inflict the terrorists who worked towards his parents' (Voldemort, Snape) or friends' (Snape, Malfoy) murder upon Harry. What did Harry do wrong to deserve such a fate?

**** I guess there is just a certain appeal to this whole enemies to lovers trope or that an "evil" character is redeemable but sometimes it's just more fun to write/read about a dark character. But it's not only slashfics that do that but there are also Bellatrix/Harry fics or similar ships. It all depends on the personal taste of the reader then.

In the HP fandom, there is not much difference because you basically either have Harry's honorary family or Death Eaters. And to be perfectly honest, I am not interested in reading about either of them. Just like I don't want to read any fic which tried to paint Lupin in a better picture than his canon actions do (so no Wolfstar for me either).

And I don't get the "enemies to lovers" thing either. I admit a certain fondness to a Bellatrix arc where she becomes an anti-hero, but I haven't found any decent fic with such a premise because, apparently unlike the Bellatrix writer circle, I would prefer to avoid the issues of her killing Sirius and torturing Hermione. But the Bellamione fans I talked to all love the tension which comes from that torture, something I really can't understand.
