I stumbled across this gem this morning: The Sea King linkffn(7502511). It's a deadliest catch cross over written from Hermoine's perspective where she finds Harry Crab fishing in Alaska years after disappearing post-DH. It got me thinking of what are other crossover stories with books/comics/tv/movies that one would never usually think of merging with HP.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** Warning for shit

I remember a couple years ago I came across a fic - a Harry Potter / Naruto crossover, later devolving into multiverse stuff. It mostly caught my eye as I was looking for dimensional travel stuff at the time, and it had 400k+ words or something like that. Here is a list of what I can remember about it as I write.

- The Elemental Countries exist in the HP verse, and were hidden until a few years before the start.

- Both Naruto and Harry were female in this, they were twins and born to Minato and Lily (I think)

- One of them was treated like the second coming of god, the other (the protagonist, obviously) was not. I think it was because when Voldemort came to kill them, he got blasted away and everyone thought it was one of them (but it was obviously the protagonist). Strange how tropes can be so similar in two different fandoms.

- The protagonist started pulling new abilities out of her ass, including (but not limited to) sage mode, Rinnegan (which she used instinctively to destroy Voldemort as a baby), Rinne-Sharingan, pacts with Kurama and literally everything you could think of.

- It was a harem fic, with quite graphical sex, though I can only remember Fleur and Luna.

- After a while, it started pulling in weird crossover stuff, like the Diclonii from Elfen Lied, and Elizabeth from Bioshock was apparently Luna's daughter from the future.

- I also remember her moonlighting as an angel/grim reaper figure, vigilanting against the DEs, in one of the greatest displays of Edge I have ever seen, scythe included.

- Also, wand with a dozen woods and half a dozen cores to control her enormous magical power, not that it's needed as she uses wandless, because of course she does.

- Madara had a role in this, though I can't remember how he got there. He was there early and acted as a teacher, but I really couldn't say why.

And I guess that's it, now excuse me while I go try to bleach my brain again.
