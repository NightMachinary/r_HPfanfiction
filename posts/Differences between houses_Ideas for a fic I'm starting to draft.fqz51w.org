I won't explain the context because I think it would give an unnecessary bias, but basically Harry puts the hat in his first year and instead of sorting him it tells the whole school that he needs to spend a year in each house and his sorting will be determined at the end of his fourth year.

​

what do you think will be the differences between the houses, I want out of the box ideas, I know the Gryffindors would be boisterous, Ravenclaw studious, Hufflepuff friendly and Slytherin... Intriguing I suppose? I really don't want to do bashing or be one of those ridiculous fics in which the girls being raped in Slytherin is expected

​

That's the other thing, bashing is for lazy writers so don't suggest it pls


** Ravenclaw- weird/potentially dangerous experiments happening. Maybe they do secret psychological experiments on their classmates? In a creepy, non-invasive way. Starting and publishing a Hogwarts Academic Journal (perhaps co-founded with Slytherin?). Hosts a book club for each year that's open to all houses. They read more than the typical "smart" books because there's always something to learn.

Gryffindor- Organizes intramural sports, whether for just their house or the whole school. Perhaps co-run with Hufflepuff? There's also always a game of Truth or Dare going so it's not unusual to see Gryffindors doing weird things.

Hufflepuff- Throws the best parties. Organizes volunteer work and field trips. Runs a mentorship program in partnership with Slytherin.

Slytherin- Runs the wizarding versions of FBLA and DECA, the Hogwarts secret society was founded by a Slytherin many moons ago. They sponsor career days and internships for older students.

** Ravenclaw is filled with weirdos. I think slytherins are the ones getting the best grades out of the houses on average bc of the ambition thing. Ravenclaws are the type that will stay up all night reading whatever is the wizarding equivalent to weird wikipedia articles and forget to do homework. Also they tend to be kind of not the friendliest? More withdrawn and tend to think they don't need help because I can do the thing myself thank you !! I am learning how to do it!

Gryffindors are very do-now-think-later. Thrill seeking and like physical experiences a lot. Which could be a nice smelling shampoo or getting drunk off your ass. Or sex. Lots of addictive personalities there. The most antagonistic of the four. If they have a problem with anything you said they will speak up and they will do it right now.

Loyalty is often described as a hufflepuff thing but i think slytherins have a lot of it as well. Who's gonna secretly hex your now-ex-boyfriend? A slytherin will. They're ride or die. If you fuck with my friends you fuck with me. Hufflepuffs will try to make friends with everyone, slytherins will join you in your revenge plotting.

Hufflepuffs are push-overs/people pleasers. They'll let people walk over them to avoid conflict.

** I like to think that each house has a different dorm system: Gryffindor groups students by age and gender, so all of the first year boys are together, and so on. Hufflepuff puts all the boys in one huge room and all the girls in another, though beds are assigned by age so that students are still with kids their own age. Ravenclaw just gives every kid their own room, and Slytherin groups kids together in rooms if two or three.

*** LolL great minds think alike, I have pretty much the exact headcanon, in fact, I always imagined Hufflepuff's dormitories like a barracks and Salazar Slytherin saying to his firsties:

"Look at the person you have beside you. You will share a room with him or her for the next seven years, what will you make of them? a friend? an enemy? an ally of circumstances? a follower? the true nature of a human being reveals itself when it believes it's free from scrutiny, you will have the chance to learn about him or her more than anyone else in the school, and the true measure of your humanity will be in what you do with that knowledge"
