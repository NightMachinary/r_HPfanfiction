It was a one or two shot I think. I remember Hermione was struggling after the war and Ron left her. She accidentally starts communicating with a book and sets about reuniting the piece of soul in the book with Snape, without knowing it's Snapes soul

:)


** Is it "All The Wonders That Would Be" by Bedelia? linkffn(7148992). It's a great short story where Hermione receives a strange box that has part of Snape's soul (though she doesn't realize it). She uses it to help win the war, but has to make difficult choices.
