One of my favourite HP fanfics is Too Young To Die, and as flawed as it is part of what I like about it is that Harry has this one thing driving from the very first chapter so everything that happens is a result of his actions - things don't just happen to him, things happen because of him. I find this kind of agency in a protagonist to be really compelling but I don't feel like I come across it that often.

I'm a DLP lurker so I feel I've exhausted a lot of the dark and/or independent Harry stories already and not many of them have this characteristic either.


** Similarly to 'Too Young to Die' linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

*** D'awww. You stole my idea! This was the first fanfic to occur to me when I saw this thread.

Regardless! OP, if you like a gray!Harry, driving ambition, no pairings, engaging plot, and an interesting exploration of transfiguration theory, you'd definitely love that one! (I'll gush about this since recommender didn't haha). It's a seriously great read. Still a work in progress, if you mind that kind of thing, but the author's pretty good about sticking to her weekly update schedule (give or take a few days). When I first came across it, I caught up in one read, because I couldn't get away from it. If you like the premises I mentioned above, you should definitely check it out!

**** This is the one that occurred to me, too. And I love it. But I always feel weird reccing it because this is one of those fics where the character bears almost no relation to cannon Harry.

***** I completely know what you mean. I think he does share traits with him, but for the most part, it's a completely different person.

I must admit though, that things like that never occur to me when I'm recommending a fic. I forget that not everyone reads off-the-wall pairings, fics with completely OOC-characters, and terribly non-compliant in literally but everything but names, fics like I do xD . It's a sickness.

** Linkffn(Emperor by MarquisBlack) is largely driven by Harry's ambition to make a safe place for his family. He's slightly overzealous in the execution, though.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is worthy of magic and who isn't.

** Have you tried [[http://hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]] (also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][on fanfiction.net]])? Harry's driving ambition is /world optimisation/, as in "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimisation."

It's not for everyone, but I strongly recommend taking the author's advice and trying the first 10 chapters to see if you like it.
