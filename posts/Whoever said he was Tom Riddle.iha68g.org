Are there any fics that cast doubt on whether Voldemort is Tom Riddle, or if Tom was someone else entirely?

I'm not looking for fics that outright state Tom isn't Voldemort (i.e. Dumbledore is Voldemort); but ones that use unreliable narrator/characters to create doubt about his identity, Keyser Soze style.
