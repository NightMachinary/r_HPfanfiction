I was reading a tvtropes page with HP ff author recommendations earlier, which led to checking LotW's ff page out of nostalgia. Which led to a sense of frustration that she hasn't posted anything since. A few minutes later I reached Lomona's entry and it suddenly /clicked/ in my mind. Lightning hadn't stopped posting, she simply switched accounts.

Clues I thought of after at least 10 minutes of research:

- Mastery of latin, showcased by both. They really pull amazing incantations out of their ass (makes sense as LotW has a Phd in the classics)

- Focus on some characters: both have a tendency to focus on (what I presume are) their favorite characters, i.e Draco, Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Voldemort/Tom Riddle, random Slytherins. Likewise less liked characters rarely play a part in the story, don't feature at all or are outright bashed (Ron, Hermione, other Weasleys, Potters, Remus, Sirius)

- An ability to create rich and believable OCs.

- Worldbuilding. Awesome in both cases.

- Characterization: This really was the biggest similarity. The biggest weakness for both authors - although the writing quality somewhat compensates - but, there are a ton of characters that are presented as extremely simplistic, unvaried or even autistic in some cases (if not autistic, definitely on the spectrum).

- A trope they both share is Harry stealing allies from Voldemort.

- The writing style is really very similar. The turns of phrase, the sentence structure. What I call LotW's signature "solemn, dramatic tone" definitely appears in many of Lomona's fics.

- Vengeance/justice scenes. For me, the most alluring part of either author's stories - tbh it was rather like what I imagine taking crack would feel. LotW's scene where Harry is betrayed by Lily and he proceeds to turn her into a muggle is still burned into my mind. Likewise Lomona's stories feature many such scenes, not the least of which is Harry dispassionately removing Snape's eye when he tries to curse him, in /The Art of Self-Fashioning/.

- Someone who posted three million words of fiction in two years is just unlikely to stop posting all together. In fact Lomona has authored no less than 598(!) stories, a quarter of each are over 30k words, which seems to be a continuation of the "5k chapter a day" theme from the Sacrifices arc days. If anything, she's become a /more/ prolific writer.

- LotW's last chapter was posted on January 2007. Lomona's first chapter was posted on May 2007.

Thoughts?

** It's possible, I suppose, but I doubt it. While there are certain superficial similarities and a coincidence of timing, the overwhelming impression of their writing is fundamentally different, I think.

LOTW is far more verbose and her sense of pacing is far slower, with repeated extended sequences of armchair psychoanalysis and introspection. Lomonaaeren has plenty of angst, but LOTW takes it to another level. She is to angst as LessWrong is to authorial tracts.

Her prose is also substantially more melodramatic/attempting to be literary in tone, whereas Lomonaaeren's writing is much closer to the matter-of-fact simplicity of Rowling's style.

I think what you have cottoned onto with the superficial similarities is in fact just the fact that there's a certain "slash style" which is prominent within that community (but certainly not universal). The style is sufficiently distinct that you can read one of Lomonaaeren's Gen works and instantly know that she's a slash writer just from the writing style.

That style is typified by the following characteristics:

- Describes male characters using adjectives more commonly associated with women, especially the protagonist.

- Describes male characters interacting in a way which is more touchy-feely (in the physical sense) and open (in the emotional sense) than is common in real life male interaction.

- Heavily relies on the "strong on the outside, but emotionally stunted and psychologically fragile" archetype for the protagonist - the Cloud Strife model, wallowing in his anguish until he is rescued through the emotional support and/or penis of his OTP.

- Angst and psychoanalysis. Lots of it.

- Uses mental illness and trauma as a replacement for giving characters personalities.

I do agree with these points. However the difference in styles could be explained in a few different ways; evolution, for one. Simplifying is actually a difficult process, more so while maintaining quality of writing. For another, I wonder if you're basing your opinion about Lightning solely on /The Sacrifices Arc/. That saga had a certain /tone/, from beginning to end and I believe was over-dramatized intentionally. Lightning's original fiction, which can be found [[http://ffstories.net/lightning/original.php][here]] is lot less angsty and a lot more matter of fact.

That may well be true, but, as I generally rarely read slash stories, apart from a handful of authors, I can't confirm or deny it. A more prolific slash reader could probably comment on this.

Cheap drama and unrelatable actions because the author is unwilling or unable to write proper conflict/plot. Especially since angst is often based on interpersonal problems rather than the actual threat, magical Hitler in the HP world

Wannabe therapists remote diagnosing a fictional character. Might as well write a hospital drama based on Hasbro's "Operation" game.

While a little short of Lord Potter harems, it still sounds like the recipe for a disaster.

*** Saving Connor: linkffn(2580283)

It's a /very/ long series. In particular I don't think that scene is until the 3rd book Comes Out of Darnkess Morn.

It is very good. Can meander a bit though and is quite heavy on the angst.

** this is really interesting!! i often wonder about the two; how do/did they have so much time? so much words, god. i find that the pacing of the two seems to be similar, too. as well as the way that they depict relationships; i think that the specific characterisation of snape, draco and dumbledore is not particularly common (esp when most of these fics are just adolescent drarry fans) and both fics potray them similarly . ive always associated the sacrifices arc with lomonaaaren because they seem to have, at the very least, the same superficial tone and themes. but idk. if you ask them on ffnet and they reply, please pm me or make another post!!

** I went on a deep dive into LoTW after she stopped writing and tried to figure out who she was and if she had ever published traditional fiction. One of her alt accounts (she also wrote under the name Limayaael and other weird fantasy-sounding names) had her birthday (month and day) listed in the profile. It happened to match the birthday that Lomonaaren lists in her DW profile. That, coupled with the writing style, the timing of the account creation, and a few other coincidences, has convinced me that they are definitely the same person. It's nice because I don't have to wonder if Lightning died or something. I do still wonder why she doesn't acknowledge her work as Lightning or ever respond to any questions/comments on that fic.

I discovered this only after making my original post, but there was some nastiness way back in 2007. Apparently Lightning had some rabid fans (she just draws the kind) and they discovered her RL facebook page... and yeah, that went about as well as you'd think. She was harassed constantly. I think that incident taught her to fully separate her various online accounts and leave no clues to her identity.

So long as she doesn't confirm, there is a degree of safety.

I'm curious where you heard this from. I'm not saying I disbelieve it, but I've read through so many of her old journal accounts and never seen it mentioned.

I'm in a Facebook group for fans of the Sacrifices arc and one of the members claimed to know Lightning personally. He asked her if she was interested in speaking with fans, and said she declined politely but that she was happy people were still enjoying her work. That was a few years ago and I don't remember the exact situation, but I remember I found him pretty credible.
