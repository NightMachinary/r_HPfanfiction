#+TITLE: Looking for a post-war fic where the characters basically just sit in a pub and talk, featuring eventual Gryffindor/Slytherin friendships and minor Drarry, pretty sure it was on Ao3.

:END:
The description of the fic is something like, “Harry and Draco sit in a pub and talk. Ron and Pansy sit in a pub and talk.” Et cetera, with several other pairs/groups of characters listed in the description.

I'm pretty sure I read it on Ao3 but I can't for the life of me find it or remember the title. It is Drarry, but that's not the focus.

Thank you in advance!!
