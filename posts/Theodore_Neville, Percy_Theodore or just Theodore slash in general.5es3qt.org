** Okay here we go!

My absolutely favourite Draco/Hermione/Theo is also by Colubrina! The relationship is incredibly well developed and there's a focus on Draco/Theo's relationship as well. It's kind if a two part story - the first half is just setting up the Dramione side, that's linkffn(The Die by Colubrina). Then after a certain point she splits and write an alternate ending where Theo comes in, that's linkffn(After the Sea by Colubrina). You don't have to read the first one, but since you're reading Rebuilding you probably like Dramione, and it's one of my all time favourite fics, so take that as you will.

If you don't mind modern AUs, I adore provocative-envy - I loved linkffn(11257023).

I will also say you'll probably have a much better chance of finding Theo in slash on tumblr. Slytherdor et might be a good place to start as a place to find fics. I will say I'm pretty heavily in the rare pair "community" and from my view nearly no one writes about Theo, which is actually a real damn shame. (We got LOTS with Marcus Flint if you're into that!)

Another wonderful Dramione called A Cruel and Beautiful World featured Theo/OC slash, but she took it down and turned it into a real book. You can probably find a download if you look around.

Good luck! Let me know if you find anything good!

** Theo is so rarely in the books that he is more or less an OC. I haven't read Rebuilding so idk what her Theo is like to rec something similar. But there is a Theo/Draco relationship in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/997915][The Greyest Eyes]]. That's the authors first fic though and it really does show.

Also there's a really sweet Blaise/Neville in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2088468][For the Sake of Grades]]. Linkao3(2088468; 997915)

  Draco Malfoy didn't find it difficult to serve Voldemort. He found it impossible. Which is why, upon being ordered to kill Dumbledore, he defected to the side of good and sent his own father to prison. Students on both sides of the conflict have problems with him, and he finds himself beset on all sides by hatred and distrust.Harry doesn't know how to feel about any of it, but someone's going to have to take Malfoy's side in all this.
