Why are request and what's that fics getting downvoted. I have had several of my post downvoted with no comments I also have seen Remind me coments downvoted (bots and all) but why what's the point of downloading. If you dont know any story's or dont like the paring dont downvote, upvote so those who do can see and find the stories there looking for. It's not like we will get famous because of upvotes or downvotes it just let's otheres see the post more.


** A lot of people use downvoting like a dislike button, so I'd imagine a majority of those downvotes are because they dislike whatever those request or what's that fic posts are asking for. Some people might also be downvoting because they disagree with a point the poster is making alongside their request too. In both cases, they exactly want less people to see the post (themselves included) because they don't want things they dislike on the subreddit or don't wanna have to see more of that thing themselves. Doesn't make much sense to me, but I always sort by new, so it doesn't actually make a difference to me how downvoted a thing is.

Remind me Bot comments are somewhat hated in this sub - I've seen at least a half-dozen posts/mentions (probs more) in my 11 months here talking about how much people don't like them and how having multiple remind-me comments on the same post is disappointing for the poster and annoying for people looking for comment content, etc. Also, if the remind-me posts are downvoted and people are sorting comments by karma, then they get tucked off at the bottom while all the actual comments with answers and content are at the top. So, some people are probably following that unspoken tradition too.

*** That's kind of my approach. This is mostly though because I still don't understand the karma system or the whole downvote thing. As I write this, I have 402 karma - no idea if that's good or not, or what I can do with it.

** Contrary to what Reddiquette says downvotes are and /emphatically are not/ for, a lot of people simply use them as an "I dislike this" button - and on this subreddit, there's a lot of negativity around certain tropes and ships that will almost always get downvoted as a request.

RemindMeBot comments are downvoted pretty much to get them out of the way, because they don't really add to the topic at hand (which /is/ the correct use according to Reddiquette). By default, Reddit weighs comments by karma - so downvoted comments go at the bottom. Reminder-bot comments also got /really/ spammy at some point, with a lot of posts getting like 15 reminder-bot comments (all for the same span of time between post and reminder) and zero actual responses.

** Well imo there is only one real use for them, when someone makes an inappropriate comment or a simple hate comment. It gets them out of the way so other comments are focused on.

There's also the simple fact that it is easy to hit the downvote button accidentally instead of the upvote button. I've done it myself and when you don't pay attention and move on it leaves things downvoted instead. /shrugs/

Edit: they should have a check mode, where it asks ‚Äúare you sure you want to downvote‚Äù so it's not so easy to do. üòÖ

** There are certain stories (well at least one popular story) that get downvoted whenever they are mentioned in any context. Some people are just enraged that a story they dislike can be popular. Downvoting is apparently therapeutic for them. Actual professional help would probably be better though.

*** And lol, the above got downvoted without my even mentioning the story I had in mind. You people. It's the most popular HP story on ff.net, but you know, if you don't llike a story, don't read it. There is no need to gnash and wail over it. That used to bug me, but now it just makes me laugh. I pity the fool who can't just move on after noping out of a story.

*** Oh dont I know it I once recamended harry crow to someone because they brought up the sword of gryffindor falling on Harry's head dering sorting and it got to -10 before going up to 13 upvotes. Then when I asked why no one would give me a straight answer.

** I'll downvote such threads if they fail at Rule 7 and/or if their title is just some variation on "Looking for fics" or "Help me find this fic".

*** u/SpiritRiddle:
#+begin_quote
  "Looking for fics" or "Help me find this fic".
#+end_quote

Why though if you click the post it usually tells you more about the fic. Sometimes you just dont know wat to put as the title of the post so you just ask for help

**** While I've heard that flairs are optional on mobile, I scroll through and see what amounts to the flair and title on a post saying the exact same thing. It's not that hard to put "LF a particular H/L fic" or whatever instead of just "LF a fic" - it's not a /lot/ more information than the flair, but it's at least something - then put the details in the body of the post.

Personally, I don't generally even bother looking at the body of a Request/WTF post unless something in the title makes me go "oh, I might be able to answer that question".

** Like the others say it's probably mostly to do with disliking a pairing or request. Personally, I try not to, but I /will/ downvote if someone requests an adult/minor pairing, especially if it suggests smuttiness.
