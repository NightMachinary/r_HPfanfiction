I've heard that in the original books, some people were unhappy with how the Hallows just sort of appeared at the end. The cloak had been in the story since the beginning, but other than a throwaway line by Ron about how most invisibility cloaks lost their charm, and that Harry's cloak was the outlier in that regard, it's never really discussed until the Tale of the Three Brothers in the final book, when we're finally told about these incredibly important magical artifacts.

So, I wondered whether anyone has ever written a story where the legend of the Hallows took precedence from the beginning. Not necessarily the whole plot - I like Voldemort's horcruxes just fine - but one where there's tell of a stone that can bring people back from the dead. Where the longevity of Harry's cloak's "charm" is more noteworthy, and where every student in the school - everyone in the wizarding world - knows that the wand Dumbledore wields isn't the one that chose him as a boy. That it's special, powerful, proof that Dumbledore himself is the most powerful wizard in the world.

Is there anything like that about?


** Pretty sure Hallowed is exactly what you're looking for. One of Voldemort's main goals is uniting the Hallows, which is one of the reasons he targets the Potters and clashes with Dumbledore.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome seems to be heading in that direction. It's pretty heavily AU though, so if that's not your thing give it a pass.
