are there any fics that make Harry a badass in the style of badass anime kid rather than Harry Dresden. We mean really, Adam Jensen mixed with Anakin Skywalker is *a* style but when Harry is younger than 13 wouldn't it make more sense to go the way of Negi Springfield or Illyasveil Von Einzbern, or hell even freaking Killua who is like what? 11?

Well, whatever, the point is are there any fics that make Harry badass as a kid without going the route of Mr."I never wanted this".


** You might enjoy linkffn(7161848)

Edit: that's what happens when the fic title is a number... Anyway, Harry is a bit older than you wanted, but I suspect you might get a kick out of this anyway.

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.
