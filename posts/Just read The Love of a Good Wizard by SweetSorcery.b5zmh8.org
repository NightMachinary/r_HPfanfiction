Goddamn! This fic...was just wow. Just so fucking good. I loved the way the author wrote Tom and Pansy. I just fell in love with them. The characterizations were absolutely amazing. And Thoth was just like the best snake ever, oh my god. And I loved Pansy's and Minerva's relationship, they were so freaking cute. This is definitely one of the best fics I've read. I highly recommend it.


** 200% agreed! Rereading it after a few years and remembering now why i bookmarked it in the first place! Never thought I'd like this pairing but it works so well! On the hunt to find similar ones now.
