Basilisk-born

By: Ebenbild

Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

Rated: Fiction T - English - Mystery/Adventure - Harry P., Salazar S. - Chapters: 69 - Words: 591,518 - Reviews: 6,083 - Favs: 8,811 - Follows: 10,140 - Updated: Feb 12 - Published: Sep 23, 2014 - id: 10709411


** I do wish Ebenbild would be a little clearer about what is happening when where and to who. I'm currently reading Family Secrets, I'm on chapter 10.

I think -

Petunia, Snape, Sirius and Regulus are "siblings". Snape and Sirius are twins, metamorphagus and pretend not to be. Snape and Sirius take turns teaching as Snape, and it is Sirius that wants to teach defence.

​

My head hurts.

Edit - I mention this because some of the back and forth time skips, and Harry being under a new name had a similar effect.

**** This is how he structures his time travel fic, baring in mind that Harry is not jumping back and forth, he lives through 3000 years in the order they happen chronologically.

Chapter, year, main characters

One, 1812 Bob Smith

Two, 1814 Tom Johnson and Charles Johnson (Tom = Father, Charles = Son)

Three, 1828 Walter Smith and Tom Johnson

Four, 1798 James Jones

Five, Bob Smith and Charles Johnson (Is Walter Smith also Charles Johnson?)

Six, 1760 William Brown

Seven, 1790 James Jones, Bob Smith and William Brown.

Eight, 1795 Tom Johnson and William Brown

Nine, 1915 Walter Smith, oh by the way Walter is Bob's dad.

Ten, 1980 James Jones. Walter is also James Jones.

Eleven, 1762 Mike Brown (Definately also Walter) (Son of William) (Somehow)

That information being withheld did not add to anything. It just left us confused about how this person was connected to the plot. A simple (Harry) when he shows up under a new name would have helped. If it was a film/tv show, we would realise it was the same actor.

** Can someone give a good summary?(no problem if spoilers are included)

I've tried to read through it a few times, but I can't get past the first chapters.

*** A good comparison is the Assassin's Creed series. All of history, everything important was Assassin's V Templar's, somehow history didn't notice. All of history was Harry, and somehow nobody noticed. There is no way to summarise it without sounding like it's as simple and coherent as getting hit over the head with a sack of bricks and then learning rocket science, but it is told well, and it works. It allows Harry to have a massive impact on the past, without having any impact on HIS past.

​

Harry gets sent back in time, and will not age until he returns to the present. He has to spend 3000 years as a teenager. He fake ages himself with magic to live a full lifetime as a short person several times, and gets adopted by a bunch of people so he has about 10 surnames. The whole saga is told out of order, (all caught up to the present now) and is of him living that 3000 years without changing the past. This is despite him litterally being Salazar Slytherin. Many things get taken out of context, which is why he can have a reputation as a dark wizard. For example being Pure blooded is about having magical creature parents/ grandparents. (Every now and then things like Phoenixes and Basilisks take a human form, and have wizard kids.) They stopped doing that about 1000 years ago, and the term changed to "non muggle" ancestry. Because he is a teenager, he is not at full power, so has to learn to be very efficient in his use of magic.

*** basiclly during the 5th year dementer attack harry gets sent back in time to merlin or myrddin's time he gets adopter by myrddin and becomes temporarily immortal because of the time travel there's some stuff about where magic come from basically harry makes his way through time and gets adopted by various people he eventually becomes salazar slytherin and helps found hogwarts eventually he gets back to his own time and starts dealing with voldemort something you should know about the story is that it bounces back and forwards between present (harrry's origional time) and the past

** Agreed. Put off reading it for a long time. But once I started, it was a very gripping story. Only problem is the frequent shift between the two time lines. It always left me disappointed to see the story shift between the two, but then again I'd get into the shift and it changes again leaving me pulling out my hair in frustration.
