** linkffn(12352826) - Demonic Intervention by bennybear

It is not exactly what you asked for, but it does involve the Goblet of Fire and messing around with the names of the candidates put into the goblet. Very funny, highly recommend.

  AU, taking place during GoF. How Harry fulfilled the prophecy without ever learning about it: He is given a weapon and gets creative with it. The Dark Lord doesn't know, and never will.

** The Goblet of Fire is an ancient device. Originally it was named "The Chalice of Judgement", and had been enchanted by a roman sorcerer to choose the most pleasing candidates for gladiator matches. The gladiators would carve a small statuette that symbolized them, and submit it to the Goblet. It would then choose the three strongest to fight to the death.

When it was lost during the sacking of Rome and eventually "rediscovered" by the british monarchy, the Triwizard Tournament was born. The enchantment was refactored to give three trials instead of combat, but the submission mechanism stayed the same.

What was written on the slip of paper was ultimately meaningless. The gladiators would submit their totem, which would then fall into the hands of the emperor's aides to proclaim their being chosen - and then they would fight. To prevent any cowardice, a countermeasure was implemented.

This countermeasure was keenly felt about 2000 years later.

When the first task was done and the people had withdrawn back into the great hall for a feast, the Goblet lit once more, its flame whipping high into the illusory sky, then turning pitch-black.

*"IMBELLIS!"* came a thundering bellow from the goblet, and its dark flame whipped toward the one who had been chosen, but not participated.

The entire school could only watch in horror as Professor Moody was burned to cinders right in front of their eyes.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr
