A few restrictions on the stories I would like to read

1) Non combined worlds, I want to read Wizard Harry figuring out his way through the Pokémon world

2) Het, I only read Het and to many times I start reading a story in the Pokémon/Harry Potter section to find out 6 chapters in Harry is so into Falkern's eyes are perfect and his hair is so soft. And I just wanted him to act a Mareep and maybe flirt with a Nurse Joy

3) Him actually being a trainer or researcher or something other than a guy on the sideline.


** I can't remember the name of the one I read, it wasn't bad but everything was too easy for harry. He was MOD Harry, child body. Starts in kanto with hedwig as a togepi egg and he befriends a shiny charmander I think, gets lots of pokemon and wins *spoiler* place in the kanto league. Repeat for the next regions except he wins every single time.

At some point he builds an island with *spoiler*,gets rich, gets tons of mega stones using point me spell, gets several legendary pkmn and pretty much mega evolves every one.

Really fast paced story. Completed too if I remember correctly.
