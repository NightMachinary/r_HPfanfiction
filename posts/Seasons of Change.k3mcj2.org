I've been reading this for the past week. I like how it subtly changes canon by having Harry form a stronger relationship with Dudley, while showing how the main plot would differ if Harry, Ron and Hermione were a bit smarter, had more resources, and were more trusting of their professors (very noticeable with Snape, and McGonagall).

  It's just before Christmas in Harry's first year. Giving presents does not come naturally to a boy who has never received any. But sometimes, it only takes voicing a random thought to bring changes to one's life.This story is also posted on FanFiction.

  With Dudley doing his best to help him in secret, Harry's summer break is surprisingly tolerable. Especially with the new friend he has made in the overgrown mutt living in the playground. If only his friends would write to him. Soon, Dobby's warning is promising another adventurous year, one which will test Harry's ability to inspire loyalty in those around him.

  Harry is doing his best to enjoy his summer holidays with Dudley, despite his aunt and uncle's best efforts. He, Ron and Hermione, are about to start their third year at Hogwarts, with new subjects and a new defence against the dark arts teacher -- and an old friend of Harry's father and godfather. But there is all that mess to sort out with Pettigrew on the loose and Harry's godfather being searched for by the aurors. When Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense. The dementors are guarding the school, his movements are supposed to be closely monitored, and the focus of the aurors' search is still on Sirius. Perhaps Harry could point them in the right direction...This story is also posted on FanFiction.

** I know it has been a while but I am also searching for similar stories after reading Seasons of Change, and I can recommend In the Name of the Brave, it has not updated in two years, but whats there is well worth the read.
