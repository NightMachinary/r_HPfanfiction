A while ago I started reading a fic about the tipical Hermione time-travel story, and I only read part of the first chapter, BUT, when she arrives at the new era, she sees Moody (he wasn't Mad -Eye yet) at the Leaky Cauldron and I remember that ser thinks “He could help me” or something along those lines. Sorry about the little information, but I can't remember anymore.


** It's not this one, is it? This is the only Hermione/Mad Eye story I know but she does time travel in it linkffn(4200186)

  Very few knew why Alastor Moody was so adamant on constant vigilance. It was a sorrowful lesson learned.
