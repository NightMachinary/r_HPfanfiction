I've been bingeing these for a few weeks (my favourites featuring Loki) and I'd like to read some more. Anyone got any favourites I could check out?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Enigmaris/pseuds/Enigmaris][Enigmaris]] has a couple, one completed and one still a WIP. The completed one, called something like "of punching gods and absentee fathers" is where Harry is Loki's son. The WIP is "Holly Potter and the midlife crisis" and is post Hogwarts with a FemHarry.

Linkffn(child of the storm) is one where Harry is Thor's son. Huge crossover with a bunch of fandoms. There's a WIP sequel as well.

Those are the ones off the top of my head that feature Loki in a significant way but I know of many more crossovers of you'd like more.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11146299/1/][Destiny Delayed]] When Harry faces the newly reborn Voldemort in the graveyard, something goes wrong the instant their spells connect and both of them are transported to another world where witches and wizards don't exist.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1300453/chapters/2700007][Son of the champion]] Fury needs Coulson to do one quick side trip while passing through England, just a check in on a person of interest to S.H.I.E.L.D. unfinished. Ao3.

Running from the sinister world that is Wizarding England, Lily Potter nee Evans has only one person she can trust to protect her son: His father.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23950192#bookmark-form][The Last Seidir]] Doctor! It's spiking again.” To which, the Cube sparked one more --a much larger spike to the previous. “What's that?” Before Fury could so much as tense, eye on the Cube, it sparked again --for the ground and walls to visibly shake. It continued to spark some more, bigger each time - to which a beam of energy was suddenly brought forth and -an explosion... Once visual on the platform returned, it was only for Fury to tense further. Confusion and concern ran through him as he took in the several unknowns now of the platform, each more confusing than the last. In the centre was a dark haired kid - ten or eleven if Fury had to guess - complete with a bloodied sword in his hand. Yet, they were not the oddest thing. That was reserved to the brightest tropical bird he had ever seen, complete with a wide colourful wing span and a long back tail rivalling that of a peacock's, which flew in suspension above the boy. Unfinished. Ao3.

Adult Harry:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136?view_full_work=true][Of Wizards and Heros]] Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles... Complete. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8216900/1/Legal-Alien][Legal Alien by Whispering Darkness]] Normal people didn't have to worry about this sort of thing when they go on vacation. They worry about things like losing their luggage, catching a cab or something similar. Not alien invasions. Harry, however, had never been normal. Then again, neither were these guys. One-shot. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12164536/1/][Loki and the Kleptomaniac]] Loki tries to summon Death to deal with his enemies. It doesn't work out quite like he planned. complete FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/][I see the moon]] Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers. WIP. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/][Heroes Assemble by Stargon1]] After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11799474?view_full_work=true#main][The blood on my hands, it scares me to death]] The fight against Voldemort went on for years. In the final confrontation, Harry found himself not at King's Cross, but in a whole different world - one without wizards, and without magic. He flew under the radar for two years, but when the Chitauri invaded Harry couldn't help but act. His attempt to protect civilians caught the attention of SHIELD. After meeting the Avengers, Harry quickly finds himself entangled in far more than he bargained for. All he wanted was a safe place to stay off the streets during the winter. When Fenrir comes to Midgard and Loki escapes his prison, things get far more complicated than anyone expected. Complete AO3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11426651/1/A-Child-Avenged][A Child avenged]] Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them. Oneshot FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8643484/1/All-Hallows-Eve-New-York][All Hallows Eve, New York]] Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit. Oneshot. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141722/chapters/2310089][Safeguard by Esama]] The Chitauri invasion launches a whole new age - for everyone. Unfinished. Ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1539560/chapters/3259514][Betreyal]] Harry Potter experiences betrayal of the worst sort. The Ministry of Magic drugs him then hands him over to a muggle terrorist organization and bids him goodbye. unfinished.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14379909?view_full_work=true#main][Burning bright]] Harry never wanted to be special, to be a freak, but when he awakens in the body of an infant phoenix, 16 years after being pronounced dead, he finds that he's even more different than ever. Unwilling to face the backlash that his resurrection would cause, he flees the wizarding world, only to come across some of the most unique individuals the world has ever seen. Maybe, just maybe, there's a place for Harry amongst the Avengers, and perhaps he can prove it by helping them defeat a villain hell-bent on consuming their very souls... unfinished. Ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4159950?view_full_work=true][Making our own path]] Tired of fighting, Harry decides to become a doctor so he can help people and save lives. After he decides to see the world, Harry joins Doctors Without Borders and eventually end ups in India. While there, he meets fellow Doctor Bruce Banner and gets pulled in to a relationship and so much more. The two of them end up fighting fate and alien invaders while trying to figure out what they mean to each other. unfinished. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11235039/9/][Turned around in time]] Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change time. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC unfinished. FFNet.

That's all folks

*** Is it really, tho? My gary-stu-o-meter almost exploded while I was reading first chapters. It's decently written, but Potter here is so overpowered that I feel it's going to get very irritating and boring pretty fast.

Please tell me there is well written intelligent Loki with greater power or at least that Potter is the weakest Sourcerer in this universe or otherwise I think I'll leave it be and move along.

**** Harry is absolutely overpowered, but still have flaws. He is the idea-guy and the prime mover for changing the course of the marvel universe. Loki starts out as an asshole, kinda like in the movies. But it changes later, prank wars anyone? He certainly have a central spot, but he is far from a main character. Sorry.

But everyone still own their speciality... stark run circles around Harry when concerning inventions, banner know chemistry and take that to a whole new level, dr. Strange... Spider-Man... Collected guardians of the galaxy ... black widow... hulk...nick fury... wolverine... death pool ...... everyone benefits and just get better because of Harry Potter.

  He's been broken by the war, by the deaths he's seen and by the things he's done. But when he wakes up in the Marvel Universe, Harry Potter wonders if it's life's way of giving him a second chance. This will be about a man, tested by the sands of time becoming who he was meant to be. Some say it's luck, some don't know and even if he refuses to admit it, he knows it's his destiny.
