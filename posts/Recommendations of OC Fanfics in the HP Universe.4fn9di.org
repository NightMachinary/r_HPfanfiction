I just finished reading the published parts about Alexandra Quick series, and I find myself craving for other fanfics in the HP universe but with OC, including but not limited to new characters in new countries with new cultures.

I'm not looking for some extravagant Naruto/HP/Friends crossover with 10 dimensions, just a compelling story with the above criterias. Or something else entirely that doesn't involve the same ol' characters and plot-settings.

Recommendations?


** Not perfect, but a ton of content. 5 main works, and a bunch of spinoffs and AUs of the main 'Dangerverse'

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.
