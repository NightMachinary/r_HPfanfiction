I know canon stations can quickly make a story repetitive and boring, but I've got a question. How much would it put y'all off if the Hogwarts Acceptance letter was included in a fic? I'm writing three different POVs for the acceptance, and I obviously wouldn't include it for all three, but I thought it would make sense to maybe include it in the first one (Hermione). I've got a scene where the book list is (kinda) a plot point, and I was thinking it might be better to include it just as a reference point.

Would it be worth it or should I just not include it? Thanks in advance!


** I think the presence of the letter, or not, in a fic depends about what character receive it. People a reading a fanfiction, they know HP and the letter, so only how the character would react matter.

For a "wizard raised" child, like Ron, Draco or even Harry in a "the Potters survive" scenario, I don't think it should be shown. The owl arrives, and once the child see the letter, it's over, everyone already knows what it is about.

Yet, for a Muggleraised child (like Hermione), I think the scene become a lot more important, and should be shown. The child can wonder if it's a prank or not, can try to analyze the wording (considering Hermione character, just Dumbledore titles should make her crazy), or just show it to the parents.

So yes, if one of the character is Hermione, I think you should include it (and if the other character have different uprisings, it can be a good way to show the differents reactions of the parents).

This. The letter itself is just repeating canon. But how do your characters feel about it? How do they react to the revelation of magic, to the bizarre shopping list, to the fact that someone thought the letter would be sufficient to tell a muggle-born witch or wizard everything they need to know? Do they laugh? Gape? Are they afraid? Excited? Skeptical? The people are what give life to the events.
