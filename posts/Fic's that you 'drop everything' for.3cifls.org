Essentially fic's that when they update, even if you are enjoying what you are doing right then you stop to go read you have waited for that update. Due to it either being that good, or updates so infrequent that you feel if you don't read it then it will disappear.

linkffn(5318075)

I actually go through the first two fics in this trilogy once a year or so, so if the third book ever received another chapter I would be on that like fleas on my dog every summer.

  Last fic in the trilogy! Demons invaded Earth intent on enslaving all magical life. But they miscalculated...the Earthling's magic is stronger than they suspected, and far more dangerous. Now the survivors regroup in the new magical world, to fight back.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** For me that would be a series by Nightfall Rising / Potionpen called [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][The Truth is What I See It Is (subjectiverse)]]. The latest story in the series is Valley of the Shadow, but you really want to start with Album of the SangReal.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is way more true than that. Lily Evans doesn't know she looks different depending where you're standing, the Blacks know exactly how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't exactly who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.

  *Canon Compliance*

  It is advised that the reader be familiar with the biography of Harry Potter written by Ms. Rowling. The reader should be aware that this seven-volume series was fact-checked by Ms. Skeeter rather than Miss Granger, and cannot be relied on in the matter of dates. Furthermore, Ms. Rowling's books are written from the point of view of the subject, and not only contain a distinctly pro-Gryffindor bias but largely confine themselves to what Mr. Potter saw, heard, assumed, and speculated.

  This is a Slytherin story, and truth is subjective.
