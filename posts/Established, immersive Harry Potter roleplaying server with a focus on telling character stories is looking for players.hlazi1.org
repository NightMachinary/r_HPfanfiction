Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting for hours for a reply to your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play Quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][wikia]]!

** *What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: whats-unique-and-awesome-about-model-hogwarts
   :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to choose how many classes you want to take, as all classes are optional! Do you want to be like Hermione Granger and go to all the classes? You can! But if you'd rather roleplay your character going through a frightening adventure then you need not fear, as class obligations will not get in the way!

2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, Quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.

3) We're still pretty new. This is about Model Hogwarts' eighth month! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. Want to be a Prefect? Want to start a gobstones club, or a writing club, or even a flesh-eating slugs fan club? Hey, we won't judge! Model Hogwarts is ripe with opportunities but still is developed enough to give you the structure to succeed. Want to develop a new system of magic or discover a secret room? Hey, we're game!

4) We have a number of custom bots made specifically for our server! Want to cast spells, practice them and know if they succeed? Want to train your characters stats? Want to practice reading tea leaves or tarot cards? Want to add to your character's chocolate frog collection? You can do all of the above using bots made specifically for Model Hogwarts!

5) We're welcoming to both new and experienced RPers. If you're new to RP it's okay! Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics][detailed RP guide]] to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you're new to RP and shy, you'll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!

6) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

7) I am happy to confirm the server is a success! We currently have about 200 extremely active players! During the first year, a dangerous ghost by the name of Cyrus haunted the castle, and it was up to students to solve the mystery! In the second year, the Head Boy was murdered and students and teachers alike found themselves embroiled in a complex conspiracy involving dark magics and terrible manipulations that culminated in the resurrection of the ancient murder Elizabeth Báthory, leaving the student body reeling and schisms forming due to the choices made by certain students. In the third year a mysterious cloaked figure left behind magical artifacts in various dorms that turned awry, harming their users more than helping; by the end of the year, they discovered that the cloaked figure did not wish to do them harm, but was merely a misinformed parent trying to help out. What will happen in next year's plot? No-one knows! Classes are going strong, and you can join whenever you like! In Transfiguration, for example, they're discussing the theory and origins of magic, and in Defense Against the Dark Arts they're learning about magical creatures and classifications. Drama is always present, and whether you're a muggleborn or a pureblood supremacist, Mexican or a British nationalist, shy and reserved or the class clown, Model Hogwarts has a group of friends just waiting for you.

*** *How to start:*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-start
    :END:
1) [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM][*Join the Discord!*]] This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You'll get two weeks of ‘Hogwarts Summer Camp' where you can informally meet your peers in your year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.

2) [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][Check out our wikia]] for more information about our classes, professors, and some existing characters!

3)[[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/The_Student_Handbook][Read our student handbook!]] In here you can find info, our code of conduct, and FAQs. Don't worry, if you have a question that isn't answered here, we'd be happy to answer it as well!

4) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop-in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they're totally optional if you're more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes (but we have a variety of electives when you advance in years too!):

Charms Defense Against the Dark Arts Divination Herbology History of Magic Path to Success in the Wizarding World Potions Transfiguration

5) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We'd be happy to answer them! We can't wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!
