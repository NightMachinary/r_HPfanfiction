I have recently read Harry Potter and the Disorder of the Phoenix and loved it. Does anyone know any other fic where harry ends up back when he was at hogwarts but keeps the age he has grown to rather than just getting younger again.


** There was one fic, totally crack/humor, where adult Harry is an Unspeakable, mucks up an experiment, and ends up in 1994 as an adult. Unfortunately I can't remember its name for the life of me.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

*** about this one; Due to the line /"Due to circumstances beyond his control, time throws in a twist."/ in the description I've never read it.

--------------

I hate it when a redo fic goes all "SURPRISE!, this is AU and everything you tried to do fails!"... I can accept it if the fic is about the MC noticing that it's *slight*AU very early on, then having the story be about MC working around that.

An example of what I would be ok with; "fuck!, McGonagall came to deliver the letter rather than Hagrid... does this mean Dumbledore hasn't hidden the Stone for me to find?, now I got to check if Voldy created Horcruxes and if they are hidden in the same places..."

while I wouldn't be happy with "Sorry Harry, in this Universe I feel when you destroy my Horcruxes... now I've moved the others and you are fucked!" nor with "Sorry in this universe Snape actually was on Voldy's side, you assumed he wasn't and now everything goes down the shitter."

--------------

so, could somebody spoil me on the twist that gets thrown in... and what effect it has.

**** Nothing like what your thinking about, the twist is just that there are two characters going back, the first chapter is about the non-Harry character so just read it. It's very sweet.
