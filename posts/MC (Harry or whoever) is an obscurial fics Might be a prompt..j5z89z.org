After watching those Magical Creatures movies, I thought that surely Harry would become an obscurial after the Dursleys and their hate of magic. But I don't like the movies, so I don't want to look for the development of that concept in their part of the fandom, I'm interested if it's been applied to classic HP fanfiction.

I'm not really interested in power fantasy, it's old and I don't get off of it anymore, so this is not why I'm asking. Such a fic would rather probably be something deeply psychological, dealing with topics of suppression of one's desires and other psychological issues. Besides, I find the tragic idea of uncontrollable magic, genuinely dangerous to others and self, more interesting than a power fantasy. But I have no idea how to find fics that tackle this angle: do they exist? If not, maybe someone wants to adopt that angle in their stories.

*** Mm... Well if I was the writer, I wouldn't give Harry a Credence personality. I'm too lazy to write a huge fic myself (b\c this WOULD end up a novel-length lol), but it'd be something like that:

Harry has commited something horrible in childhood in order to stop the abuse (like, killed the Dursleys) and was so traumatized by that deed that he 'sealed' his own magic for good, becoming essentially a squib. But now he's fine, with a new family, not broken or something. However, Dumbledore is shocked to find out that he can't do magic (coz who will defeat Voldy now?), so he takes him to Hogwarts anyway...

Dumbledore has a history with his sister being an Obscurial, so he genuinely wants to help Harry avoid being overtaken by an Obscurus and dying soon from it, to make up for failing to help his sister. He has an idea that Occlumency skill should help against the Obscurus taking control over Harry, just like it would against Vold taking control over Harry, and someone (preferably not Snape, he sucks at it in canon) starts teaching it to Harry.

Well, I have other ideas on how this would end up, but this is the premise I'd have for the story. It would explore how eventually he starts being able to do magic, but only wandless and too wild\uncontrollable and struggles for control of it. I have an idea that it'd be like 'wild magic' in D&D: someone who is able to access it would end up being able to perform spells in power far above their level, however, it would be so prone to randomness that spells could switch on the fly and become a different spell, of their own volition. Now imagine trying to cast a healing spell on someone only for it to morph into a burning spell! D&D also had it possible for spells to switch their object to 'self', i.e. you could cast a damaging spell at someone else, but the object would randomly mutate to 'self', and you'd end up damaging your own self instead. Quite terrifying, I remember nearly killing myself accidentally like that in a game when I tried to cast something innocuous but both the spell and object suddenly mutated.

In the end, Harry would probably lose all his magic, b\c if everything goes on as in canon, Vold killing him in the forest would end up destroying both the horcrux AND the Obscurus, leaving him without magic at all. (The idea here is the the horcrux is in the unconscious part of his mind, and that's the same place the Obscurus is supposed to be, so they're linked and destroying one destroys the other)

OK enough fantasizing :) I wish there was a story to read, not just my fantasies about one.

** Ooh hang on, do I have a fic for you! Harry isn't the obscurial, James is, and it's a series, and the grammar is kinda shit, but the plot is riveting, devastating and full of incredibly well-developed plot twists. Gimme a sec to go find the link.

Edit: not a series, just one crazy long fic. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10206680/1/][Harry Potter and the Passion Years Memoir]]

  What will happen when a young abused Harry Potter is pushed too far? Strong Harry. I don't know what pairings I want to do yet but will probably have it figured out soon. Rated M for violence and Language.

** Iirc Harry wouldn't become an Obscurial because he was ignorant of magic. For an Obscurus to form the witch or wizard in question must hate or otherwise try to suppress their own magic which Harry couldn't do while ignorant of it.

I am reading one obscurial!Harry fic right now but it's a bit silly and not the best quality. Still, I am enjoying it and will recommend it here.

It's crossed with Marvel and Harry has a gamer like system fair warning.
