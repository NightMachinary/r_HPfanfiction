I managed to finish up a six chapter forum challenge that provided writing prompts based on the 12 Days of Christmas, bringing my completed fics total to... one.

I have three ongoing and find I can't switch between characterisations very well, so I'm trying to concentrate on finishing one at a time. But!!!! I'm looking at a page and nothing is being typed!!!

What are your tips and tricks for getting through a writing slump?


** I'm a super finicky writer, and I have three novel length fics in the works. I just try to write a bit each day, even if it isn't for the works I need to be finishing. I don't publish everything I write- most are one chapter little tales that sit in a master document on my computer, because I know I can't juggle 50 stories at once. But writing every day helps. Also, reading stories that you take inspiration from. It gets you back in the mindset you had when you decided to write your story.

I hope this helps!

** I have one fic that I post chapters to on ffn and ao3, and several others in my google drive that are my "procrastination projects". If I'm in a bad slump with my main fic, then I work on one of the procrastination projects until the ideas start to flow again. Either that, or I work on worldbuilding details for my main piece.

** Oddball advice: start work on another random story. 60 percent chance that as you get back into the swing of writing that one, ideas for the earlier one will occur to you and you'll be itching to return to the first one within a week.

(Of course, that leaves you with /another/ story to update, but you can always put that one on hiatus. Maybe return to it if you get stalled in the main one again. A sort of inspiration-buffer.)

*** This is pretty good advise. As long as you have ideas and write anything, you are making progress. Sure, writing three oneshots won't create a chapter for your ongoing stories, but it gives you a new angle. You might end up inspired, you might have a random thought which can help you to find a way around the roadblock, or you might even ditch the oneshot halfway through because you figured out that the idea is better suited for your longer projects.
