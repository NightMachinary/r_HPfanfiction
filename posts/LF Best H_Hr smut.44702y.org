  Hermione walks in on Harry while bathing in the RoR after a workout. Not wanting things to be tense, he stops her rush from leaving and they talk so things don't get weird between them. Though they do get heated. H/Hr Lemon Harmony

*** Nothing makes me feel each and every of the 10 years I've aged since I started reading fanfiction like the microscopic font size of Portkey. I know I can change it. But still, I used to be able to read it just fine...

Edit - also just actually skimmed that story. O.o

** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025401][Folie a Deux by Salon Kitty]]. IMO the infidelity is a pointless source of angst, but Ron isn't bashed so that makes it particularly noteworthy among smut-heavy H/Hr stories. It's a first person limited from Hermione's POV.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
