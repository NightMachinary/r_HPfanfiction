I've recently read a few stories that pair Harry with some background Slytherin Characters and found the characterizations to be rather interesting. So I was hoping for some recommendations for others.

Slytherin Character Examples:

Marcus Flint

Adrian Pucey

Cassius Warrington

Maybe some OCs that fall into this

Generally, I was more focused on those that went to Hogwarts with Harry for at least some of the time. However, I would be interested in older characters being paired with Harry as well. I do have more of an interest in slash pairings, but would welcome others as well.


** I love Duality, a Harry/Daphne fic. Seriously, it's really really good.

*** Thanks! I did see another post about this fic and I have been debating reading it. I do like the pairing, but I'm not sure about committing to reading a story of that length from an author that hasn't updated in so long. I'll probably end up reading it eventually, but thanks for the recommendation!

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

*** I have read Contractual Invalidation and enjoyed it, especially since it is set after they leave school and most aren't.

I haven't seen What Lies Beneath, but it seems interesting. Thanks for the recommendations!
