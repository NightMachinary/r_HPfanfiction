Well apparently the author just... didn't stop updating

/It's at 2.5 fucking million words/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate][Fate]]


** My review I originally posted elsewhere for those who may be interested:

I've been following this story since around 1 million words. I enjoyed the Ron-centric POV and some parts of the plot. The issue for me is that this story comes with a lot of baggage. The writing style is bland and the author insists on capitalizing oddly, sometimes for emphasis and sometimes for no reason at all. Character arcs regarding Ron's relationships with his family and friends keep repeating. It was okay the first three times but after countless arguments with his friends and family that are resolved only to occur again, it ends up being too much.

The character arcs and slice of life sections end up creating a fic with horrendous pacing. The story is at 2 million words and at the end of the third year. The arc with the French veela families took countless chapters to resolve and the arc could honestly have been contained entirely in one of TrueSpartan's longer chapters. The politics is also disappointing. There's a lot of the posturing behavior in political fics that's cringy. Ron's hatstall leads to some of the Slytherin kids look for "new allies with Ron" instead of Draco. Theo and Blaise lecture Ron about his eating habits because they want a powerful ally. Getting a haircut is treated as a huge deal. Despite how the story describes seating and posturing as the end all to politics and the future, the end goal of all the Slytherins is winning the house cup. Don't forget the 11 year old being appointed as an ambassador to the French (did they not have one previously?). Suspension of disbelief is required as to how he achieves said position. The only consequence for Ron not actually doing his job as the ambassador is that his boss threatens to fire him if it happens again.

There are other issues as well. Ron thinks about women in the context of sex constantly. I find it hard to believe a 6th year is really pressing her breasts into a first year's face and arm because she enjoys teasing children. Who knows? Maybe it's more common than I think. Regardless, after countless incidents of Ron admiring the body of <insert whichever woman or girl>, it starts detracting from the story and piles onto the horrendous pacing. Even the magic used by Ron's auror trainer to heal him has to get him erect, because it adds a few more paragraphs. The magic system feels disappointing in some ways. Wandless magic is treated as more powerful, Dumbledore is disappointingly weak, and there's a magic dummy that can outduel and outthink aurors (but I'm willing to bet we'll never see said dummy in actual combat despite its ability to be repaired). There are a few upsides to the magic system, but not many.

Money makes no sense.

It's not all bad. Theo and Blaise have interesting characters and backgrounds. Some parts of the plot are interesting, but in the end, the story is a wish fulfillment story. That said, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine, and I do eagerly await every chapter. I wouldn't recommend it to others unless they desperately sought a Ron-centric story though. It's the Red Knight but with the problems compounded. 2.5/5, rounded down.

*** It's actually pretty good. The plot and characters are way too good to not be invested, you're left wanting for more each chapter. There's NEVER any boring filler, time never drags on.

​

You can read the first 5 chapters, if it's not for you then quit it. I actually usually read oneshots (I usually have no patience for long fics), but reading Fate was so different!

*** A nice plot and lot's of patience and time. I've read a 1.2 mil fic and it's 2.5 mil sequel back to back.

...

I wasn't very happy when I realised that the climax of the 2.5 mil fic (Edit: Not fate, I'm referring to a different one here) the one where literally every single subplot, probably including the romance of the main character (his loved one was presumed dead and she had been getting closer and closer to him since she was rescued) /was never fucking written/.

They literally had a scene where the heroes each used the "powerups" they earned in their journey only for the actual fight scene to never be written.

I'm still fucking mad so many years later.

**** What I meant is that even with reading fanfiction there is some cost/benefit analysis. When reading linkffn(It's Always The Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1), I don't care that it is not as good as “The Brothers Karamazov” (heck, it is not even as good as the original Lovecraft), but it is 8,400 words so it is exactly the length to carry this story, and C/B ratio goes straight to the reader.

** Yep!

I read it every time a new chapter comes out and leave a review.

Yes it has its flaws, the pacing at some parts is bad and sometimes the characters act out of order.

But this is a fanfiction.

Dont get your hope up for the next HP when this isnt trying to do that.

It's pretty good for my favourite character Ron so I'd say give it a try.

** Too long, didn't read. Or rather, I tried to read the first few chapters. There are some punctuation and grammar mistakes, but it's just boring. I can see so many redundant words that could be cut to improve the prose.

For example, part of chapter 12 could go from this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and immediately noticed a giant ornate mirror in the middle of it. It had clawed feet, and a gold frame that had odd inscriptions carved into it. This is the mirror with Harry's parents... Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out! Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the mirror, with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron" Harry said, his tone boastful. "My parents are in there! C'mon have a look!" Harry said as he overtook Ron and jumped in front of the mirror. Harry looked hungrily at the reflection in the mirror, while Ron stood just a little behind Harry. All Ron could see was Harry, but it was clear to Ron that Harry saw much more as the boy-who-lived had tears welling up in his eyes.

"Harry..." Ron said softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you." Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, and then Harry shook his head hard.

"No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!" Harry implored, his voice was strained. "Come here" Harry said quickly as he pulled Ron into the spot that Harry was just now occupying, right in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad at seeing Harry so desperate for something. Ron then turned and looked into the mirror. What he saw within brought tears into his eyes, and a terribly sad smile upon his lips.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his loved ones, and his loved ones were all older than they were now. Fred was standing right behind Ron, alive and happy, and he had his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. Around them were the members of the Weasley and Lovegood families, all of them were beaming at Ron. They looked so happy, so content, and so full of life. Ron felt his own hands tremble slightly and he gave a wet chuckle at the sight. /They're all alive, and unharmed... Fred is alive! I did it!/

To this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and noticed a giant mirror with clawed feet and a gold frame. The top was covered in odd inscriptions.

This is the mirror with Harry's parents. Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out? Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the centre of the room with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron," boasted Harry, "my parents are in there! C'mon, have a look!" Harry jumped in front of the mirror, looking hungrily at his reflection while Ron stood behind. All he could see was Harry, but it was clear to him that Harry saw much more.

"Harry..." Ron began softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you."

Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, tears falling. "No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!"

"Come here," Harry said, pulling Ron in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad seeing him so desperate for something. He turned and looked into the mirror.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his older loved ones. Fred was standing right behind him, alive and happy, his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. The rest of the Weasley and Lovegood families surrounded them, beaming. They looked so full of life. Ron felt his eyes water and he let out a wet chuckle. /They're all alive, and unharmed! Fred is alive! I did it!/

Not perfect but a bit better. Little changes here and there can really help trim the fat.

The word count is another factor. 2.5 /million/ words and it's only completed up to third year? Maybe if I read from the beginning it'd be easier. I really want to enjoy this fic but it's just too much.

**** I think it's awesome!

The characters all are interesting, unique, and deep - and I care about them (and there are not too many). The author is so good at writing characters.

It never feels like there's any filler, but it's not too fast either.

There is so /much/ sheer CREATIVITY in it. Dozens of new, completely unheard of or rare ideas, and lots more.

No mary sues.

The plot is intriguing as hell.

And it's written well.

When I started with it I thought it was going to be boring, but at the first chapter I got really interested, and at the 4th chapter I was hooked.

You should at least give it a try, even if Harry isn't the MC.

** All the things wrong with this fic from the perspective of someone who won't read it:

#+begin_quote
  "it gets darker just as the original"
#+end_quote

Almost no one liked that in the original judging by the fact how later book are typically ignored in fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  2.5 mil words, unfinished
#+end_quote

It's too big a time investment for something that clearly has no end in sight.

#+begin_quote
  mostly from Ron's perspective
#+end_quote

OOC Ron, most likely. Not a very likeable character in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Reviews: 2,532 - Favs: 661
#+end_quote

Extreme amounts of people commenting multiple times is almost never a good thing.

#+begin_quote
  tons of guest reviews
#+end_quote

yeah....

#+begin_quote
  Never once seen recommended to me despite the size
#+end_quote

Despite me reading the fandom I haven't seen this in recs

#+begin_quote
  Not enough stuff on author's favourites to get a feel for what they like and how good their taste in fiction is
#+end_quote

For a 2.5m fic it's important.

So yeah, too many warning signs to invest time into it. I haven't read it and likely won't.
