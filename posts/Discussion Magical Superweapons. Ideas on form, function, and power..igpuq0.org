So, I was re-reading Petrification Proliferation, linkffn(11265467) and began to wonder, since a basilisk is clearly a WMD because of the lethal gaze, what other sorts of superweapons might exist in the magical world? We see the basilisk in CoS, and Fiendfyre in DH, both of which are capable of causing death tolls similar to a nuclear detonation /if properly deployed/. So basically, discuss what things you think might, could, or would exist as WMDs in the wizarding world.

For example, I have an idea for a weapon called the Breath of Morpheus. An enchanted mist that puts anyone inside it to sleep, but if it isn't dispelled by sunrise, it becomes the Breath of Somnus and kills everyone who was asleep in it. I can picture a dark wizard using this on small muggle towns to great (and terrible) effect. Those occasional news stories about a family being killed overnight by carbon monoxide buildup? Breath of Morpheus/Somnus.

Note: The Killing Curse is a terrible, boring piece of dark magic, and thus should not exist in its canon form. I stand and die on that hill. I'm also rather inebriated, so I apologise if I've failed to properly articulate this post.


** Mandrakes and fwoopers. Better than a basilisk really, since it works by sound and can work around corners and walls. Nundu's breath is the wizarding bioweapon which seems similar to your Breath of Morpheus, only it kills instantly. These are all canonical (or not all, depending on whether you count pottermore and the fanastic beast book).

I'm not sure why you dislike the killing curse, but I actually quite like it.

*** Don't recall the fwoopers, but mandrakes most definitely. Anyone close enough to hear dies. Drop one of those in a crowded place, and you're talking probably hundreds dead.

Put one in front of a live TV or radio broadcast, and potentially millions (unless it has to be heard directly by the ear for some magical reason).

*** A Nundu's breath isn't terribly effective though since even basic NBC gear should be sufficient to deal with it and, well it's basically gas without a delivery system. It is highly local and dependant on the wind. An artillery barrage loaded with Greencross or Sarin would be way worse.

**** Nundu's breath carries death and disease, and a magical one at that if it can wipe out dozens of wizards and their villages.

It's certainly far more effective at killing wizards who possess an innate resiliency to mundane poisons.

A lot of assumptions about the effectiveness of muggle protective equipment against magical disease, given how conceptual and powerful magic is in canon. You can drink a potion to cure disease, close a wound with a flick of a wand, teleport and conjure matter, but it's dragon pox, a magical disease, that poses a real threat.

Additionally, the effectiveness of chemical weapons is constantly overestimated by people. They're more psychological and mutual destruction via contamination. Delivery of chemical weapons via artillery renders a percent ineffective. It took hours to build up the concentration to start killing people en masse in the Iraqi attack.

They're a poor man's nuke; they leave long term consequences wherever they're employed. They're good at killing muggle civilians, honestly pretty bad at killing soldiers, and would be completely ineffectual against wizards who are highly resistant to chemicals. Muggle bioweapons would be more effective as wizards can still get infected, even if they might be able to easily cure them.

*** Nundu aren't exactly common though, and it would be incredibly difficult to safely collect their breath for use as a bioweapon. On the other hand, mandrakes would be terrifyingly effective when properly deployed.

As for the killing curse, I dislike it because, in my opinion, it's a boring piece of magic. Instant death for anyone you hate enough to cast it. If it was nearly impossible to cast, even for most of the more talented Death Eaters, I'd like it more. It would emphasise how vile Voldemort is that he is capable of tossing them out like candy. As is though, why even use other spells on enemies when you can just cast several of those at them until they can't dodge any more. Just my personal opinion.

** While it is not mentioned in the books, Rowling later explained (on Pottermore or something else) that the British Ministry of Magic "discovered" the island of Azkaban after the death of its previous occupant, the Dark Wizard Ekrizdis, died and the protections failed.

Since the Dementors were already present on the island when the Ministry went to investigate, and that we do not have any other informations about this specie, it is not impossible that the Dementors were a "magical weapon" created by Ekrizdis. If it was the case, I think that a bunch of unkillable, soul sucking monster who generate an aura of despair qualify as "Superweapon".

**** Dementors can't be destroyed but apparently they can't pass through solid objects like walls and their hovering is limited to a bit faster than running speed. Those are pretty major weaknesses, so it should be totally doable to catch them, then once they're immobilized just launch them into deep space. Muggles could probably do it if they could see Dementors; hunt them down riding on motorbikes that are faster than Dementors and catch them with lassos, then put them into solid steel cages and mount them on top of an Atlas or a Delta. If one cage containing a Dementor weighs around 140 kg, a single Delta IV Heavy should be capable of sending 100 of them towards a rendezvous with Venus at once.

****** For wizards, the Sun or out of the solar system entirely is easily doable. But for muggles it'd be quite a bit more expensive. Hitting the Sun is actually quite energy intensive, the most efficient route we have starts by flying past Venus for a gravity slingshot.

** AK is signifcant because its (mostly) magically unblockable, and because it requires a malevolent state of mind to use. Its not a WMD, no.

I think that equating the basilisk's power to a nuke is a bit much. You have to look it directly in the eyes, and sooner or later they'd figure out to clear the area and just gas it or shoot it from the air.

A Nundu would be worse- probably faster than a basilisk, and poison breath. Its never been taken down by less than a hundred wizards IIRC.

Fiendfyre, deployed in a dense urban environment without warning, or at a major event, could kill thousands, perhaps tens of thousands.

I've often thought about portkeying explosives or poisons into a place for a surprise attack.

*** A Basilisk would be pretty lethal outside, when it's gaze can affect anyone within miles who happens to look in the wrong direction. Inside a building it's quite ineffective.

** How about the Vanishing spell? It can be cast in modified forms to vanish exactly what you want gone while not affecting what you want to keep. Cast it at some uranium ore, removing everything but U-235 and you can easily make weapons grade fissile material.

Now a switching charm can be used to effectively teleport items between fixed positions, very handy for instantly assembling a critical mass. No need for complicated explosive lensing.

Combine that magic nuclear weapon with a portkey, and you effectively have an untraceable ICBM. Your enemy's place might be charmed against arriving portkeys, but you don't really need to hit it exactly when you're sending a literal nuke.

Pretty much any skilled wizard with a decent knowledge of spells and a few months or years studying nuclear physics could pull it off. That's easy enough that there's a sizeable danger that some psycho might actually do it.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
