I got into a disagreement with someone else because they felt Harry fell ass back into power, rather than doing any actual training, which I disagreed with since the first two years Harry is a child trying to fit in somewhat, then Harry learns the Patronus, trains for the Triwizard, the DA, His lessions with Dumbledore, the entire year on the run. I feel Harry trys to trains as much as a person can without severing himself from the student body.

Whats your take


** When he wants to be. He can be a bit lazy when it comes to general schoolwork, especially in subjects he doesn't like, but like you say, he dedicates a ton of time to learning things he's interested in, most notably the time he spends learning the Patronus Charm, all the time he spends preparing for DA lessons, as well as the lessons themselves, and the amount of time he spends practicing quidditch, as well as game planning when he's made captain. So he's not the most diligent person, but I'd say yes, he's very hard working when he's interested in the thing or thinks it's necessary.

*** Completely agree with this. I think that when Harry sets his mind to being good at something, there's very little that can stand in his way to mastering it.

Did anyone else think it was strange for this facet of his character to not make it into Cursed Child? I'd imagined that Harry would definitely want to be a good father, and would dedicate himself toward that end.

** I think what offends people/me is that harry as a muggle raised child never took any great interest in magic outside of school work and fighting.

if you look at all generation that came before harry and compare him to the big names among them he is one big disappointment

hell even Peter pettigrew was an animagus before age 15( patronus charm at age 13>animagus transformation at age 15)

I mean, yes, he could stand to be more curious, but there's an okay in-universe reason for his lack of curiosity. And even doing magic would get old after a while of writing lots of papers on it and having to learn it in school, just like any other skill.

It's largely fanon, as far as I can tell. Harry has no trouble talking back to Dursleys, bragging to Hagrid about knowing stuff (before knowing that Hagrid was there to take him away to Hogwarts), etc.. There little canon reason to believe his curiosity would somehow be affected.

Considering that Snape still turned out to be much better than Harry at magic when comparing them both as students, even despite Snape's home life, evidently his father's abuse towards him and his mother did nothing to impact his later progress.

At least Harry knew that his parents were good people and loved him. Snape's father hated Snape and his mother, and as for said mother, considering how irrelevant she was, she certainly didn't leave much of a positive impression on Snape.

Even Voldemort had it worse than Harry and ended up far better when comparing them as students. Again, Harry at least knew that James and Lily were good people and loved him dearly. Voldemort's parents were terrible given that the reason he was even born was because Merope raped Tom Riddle Sr, and Tom Riddle Sr was implied to be a Draco-esque jerk even before Merope came into his life. Petunia didn't bring Dudley into the world by raping Vernon, nor did Vernon do the same to Petunia. So even though the Dursleys are truly horrible people, I'd say they were still better parents to Dudley than Merope and Tom Riddle Sr would have been to Voldemort.

The Marauders had to deal with Voldemort, and unlike Harry, they had to deal with the Death Eaters when they were at their strongest. Harry never knew that the Death Eaters existed until GoF and was so dumb, he didn't know what they were. Harry not knowing what the Death Eaters were is like a someone not knowing about the Nazis. Even people who don't care about history or learning at least knew about the Nazis given how omnipresent of a topic it is in education. You'd think that Harry would ALREADY know that the Death Eaters were Voldemort's followers. Even if he can't name any Death Eaters at the start of GoF, he should have at least known about their role in the wizarding world.

People always say "but Harry had to deal with Voldemort" as an excuse for Harry being objectively inferior to the previous generation (Marauders, Lily, and Snape) when comparing them at the same ages. As far as Harry was concerned, Voldemort was basically non-existent until the end of GoF and the Death Eaters were non-existent until the Quidditch World Cup.

Meanwhile with the Marauders generation, Voldemort was alive, at full power, had all his Death Eaters, and was an active threat. It wasn't like Voldemort had disappeared or anything since during 1970-1981, Voldemort would have been killing off his enemies and trying to take over the Ministry. Unlike Harry, the previous generation were not protected by the three-fold plot amour of main character status, Voldemort's forced stupidity, and Harry's sheer dumb luck.

Also, the Marauders era still had to put up with the DADA jinx, meaning that the previous generation (Marauders, Lily, Snape) had DADA teachers just as terrible as Harry did, and yet they all turned out to be more skilled by comparing what they did at the same age. So if anything, the Marauders, Lily, and Snape were the ones who had to worry about Voldemort when they were students, not Harry.

Especially since that from where things stand, Harry is a failure for being weaker than James or Lily. Especially considering that Harry has a wealthy pureblood father, meaning that Harry pretty much inherited all the money from James and also the Invisibility Cloak. Yet Harry, as a Hogwarts student, is outclassed by the previous generation when they were students.

HBP reinforces this most of all, given how Snape as a student was far better at magic than Harry ever was, and to add onto that, he was better than Hermione. Snape made improvements to his potions textbooks, proving himself smarter than the author of Advanced Potion Making when Snape himself was still a student. Then he proceeded to invent several spells, the most notable ones being Levicorpus, Sectumsempra, and Vulnera Sanetur. Meanwhile Hermione's biggest achievement is learning the Protean Charm a year before she would have learnt it.

The Marauders became Animagus at the age of 15, which is much more difficult than Harry learning the Patronus Charm at the age of 13, especially since the Patronus Charm isn't a skillful spell because it revolves around Harry's emotions. Most spells revolve around skill and theory, whereas the Patronus does not. All it takes is strong happy memories, not intelligence or skill, and isn't a testament of being powerful. Remember that the only reason Harry learnt the Patronus was because Lupin gave him private lessons that nobody else had access to.

The fact he needed Lupin to teach it to him rather than him learning it himself only devalues Harry's achievement even more, since it implies that Harry is incapable of doing anything unless Hermione/Dumbledore/etc tells him to. Voldemort didn't get any special treatment like private lessons from professors to learn about Horcruxes as a student, nor did the Marauders do the same to become Animagus or make the Marauders Map. Voldemort and the Marauders did that on their own, of their own initiative, not by having professors hold their hand.

The difference is that a Patronus isn't a big achievement. Its only notable because Harry is a student and only because Hogwarts never had a competent teacher to teach the charm. To adults, the charm is no big deal when used by adults. Yet stuff like the Fidelius Charm are impressive no matter how old its caster is, and is impressive for ANYONE to do. Since the Fidelius Charm is a mark of skill and intelligence, unlike the Patronus.

To be fair, the jinx had been around since between 1965 and 1971 or so, so when the Marauder generation started Hogwarts, it had been in place for between 0 and 6 years, and between 7 and 13 years when they graduated. This means that while they didn't have the most consistent of curricula, there were still plenty of people both qualified and willing. By the time Harry & Co. matriculated in 1991, it had been in place for between 20 and 26 years. Add to that that some the sort of people who were both good at DADA and Not Evil (TM) tended to join Aurors or the Order and die in the first war, and it makes sense that Dumbledore was scraping the proverbial bottom of the barrel at that point.

So, I think that we should be charitable to Harry & Co. here.

*** This view always bothers me. Learning is work. I had wanted to learn Japanese and go to Japan since I was /five years old/, but once I started taking classes, I was sometimes lazy because it's /work./ I had to force myself to get past the lazy days and find time to study despite being tired or busy to make my dream come true, and I'm still working at it.

If you were introduced to a new magical world like in Harry Potter, I find it very believable that a child would be fascinated and then uninterested in all of the work needed to understand or perform all of the amazing things they're seeing. It takes dedication and self-discipline that most people don't have. Pettigrew and the Marauders were animanguses through personal interest, something Harry had in different areas like broom flying and Defense against the Dark Arts.

That just makes him a typical human, IMO. If you give a smartphone to a thousand people, only a handful will display any curiosity about how one works, or how to write apps for it. Similarly, vast majority of drivers are perfectly content driving without learning automotive repair beyond changing a flat. Most Quiddich players probably don't care about how to enchant a broom.

Sure, seeing magic for the first time must have been exhilarating, but, again, vast majority of people who go to see Cirque du Soleil do not emerge with any particular desire to take up acrobatics or even learn physics.

Hermione is the weirdo who reads nonfiction in bed and learns spells for fun (and we love her for it). Harry is normal.

#+end_quote

It didn't say he was Voldemort's equal. It said Voldemort would mark him as his equal, but that he would have power that Voldemort knows not. The first clause was fulfilled when Voldemort decided to treat Harry as a legitimate threat requiring his personal attention and gave him the lighning-shaped scar. The second clause referred to love, friendship, and all those other warm and fuzzy things that Voldemort always underestimated. (Well, that, or Dumbledore was horribly wrong about interpreting the prophecy, yet somehow managed to plan for Voldemort's death and Harry's survival in spite of that.)

The hype was just wizards being wizards. (Or, more precisely, wizards being human.)

** No - only when his fun (quidditch!) is threatened or when Hermione forces him to (the DA!)...he doesn't even outright try to prepare for Voldemort (even on the Horcrux hunt he was clueless...why not live in the muggle world for example?)...he's not even that great at defense: He's quick on his feet but his repertoire of spells is quite limited (not to say: poor!)...he's squandering potential (even more so with getting together with fangirl number 1 in the crapilogue and becoming a ministry lapdog (while nothing much changes - Malfoys get off, there's still bigotry and pureblood elites etc. etc.))

It's one of the few things Snape (Note: I hate him...he's a great character, but I still hate Severus Snape!) got right about Harry Potter!

Harry is average - why? He wants to be average, to blend it with the crowd (despite showing potential, like with his patronus!)...he's more Dursley than the Dursleys sometimes (he doesn't show genuine curiosity about magic (how does it work? Can I learn that? Can I improve that?), hell he doesn't even ask about his parents much (we don't even know what they did for a living...unless Rowling said something about that, it's not in the books as far as I remember!))

Over all if I were to meet canon Harry then I'd tear him a new one (tell him that his parents would be disappointed because he was not even really trying, he wasn't living but instead reacting to Voldemort and manipulative headmasters!) not only about academia but his lack of friends (he has 2 real friends and even they need to learn certain things, like not sticking their nose into everything (even your friends have a right to privacy!) and snitching to teachers etc. (Hermione!) and not being a total slacker without any ambition what so ever and generally being (IMHO!) a bad friend (Ron!)), his lack of personal interests (beside quidditch Harry doesn't have ANY HOBBIES!), his lack of interest in how he looks (Dudley's second hand stuff isn't good enough if you can afford better!) etc. etc.

I am sure Harry would be crying after I am done with him, but I think he'd do lots better after having been forced to hear me out (body binds do wonders here!)

ps: I'd do the same for his friends (though I don't have high hopes for Ron - but that might just be me...after all I don't like Ron at all!)

** Hard working is rather vague, we need a reference, we know his parents were both brilliant students meaning its likely that he has a lot of raw potential as some elements of intelligence are genetic. Objectively Hermione is extremely hard working, are you comparing Harry to Ron or to Hermione?

Harry compared to an average student? I would argue that Harry isn't particularly hard working with regards to class. Evidenced by not looking thoroughly through his books before first year and his not fantastic OWLs. What he can do however is dedicate himself to something he sees as important. Preparing for the third task of the tri-wizard, the partonus and preparing for the DA all hint at potential. Fanon often blames Ron for bringing him down but really he just seems not to care about academics, Harry never seems to look to the future nor does he have any aims or goals, he spends so long trying not to stand out that he never tries.

Most of the 'training montage Harry' fics are ridiculous. Harry is not Tom Riddle, even if they were the same age Harry would be outmatched in intelligence and ability. Voldemort is 55 years older than Harry, there is no training or studying that Harry can do to overcome that advantage.

Even so he works hard, he does well in his classes, he gets into the difficult NEWT classes, he trains half the school in defense, he never loses at his sport. Calling Harry lazy doesn't stand up to any real scrutiny.
