1. No Slash or Dramione
2. The focus should be on Harry. e.g, No story detailing the budding romance of Character A and Character B unless one is Harry.
3. Preferably over 20K words
4. Any Fanfic tropes are fine too
5. Harry can use dark spells, but not get any enjoyment out of it.
6. It should be well written, both grammatically and in terms of plot

An example I could give would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/][A Cadmean Victory]]


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

-No slash or Dramione. Hermione absolutely *hates* Draco in this one. Her revenge is the main plot.

-Focus on Hermione and Harry. Alternating perspectives. H/Hr romance eventually. Both have other partners before.

-Over 600k words.

-Slightly AU with different plot, even before the start of the fic. Rich purebloods in control of the government and ancient wards protecting their manors are the main tropes.

-Harry uses illegal blood magic against Voldemort, is disgusted by it, but does it out of necessity. Hermione does plenty of illegal, but not dark stuff.

-The story is well written, the plot is great, the action scenes are exciting and the heists very creative.

I also recommend a few of the other fics of Starfox5 if you like this one, they're my favorites although most are more focused on Hermione than Harry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), looks like a very good fit:

- No slash or Dramione
- Harry centric, and no romance at all
- 143k words
- No particular tropes, but the Wizengamot is made of hereditary seats in this fic
- Harry loves dark spells, especially Fiendfyre
- Very well written, especially the Trio characterizations and interactions; Neville, Susan, Luna, George, and Professor Flitwick all have their bright moments

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
