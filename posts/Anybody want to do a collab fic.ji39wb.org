I have lots of ideas and bits of storys but I have a hard time stringing things together and writing big storys and think It would be fun to write a story with someone.

It will probably be a bit long term because I dislike when others don't finish their fics and there should be more complete fics out there.

Um I dont particularly care alot about pairings outside of no girl pairings for harry anyone else is fine

The main plain is for a fic with harry being like luna and them being best friends

Def slytherin or ravenclaw harry

And it will either be him as a teacher along with others or him in school to him as a teacher witch would be a bigger project

Prob will be on a03

Of your interested we can meet up on discord to vc and plan

** It sounds a bit interesting, but where are you trying to go with the story?

*** That's a bit hard to answer because o have lot of little pieces but am struggling with where to take them. Thats the main reason k want to work with someone to help bounce ideas and create a good story that actually has a end point. The best I can give you is that I had seen a small prompt about Neville as a professor where he's generally soft and Neville like but on occasion students catch him and all the stiff he did during the war and my idea spiraled from there. Its alot to type out
