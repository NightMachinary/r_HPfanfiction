A complete canon story that follows James, Lily and the rest of the gang through Hogwarts up until that Halloween night but instead Lily and James end up surviving? I'd love to read something like this! If you don't know anything like this then feel free to still post your favourite Marauder story! AU or canon, doesn't matter.


** I'm afraid I don't know of a fic like that. However, I'm currently reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486/chapters/34657572#workskin][the lost generation]] linkao3(1110486) and really enjoying it. Canon compliant (except for the Sirius/Remus pairing, depending on how strictly you define canon-compliant), and a WIP (currently covers through sixth year).

  The Marauders era at Hogwarts, Voldemort's rise to power and the subsequent war, family loyalties and dishonour, and the struggles of friendship in a difficult time.Ch. 98: The Slytherins have a prank up their sleeves, but it doesn't end how they would probably want.
