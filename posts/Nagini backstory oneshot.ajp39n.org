Not sure if this is allowed but I'd like to share my fanfic. This fic kind of explores Nagini's backstory as a Gaunt girl like Merope. Going to warn you now that it contains a short description of sex and elements of incest, rape, racism, abuse, abortion...

I'd appreciate it if other writers could tell me what rating this fic falls under. I've got it as T on FF.net and have left it unrated on AO3 because I'm not sure what rating to give it.

Oh yes, I forgot to mention that this is set before Fantastic Beasts and doesn't really contradict anything in CoG except one small line about Nagini being found in an Indonesian jungle. I've categorised it as a HP fic rather than FB because it's got the Gaunts and Tom Riddle (Sr) in it.
