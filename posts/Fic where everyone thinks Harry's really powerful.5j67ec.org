I think it's pretty popular, all I remember is Harry goes on holiday and does some relatively innocuous things but they make him look really powerful to observers. I think he calls himself Mr Black.

** I seem to remember one where he holidays in a tent. I don't think he called himself Mr Black though although everyone thought he was powerful even though he could only cast expelliarmus. I think it was called Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
