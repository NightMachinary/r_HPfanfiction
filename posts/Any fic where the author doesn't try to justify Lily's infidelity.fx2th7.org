Because even in fics like linkffn(Conditioally), supposedly one of the best Severitus(why is it even called Severitus by the way?), Lily kind of gets an out.

"Oh, they were treating her like a kid, she got mad, she wasn't in the right mind".

And James is such a non-character in this fic. Ok, sure its mostly because he died before even knowing. But Lily gets to have her justification and all James has is that its kind of his fault because he got too overprotactive?

Granted, the author doesn't bash him at all, but he/she makes him either irrelevant or kind-of-in-the-wrong.

Like, at the end, Harry straight up says[thinks] that he would be fine with Evans as his surname but there were some legal complications that probably wouldn't allow him to have that. Like, this is the woman that hid the fact that her son wasn't from her husband from him even though she knew it from the beginning. Charmed her baby's appearance so that he could look like her husband and not arise suspicion. Told her baby's biological father to never speak of the instance and never to get in her and her baby's life(or something along the lines, I don't remember this part much). And she's treated by the narrative as a good person? Seriously?

I hate this. I want to see Lily straight up being in the wrong.

I don't like reading about infidelity to begin with. Clearly I don't like Severitus. However, whenever I've read any of them by accident or for some other purpose, I've seen every time that Lily is either excused or justified in her infidelity. I don't like that. I just wanted to see if fics that don't sugarcoat her exist.

​

I have never read a single one where both parties are in the wrong or have valid points

​

One person always seems to be abusive or drugging the other with love potion or they are just REALLY annoying so their partner has no choice but to escape

I dont think ive read any fics where a character simply cheats

Unless the person cheating is the antagonist so when they do its wrong

***** Lily is one of the least negatively-portrayed characters in the entire HP universe. The only female characters that come to mind that are portrayed less negatively are Luna and Nymphadora.

It gets to the point where authors go out of the way to engineer justifications for why Lily did something bad, in case she did, because it definitely wasn't her being in the wrong, no that can't be.

I suspect the reason for this is that pretty much /everyone/ in canon calls her as being a very good person, including that one guy that seems to hate everybody's guts. /Everyone/, except maybe Petunia whose argument is lessened by her disposition towards people in general. This colors people's perception of her to the point where people have a hard time portraying her badly.

The main problem with the Draco Trilogy was the blatant plagiarism, pretty much any witty lines were ripped off from whatever was on TV at the time the fic was written, ditto for a bunch of subplot ideas.

But overall it was a good fic, up there with Methods of Rationality or other current popular fics. Also, did I mention that one of the pairings in the Draco Trilogy was H/Hr? It was one of the few H/Hr fics that I genuinely liked, at least at the time. The rest I encountered had too much of what I like to call "Barbie and Ken" feel.

********* I really dislike how that often happens in crossovers. Like, is there absolutely no way to write another witty character? do you really have to turn him into an existing one, with magic tacked on, which he very often doesn't even use?

I think the absolute worst offender ever in this was a fic where Hermione was somehow stripped of her magic, then studied archeology and encountered members of SG-1 multiple times, only to be threatened with custody in america (despite being a british citizen and in germany at the time) if she didn't sign a NDA.

The entire fic sort of tapered off there, but she was literally just a random muggle oc with a name from HP. She didn't even have magic. That's sort of a guideline for me - if the protagonist isn't a wizard or doesn't interact with the wizarding world in any meaningful way, then it's not a HP fanfic.

** Check out Blood Magic by Gateway Girl.

Harry is conceived by magic ritual and James knows about it. But then they lie about Harry's parentage and hide the fact that he is Severus', which is highly illegal due to the laws surrounding the magic ritual. (Trying not to spoil things here.) So James and Lily together are in the wrong here.

Why is it called Severitus: Bc the fanfic author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/123967/Severitus][Severitus]] issued the so-called [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][Severitus challenge]].

As for Lily always getting an out: If you want Snape to be Harry's biological father, stuff needs to happen. The "Snape is evil" version would be that he rapes her. Considering that the goal of most Severitus stories is to write about a developing positive relationship between Snape and Harry, that would make things difficult so authors generally avoid that. At the same time you get the impression from canon that James and Lily were very much in love, so authors need to come up with a why and how. The easiest is to pin it on James (he cheated so she choose take revenge, James was infertile, etc). It is also easier to give Lily an out this way, bc a Severitus story is about Snape and Harry - not about Lily and James.

Just follow any discussions on [[/r/genealogy][r/genealogy]] and [[/r/adoption][r/adoption]] about people taking DNA tests for fun and finding out that they have a different biological father than they always thought. The general consensus and advice to the child is not to be angry at the mother, bc a) you don't know what she went through at the time and b) it is really none of your business who your mother did it with. Yes, you have a right to know who contributed to your genes, but the rest is none of your concern.

The pureblood society's prevalence of historical inbreeding meant that their swimmers every so often have issues, and their female partners every so often copulate with someone else, and there is a paternity potion of sorts that hides it. Arthur's mother is mentioned as having done it, aka how he and Molly were pureblood anomalies with 7 children.

** I've always liked fics portraying Severus as being much closer to Harry (platonically), including Severitus-style plots. However, for those cases in particular, I've always much preferred them as not being related in blood (at least not the obvious paternal route). There's plenty of reasons for this, but the infidelity is an obvious one (while I've never been a fan of James-bash, this is usually the way it's justified, but it doesn't really make any sense -- why would Lily go /back/ to James if he was so horrible in first place?). There's also another somewhat common interpretation (Severus and Lily were the genuine past lovers, but Lily ended up with James as a cover for Severus being a spy), but while it's not strictly adultery, it's both disturbing as well as just plain depressing for everyone involved. I also take issue with most Severitus fics on ao3, because the authors insist on tagging them Snily. Now, I actually happen to like this pairing, but not the Severitus version of it due to reasons explained above (I much prefer Marauder-era fics with it), and they don't even tend to contain much of that ship in first place anyway besides a bit of backstory, so why even tag it?

I /have/ seen one fic where Lily took issue with something James was doing, but her retribution went way over the line (she basically used Severus for revenge sex, exploiting his feelings for her -- James hadn't done something /that/ bad), ultimately hurting everyone involved. This is only revealed years later in typical Severitus fashion. Severus was unhappy for having been deceived over the lack of a son, and it's implied that James would have been devastated (obviously) if he had known. But that's the only fic I've seen which portrays Lily as being in the wrong. I don't remember the title of it, sorry, but I remember it starting off as Harry dying from something and needed blood from a close relative, with Severus being the one. Severus was confused, but Obliviated before he could draw the inevitable conclusion, and only found out later when he drank a potion to un-Obliviate him (for unrelated reasons).
