**** I thought Neville made a good He-Man, and Dennis complaining about a lack of Ramen while in Naruto mode still makes me smile.

** For example, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/#post-54733534][Aspects]] has a bunch of characters from the three web serials Worm, Pact, and Twig in Hogwarts.

** I've started something much like this, blended with too many time travelers. One scene I haven't posted yet has McGonagall asking how the hell they suddenly have 90 or so students in Harry's year, instead of the 40 she expected.

  An extra-dimensional being sends a hero from their universe to King's Cross in September 1991, with the goal of helping young Harry Potter. Unfortunately, they aren't the only one who decides to intervene, and the sorting that night just keeps getting longer & longer. Chapter Two featuring Eve Moneypenny (from the Bond franchise).
