I'm looking for fics where Sirius and Harry get to demonstrate their familial love for eachother. Canon divergence is fine. Angst/hurt/comfort is preferred.

As examples, some of my favourites are:\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/750576/1/][Never Alone, Never Again]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009628/1/][Never Gone, Never Forgotten, and Never Letting Go]]\\
* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2077037/1/][Here Today and Gone Tomorrow, Without a Yesterday]]

Thanks in advance :)


** You'll probably like A Maurader's Plan (I'm certain I spellt that wrong but I'm on my phone and can't be arsed to fix it).

I haven't personally finished it yet, I keep forgetting for some abyss-damned reason, but what I've read is pretty good.

Can't tell you how good the fluff is since I'm a really bad judge (No really, I literally feel nothing from what I'm told are the most heartwarming scenes, the best you'd get from me is a slight smile) but the angst seems pretty strong. Even if I'm not certain what exactly is angst and what isn't at times.

...yeah, I think I'm emotionally dead.

Anyway! Read the fic, It's one of the most popular on the ff.net by measurement of favorites.

Have a good read and enjoy the fluff in my place!

** So you mean Harry and Sirius being dorable? Ok, try this: “Innocent” by Marauderlover7 link!ffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]) . It is first in a series and super long, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

*** Just started reading that one a few days ago. Already 500k words in and almost skipped Christmas because of it.
