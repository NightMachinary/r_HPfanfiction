** I'll move past the fairly pointless arguments that /reposting with credit, but without consent/ does not technically constitute plagiarism as defined by the AO3 TOS because it is also explicitly disallowed as copyright and trademark infringement:

#+begin_quote
  Reproductions of entire copyrighted works---whether songs, poems, transcripts, or other material---are not allowed without the consent of the copyright owner.
#+end_quote

Similarly, representatives of AO3 have stated in the past that exactly this kind of activity should not be performed without explicit consent: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/bgvbqa/am_i_allowed_to_post_someone_elses_work/elntbtr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]]

The issue here is that it appears to only be enforceable by the copyright holder themselves:

#+begin_quote
  If you believe that your content has been reproduced in whole or in part, without transformative use (transformative use is defined by the OTW as adding something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the source with new expression, meaning, or message), please follow our procedures for reporting copyright infringement.

  The report must clearly and specifically indicate the exact location (URL), nature, and extent of each instance of allegedly infringing content, as well as the exact copyrighted material that is being infringed, as well as full and complete contact information for the copyright holder and/or an authorized agent.
#+end_quote

Thus, if the author is dead, or simply no longer active, it seems that it's open season on their works.

This is similar to the broader problem of orphan works. In most places use of copyrighted orphan works (where the rights holder is either unknown or unreachable) is still illegal, it's just entirely without enforcement as only the rights holder can enforce their ownership of a work.

Thus it seems AO3 is entirely in step with most international copyright law. Copying shit without permission isn't allowed, but attempting to police it is too much work, and so it falls to the rights holders to do so. If those rights holders are unaware of the infringement, then it simply gets overlooked.

*** If the author's dead or no longer active, I think it shoukd be open season on their works. Orphan works should automatically pass into the public domain, but as protection against accidentally scooping in non-orphan works the cooyright remains but the author has to actively defend their copyright. That way orphan works are still de jure cooyrighted (which is unfortunate) but with nobody actively claiming and enforcing cooyright on them, de facto they're public domain.

**** If the author is no longer active and have moved on, it's still plagiarism to steal their stories and repost them under your account. Now, there were a few stories that I was inspired to write that are based off of orphaned works, but I always made it a point to link to the source material. However, these stories were only based on some events that took place in that orphaned work... and if I can find the original authors to that fic, if say it is a story that gained a lot of traction in the fandom, then I ask around to see if I could find the name of the author and ask them if I can base my fic around x story.

In most cases, the authors of the orphaned fic have removed themselves entirely from the fandom and deleted their accounts, so I just link to the orphaned fic and let it be. If I do get into contact with the original author and they tell me that I can do whatever I want as it is no longer their fic, then I still link to the source, and take great care to not name the author.

Also, if we are dealing with authors that published their books, their works are protected by copyright as well. I've seen people lift entire books from now deceased writers and post them to sites like Wattpad and AO3. If it's a fanfic writer that has died, and their work is still posted to the archive, then I feel that the copyright of that fic is still to the original writer and stealing it verbatim and reposting it to your account is incredibly offensive.

***** But if, as in this case, the person who wrote it and originally posted it is still identified as the author when it's reposted and the original posting made it available to the world free of charge, how does "steal their stories" even apply as a description of reposting it? The author's still getting credit and there's no lost income/unjust enrichment issues. How does it affect me at all if I post a story to FFN, that all the world can read without paying me a cent, and someone copies it to AO3 as "Story From FFN by RealLifeH_sapiens"?

Hell, what difference would it have made if you'd written your stories based around around Story X without the Author of Story X's permission? I can't think of any compelling or valid reason for you to have refrained from writing and posting your stories even if Author of Story X had specifically said, "No, I don't want you writing derivative works based on my work", so I can't think of a reason.to ask for unneccessary permission. Or to post the link to Story X except as a courtesy (as much to your readers as to that author).

**** I'm honestly struggling to see your point here. In fact, I'm kinda struggling to see the point of most of your comments on this post.

My first question is where exactly did I complain? I merely pointed out the legal reality of how things worked. Am I suggesting that something is left to be desired about reality? Yes, of course. What I did not do, however is:

#+begin_quote
  [complain] that you have to prove that you have the authorisation to act in someone's name
#+end_quote

What I was in fact suggesting is that it is kind of... weird (to borrow a turn of phrase) that a thing can be both /illegal/ and /explicitly against the terms of service/, but that no-one bothers trying to enforce these things unless they're about to get in trouble for /not/ enforcing them.

Why does representation matter at all when something has been posted on a site which clearly falls afoul of the rules of that site? Why does the site drag its feet so much on enforcing their own rules that it is only the possibility of legal liability that makes them do so?

Further, your arguments in other comments about the nature of plagiarism just seem to be pointless noise. They don't further the discussion at hand. You could have made the point (which I did above) that it is not technically plagiarism, but just straight up copyright infringement without needing to enter into more than one lengthy argument which was completely irrelevant to the real question of /why AO3 doesn't feel the need to enforce its own rules/.

The answer, as I have said above is that they don't feel the need, because the way they enforce their own rules in this case is identical to the way the law is applied. Whether you believe that that is a fair way of treating intellectual property or not is a further conversation, and one which I think is entirely more valuable to have than trying to pick at irrelevant details of the original complaint just so you can look smart.

****** So, firstly, if you accept that I did not in fact complain about it, why did you address it as a reply to something I'd said? Have you not made top-level comments to this effect already?

Of course, what you actually said in reply to my earlier comment didn't really have anything to do with the plagiarism/reposting confusion at all and was instead commenting on the legal reality of copyright ownership and enforcement. If you were trying to make a point referencing my own comment, perhaps it would have been better to actually make the point, rather than settling for making vague implications.

In fact, this seems a fairly strange hill on which to die because copyright infringement and plagiarism are two concepts which overlap significantly.

Copyright states that the creator has the sole right to:

- reproduce a work.
- create derivative works based upon it.
- distribute copies of the work to the public.
- publicly display or perform the work.

Here's the thing, copying, with or without attribution, is copyright infringement if the copyright holder did not give permission for their work to be copied.

The primary difference is that with plagiarism there's an additional 'victim' at play: the mislead 'consumers' of the plagiarised work. There are cases where one may plagiarise someone without infringing their copyrights, but these really aren't especially applicable in this context.

I guess that raises an interesting point. If AO3 is more strict in its actions against plagiarism (considering that their interpretation of fair use probably makes it extremely difficult to plagiarise a work without infringing copyright) than it is when dealing with copyright issues, it says something about how they value authors and readers.

It is almost as if AO3 holds the position that readers are worthy of protection, but authors must fend for themselves.

It just makes sense that the burden of proof is different in the case of reposting.

Like, imagine you have a house with a lawn, and your neighbours kids are playing there one day, and someone else comes and, without asking you whether or not you mind them playing there, tells them to get off /your/ lawn or else.

If someone reposts a story and credits the original author, then one should check with the original author if they mind that before demanding that a story is taken down. Because no matter what people say about moral and not, only the original author has the right to demand that the work is taken down. Anyone who, without asking, steps in and demands that in their name is usurping a right they don't have.

  In order to investigate a claim of unauthorized reposting, we require at least two of the following: proof that the user did not ask for or receive permission, proof that the original creator has previously stated that they do not give permission for anyone to reproduce or redistribute their work, and an accessible link to, or copy of, the original source.

*** I think this is to make sure that somebody isn't revenge reporting plagiarism. A lot of people crosspost their fic to other platforms, and there are some people that for whatever reason don't like the author, so a lot of the time they will report the fic to the mods.

This sort of rule is also on Wattpad and I think FFN implemented this policy as well.

The original author is able to do the takedown order and is able to then present further evidence that they are victims of plagiarism when the mods reach out to them. However, this is bad news for fanfic authors that are no longer active on their platforms. On Wattpad there is a plagiarist that uses this fact to their advantage and will post fanfic from these inactive writers because they know that the site won't do anything.

Mind you, Wattpad is notoriously bad for even doing anything when the writers themselves reach out to get the plagiarised copies of their work removed. One writer found out her story was plagiarised back in 2018 and the story is still posted there under the plagiarist's account who bailed the moment they found out that the original author was on the warpath.

Firstly BadWolfe placed a clear disclaimer on the front owning up to this not being their own work and crediting the actual author. Secondly, the original story seemed to be on fanfiction.net only and not on AO3, so it is not directly competing with the author's account, but making it available on a different site in addition. Finally, going by the update date, the original seems to be dead, unless you happen to know if The Santi is active behind the scenes. This is more morally dubious, but I feel that there is a general principle on the internet as a whole that if you have clearly abandoned a project then it is fine for someone else to volunteer to maintain it in your place. Also I feel that proactively getting permission from the original owner can be an unreasonable requirement if it may be impossible to actually contact them if they are no longer involved in the community.

***** The vast vast majority of cross-posted fics would never be reported because it would be apparent that they are cross-posted by the original author. This is how the fandom worked for years without any problems at all before AO3 came along.

Edit: just realised this entire discussion (including all the exchanges below) was a pointless tangent. We're talking about removal of copied works that give credit to the original author. The very act of giving credit unambiguously signals that the poster is not the author and therefore doesn't have the right to post it. So there is no practical problem with identifying which fics to remove.

The practical issues you are talking about only really come up with people taking other people's fics /without/ giving credit. But even the posters in this thread who support taking other people's works without permission seem to hold the view that sites should remove those works that do not give credit.

My position is not "authors must interact with readers to prove who they are". That was simply an example of one possible factor amidst the host of factors within the factual matrix that a decision maker would take into account when making their decision.

There is no need to set out a kind of recipe for how to prove you are an author when a human will be making a judgement with a view to all the circumstances in accordance with their common sense. Particularly where those circumstances include messages exchanged with the user in question, who (in the rare event that the account is in fact genuine and not a plagiarist) can respond to concerns with perfectly reasonable, common sense explanations such as "yes, that account is mine, here, look, I just edited the profile to say that the two accounts are the same person".

In fact, reddit and imgur would probably die off if people couldn't upload content they found elsewhere.

** /Reproducing the content of the post here as the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] mods are apparently very protective of AO3.../

There is a story in the Harry Potter fandom called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], written by The Santi. With 12,000 favourites, it's pretty well known.

The Santi was also a member of the DarkLordPotter forums (DLP). Those forums have a private subforum called "Work by Author" (or "WBA") where authors can share their draft works with beta readers for comments and revisions prior to public publication.

In addition to the 12 chapters which The Santi published publicly on FF.Net, there were an additional [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/harry-potter-and-the-boy-who-lived.17021/][6 chapters]] posted in draft, incomplete form in the private WBA subforum on DLP.

An unscrupulous individual going by the nick "BadWolfe" has [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21393430/chapters/50965216][reposted]] The Santi's fic on AO3. Worse, they have taken the private, draft chapters from DLP and published them publicly, even though The Santi intended to make further revisions to them before posting and had deliberately not added them to the publicly-accessible FF.Net version of the story.

A number of people reported this plagiarism to AO3. This is their response:

[[https://i.imgur.com/8os97FQ.png]]

The key section:

#+begin_quote
  In order to investigate a claim of unauthorized reposting, we require at least two of the following: proof that the user did not ask for or receive permission, proof that the original creator has previously stated that they do not give permission for anyone to reproduce or redistribute their work, and an accessible link to, or copy of, the original source.
#+end_quote

This is a horrible and frankly immoral policy which cannot possibly be justified. AO3 apparently operates on an assumption that all authors /consent/ to the plagiarism of their work unless they have explicitly said "no".

That's not how consent works.

Where someone has posted another person's work, the obvious assumption must be that (i) it is not their work, so they have no right to post it, and (ii) they do not have permission unless they can show that permission was obtained. In cases of apparent plagiarism, deletion must be the default, with the plagiarist only getting a reprieve if they can show that the original author consented.

The idea that it is the responsibility of the reporting party to prove a negative - prove that permission was not given - is absurd. Lack of permission for other people to take your work is implied. It is especially implied when you have only ever posted that work to a private, members-only forum inaccessible to the public.

AO3's policy in this area is completely shameful.

*** I agree. This isn't 2012, and fanfiction, particularly more prominent fanfic like this, is real property. DLP is one thing because though its member-locked anyone can sign up for an account so its still in another sense 'public,' but that's only the smallest of problems that can result from this sort of policy.

Imagine for a moment you are an author who is literally paying the bills by offering early access to chapters that will later be publicly posted. This is a classic way to build revenue for yourself by leveraging your fanfiction writing.

By stealing that work ahead of time, such a poster is devaluing the product offered by the writer, and potentially depriving them of revenue. And that's /if/ they credit the original author, which they may not actually do, Ao3's policy doesn't seem to preclude it.

And sure, you might say that this is (ethically) no different from pirating an anime, but I think that loses sight of the fact that:

- the 'victim' here would an independent author who's making very little (or potentially no) money here, not some mega-corp that will actually benefit from 'the exposure.'
- The IP is only being gated for a week or two at most
- Ao3 isn't a piracy site.

and I'm sure this is where tons of people will jump in to tell me that transformative writers don't deserve to get paid because they're stealing IP themselves which.... gosh, I really just don't have time for that argument. Writing transformative fanfiction of someone else's IP is not the same thing as literally conducting espionage to steal and redistribute someone's work /without their consent/ .

But if I've lost you because I'm talking about piracy and copyright and all that shit, consider this alternate thought: What if the author decided that they /never wanted/ that beta chapter to be published? Not now, not ever. What if they included a thoughtless line that promoted rape culture, or had a character make a comment that came across as racist or sexist in a way they didn't like? What if they used a word without realizing it was a slur? (See: any american trying to write about european traveling communities) In a private beta forum like DLP, people understand that its beta work and will be gentle about offering correction. It's entirely conceivable that an author might decide to scrap a project entirely, realizing that the premise itself is unworkable.

But if someone circumvents that process, steals the work, posts it without permission and then credits that author /without their consent/ that author will forever have their tag associated with things that they did not want to be associated with. Authors should have a right to publish their works when they want, and to have their works /not be published when they do not want./ This is super basic stuff.

Gosh, I could list examples, but I fear that would just get me too much in the weeds. Suffice to say that 'giving credit' does not allow you to steal someone's work. Good Grief.

2. You: Taking someone else's work with credit and without credit should be treated differently because the law treats them differently.

3. Me: Actually the law treats them the same.

4. You: They should be treated differently because they are enforced differently.

5. Me: They are enforced the same at law.

6. You: They are enforced differently by AO3.

So it now seems like you have completely abandoned your argument that taking someone's work with and without credit should be treated differently because they are legally different.

Instead, your position now appears to be that they should be treated differently because AO3 treats them differently.

In short, you are justifying AO3's policy with the argument "it's AO3's policy".

Responding to a "should" with an "is" fails as an argument, however. The question is: what /should/ AO3's policy be? And it seems you've run out of arguments for why AO3 should treat two forms of taking someone else's work differently, with one requiring the author to complain but the other AO3 enforcing of its own volition.

The very fact that AO3 (and universities) are perfectly capable of practically enforcing a self-policing policy against taking other people's work /without credit/ shows that it's perfectly possible to enact a self-policing policy against taking other people's work /with credit/. The only difference between the two in practical terms is if the work contains an extra sentence "By the way this isn't mine."

Indeed, arguably it's significantly easier to practically enforce a rule against taking other people's work with credit, because by giving credit, the work will always flag up that the person posting it doesn't have the right to do so, by their own admission.

*********** Ao3 is perfectly fine to treat two different things differently. As I posted, there is a difference between plagiarism and copyright violation. No matter how long you ignore that, it doesn't change that there is a difference.

One of them can be handled without proving that you're speaking for the original author. Because, as I keep saying, you need the authorisation of the original author to go against reposting because only they can decide that something should be taken down. That's their decision, not anyone else's.

That you don't want to accept that, that you want Ao3 to let anyone enforce copyright, without proving that they are speaking for the author in question, doesn't make that stance OK, right or sensible.

Could Ao3 allow anyone to take down a repsoted work? They could. Would it be a good idea? Absolutely not.

I don't exactly understand why you are so obsessed with taking down a reposted work without the consent of the author of the work. If an author cannot be bothered to act, then why should someone else have the power to act for them without any authorisation given? That's nonsensical.

And yes, "by the way, this isn't mine, it's X's work" is the only difference - and it makes all the difference. That you don't seem to understand that is very, very weird.

Now, why do you think you should be able to speak for an author without having proof that you are authorised to do so? Why do you feel you should have the right to represent someone without them authorising you to do so? When you can't even contact the author?

That's not how things work. Why should that be how things work here? As long as credit is given, it's not plagiarism, and if it's just reposting, it's none of your business at all, but just the author's.

************ This is a completely unnatural and wrong-headed position.

The starting point is that no author consents to unauthorised copies of their works being posted - with or without credit. This is a simple extension of two basic, general moral principles:

1. People are assumed not to consent to wrongdoing against them.

2. Consent must be given and cannot be assumed.

The simple truth of these basic principles can be demonstrated by considering other forms of wrongdoing. Should you assume that people consent to assault, or should you intervene to protect them on the assumption they don't consent? Should you assume that people consent to being defrauded, or should you intervene to prevent dishonest business practices?

As a general moral rule, you assume that people do not consent to having their rights encroached upon, and you are justified in intervening without explicit authorisation.

It is completely arbitrary to say, as you do, that:

1. We assume authors do not consent to people taking their works without credit;

2. We assume authors do consent to people taking their works with credit.

What possible basis is there for treating the two as complete opposites? There is none - neither rational, nor moral.

Your arguments fail to disclose any real basis for this distinction.

You rely on the idea that only copyright holders can enforce copyright. This is a bad argument on many levels.

- Firstly, we're not talking about enforcement of copyright, we're talking about the AO3 terms of service, the rules of the community that AO3 choose to implement. As stated elsewhere, those rules can be anything they want, but to be good rules they should reflect good moral standards.

- Secondly, even if it was a good argument, it would equally apply to the takedown of copied works which do not give credit. At law, to oblige someone to take down a work which is copied without credit, the action would have to be brought in the name of the copyright holder. The only reason why universities and websites take down copied works without credit is because they voluntarily self police. And they are perfectly capable of equally self-policing the copying of works with credit.

Then you rely on the idea that people must not act to protect an author's rights unless that author has explicitly given them permission to do so or commenced the process themselves.

But again, this displays an inconsistency in your position. Because if people protecting the rights of authors could only do so with the author's explicit authorisation, then websites also could not take down copied works without credit unless the author kicked up a fuss. And yet by your own admission they rightly do not require an author's explicit permission to do so. There is in fact no general moral or rational principle that sites must not act to protect people's rights unless the victim themselves initiates a complaint.

Finally, you state that an author's absence justifies the idea that no one should protect them. This is clearly a morally bankrupt principle. If I had something in a deposit box and someone took it, but because I didn't check the deposit box I didn't realise it was taken so didn't kick up a fuss, would that render the theft morally acceptable? Of course not.

"Someone has to kick up a fuss first before immoral act becomes immoral" is an indefensible moral standpoint. The fact that the author isn't around to complain doesn't mean it's okay to take their work.

Finally, you query why I care so much. This should be obvious:

1. I am an author so I care about other authors having their work taken, and I care doubly when no one seems to give a shit about the casual wrongdoing playing out in front of them.

2. I am a member of the private community from which the work in question was taken.

3. There are very good reasons for society to create the social construct of protecting the works of creative individuals, because most creators would not create if they could not control the distribution of their creation.

4. Beyond that, there are additional good reasons for insular, close knit, collaborative communities like the fanfic community, of which I am a member, to have common standards of solidarity which hold people to a higher standard than their bare legal obligations. And one of those standards is don't nick other people's shit.

5. As a moral individual, I have an interest in preventing immorality.

************* You really don't get the difference between plagiarism and reposting without authorisation. There is a difference, and it's why those things are treated differently.

Morally, it's not OK to claim you're representing someone without their authorisation. If someone's playing on your neighbour's lawn, you don't get to send them away unless the neighbour told you you could do it. Whether you assume they want their lawn free of others or not doesn't matter: You don't get to assume that you speak for someone. That should be very, very clear. Outside very rare cases, you aren't protecting anyone's right by assuming to speak for them without their authorisation - you are violating their rights.

Also, the idea that reposting a fanfiction story is in any way, shape or form equal to stealing is ridiculous. You can't make money off fanfiction, so there's no monetary interest. That means, it's not obvious, nor can you assume so, that an author is opposed to their work being spread as long as they are credited.

Really, your case is a very, very rare situation. The arrogance to assume everyone has to follow your views is striking - as if you speak for every author, and as if every author would be fine with people speaking for them without being asked. Not everyone minds a repost as long as they are being credited.

So, no, the idea that Ao3 should change their rules and allow everyone to take down reposts without checking with the original author is wrong and stupid. Ao3 shouldn't cater to a very small group and screw over everyone else.

And, again: the idea that you can just act in someone's name without authorisation is not moral nor common sense. It's actually barely better than taking someone's work without asking and reposting it.

Plagiarism is indeed copyright infringement. An aspect of copyright is what is called the author's "moral rights". That is the author's right to be recognised as the author. If you look inside any book you will see a statement that the author's moral rights are reserved. When an author sells a work to a publisher, what they are doing is splitting out the copyright so that the publisher gets the commercial rights and the author keeps the moral rights.

Both commercial rights and moral rights can be enforced by civil suit.

There are two reasons you can plagiarise Shakespeare to your heart's content. Firstly, the work has entered the public domain so there is no commercial rights remaining to be enforced. Secondly, the author is no longer alive to enforce their moral rights.

Eh, if the moral rights were still enforceable Shakespeare's estate (assuming that you could trace it) would be able to enforce it. But they are not, because moral rights (at least in some jurisdictions) expire. So in the UK, Shakespeare's hypothetical estate has neither economic nor moral rights over Shakespeare's expired copyright, and yet copying his work without proper attribution is /still plagiarism/.

***** But they don't know what the author has stated. If I wanted to repost a fic, I'd do it as follows: I'd PM or email the author for permission, and if I got it, I'd go ahead and repost. But the permission would most likely be made in private.

The presumption of innocence then dictates that it should be assumed that I did contact the author and got permission before reposting, unless there's some evidence to the contrary.

** I don't know what was said as the post has been removed, but I feel that the mods on AO3 take plagiarism more seriously than the mods on Wattpad. Speaking as somebody who had to deal with plagiarism on both these platforms, the mods on AO3 looked at my evidence and removed my stories while Wattpad allowed my stories to be under somebody else's name for months until they finally deleted them.

And I know so many other authors that have complained years ago that their fics have been reposted without their permission, and they are still up on the site where commenters on the plagiarised story go on witch hunts against those that accuse the plagiarist and the actual authors of the fic.

*** Varies by author. In the case of Harry Potter, JKR has given blanket permission for people to write fanfic, with the exception of sexual content, which she asked people not to write (and actually commenced legal action to shut down RestrictedSection.org to get rid of it). But most people seem to ignore that caveat and JKR hasn't sued anyone over HP since she sued HP Lexicon.

OP, I wasn't able to contact you via PM. Just so you know, the post was taken down at the FanFiction subreddit. My guess is that a revised version might be reinstated. Check the moderator reply for details.

There's also a subreddit dedicated to AO3 (which is [[/r/AO3][r/AO3]] ) if you want to crosspost this there in some form.

*** I think the worst part of it is just how impractical the policy is.

E.g. the demand for a publicly accessible link to the original work. The whole point is that the original work was posted to a private, members-only forum which is not publicly accessible. Or the demand to prove that the plagiarist didn't ask for permission. How is the reporting party supposed to have access to the plagiarist's messages?

It's basically the creation of criteria with the deliberate aim of making plagiarism complaints impossible to sustain.

**** Uh. Here's the rule for Plagiarism on Ao3:

#+begin_quote
  E. Plagiarism Plagiarism is an often-contested and fuzzy concept, and no definition will satisfy everyone. Our aim is to be transparent and fair in resolving disputes.

  Plagiarism is the use of someone else's words or concepts without properly attributing those words or concepts to their original source. Simply finding and replacing names, substituting synonyms, or rearranging a few words is not enough to make the work original to you. Deliberately writing a work using the same general idea as another work is not plagiarism, but citation is always appreciated. Generally, quotes from the source material (canon) on which the Content is based will not constitute plagiarism, nor will obvious allusions ("Use the Force, Luke!"). However, when in doubt, cite. Be aware that the Policy & Abuse team may decide that your citation is not sufficient to render the work your own; a mere nod to another author whose work you are presenting as your own may result in a judgment of plagiarism.

  Plagiarism is a violation of the ToS and will incur the penalties described in the Abuse Policy. As with all Content that violates the ToS, plagiarized Content must be removed. Depending on the type and amount of plagiarized Content, this might entail removing an entire piece of Content, removing only the plagiarized portions from a longer work while leaving the original material, or adding citations.

  If you believe a fanwork posted on the Archive plagiarizes another work, please report the work to the Policy & Abuse team. In order to allow us to investigate, please provide a link to the work on the Archive, relevant excerpts, and a specific citation of the original material (for example, a URL or a book edition and page number).

What you are complaining about isn't plagiarism.

****** Sorry, but wholesale copying and pasting of someone else's work without claiming to be the author isn't plagiarism. That's pretty basic stuff here, champ.

Or do you think music piracy is plagiarism? That someone posting a copy of a Tayor Swift album is a plagiarist? Certainly not.

It's the same with reposting. Unauthorised reposting isn't plagiarism unless the poster claims to be the author.

Please check the definition of plagiarism.

******** The point is that just giving anyone leave to have a work taken down as an unauthorised repost is incredibly open to abuse. Plagiarism you can prove with links to the original work. Unauthorised reposting? If you don't require proof that the author is behind the demand, you force authors to defend their work from every jerk that reports them - or, worse, have to contact Ao3 to get their work restored. That's especially bothersome if, which isn't uncommon, authors use different nicknames on different sites.

And I said before: In this case, the fact that they were posted on a semi-private forum might be enough to get the stuff taken down. But blanket permission without any, much less solid, evidence that the author wants something taken down? That's how plagiarism is handled, correctly, but would be incredibly dangerous to extend to reposting.

********** No, I am saying scrutiny and standards /should/ be applied. Just going by "oh, yeah, you claim this is an unauthorised repost, let's take it down without checking if you're representing the author" would be sloppy and wrong.

Because ultimately, whether or not something is an unauthorised repost and should be taken down is the author's decision - not anyone else's. Certainly not the decision of someone who can't even be bothered to prove that they are representing the author.

Whether or not that's the case in this case depends on details I'm not privy to and would be up to debate in any case.
