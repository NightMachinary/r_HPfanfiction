I had the fic open in a tab that has since disappeared and it isn't in my history anymore. I don't even know how good/bad it is because I'd only read some of the beginning.

Remus had left some recording spell on a book that he returned to Dumbledore. And they realized he had plans to put Harry's name in the goblet. So the three of them (Sirius, Remus, Harry) made a plan for what Harry would do if it happened. He ended up snapping his wand and maybe Dobby helped him get out of the Great Hall? I think it was tagged with Harry/Hermione.
