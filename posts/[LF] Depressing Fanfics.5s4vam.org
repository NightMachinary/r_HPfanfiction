There are some fanfics which are just so emotionally charged, that they can get you down. I am in the mood for some of these, so if you guys have any which pop up, I would be grateful. I have read quite a lot of the better works of fiction, but by no means all of it. 40k+ and no slash is preferred, albeit not required.

I am talking Too Young to Die, and some parts of the Saving Conner series, in terms of depressing content. Like, legitimately Self-Destructive practices, either with addictions to dark magic, or something similar. I would like to try to avoid angst, as well as the typical Harry is abused, must cuddle with Snape/Malfoy/Voldemort.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2470334/1/The_Birthday_Present]]

Snape-centric. Not slash. It was written before HBP and DH came out. Everyone in it is a complex character and people can have downsides without being bashed. It has a really good Dumbledore and Voldemort, and does show Snape under tension between the two of them. Also, it has a Voldemort who you can understand why people would serve.

Also. Relentlessly miserable.

It's a James/Rose deconstruction - meaning real world consequences apply and shit hits the fan all around. And the fan keeps spinning. Until everything is shitty.

  Love between cousins isn't globally accepted, some people think it's immoral and in some places it's considered illegal. And what happens when this love brings to something else? A baby is growing in a girl's belly and the emotional consequences will be devastating.

** linkffn(the yellow submarine) is extremely depressing/horrifying especially in the beginning/middle. Things make a turn for the better in later chapters.

Edit: Okay that was mega wrong. ffnbot!delete

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
