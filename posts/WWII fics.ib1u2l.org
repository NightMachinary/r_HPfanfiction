Fics where Voldemort ended up in a concentration camp or was twisted by the events he lived through - seeing how ugly people are. Or fics where Harry went back in time or understood what happened based off Voldemort's flashbacks?

I read a oneshot once where Voldemort had a "tattoo" - a number - after suffering in Auschwitz, which is what really made him hate muggles the most.

I'd love the name of this fic or any like it? Including crossovers!


** There's a crossover with Captain America, where Tom Riddle gets dragged into the war. Would that qualify?

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
