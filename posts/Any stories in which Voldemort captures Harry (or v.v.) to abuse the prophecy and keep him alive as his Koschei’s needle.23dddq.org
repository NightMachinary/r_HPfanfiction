Trelawney's 1st prophecy ends with “either must die at the hand of the other”, so I reckoned Voldemort could use a sealed-in-a-box Harry as another bumper between himself and his death.

Are there any stories in which any of the two use such a mechanism to indefinitely benefit from the prophecy and protect themselves from death?
