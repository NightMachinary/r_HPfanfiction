I remember that harry was in the orphanage and was really Tom riddle like in the beginning, but a little girl arrives at the orphanage and he finds out that she has magic and becomes her big brother. He can already use magic and the head master if a 4th secret school founded by Merlin and Morgana called something like nocturnus or nocturnal, they use wands and instruments, harry becomes the prince of the school. I remember that they participate in the tri wizard tournament and their entrance is to the song 'secret'
