Prefer drarry or tomarry (noT voldemort/Harry preferably)

Not famous ones please- no fics by saras_girl or lomonaaeren or the such.

Also during hogwarts years, not post/pre hogwarts

Thanks!

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did â€˜gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*

  "The stars incline us, they do not bind us." For Harry, it's something he learned long ago on the battlefield. But for his son, James, it will be a painful lesson in the form of a friendship with a boy named Scorpius Malfoy.
