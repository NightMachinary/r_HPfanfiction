  Harry never put his name in the cup. No one would believe him, so he leaves Hogwarts searching for a way to fight the wizarding contract, using the thing that holds him to it; the law.

  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon.

** I'll be honest, while I like this notion, I really don't like fics where Harry just nopes out of the Tournament. It isn't in his character, and 99.99% of those fics are Angsty/Indy Harry which turn out to be just crap. Five minutes later it'll be all "You have to call me Lord Harry" and "I removed all your blocks from my magic now I am uber powerful".

Now what would be nice is if Harry turns to a responsible adult in his life (Sirius) and they raise hell / keep Harry out of it. Even if Sirius can't get involved directly, guiding Harry to say, a lawyer or something.

Someone else linked Banking on Her, which is nice, but you know Hermione being the responsible one gets kinda old (and I like H/Hr fics). I recall it being good.

Edit: Banking on Her actually falls into "Harry acting way out of character", with Hermione simply following. The Lawyers Against the Cup has a much more Canon Harry, one of the best I've seen for this prompt.

**** Eh, I doubt that last part, as Harry is set up as 'real life is shit, escape into the magical world'. If anything Harry always wants to pull more into the magical world than out of it.

However, I do agree that it would be within Harry's character to be stubborn and fight a magical contract. He is set up as a stubborn character with a strong sense of right and wrong. And he has no problem subverting authority.

However, Harry really isn't an initiator of such things. Likely due to his role as a reader avatar. He isn't the one starting house elf liberation efforts, doing independent study, starting prank wars, or deciding there is a 'good fight' to fight. Canon Harry always takes his cues from Dumbledore, Hermione, or Ron. He then runs with it and sees it to conclusion.

Thus why I said it would be interesting to have a responsible adult (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Sirius, Random Lawyer) break down the issue for him. And then I can easily see Harry stubbornly sticking to the path of resistance...

OP didn't ask for Angsty/Indy Harry fics, if he did, I would have just ignored the thread instead of commenting. I think this is a fascinating notion to explore, particularly if authors find a way to work around the fact that Harry is a bit of a pushover and isn't one to just nope out by himself without support (such as the linked fics "Lawyers against the Cup" and "Banking on Her" do).
