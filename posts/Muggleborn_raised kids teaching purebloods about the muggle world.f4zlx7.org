Preferrably funny or mildly amusing nothing too dark please I'm in the mood for light hearted fics.

Don't care about the characters involved too much I would prefer if Malfoy was the pureblood but it could also be Harry and/or Hermione teaching Ron, or Justin Flinch fetchley teaching Ernie Macmillian. I'm not overly bothered.

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.
