** I would say Control by Anonymous and also I can't remember the fics name but I read a guilty pleasure fic a few weeks ago about a Harry who had a true boy who lived sibling with his parents still alive and a younger sister. The sister was killed in an accident so Harry becomes a necromancer to revive her and it was very blatant how much he spiraled. He manages to rezz her by like 4th year and then the fic ends.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Antithesis has been my favorite in that general realm. It's got a lot of the really terrible tropes in it, but still manages to be one of my favorites.

Broken Chains would be my second pick, heavy crossover with Star Wars and Stargate, but I couldn't get through the sequel.

That's the only one I've read. It's one chapter per book, so one for the first book, two for the second and so one. Only downside is it doesn't look like it was completed. No edits since 2014 and they left it at book six part 5.
