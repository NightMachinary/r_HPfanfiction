  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** Evil Hermione isn't just evil because she always was evil. Her past aswell as the present shaped her to who she is today. Evil Hermione is a culmination of many things but I think even the writer says that they didn't make her evil to bash her at all and I would have to agree there isn't any bashing. She is not on Harry's side. I guess I would call her an antagonist to Harry. I love Hermione's character so I was afraid going in but I'm glad I did.

  “Are you afraid of me, Harry?” His mouth opened, but no words came. His mind blanked, his cheeks draining completely of whatever color had stained them in response to the curious note of Riddle's voice. It sounded innocuous enough. Harmless with how casual she'd asked the question, but Harry knew better.
