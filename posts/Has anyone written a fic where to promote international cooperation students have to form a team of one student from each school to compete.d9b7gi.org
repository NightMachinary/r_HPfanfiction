**** It's not as if most het fics are replete with tasteful lovemaking. Most smut is bad because it's being written by young people who don't know much about sex that they haven't gotten from the internet. I've read far more palatable sex written by slash writers than het writers, even het sex, because in my experience quality slash writers are far more likely to disregard societal expectations of what gender roles are supposed to be when it comes to social interactions, of which romance is one, in favour of letting the character's personality shine through. Copperbadge is primarily a slash writer, and his het ship writing in both HP and other fandoms is brilliant. He's written the best Remus/Tonks I've ever read, the only Remus/Tonks where they don't come of as either dysfunctional or OOC.

***** I myself view most romance as diminishing the plot.

I honestly don't care what the pairing is if there's a good plot.

I'll tend to stay far away from fics that change huge parts of a character's personality without cause.

** I've been plotting up one were there are "foreign" exchange students that get traded off between all of the magical schools after the war... It's probably going to be Slash and rely heavily on a MC and a few of the HP characters...haven't much of anything but a few scenes in my head at the moment.
