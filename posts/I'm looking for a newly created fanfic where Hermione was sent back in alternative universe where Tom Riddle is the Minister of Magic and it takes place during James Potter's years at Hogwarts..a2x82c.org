When I was last reading this story, only three stories were written so far and I was really hooked on it, but I forgot the name of it and can't find it anywhere on fanfiction and I'm too lazy to continuing looking for it. It was a newer one too.

In the story, Hermione is sent into the past in an alternative universe where Tom Riddle is Minster of Magic and muggleborns are not allowed at Hogwarts or the wizarding world and if any half-bloods are caught, they will be sent to Azkaban where they will be killed immediately. And Hermione is trying to finish her seventh year at Hogwarts as a transfer (but this Hogwarts doesn't usually transfer students) and she is trying to disguise her true background and is trying to save the future and prevent herself from being taken away by the Ministry.
