** Why would one, though? Isn't the whole point to have an external soul container in the event of death? Why split one's soul and keep the fragment in one's body? Unless I misunderstand the question?

** If it made a living body indestructible, then probably it would be a good idea (split your soul and move that piece to your leg or something).

If it doesn't make a living body indestructible, then your basically guaranteeing that your horcrux gets destroyed when someone goes to kill you.

In my opinion, the best way to go about immortality through horcruxes is to 1) make it something ordinary such as a knut or a scarf or something 2) extract an unbreakable vow from a loyal minion to a) never tell anyone AND b) to resurrect you if you are ever killed....

.....not that I've thought about it a bunch or anything

Get a diamond, turn into a horcrux, go to a muggle construction site and push it halfway down into the concrete. This was the 50s/60s, construction was happening EVERYWHERE. Pick a building of importance, like a government building or a hospital. Or prison.

******* I would say Cursebreakers. They deal with all sorts of crazy stuff in Egypt. And Gringotts itself most likely has a way to destroy, cleanse, or de-possess people with them. It is cheaper to heal an employee than it is to hire and retrain a new one. That, and the item used might be worth money. It's good business.

***** The sea is the worst place you could use. Currents could move it about, and hell, it might even get swept into an undersea volcanic vent. Poof, no more horcrux. Then there's the fact that you might even want to destroy, reabsorb it, or use it for something else.

Seriously, forever means forever. The vast majority of people would be bored after a couple hundred years.

Unlikely since they are hot and hot stuff generally moves upwards. Hell, chuck the thing in a quarry lake and it will never be found without the unlikely volcano danger.

*** The question is really "where in the body does the soul reside?" If the soul resides in a specific part of the body like the heart or brain, then it may be possible to shift a piece to another body part. But if the soul permeates the whole body then turning one's body Into a horcrux would just result in the merging of the soul fragments.

On one hand, Harry's scar was specifically the actual horcrux, implying that the soul can be kept in a singular body part. On the other, simply removing the scar clearly wouldn't be enough to remove the horcrux since Harry specifically had to die, implying that Voldemort's soul was intertwined with Harry's closely enough that killing it required Harry's death too. Harry's scar means either souls take up the whole body or are stored in the head, so make of that what you will

*** In canon, the book discussing Horcruxes provided a list of enchantments to use on the object after it has been turned into a Horcrux in order to make it more durable

This implies that it's not just the Horcrux that gives the incredible durability, but a series of additional magic.

Whether those same enchantments can be applied to a living Horcrux is unknown

Was Nagini more durable than normal? Voldemort saw fit to create that protective orb around her so I'm leaning towards no
