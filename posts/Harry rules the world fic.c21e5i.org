:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry creates an Empire and rules over it. He was married to Daphne primarily but also Ginny and Gabrielle. He created a muggle born program where if a child was magically they where taken in the wizarding world and the first one was Dudley's kid. He gained control by putting the Queen under the Imperius and having her name him King of England, then he killed the electricity, oil production and economy. Eventually Hermione tries to kill him with her son, but ends up killing James since Harry is the Master of Death.
