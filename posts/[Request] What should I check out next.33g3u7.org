What the title says. My first foray into HP fan fiction was HPMOR and I recently finished /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/. I haven't enjoyed a story like that since /The Martian/. Are there any that fun (doesn't have to be Harry Potter)? What HP fanfic are must reads?

edit: Thank you all. /Alexandra Quick/. After /Worm./


** First off, go check out the web serial [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] by Wildbow. Its something that I'm recommending to absolutely everybody these days, and I know that EY (author of HPMoR) is a fan as well. Its not 'rationalist' but its the most intelligently constructed superhero universe I've ever encountered.

#+begin_quote
  An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the local â€˜cape' scene's politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.
#+end_quote

Another singularly unique and amazing fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and The Art of Beig Sisyphus]] by The Carnivorous Muffin. Its hard to describe this one, but its a must read.

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.
#+end_quote

Another classic (IMHO) in the same vein of HPMoR is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by Vera Rozalsky Again, not a 'rationalist' fic but a very intelligent examination of Wizarding society in the aftermath of the war.

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
#+end_quote

I also can't pass up an opportunity to recommend my personal favorite work of 'fanfiction', the Alexandra Quick Series by Inverarity, which starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]]. Just an amazing work of world-building, populated entirely by fascinating original characters and tied together by Inverarity's writing style, which I can only describe as 'Rowlingesque".

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes is one of the funniest fics that I've ever read.

#+begin_quote
  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

To be honest though, I've never been too big into humor when it comes to fanfiction, so I would suggest looking up other humor request threads on this sub.

**** Worm is the sort of story that you REALLY don't want to start on finals week. If I remember correctly, it's nearly 1,750,000 words - or a bit more than 4,000 pages.

It is also utterly fantastic, and I cannot recommend it enough. Worm is the only superpowers universe I've seen that tries to show the societal changes (gangs being much more powerful, new government agencies, merchandising, etc) that would result from large numbers of people gaining superpowers. (I think Worm has 'parahumans' at about 1/10,000^{th} of the population, so 5,000,000 worldwide - more than enough to truly upset some power balances)

That, and [[/s][major ending spoiler]] is easily my favorite source for superpowers.

** I just finished a Harry Potter/Calvin and Hobbes crossover that was fantastic! True to Calvin's character and pretty much canon compliant. Witty, imaginative and very original.

** /Must Reads:/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year. They're truly in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made the pairing it involves one of my OTPs. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/19/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a stellar piece of work. It's quite emotionally intense, and can occasionally get pretty angsty, but I would definitely recommend it.
