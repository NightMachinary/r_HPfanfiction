** My main objection to those isn't that they're not very funny, it's that they're not very British. We'd basically never use the word 'dork'. Sounds like something Bart Simpson would use. It's significantly more tame than any joke or nickname most UK teens would use - we'd be more likely to call Dumbledore a 'nonce' than a 'dork'. Dork is too... tame 80s Teen High School Drama for us - similar to 'poindexter' or the like.

(Nonce is UK slang for paedophile, or sometimes other sex crimes).

No comment on whether they're good or bad humour because that's relative, but those nicknames are very much not British humour. Look at the kind of jokes Eggsy from Kingsman makes, or anyone from Skins or Inbetweeners or the like. Those would be far more common.

*** I agree with teenager humor not being the best; it would be okay if it would be used ironically or with the clear intend to show that this is inmature teenager behavior. But the point is, in most fanfics this names are used unironically.

And with Voldemort you have to remember, that we are talking about the person who is alone in the Gryffindor-boys-dorm responsible for: Harry and Neville having no parents, Ron having no uncles on his mother's side and Dean having no longer his biological father. I don't think they would joke about the person who murdered their families with cringe nicknames.

So outside of some very rare exceptions (like Peeves using them) this cringe nicknames are absolut not fitting and bad writing even if we talk about teenagers.

** About the only nickname that I like is 'the dark tosser', because that actually sounds like something I would say, having also been raised in the south east like Harry was.

As others have mentioned, a lot of the nicknames that I've seen feel too Americanised, particularly for mid 90's UK. We don't/didn't use the term 'dork', and shorts are outerwear here, not underwear, so moldyshorts has also never resonated with me like it might with non-English readers.

There are others that make sense, but the issue with those is the persistent usage of them, to the point where the original names are seldom actually used. If it gets that bad then actually reading the fic often becomes hard to do unless the story is /really/ compelling.

****** Well I can imagine Ron acting like he sometimes does with Hermione. For example how he'll affectionately call her Barmy for wanting to go to the library all of a sudden.

I think its partly cause Ron's grown up around magic and would kind of see them like a kindred spirit of his dad (someone totally fascinated by muggles but for them it would be the other way around) but also as someone who's not really studious is like "....why do you want to study more?" And finds it weird. .... but also would remind him of his brothers

I mean if you look at his brothers I could see Bill studying obscure stuff "cause it's cool", percy for his future career I guess and charlie..... well dragons.

**** If I'm being honest, it's been 20 years for me since I was last in secondary school, so I don't really remember much, I was also seldom the target of affectionate name calling, so there is that factor too. So I honestly don't even really remember what sort of terms for a nerd were used, affectionate or otherwise.

These days American media as well as social media in general means that UK kids probably have a similar lexicon than American ones do with a few Britishisms sprinkled in for variety.

most insults people come up with to be disrespectful and show disdain in real life aren't very elegant either, and are generally made up on the fly

So Prongslet has never bothered me since Harry is the sole Prongslet and it sounds better than Prongapawn or Prongsling.
