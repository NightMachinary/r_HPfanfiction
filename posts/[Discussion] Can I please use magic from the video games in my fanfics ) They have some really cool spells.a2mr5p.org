Yes please see the title! Like Carpe Retractum is a grappling hook made out of energy, and then there is Spongify which makes things into trampolines and you can jump super high on them! :) And then there are alternate spell uses like Lumos being able to shine away magical illusions and stuff. Also LAPIFORS can turn stuff into a bunny and you can control the bunny with your magic! :) Glacius can make like giant ice AOE and slides and stuff, and Depulso is powerful enough to send like 500 pound giant staircase pieces sliding a dozen feet across the floor! Imagine if you cast that on a car and threw a car at someone in a battle? :)

Yes please would anybody be annoyed if I used some of these video game spells and spell applications? I think it makes the magic way more versatile and creative than in the canon books! I mean yes it is MAGIC, why wouldn't spells have multiple uses? :) Also they should be more creative like magic grappling hook!

** Everyone who's written long enough will end up making up their own spells; borrowing them from a video-game universe instead is functionally the same thing from a reader's point of view. As long as the spell seems like it /can/ fit in with the canonical magic, there's no problem. So go for it!

*** Please do not be mean. I have reported your post. Thank you. Also I do not tap into my "inner 9 year old cousin" I am tapping into my excitement and passion for fanfiction, writing and reading, and Harry Potter series that I love. I am sorry not everyone on this website is full of cynicism and pessimism and hatred. Yes, not everyone here is as miserable as you are in life, and they don't feel the need to spread that misery to others because they can't stand seeing other people happy and passionate about their life.

**** interactions on the internet are difficult because we can't see each other's faces and expressions. when someone behaves (or writes) significantly differently to the average reddit poster, it is conspicuous. that's why you gotta ask questions sometimes. Self expression is great and all, but we sacrifice some individuality to participate in a shared consensus reality. If you don't recognize the difference between the average (dare I say: normal) post on this subreddit and your posts, I think you have a problem. If you realize it but do it anyway, great, but then you need to accept that it influences the number and type of interactions you will have.

I don't have a huge amount of experience here on reddit, but from what I've seen, the way you express yourself here in this subreddit is unique. therefore, I think, yugiohgenius's question isn't out of line. it's not impossible, for example, that you are in fact a child. Most people here would probably react to you differently if they found that out. but it's also possible that you're a troll. or just someone with a lot of excitement and passion for fanfiction. maybe english isn't your first language and some of your tone is getting lost in translation. and to be honest, I've wondered whether there's some mental illness at play as well, which is why I've tried tp phrase this post respectfully and I hope you don't feel personally attacked.I'm just trying to give some feedback, because in my opinion, reporting yugiohgenius for the above post is childish behaviour.

  A simple question from Harry during his vault visit in book 1 changes his life, as Harry accesses a family vault. And a stone there that will change his life, even more than finding out he is a wizard did.

** You could easily explain it away in the story as the character just using said material for an idea on how to manipulate their magic. For example Harry finding video games while he wonders Surrey, and having accidental magic manipulated into the only thing that was familiar ie: video game spell mechanics/effects. Idk, just an idea.

**** I guess it really doesn't matter in the long run, who cares what you put in your own works. As long as you don't break the law, or are hurting anyone write whatever you please. That's kind of what fan fic is all about at the end of the day.
