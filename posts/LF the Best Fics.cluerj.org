  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

****** There are those who love it, those who hate it. Personally, I don't like it as much as those who love it hype it so much but its not bad. It is a very different fanfic than others in the fandom.

  Of all things Edward was prepared for as the day of reckoning grew near, being transported from one world on the edge of war to another was not one of them. AKA: Edward gets accidentally summoned by Death Eaters, and neither party is happy. (Pre-Promise Day, HP book 5)

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?
