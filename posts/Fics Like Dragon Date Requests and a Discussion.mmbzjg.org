Okay, I /love/ Dragon Date and the story inspired by it, Draconian Mishap (the latter having an obviously jealous Fleur is goddamn hilarious!): are there any other stories like that out there? Or with another magical creature (I know there's a few with the basilisk?).

Things to tick off, though:

I'm also interested in fics that have Harry as a dragon: I know of the famous "Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay", but to be honest, while it's well-written and a good fluff piece to enjoy, it's kinda dull. There's just no conflict and it's just... plodding along, I guess, on inertia like Taylor Varga in the Worm fandom is.

I also know of the infamous Enter the Dragon, where he's a Shadowrun Dragon of all things, and the story where he's a five-headed chimera-like dragon (with each head representing an emotion), but I forget the name of that one (it was very unique and interesting, though!).

I remember The Queen That Fell To Earth, vaguely, but not specifics? Is it worth a re-read?

Also, there was a pseudo-crossover where Bahamut from Final Fantasy was in Harry's body since the Killing Curse as a child (and helps to move on the poor baby's soul to the afterlife to be with his recently-killed mother and father, James and Lily), and he's determined to regain his "regal" form eventually. I can't remember the name as it was on my phone (note to self, buy a new phone that doesn't have a battery with the shelf-life of a Death-Eater in a shitty Indie-Harry story), but it had a loa called Samedi and the World Serpent Jormungandr at Hogwarts with him. He was also friends with/views as pets a somewhat constantly freaked out tsundere Daphne Greengrass, the rest of the Slytherins, Hermione, and was a Hufflepuff.

Sadly enough, it was only fifteen chapters long (with the initial chapters being so bad with grammar and syntax that it was barely readable) and the author began to import more and more anime-style stuff in the last chapter to keep it going (which is usually a sign of the author not knowing what to do next, like that Harry Potter/Buffy crossover Fallen), and it quickly petered out as expected.

I know these requests/searches would most likely ping a lot in slash stories, but if you do know of some fics, no slash/yaoi please: it's just not my personal preference.

Does anyone have any fics they can share? I don't mind crossovers too, so long as an intimate knowledge of the source material isn't required ('cause, you know, I'd be completely baffled and wondering what the heck was going on half the time, haha).


** linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

It's a fic with a lot more dragons than cannon. Brief summary: During Fifth year, Harry gets sent a dream and rushed to the Room of Requirement to open his side of an interdimensional/world/universe portal. He promptly ends up with a pile of rather desperate dragons at his feet and his life gets more complicated, but in a good way. Features an Albus that really should have listened to his pheonix and torched the Elder Wand, many, many dragons, the main characters gaining power by combining two very different magical traditions, and a Harry/Hermione/+ ship that isn't mentioned much really.

And for your request, Remus Lupin had been on assignment for about 20 chapters in North America searching for a method to bind your animagus form to a sample from a creature. Remus isn't my favorite character really so it was a good way to get rid of him for a while.

If you want a taste of my writing style, check out chapter 19, it's a self-contained origin story for the hallows.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.

*** Sweet, thank you! I've always liked Warcraft's (pre-recent WoW) lore and setting, so seeing a crossover with them is rare.

It's just a shame that Blizzard's writing team must be either drunk, high, or just plain ol' fucking incompetent to do what they've done with Warcraft's overall story.

**** On the plus side their cannon makes a convincing case for why the Titans are evil and need to be destroyed. The whole giving Neltharion a 'blessing' that drives him to madness, a job involving the old gods and zero protection from them, plus the whole 'why aren't there intelligent proto-drakes/dragons' that didn't, at one time, serve the Titans?

In any case, I'm having fun writing it. Got a shovel and some fill dirt on hand for all those plot holes.

***** I like they tried to add depth to the Titans, but I don't like that it was basically because of a villain/power-creep over expansions.

Each expansion needs a new villain more powerful than the last to keep the zombie of a game going.

Hell, their rewriting the lore for the Lich King, just to give this Shadowland shit validity, made me shake my head and lose interest. That, and Windrunner basically becoming a Mary Sue.

****** Biggest thing I don't like about the game is the constant theme of the world getting worse/beauty destroyed/every day darker/fire and death and blood.

Pandaria was nice because most of it was green and lively, and even if things got dark towards the end the evil was beaten and the lands were supposed to heal in time.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.

  There's more to dragons than humans can hope to understand. When Harry meets a beautiful, fiery young woman with horns and scales, he's drawn into a side of the magical world that he'd never imagined. A fluffy, wacky romance, in the form of a series of connected oneshots. Updates as and when I write something new for it.
