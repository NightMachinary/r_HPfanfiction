I love pairing Harry with Sirius and I am writing several fics with that pairing in mind. I have a blurb written with a really sassy Harry who gets summoned into the past (no, he isn't overpowered or an eldritch entity) but now I'm thinking of converting it into a fem!Harry x Sirius pairing. I'm really into that pairing currently and finding a severe lack of those fics.

It got me wondering - how much of the reader base actually enjoys Female Harry? What are your thoughts on this trope?

P.S. Please no hate about pairing Harry with Sirius. I know there is an age difference.


** Nothing against Fem!Harry, I just think that it is rarely taken to new interesting places. Almost every fem!Harry fanfic I read is borderline the same with rare exceptions.

Like... something I would find interesting? A fem!Harry fanfic where she is shipped with Ron. That would be new, at least in my experience, and makes perfect sense, since they have a shit-ton in common, assuming female Harry has the somewhat same personality and likes as canon-Harry.

*** Sadly female harry exists solely to create yuri or to not create yaoi with Draco. I mean, who would want Ronald Weasley when you have Draco Malfoy? One of them would insult your whole family and spit on everything you stand for if it ain't what he likes.

**** I personally prefer fem harry x Cedric but I get your point most of the fanfics make Draco out to be this dashing Darcy figure. When the real Draco was nothing like that.

** Age difference is no problem as long as they begin their relationship when the female Harry is already an adult.

This sub hates pedo relationships and will downvote any such idea into oblivion

I mean, there is a legit good reason for this reaction.

It is literally human nature to want to protect children. To want to see children in relationships with adults goes against everything we as humans stand for.

** I enjoy fem!Harry greatly - when it forms part of a proper story rather than being used as a shipping vehicle.

** I love writing female Harry. I've been a writing female Harry series for the past six months and it's a lot of fun.

Victoria Potter is a good one too.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** I don't think I've read a (Female) Harry where she was the only Harry. I've read a few now where (Male) Harry ends up in an AU already occupied by a female equivalent of himself, but he was always the primary protagonist. So I don't have a strong opinion on Female-Harry as a stand-alone protagonist, I haven't read a story with one yet.
