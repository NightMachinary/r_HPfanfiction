Maybe he teaches Harry to hand out treats laced with veritaserum, cast compulsion charms, brew illegal potions, learn dark magic, and disguise it all as light magic/"the greater good".

Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermione could be set up, but it's a lesson on how to gain loyal followers.

Harry having to fight in the second war is a plan to make him (even more of) a worshipped hero. And also indebt people to him for saving them.

Like the stereotypical manipulative Dumbledore in many indy!Harry fics. I think it would be fun to see them working together.


** It seems interesting... could work fantastically in a comedic setting.
