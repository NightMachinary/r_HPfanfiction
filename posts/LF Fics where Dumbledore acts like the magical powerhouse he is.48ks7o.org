Dumbledore is supposed to be some super powerful wizard. The only one Voldemort feared, defeated Grindelwald and yada yada but I have never found a fic where he actually unleashes his power in battle or any other time. So I'm looking for something where he either acts like the powerhouse he is and/or people remember just what he can do before they confront him (The slander from book 5 comes to mind). Like if I was the editor of the Prophet, I would not be slandering the most powerful wizard alive... who does that.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** There was one I read with a powerful albus who dueled riddle to a stalemate at least twice. I remember the main duel having albus absorbing riddles magic into his cloak and then Launching magic bowling balls back out of the folds in his cloak. Remember it being a good read. Anyone recognize this fight?

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

I should get rid of that image before trying to read because otherwise I'm gonna be disappointed.

** I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy", where he gets to cut loose in combat in the later chapters, as well as to show his vast experience in diplomacy and politics as he tries to keep the Ministry and the Watchers from killing each other instead of Voldemort. He's as powerful in "Patron", but has mostly been doing planning and politics there (His brother got to fight more).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
