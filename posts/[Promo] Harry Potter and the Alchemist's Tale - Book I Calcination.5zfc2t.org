** Gah I can't believe I didn't realise that text based and link based posts were two different things D: apparently I just haven't needed to know the difference for two years...

Anyway, thanks to the support of this subreddit, I decided to bring forward my update schedule and start posting tonight. I hope you enjoy it!
