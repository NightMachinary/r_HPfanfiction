  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** While not the main focus, Fred and George get some amazing moments in Meaning of One by Sovran. There are some glorious and gut busting school-wide pranks that hit Snape and even Dumbledore. And, they are a lot more involved in the main plot than in the original, Fred and George have detention with Harry in the forbidden forest in PS/SS when he encounters Voldemort and the Unicorn.

** Linkfnn(2074348) is pretty good. It does have romance which you may not be looking for but I can't think of any others of the top of my head, sorry.
