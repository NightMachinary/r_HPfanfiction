** Oddly the last time Santi updated on ff.net was the same day he posted that other stuff on DLP. I honestly have no idea why he hasn't posted it there yet.

*** The Santi leaves a cushion of chapters between what's posted for his story outside and what's in the DLP Work by Authors, where chapters in draft form may be commented upon and workshopped by DLP members.

*** They are up to chapter 17 last I checked on DLP. You need to make an account though, but accounts where you can view and not post are quick and easy.

**** I know this is a really, really old thread, but they have appeared to have changed the rules and going from muggle to squib ranking takes a bit of time. Would you be willing to get me a copy of chapters 13-current?
