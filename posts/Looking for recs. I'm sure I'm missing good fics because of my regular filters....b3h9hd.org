So I don't like Draco/Harry, Draco/Hermione, Severus/Harry, or Severus/Hermione and there's so much of it that I usually just filter Draco and Severus out but I'm sure that's caused me to miss some good fics that don't have the ships I don't like but have the two as important characters.

Now I know I can just remove the filters but like I said there's so much of these pairing that manually filtering that is going to take forever. I've also tried AO3 but people don't tag things properly so there are still a bunch of these that get through even with the filters.

So given all that, do you have recs for Harry centric fics that include Draco and/or Severus as import characters but not those pairings?

Oh and no OCs


** Linkffn(Time to Spare by EmySabath) is one of my favourites

Linkao3(World In Pieces by Lomonaaeren) has Harry pulled into another world. Draco was in a relationship with the Harry who was born in that world, but MC Harry is not interested at all and there is no romance.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
