I'm currently writing the first chapter of my first HP fic and I was wondering what the general consensus is on chapter length.

I have just over three thousand words right now and I think I've reached a pretty good cut off point in terms of content. That said, there is room for expansion if the word count is too low.

Thoughts?

*** Seconded. Also 10.000 is a maximum, not something that you should reach on average. I personally try to aim for 5.000 words per chapter.

** 3-4k minimum, and no maximum with the caveat that if you're publishing as you write the chapters should be short enough that you can update frequently. Authors that put out a 30k word chapter every few months are really annoying. After that long of a wait most of your readers will have forgotten what was happening in the story.

** It's a matter of personal choice, but wherever you feel best matches the story and tone. Generally, I shoot for 2500 to 5000 words, but that's just me.

Ending a chapter on a cliffhanger or a bit of intrigue is an effective writing technique for novels, however it should be used less frequently in fanfiction--especially if you don't already have your next chapter queued up and ready to submit within days. (Long waits between chapters with cliffhangers tend to irritate readers.)

Another technique (borrowed from sitcoms) that's often effective is to end a chapter with a bit of humor or the delivery of a great line by one of the characters. It's like signing your name at the bottom of the page with flair.

** When I first started writing, it was a struggle to /fill/ a whole chapter with 5k of words. I didn't have nearly enough descriptions to make each chapter at least 5k words.

Nowadays, I struggle keeping chapters below 10k and have had some headaches reformatting things to keep a better flow of the story.

So, personally, it depends on the type of story. If you're writing a heavy world building epic that diverges from HP canon a lot, I think it's better served to write longer chapters (10k+). It makes for an easier reread and it also helps segregate the fic into "sections."

If you're writing a smaller fic that's more canon-compliant, I think you can get away with 5k-10k words as most readers will be able to follow it handily and will be looking at the character interactions instead of general world building.

** Everyone's just throwing out huge figures like a 1000 word chapter is inherently less powerful than 3k one, its much more subjective than that. The truth is a chapter should be as long as is need to tell the tale and get the information across. Some would need 20,000 words others a 1000, its your /quality/ not your quantity that matters.

** I don't read anything that's less than 3000/chapter. Though that's somewhat hypocritical since my story I recently started has maybe 2,500 word chapters. I think anything over that is a good length. Over 10,000 words/chapter can make it overwhelming for a reader to jump in unless the beginning has a good hook. I think I prefer stories with longer chapters over shorter ones though. It makes them look more professional in my eyes.

** For the first chapter(s), I would say at least 2k, but 3k-10k is even better. Later on, if you have deadlines you want/need to meet, 750+ is fine, though if you update every three days with such short chapters, I get both annoyed by the amount of emails and the small chapters. I would rather have weekly updates of 5k than 750 thrice a week. More than 10k and I might get bored, though from my experience, writing more than 10k is hard.

** Acceptable? Minimum of 5k words, preferred 10k words per chapter. More than that and you have to think how much you really want to "stuff" into one chapter.

** Like most of the people here, I won't read anything below 2k, simply because it's indicative of quality. I prefer about 5k and there's really no maximum, except that I'd prefer the length of a chapter to not affect the publishing schedule for in-progress stories.

** I think the first chapter needs to be shorter than the rest- it's the advertising page, the one that sets up a reader's interest in everything to come. If it takes pages upon pages to get through mundane life before you get to a breakpoint, it's time to pare away the words that don't move the story forward.

As a structural thing, I'd suggest putting action scenes mid-chapter; you have a set up, the fight and then the cool down where you get a sense what the fight's outcome has caused. In contrast, sex scenes fit best at the end (if you include them at all).

'Why?'

The reader may need a moment to... freshen up.

Also, I once read a great story with a reuniting moment with the romantic leads, but then the author tacked on a torture scene with the villains at the end- total mood-killer.

** 1k words minimum. 2M words maximum.

The lower bound is mainly because of page breaks / loading times. The upper bound is because I'm unlikely to read anything two million words long.

** 4000 absolute minimum if you just can't add anything more for a normal chapter. 5000 is the better minimum for a chapter to still be good. A first chapter/prologue can be a bit shorter because you have to jump right in a grab the reader's attention. There's no max. If you update as you write, though, keep it short enough that you can update every two weeks. Any longer and readers lose interest, forget about the story, and only read updates because they're there.

** For me, the ideal chapter takes 20-40 minutes to read through.
