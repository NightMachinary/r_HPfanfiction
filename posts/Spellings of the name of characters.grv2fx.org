** It's not petty of you, it's careless of them. It says they're not interested in creating a quality product.

I mean, I guess that's fine. Nobody needs my permission to write a fic, crappy or not. But people who don't care about writing well are (a) going to lose readers, and (b) not going to improve. It's a pity; some of them have good ideas behind them.

I stop reading them as soon as the mistakes get to be too much to overlook. As you can imagine, it really cuts down on the list of fics I consider readable. ðŸ˜Š
