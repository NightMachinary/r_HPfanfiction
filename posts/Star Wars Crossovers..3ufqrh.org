linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

Really like this fic, would love similar ones if they exist.

linkffn(Broken Chains)

This one was pretty decent too.

Harry's a galactic historian in the same way Indiana Jones is an archeologist. It's a fun read.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

*** I was really invested in =I Still Haven't...=, but then it got very repetitive. Chapter after chapter just spent on praising Harry and all the female characters can't help but keep on admiring/following him.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I would love to read it after skipping some chapters if it improves in later chapters but last I checked it was the same praise-fest.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

**** Of his completed stories, I liked linkffn(The Boy Who Fell, A HP Starwars Crossover by Darth Marrs). It doesn't have Harry in it and the author makes a few odd pairing choices [[/spoiler][Hermione/Sirius being the most notable]]. One of his earlier works, it's not as polished as his more recent stories, but a good characterization of Luna nevertheless.

His post-DH crossover linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard by Darth Marrs) is also decent writing.

I wasn't a big fan of his Four Founders harem series (the HP/Star Wars crossover being the third in the trilogy, it doesn't end well).

For WIP, his linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs) has started quite well. If you haven't followed DM, his stories update weekly on Saturdays (last update was 2h ago) and he's yet to abandon a story. It's generally competent storytelling, though some of his later work (the Firebird trilogy, e.g., as well as the one of mine he picked up, Unspeakable Things), have gone to grimdark places.

***** I read the Firebird Trilogy and parts of it were incredible, at other times it got super dark well beyond the point needed to serve the plot. Also the end was terrible. I'll probably avoid Unspeakable things based on that description.

I'll skip over The Boy Who Fell too, I'm not too big a fan of non-Harry stories. Also the trio-marauders pairing is squicky.

I'm really liking Revenge of the Wizard, started it yesterday and I'm nearly finished.
