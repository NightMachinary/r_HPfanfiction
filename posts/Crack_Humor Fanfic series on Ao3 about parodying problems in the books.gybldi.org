:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So there's this really meta series on Ao3 that I read a few years ago that I want to reread. It took every HP book, and used drabble format from the prose to address flaws in the narrative, characters, and plot. Like, it talked about McGonagall's flawed views on the point system, Snape being an asshole, Hermione and SPEW, stuff like that.

Each fic was named after one of the books, so there were seven overall. Standout moments to me were in the seventh when the writer asked how Harry knew Moody trained Tonks, Ron and Harry being horribly mutilated from the Whomping Willow in CoS, Harry going off at Dumbledore in OotP, and theorizing that Harry had a concussion for part of the fifth book.

Can anyone tell me the name of the series or send me a link. It's hilarious, and I want to read it now that I'm in quarantine.


** Could it be the “Silly, Silly Book Series“ by Shield Echo ?

  Because no matter how much we may love it, nothing is without flaws. Contains mostly nitpicking, the occasional funny aside, and an in-depth questioning of some of the actions made by the supposedly responsible authority figures of Hogwarts.
