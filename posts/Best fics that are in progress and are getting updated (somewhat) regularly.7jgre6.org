** The first recommendation is linkffn(Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel) which is a sequel to linkffn(The Arithmancer).

This story is about Hermione Granger being an awesome mathematician, arithmancer and spell-crafter. It is a Hermione-centric fanfic that explores lots of the theory of magic with maths and science. It has cool magical discoveries and interesting Beauxbatons worldbuilding. Both books together would probably add up to longer than the original series once they're finished. It's currently being updated at ~7,500 words every 2 weeks and is currently seventh year.

The second recommendation is linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me).

At first this was just a hilarious comedy story about the interactions between Luna Lovegood and Tom Riddle. However the story ends up going quite deep with an engaging plot and even some character development. No update schedule but it does update quite regularly.

Thirdly I would also recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5).

Like the person above/below, I do think this is a fun story, unlike the other stories of Starfox5 which are far darker. It is an original idea that presents Hermione as a thief after being expelled from Hogwarts in order to take revenge. This story explores the idea of disguises, curse-breaking and animagus transformations. Ironically Harry wants to be an auror which is supposed to catch thieves (that eventual confrontation is going to be interesting). Be warned this story is AU and some characters will act differently, so it may not be your cup of tea. ~9500 words per week.

Finally, I would recommend linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's surprise by Autumn Souls).

This story is fem!Harry which might discourage you. However I really like this fanfic because I love the sarcastic Harry (Iris). It is the perfect balance of Harry (Iris) slowly becoming very powerful but without suddenly becoming really overpowered (magical blocks, removing the horcrux, extra training magically leading you to be able to defeat Voldemort in a fair battle in 2 years, etc). I also like the idea of her turning morally ambiguous due to the way she's been treated at Hogwarts. No general update schedule but on average it updates once every two weeks. Also this story is going to be femSlash but there is very little romance so you could probably just ignore it if you don't like it.

** these are the fics that i follow that was updated in 2017. blood matters wasn't updated since the december of last year, but the writer said he/she would come back to it. the gorgoneion recently finished, but a sequel is coming up. also i'm a huge sucker for voldemortxfem!harry or harryxfem!voldemort stories, and tend to read a story for the sake of that pairing even if the plot otherwise sucks, so approach with caution.
