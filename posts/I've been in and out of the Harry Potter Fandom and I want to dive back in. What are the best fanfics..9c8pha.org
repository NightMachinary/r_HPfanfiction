Side note also looking for some percy jackson fics is there a better place for me to ask.


** In the words of Daphne Greengrass "there are many types of best".

I don't know what you like best, but I can give you my three favorite AUs.

linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) is a Voldemort never rose to power, Post Grindelwald AU where politically the Light Pureblood families take over. Incredibly well done, the author keeps teasing us with pieces of the puzzle that start to come together into something truly unique. No pairings thus far.

linkffn(3766574) is incredible. POTDK is likely abandoned but what is there is worth reading regardless. The only good Voldemort won AU that manages to absolutely nail the characterizations of Harry and Voldemort, keeping them in character the entire time. Harry is still Harry, Voldy is still Voldy. Highly recommend. No parings.

linkffn(8629685) is the first of a trilogy. Darth Marrs' best work by far, and likely the best AU in the fandom. A matriarchal society filled with meaningful conflict and a very well done Dumbledore. There is lots of darkness but it isn't overdone; the dystopia Harry is in demands it. The only realistic Harem fic; not a pairing/romance fic.

I'm going to mention Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, as an honorable mention. It has probably been the most popular fic in the fandom in the past couple years and it is well deserved. The plot itself is very well outlined and the author manages to weave a lot of different elements together. Say what you will about it, you cannot deny it is well done and certainly is creative.

  Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches
#+end_quote

Can you tell me a little but more about what this is about? Without knowing more it really just looks like the same shit you can find dozens of fics for.

I apparently read the first chapter at some point and I didn't like it very much.

#+begin_quote
  I don't care for your Fate and Death characters. They're almost the type of characterizations that would be found and well used in a Terry Pratchett novel, but instead have been placed here to the detriment of the story, absolutely ruining the chance of giving off a good first impression. If you're going for a serious story, you shouldn't use joke characters.

  We're not even halfway through the first chapter of the story, in no way even close to a plot point that is even partially relevant, and already you're forcing the stupid cliche that is Ice Queen Daphne. I mean, Jesus Christ, Harry's been imprisoned in Azkaban for 10 years watching everything be destroyed through Voldemort's head, died, is talking to the (shitty) incarnations of Death and Fate, found out about even further betrayals, and knows he's about to be resurrected, and you thought it was a good time for him to remember a young child he hasn't seen in a decade (in connection to eyes of said incarnation of Fate, no less). If you absolutely, positively needed to include it, it should have waited and been added into the last section of Harry, Death, and Fate's conversation, when they talk about women.

  And of course, nothing like this would be complete without some Harry Potter ass-kissing from literal gods. "Oh, Harry, you're so smart, so intelligent, so strategically brilliant, always so clever no matter the situation. You're just infinitely better than everyone else, especially your stupid, idiotic, useless brother and that nincompoop Dumbledore."

That's part of the review I wrote for the first chapter and reading it again isn't giving me a great feeling about this story.

**** I remember the first several chapters were absolute garbage, but the fic definitely hits it's stride. there are some very valid criticisms you could make on the development of the characters (I believe it was either of our resident critics, either taure or lord_anarchy thatade some pretty valid points a while back), but as an action fic it is riveting

**** Make it to Chapter 9-10 and the entire story really starts to shine. The Book of Names arc is really something.

As to the tropes? That's the point. He introduces lots of overused tropes and then manages to do something with them that no one has done before. He executes them incredibly well, allowing them to actually contribute to the story in a positive way.

Lord Slytherin? Seen that before in a million fics, but never like this. "Grey" Harry? Not on this scope. Manipulative Headmaster? A power enhancing ritual that makes you swear to a cause. Incompetent Voldemort? Two of them are running around now, oh boy. Loads and loads of galleons? Nope actually have to obtain/acquire them in some way. *For as much as this fic has things that are usually done poorly, it does them oh so right.* Just let them play out and see what he manages to do.

Death and Fate don't appear anywhere else really, this was just to send them back. If you give it more of a chance I think you'd find out what all the hype was about.

** Linkffn(2242606) is very good. It's a pre-HBP sixth year story that reads almost like one of the novels themselves (but that could just be me, idk). Pretty much all of the characters are in-character, Snape especially. It has some background H/G, but it's not the main focus of the story at all.

Oh, also this story has some concepts that I've never seen in any other fanfiction. In fact, those concepts are part of what makes it so memorable. After all, uniqueness is greatly appreciated when you're reading stories with the same things in them over and over again.

  They say your life flashes before you as you die. Harry is attacked by Voldemort in summer. Snape can't or won't get wizarding medical help for him!
