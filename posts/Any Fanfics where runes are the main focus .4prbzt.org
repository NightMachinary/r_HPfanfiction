A harry uses runes to channel his magic B runes are a major theme of the story C harry takes runes third year

Also any one know how runes work in the hp universe? What alphabet they use or if they just make it up? How runes and magic work? What they use to carve runes and if that has an effect?

Fan interpretation is fine to

Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

** In canon runes aren't magic they're just a language. So any interpretation of runic magic is up to the author. No specific languages are mentioned in canon either. C'est La Vie is my favorite, but its been mentioned already.

** linkffn(11826429)

Very AU Harry, just a warning.

This one is rubbing me the wrong way, because Harry is super unhinged in it and kind of murder-y. But... a large part of it deals with wandless magic and runes. If you can get past the horror, maybe you'll like it? It's not poorly written or anything. My personal tastes just don't match up with this story very well.
