Or fics in that vein. I seem to remember one in which Snape figures it out but has no one he can tell. Riddle proceeds to find the entire situation amusing and enjoys taunting Snape.

This can be the horcrux taking over Harry entirely, or Riddle dying and being reborn as Harry, or even something like Rebirth by Athy (an all time fave).

Malicious but (relatively) sane RiddlePotter would be great.

Edit: still haven't found it, sadly! The main part I remember was Snape growing more and more suspicious but eventually 'Harry' confronts him and swears him to secrecy. Ah well, can't win them all. Thanks for all the recs everyone!

*** Wow! I started that fic but got lost halfway through because it started waffling. Definitely wouldn't have guessed that for an ending! Thanks for letting me know :)

** I believe the one you are mentioning is /The Carriage Held/, which is an excellent read.

** There was a oneshot where Harry was reborn as Voldemort after he dies of old age and continues to act like the Voldemort he knew to preserve the timeline or something. When he dies at the hands of Harry in the end, the fic ends with that Harry being reborn as Voldemort. It was an interesting read, but I don't remember the name.
