** You're looking for Barefoot, I think.

  I tentatively rest my hands on the flimsy looking rail to ensure it will hold my weight. It will, mithril is incredibly strong. I peek over the edge and into, what I can only describe as, a bottomless abyss. A swarm, a flock, an /army/ of dementors gently gliding below. If there is a bottom, it is impossible to make out through them. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of them within the pit, slowly thinning out as the mass reaches closer to the sky. The very heart of the prison. Each dementor holds a dark grey aura of magic around them, which gives the entire pit a very bleak look to my magical eyes -- What lies beneath?

** linkffn(Methods of Rationality)

Quirrel takes Harry to Azkaban in the later stages of the fiction I believe. Tons of dementors, like pools of them.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
