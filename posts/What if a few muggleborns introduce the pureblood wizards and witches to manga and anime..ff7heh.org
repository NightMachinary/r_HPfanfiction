**** Pretty sure they were giving what they thought the characters reaction would be. I mean, that's what Ron thought when he saw Muggle football posters.

***** Oh, I get it. I kind of disagree, if it's done right then they may become obsessed. If you show someone a random poster of a band or something they've never seen before, they don't care, but if you intrigue them with some smooth words and then persuade them to watch it (Like I normally do), then they start to love it.

** I like anime too, but I've never seen any fics like this. I've always wanted to see Malfoy's reaction to Code Geass (With the mc's cunning), and Hermione's to Steins;Gate. I'd love to see harry's (NOT CANON EPILOGUE) kids reading anything from manhwa to muggle literature to anime.

Hell, it'd be awesome if Hermione became obsessed with anime - I mean after you watch a good one, you want more of it (Only downside is that if a person watched a bad one, they'll be scarred and repulsed for the rest of their lives, since anime seems to have a really wide spectrum of good-bad. Like, the best written interesting story ever written at the top, and then some random kinky shit at the very bottom of the scale. That's why anime gets so much hate, isn't it - a small minority of people bump into the bad bits by chance, and then spread hate everywhere, as that's much easier to spread than enthusiastic love of anime.)

** Pureblood Wizards already have comics, but the ones they read probably move so they would be underwhelmed

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
