In the fic Harry travel back in time to raise his younger self. I think he gets there the halloween Voldemort kills his parents in time to intervene with Sirius getting interrupted by Hagrid. He ends up living in a house with Sirius and Remus and raising Harry together, Snape is also somewhere in there. If I remember correctly it was a slow burn with them bonding over being Harry's parent figures.

​

I think I remember Harry's job/income coming from making muggle technology that works around magic/magic versions of muggle technology. They lived primarily amongst muggles.

​

Also in the fic was the fact that they lived near a muggle family with kids around Harry's age. When he does some accidental magic in front of them it turns out the kids are actually squibs and the wizarding father left their muggle mother when the son didn't get his Hogwarts letter. Later they're attacked by death eaters and manage to fight them off. The mom was Sirius' love interest?

​

Any help is appreciated, thanks!

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.

*** This is the other piece of the puzzle. I guess I was getting the two conflated and thought it was snarry because another fox I was reading reminded me of these two. Thank you for you help!

** I think you've got a few different fics mixed up. I recognize one of them though.

linkao3(The meaning of mistletoe)

It's the first in a series and it's Snape/Lupin who do bond over raising Harry, Sirius is there and he does eventually have a relationship with the mom of the squib children who fight off Death Eaters. This one isn't time travel or Snarry, nor does Harry have that job you spoke of.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
