Basically, the title. Remus is a Marauder at heart, and he would want to see the twins succeed with their pranks. I'm looking for fics where he gives them knowledge that might be useful in pranking, but could be seen as innocent in a different context.


** I wouldn't post this self-recommendation here if it weren't for the complete lack of other recommendations, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/35808267][chapter 6]] of my story, Humansplaining, has a little conversation between professor Lupin and the twins that you might like. That's the only appearance of the twins in the whole story, though.

And I don't know if this counts, but in another story of mine, the Map versions of the Marauders mentor the 11-year-old twins.
