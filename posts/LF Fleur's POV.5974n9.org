I'd like to read a /canon-compliant/ fic from Fleur's point of view; starting from GoF, if possible.

I did a quick search on FFnet, but found nothing: the longer ones are Fleur/Hermione, Fleur/Harry or Fleur/Tonks, and the rest are one-shots. Hell, if I can't find one, I'll write it, but I wanted to try my luck with you guys first.


** Sorry I cant provide any suggestions but wanted to pop in and say that ages back I had requested any Harry Potter going to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts stories, with possible involvement with Fleur/Gabrielle.

I got no real responses. Sadly this likely means there are not much in the way of Beauxbatons stories out there and hence, no Fleur viewpoint ones.

But if someone posts one, I will be just as interested as you in it, and if you ever decide to write one, definitely promote it. I know others would be interested as well. There are simply not enough stories that explore the other schools in my opinion and definitely more Durmstrang then Beauxbatons.

*** I'm on mobile, so this will be rather short. Thank you for the reply.

Honestly, I haven't written anything in years. A month ago, I posted about my troubles with writing this huge canon-compliant Marauder Era fic, and today I realised it would be better to start with something smaller, just to get back on track.

Since we know that the students of Beauxbatons take their exams in their sixth year, I think it would be nice to start there. I like to think of Fleur as rather competitive; writing about her ambition to be one of the students to go to Britain should be fun.

I never liked writing Harry's POV, since I lack the confidence when it comes to characterisation (there's simply too much OOC Harrys around for my taste)

**** I have tried for years to write HP Fan Fiction. I tend to simply lose interest. I will come up with great ideas and get the first few chapters down and then just flail around (I have this issue with writing in general). I have multiple partially complete stories and a bunch more outlines. So troubles or not, if you are someone who is able to complete stories, more power to you.

I hear you about Harry PoV. Part of why it interests me is that I like stories that explore completely different paths for him to take, and to some degree I connect with him on a personal level. He actually has a similar personality to me in some ways, I am a guy, and I used to get told I looked like him when I was younger. It doesnt mean I dont like stories from other PoV's though and Fleur (and her family/friends/school) has always intrigued me as a mostly blank canvas just ready to be explored.

*** There's a couple short fics with Harry at Beauxbatons. But nothing very substantial. If I remember the names of these short fics I'll link you to them.

This one is sadly abandoned and not tremendous but alright [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4060448/1/Defender-of-Beauxbatons]]

There's Deprived which is pretty good. But I haven't read too many others.
