:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a Hermione/Sirius fic where Sirius and Remus become spies by helping Voldemort capture students during a battle.. Hermione becomes powerful after a spell intended to stop her crying. Features a house elf who calls Hermione a jezebel. Hermione starts as being owned by Draco then Lucius, then eventually Sirius who reveals himself to be a spy. I think Parvati is pregnant by one of the Lestrange brothers at one point. Can't find it anywhere!

(Think this was originally flagged for inappropriate but I think the fic specified all students were overage and it's defo not a positive depiction of dub/non/con sorry for not saying!)
