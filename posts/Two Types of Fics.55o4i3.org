Hello! There's two types of fics which I'm looking for, so if you have any recommendations I'd be extremely grateful!

For the first, I'm looking for anything involving Tom Riddle's diary / any of the horcruxes -- where the horcrux and [insert any character here -- preferably Harry / Hermione / Ginny but I'm chill with whatever] work together to achieve world domination, etcetc. I don't care whether it's a dark fic, or the author spins it more as 'let's fix the corrupt Ministry', or any other particular creative avenue. I enjoyed The Two Body Problem when I read it months ago. I also enjoyed Hit The Ground Running (except the ending, ugh). The Very Secret Diary was also enjoyable as far as I remember. Any fics within the vein of these (or any fics at all honestly) would be lovely!

The next type of fic I'm interested in is 100% a guilty pleasure, but I've seen it done well a couple of times. Anything where Harry has different parentage; in Corvus Black, Harry finds out his mother is Bellatrix (and his father is Snape), but that fic went downhill extremely quickly because the plot never actually progressed and it was 34 chapters of angsty introspection and rambling filler. I've read In Blood Only / Blood Magic / Digging For The Bones and a handful of others in the past, although the quality in some of those left much to be desired. I'd be willing to give any 'Severitus' stories a try, but I'd also be interested in any less conventional 'secret parent discoveries', no matter how implausible. Obviously, I'm not looking for Lord Harry-as-the-heir-to-Merlin-Gryffindor-Slytherin-etc.

Long & completed fics are definitely preferred, but if they're WIP/Abandoned they should at least be vaguely wrapped up by the end. Gen is also preferred, but I'm realistic so I'll take what I can get.

Note: obviously, I've searched recent threads and previous tags (Voldemort / mentor!Voldemort / Tom Riddle's Diary / Horcruxes / Severitus / political / pureblood!Harry / dark!Harry, etc). Links to other threads or tag search ideas are also appreciated (albeit a little less so than a link to a high-quality fic :p)


** For the first one I /think/ linkffn(6035532) might be close. It features a slew of characters possessed by various horcruxes.

It's robst, though, so expect a lot of run-on sentences and Sue-ish characters.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr

** This linkao3(742072) is one of the best Severitus I've read so far. It's long, complete and its sequel is complete too.

You might also try [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]], which specialises in Snape & Harry fics, though the general quality is pretty average in my opinion.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

*** The bot seems to have grabbed the wrong fic. Maybe this will work? Love this one as well. Provocative envy does Tomione very well, in my opinion.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
