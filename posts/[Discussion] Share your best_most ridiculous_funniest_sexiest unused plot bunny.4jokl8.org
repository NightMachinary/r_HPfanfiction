** -Harry Potter and the Unstumpable Trump; A young Harry winds up going to Grunnings with his Uncle Vernon, where he meets Donald Trump. The Donald, out of the goodness of his heart, teaches Harry the importance of business. Basically it's a small crack fic of Harry acting like Trump and changing canon.

-Ron Weasley and the Power He Knows Not; Ron goes nineteen years back in time to first year, in order to protect Harry and save the Wizarding World. Ron is a real bro in this, even charming the Goblet in putting him in as a fifth champion so he can help out Harry. The power the Dark Lord knows not? Harry Potter having a time traveling friend.

-Ron Weasley and the unexpected journey: basically a crack version of the second one. Ron comes back...in his 30 something year old body, but still pretends to be an eleven year old. Voldemort is the only one who notices that he's not a kid.

Harry: "Professor Dumbledore, sir, Voldemort said some things about Ron...about how he's not really a kid."

Dumbledore: "Voldemort would do anything to turn you against your friends, Harry. When I look at Ron, I see a young happy lad, beginning to grow into a fine young man."

Ron: /Smokes a cigarette, drinks beer from a bag, and is eyeing up the seventh year girls/

** I have a few plot bunnies:

1.) *Coded Times* : [Adventure/Mystery] 1984. Action movies, football hooliganism, electronic music, and the Cold War. When a routine anti-Dark Magic operation deep in the heart of the Soviet Union goes awry, James Potter makes a chilling discovery: a high-ranking member of the British Ministry has turned traitor. With enemies on all sides, Potter is tasked with the mission of finding the mole within the Wizengamot and silencing him before he leaks something far more important than just an intelligence op to enemies of the realm.

Essentially, it's a James-centric half detective noir/half spy thriller fic that follows the premise that Voldemort only killed Lily when he attacked Godric's Hollow.

2.) *Ronald Weasley and the Velvet Divorce*: [Adventure/Humour] Ronald Weasley didn't do marriage well, and handled divorce even more poorly. On a trip around the Mediterranean to clear his head, Ron stumbles onto an escapade that may set his life back on track: a story of loss, dissatisfaction, middle age existential ennui, adventure, and accepting yourself for terrible, horrible human being you really are. Rated 'M' for frequent references to masturbation.

3.) *The Ballad of Arlfield*: [Comedy/Mystery] "Some people believe Quidditch is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it's much, much more important than that." - Bill Shankly, probably.

Three years after taking over as Chudley Cannons manager, Harry Potter has reversed their fortune nearly completely, having brought the Cannons high up enough in the league to contend for the League Cup and now reaching the European Cup final in what looks to be an all-England final against Puddlemere United. Even though they're led by the oldest goalkeeper in the league in Ronald Weasley, and Potter's hotshot godson Teddy Lupin as Seeker, they can't compete with Puddlemere on paper, which features some of the best players money can buy. The fic chronicles the three weeks leading up to the Final, and the morning after. Add in a kidnapping subplot, and Harry dealing with numerous, dimwitted, and frankly malicious side characters, and we've got my shoddy attempt at turning HP into a Coen Brothers movie. And I do have to stress that while it technically is a quidditch fic, it's more of a love letter to football than anything else, given the amount of parallelism between the fic and real-life events in football.

****** There definitely is a quidditch analogue to LFC in this fic, but it's Montrose, not Chudley. In fact, most of Harry's playing career with Montrose is interesting: he won the European Championship in 2005 with them, lost it in 2007, and ended up staying at the club captain even when they nearly went into administration in 2010. Sound like someone familiar?

Furthermore, Harry's relationship with Oliver Wood, who is the Puddlemere manager in the fic, is analagous to the real-life relationship between Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson. So, there's a lot of stuff an LFC supporter might be able to recognise if I ever get around to writing the damned thing.

** - Sparked by Rowlings "History of the Potters", I imagined Charlus' and Doreas side of the Potter family. Torn between pureblood idealism, traditions, love and his own ambition, James' cousin, Aurelius leaves the country after his seventh year never to be seen again. Not until a desperate Minerva McGonagall sets out to look for the last remaining adult Potter of the world to take care of his cousins child. Follow Aurelius, the world traveler, as he struggles to raise Harry, close old scars and tear open new ones.

I always wanted to write this one, but I haven't yet gotten the right feel for it.

- Heroes are not born, they are made. Or in Poppy Potters case, forged. Raised by Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore, Poppy Potter has soon found her passions in two things, the Arcane and the forge. It is her dream to become a Grand Artificer, a master of magical engineering and Art. One evening, after her fifth year, Poppy stands at her forge, working on her greatest project yet, when Fate struck. The fires of the forge burn her, melt her skin from her bones. But she doesn't die. Instead, she is reborn, her bones hard as iron, her skin tough as titanium and her eyes glowing with the power of a vulcan. She rises, an avatar of Hephaistos. [[http://img04.deviantart.net/bdca/i/2015/233/f/f/dota_2_lina_by_ang_angg-d8cp5i0.jpg][Inspiration pic]]

This one is more the "I really want to do something with gods..." thing lying around.

- We write the year 581 BC. A war rages among the celts of the british isles, with one man terrorizing the whole of the countries with his fierce warriors and ruthless druids. The name of the warlord is Voldemort, elder of the druids and traitor to nature. But one night, on the day when the ghosts come haunting, he was defeated - by a mere babe, no less. Fourteen years later, the babe Haralrd Jymson, child of a viking seidr and and saxon Hexe, is sent away to learn from the Southeners beyond the great mountains to become the greatest wizard the Isles have ever seen. Together with his mentor, the fierce shieldmaiden Moireach (Minerva McGonagall) of the picts and his friends, the loyal and brave Ronat of the Celts as well as the orphaned Hermenas, born of etruskian adventurers, he sets out on his greatest adventure along the Amber Road.

This one is on my to-do list. I'm not sure when its going to happen, but it is going to happen.

- Harry Potter and the War against Chaos. Bernadette, the Grim Reaper, is always on the lookout for new members of her Vigil. When Harry jumps in the way of an Avada Kedavra, a month after the final battle, to save a child he had never met before, she makes him a proposal. Harry becomes part of the Vigil and is on his way to become the greatest Guardian of the Veil, known to all who have reason to fear hims as "The Archmage". A Harry Potter x [[http://nebezial.deviantart.com/art/death-vigil-pages1to6-424856555][Death Vigil]] crossover.

I love Death Vigil. I want to make a crossover with it.

- Harry decides one day to see where some of the weirder paths on the Marauders Map lead. Deep within the school, he finds relics of oldest times, speaking of ages long forgotten as well as something he remembers quite dearly. The Veil. But after closer inspection he sees that this one doesn't whisper. Instead, he hears cheering, laughing and the occasional crackle and explosion of fireworks. But the Veil is dangerous, not because of where it leads, but because it lures you in. Not able to withstand, Harry enters the Veil, only to find himself appearing at the edge of a gigantic arena where ten participants, humans, monsters, beings - forces of nature, all of them - battle each other. The name of the arena is Summoners Rift, and Harry is about to be drafted.

HP x League of Legends crossover. This one is also on my plate, for the sole reason that there is not one good League crossover out there.

*** Heck yes, League of Legends crossover. I have one planned myself.

Xerath!Harry. Voldemort won, and Harry is cornered in a cave that contains an exposed magical leyline. With no way out, he does a very Harry kind of thing and grabs the leyline. The cave is sealed in a burst of magic. With his victory complete, Voldemort builds his fortress on top of the entrance, and carves a warning into the wall above the cave entrance. "Beware the wrath of wizards," it reads. On the other side of the world, Luna Lovegood weeps. Millennium later, after a world changing magical cataclysm caused by Voldemort before he died, the building now known as the Institute of War is found and inhabited. Deep beneath the Institute, the message, almost perfectly preserved, is found. The last word, however, was near illegible. Scholars were only able recover three letters, making the message read "Beware the wrath of --zar--". The cave beneath it was excavated, and a perfectly smooth boulder, practically thrumming with magical power, was set on display in the main hall, where it soon gained the name of "Zar's Wrath", and later shortened to "Xerath". Much like the Hall of Judgement, the Xerath Stone became a rite of passage for those who champion a cause and seek the aid of Zar's Wrath. One day, Diana Lovegood, Scorn of the Moon, and last of House Lovegood, stood before the stone, and Harry Potter woke up.

I personally love the new way Riot is trying to give their characters a bit of backstory. The Opening of the Tomb of Shurima is certainly one of the more interesting things. With Harry as Xerath, it would mean that Nasus was his warden for a few thousand years and Renekton the poor soul that had to endure Harry's torture (if we want to stay on the lore). Voldemort as Azir, and Sivir as the last of his bloodline could make an interesting antagonist pair. Cassiopeia could be a decent sidekick to Xerath / Harry in her wish for vengeance for her curse.

** A favorite premise for an "evil Dumbledore" story that I've never gotten around to writing:

As an infant, while on a routine checkup at St. Mungos, Harry accidentally ingests Unicorn blood. Because the curse cannot afflict an innocent, it manifests instead as a bad-luck curse that surrounds him, affecting those who come near. This is the Power He Knows Not.

Later, after his parents would perish despite hiding under a Fidelius charm (a seemingly "perfect defense"), Voldemort would attack him and suffer a one-in-a-million reflection of the Killing Curse. Sirius would pick up the infant to hand him to Hagrid and hours later be framed for a murder he didn't commit. Hagrid... well, his Giant blood made him immune to the curse. (He's the only person Harry can safely be with for any extended period of time.)

Dumbledore (the mustache-twirling kind) actually recognizes the curse for what it was. In a stroke of brilliance, he has Hagrid leave Harry with the Dursleys intentionally because they were the "worst sort of Muggle."

The Dursleys aren't dumb. They realize quickly that they need to isolate Harry, locking him away from them in his cupboard to avoid contact.

As he grows up, everyone Harry befriends suffers a horrible fate (though as time goes on, rarely fatal), but he never really catches on as to why.

His adventures at Hogwarts would revolve around Dumbledore manipulating Harry's curse, trying (and failing, more often than not) to get his adversaries to suffer the effects of his curse.

Tone-wise, I'd aim for light comedy, much like BajaB's Lazy Harry series. Of course, one would be obligated to try for the most ridiculous events, ones that backfire on Dumbledore (the bad guy in this--perhaps with a Voldemort who is terrified of Harry and just wants to be left alone).

Part of the reason I never wrote this up was because I discovered later on that one of the main characters (Luna) of the /Alex Verus/ series by Benedict Jacka has a very similar curse. It sort of took the wind out of my sails.

Maybe someday...

** Akira (movie version) reimagined with Harry Potter, where Tetsuo is embodied by Luna Lovegood. The original Akira-esque powerhouse would be Ariana Dumbledore.

In the late 1800's, the Department of Mysteries was researching 'magic is intent', and trying to liberate the mind from all constraints on reality-bending. Their experiments resulted in Ariana Dumbledore erasing Atlantis from history. Soon after, they shut down the project. Decades later, their top researchers Xeno and Miranda Lovegood rediscovered the Ariana materials and worked on their own 'liberated mind' in secret. What they created was a monster, capable of warping reality by the worst imaginings of the id whenever the constraints were broken. This is Luna. Miranda died putting the breakers on her mind in place, but every once in a while Luna's cage is broken, and something horrible is let loose.

For instance, the Weasleys used to have ten kids.

Albus and Flitwick are aware. Trelawney can sense it but is incapable of predicting around Luna's actions- she fears the little girl for that. Xeno just tries to distract Luna with safe, fanciful notions and conspiracy-politics; her reality-bending doesn't change individuals, usually. She can convert a mob of muggles into a zombie apocalypse, but her urges aren't fine-tuned enough to warp a government. The runic puzzles in the Quibbler are meant to train her mind to reinforce the cage. Others just find them challenging and occasionally inspirational.

It's when Harry makes the run at the Ministry to 'save Sirius' that Luna is pushed beyond her controls. When she finds Harry being possessed by Voldemort in the Atrium, things... happen. The rising Dark Lord loses some of his significance. Even if he can rebuild another body, he's really considering holding off for a bit. Maybe possess Nagini for a nice long holiday in Rwanda.

Harry is the Kaneda in this- the friend just trying to help, that may eventually have to put Luna down.

** I'm too lazy or preoccupied to write these, feel free to adopt.

- Just after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry discovers that his entire life had been a "Truman Show" type reality show (possibly only he and Voldemort weren't in on the secret, or the entire wizarding world was just a simulated reality). He is brought in to a live interview in the show's studios, which I intended to use to mock some stupid fanon/fandom notions in the form of audience questions and Harry's answers.

- Mad scientist Hagrid making horrible animal experiments to produce new species of monsters, in an au where he's allowed to do magic. Nobody tries to stop or arrest him because they're too afraid of the monsters he keeps as pets.

** Some plot bunnies of this evening:

- *Harry Potter: Master Herbologist.* Allying with the good Neville Longbottom, Harry works to weaponize some magical plants and uproot the battle to bring it straight to Voldemort. The power the Dark Lord knows not is most certainly a rhododendron bush.

- *Harry Potter & The Hogwarts Toilet Seat* Due to a traumatic event in his childhood, Harry becomes accustomed to exploring the sewers around Privet Drive, and upon arriving at school pursues his natural inclinations to enjoy the pipework. The power the Dark Lord knows not? Indoor plumbing.

- *The Road To That Gold Place* Post-DH. Harry and Ron get together and seek out the mythical, magical city of El Dorado!

- *Harry, Hermione & The Hieroglyphs* Post-DH. Having enjoyed a marathon of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones together, Harry and Hermione have found their true callings in life - they're going to become pseudo-archaeologists and go searching for buried treasure, and you can bet they're going to look sexy while doing it!

- *Harry Potter On Stage* Harry leaves the wizarding world to pursue his /real/ dream of becoming a Broadway choreographer.

- *Master Of The Catacombs* Drunkenly lost in the catacombs of Paris after a particularly wild party, Harry stumbles over a secret, underground society of hyperintelligent gnomes, and he becomes their saviour.

*** Well the attitude would definitely be weird here. Consider Ron's eating habits and Hermione's reaction to them.

With Hermione:

"Ron! Stop shoveling that food! I spent an hour getting it ready, so the least you can do is enjoy eating it!"

"Bff I eeem!"

"Aaargh! And finish eating before answering! Honestly, grow up Ron!"

With Fem!Harry:

"So you like my food, I take it?"

"Mmmhmm!"

"Do you want some more?"

"Mmmhmm!"

"Take it slower and it'll last longer."

"Mmmm?"

"Yes Ron, definitely."

Harry was always better at Ron-speak than Hermione. I can see that translating fairly well into a relationship.

Also, fem!Harry would probably have different standards than most about what constitutes a compliment given her track record, which is something Ron appreciates.

"Oi Harriet!"

"Yeah Ron?"

** ED: I've decided to just keep posting ideas here for now. It's actually kind of fun.

- Snakes on an Oil Rig; Pansy sparks off the Ministry Liberation Battle after the Slytherin contingent flooed out of Hogwarts just before the Main Battle. As a result, they get exiled-to an oil rig off the coast of Madagascar. Fast forward seven years and they are in charge of the only fully magical source of oil in the world. Cue shenanigans, adventures, evil Dark Wizard drama queens and a whole shit load of magical innovation courtesy of Gregory Goyle, inventor extraordinaire. I am actually working on this one.

- Aurors at large: The Golden Trio & friends have figured out how to climb the ranks of the Ministry without having to go through the whole 'do the same job for ten years before maybe being considered for a pay rise' bullshit. Good for them. It involves becoming Aurors-at-large, International Law Enforcement personnel troubleshooting magical problems in places where magical communities are either under severe pressure or non-existent. Forms the basis of quite a few crossovers.

- Starship Wizards; all the muggleborn and muggle-raised are abducted on january the first, 1990.Drafted by the Holy Empire of Belka to fight on the front lines of their planned pan-galactic invasion, the only way back they have requires them to win the war. In true Potter style, It Gets Worse. Nanoha Cross.

- The Dragon Queen of Narnia; Arturia Potter's cupboard ejects her into Narnia in the Narnian Year 600. The Unnamed Continent is in turmoil as the fall of the Calormen 300 years earlier plunged everything into chaos. The kings of Narnia are powerless. Warbands, Mercenaries and Bandits carve up the landscape. The Pevensies are four hundred years away. And Arturia Potter, all of five years of age, pulls a sword out of a stone. This is not going to end well.

- The first Blood War: as the only magical European nation unsullied by large-scale conflict for more than 200 years, magical Britain in 1971 was the richest and most influential of all magical nations. By 1981, it would be little more than a small gathering of enclaves scattered amongst the ruins & mass graves of what had been a great nation not so long ago. This is the history of how a civil war burned one of the most prosperous countries of its time to the ground. This is the first blood war.

- Fate/Zero Warning: Seven Masters, Seven Servants and thirteen of those most affected by their conflict are reborn in a world where Gaia has no sway over magic, the age of Gods may or may not have ended and magi are... nice? 26 characters from Fate/Zero are reborn and go to Hogwarts. That's 26 reasons why the Magical World should be very, very afraid.

- Voldemort truly died that night. The horcruxes, however, didn't follow him. As a result, small areas of the UK are transformed into Zones that only the insane, the desperate and the magical dare to venture into. On October 31st 2001, a massive magical storm causes anomalies to appear outside of their Zones-with disastrous consequences for everyone. With magic running wild and the bodycount skyrocketing, the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix desperately try to rescue what little of the magical world is left all while solving the puzzle of what, exactly, they should do. A Harry Potter/STALKER crossover.

- Being the Master of Death is suffering. Just ask Rose Weasley, bastard daughter of Harry Potter, about it.

- Outbreak: The Werewolf Curse goes airborne.

- There's a perfectly rational explanation for this: Muggle scientists discover magic, which the magical world discovers far too late. Awkward coverups, government ineptitude and eye-rolling muggleborns soon follow.

- Contingency planning for brainiacs: Hermione was fired from her Ministry position. Harry and Ron were indefinitely assigned to guarding the Department of Mystery's trash chute. This turned out to be a bad, bad move on the Ministry's behalf.

- The Bash Fic: In which Ron's in it for the money, Dumbledore's in it for the greater good, Molly's in it to clear an old debt and the Order of the Phoenix are in it to win it. With everyone and their grandparents jostling to take advantage of a stubbornly oblivious Boy Hero, there's bound to be friction down the line. A fic in which you get to see everything from the perspective of the 'bad guy'-whoever that may be.

- Reptilia's (slightly modified) challenge: He never did believe in second chances. He got one anyway. Of course, nothing goes smoothly for a re-incarnated boy hero sent back to off a Dark Lord properly this time. But this time around Tom Riddle had a few things going for him.

- Just taking a very long break: Harry Potter, fed up with the constant problems thrown his way, decides to take an extended vacation abroad. His chosen HQ? Brockton Bay. An HP/Worm crossover.

- Dangerously genre savvy: In which the Slytherins are very well aware of just how much magic loves a story and do their level best to stay out of it. Unfortunately for them, Draco's an attention-seeking idiot and Harry's a dangerously suicidal one. When the boy hero's polyjuice wears off, Slytherin House has a choice to make: embrace the role of Background Evil Mooks and die horribly or become Unexpected Allies of Partial Darkness and face a 50/50 chance of dying horrifically. Warning: reading TV tropes may be required to get the most out of this idea.

- The All Hitwizard party: Harry's first assignment as an Auror sounds like it's right up his alley-a bunch of Dark Wizards who are hell-bent on slaughtering 40-year-old muggle virgins in order to summon Voldemort's shade and get his magical knowledge for themselves. As 40-year-old muggle virgins don't exactly grow on trees, he has some time to investigate and get ready for the confrontation. That's the good news. The bad news? Robards saddled him with a team of hitwizards to 'help out'. Follow Sarge, Doc, Nubby, Cutter, Heavy, Aimy, Tink, Twitch, Crisp and friends as they desperately try to stay alive in the face of an average day in Harry Potter's life. A Harry Potter/[[http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/index.html][The All Guardsmen Party]] crossover.

- The Way of The Wands: The magical world died and nobody noticed. Witches and Wizards born with the ability to command magic are numerous yet isolated and ignorant of one another. Magic that was once shackled now runs free. The last barriers erected by the last wand-wielders have fallen. And now, for nine months every year, people ranging from the age of eleven upwards are dropped into a world where the only immutable law is Magic Is Everything and find out that, to end this cycle, they need to learn the greatest secret of a dead world-wandcraft-or die trying. Inspired by [[http://www.yurishwedoff.gallery/2016/5/14/rhg1zc1r8l06envasa2ct1fvbb6ziq][this gallery]].

  - Thoughts for the idea above: Template is essentially Urbanised dystopia surrounded by bleak countryside whose borders are ringed by dead volcanoes. The only magical inhabitants apart from the wizards & witches are magical beasts found in the HP series. Plot points would be development of wandless magic as a set of casts take on epic quests in order to discover the means to end their problem. Wandless magic has harsh conditions set upon it akin to the magics found in the Dresden 'verse; To seek to kill with magic, change another's form, toy with other's minds, steal others' memories, enthrall others, raise the dead, seek to attain knowledge from beyond the boundaries of the Universe and manipulate the flow of time is to invite ruin and death upon yourself & others. Whether this should feature canon characters, OCs, crossover characters or otherwise is completely up to the author. The main thrust for the initial chapters (hell, even the first story set there, tbh) is the environment-the mix of urban and fantastical, the familiar with the terrifying, Alice in Wonderland on heroin cut with a dash of technology and so on.

This is not a post-apocalyptic setting-the urban areas are largely /intact/ and most of those wizards and/or witches living there keep it that way.

In essence, the cityscape would be the initial important thrust-doorways that lead to familiar yet empty landscapes-London, New York, Moscow, Capetown, La Paz, you name it- that only start decaying when more than a set number of people arrive there. Phones, computers and other tech work somehow, but there is no processed organic material other than the characters to be found. They'll have to hunt the magical creatures that roam these cityscapes for food whilst trying to escape to the areas beyond.

There are hints left behind by others that have come before-caches of handwritten notes, crudely manufactured books, word documents and so on that tell of the powers they learned and the quests they went on in search of Wandlore-as well as scattered books left behind by the dead magical world itself-potions and alchemy, astrology and arithmancy, Runes and treatises on the Dark Arts- that help them learn how to use their magic wandlessly.

This world is wildly dangerous as things have a tendency to manifest at the worst possible time-a nuclear pile reactor, ancient satellites, weapons, technology and clothing from the dawn to the end of humanity come into existence there. Couple that with the magical artefacts that have been known to randomly appear & disappear at will and you get an added level of danger in this area.

Also, Hogwarts exists, though it appears to be scattered across this world.

Anyway, new idea, what do you think?

**** Well the Arturia Potter idea is also a bit of a shadow F/SN and F/Z crossover. Though she isn't /the/ Arturia Pendragon of the series (for one thing, her father's not Uther and Camelot's supposedly on Earth rather than Lion!Jesus's private Disneyland), she proves herself equal to her forebearer's legend (though whether the two are related or not is ultimately up to the author-plausible circumstance says yes, 'let's-make-shit-interesting' wants no, but maybe if you sneak a peek at it from outside the 12 known dimensions-kinda) and just as eager to correct the absolute disaster she thought her reign ended up being.

Take note that, in my mind, she's actually a bit of a villain here if only because she prioritises her kingdom's safety over Aslan's fuckery. He's trying to use her to re-establish law & order across the continent and she's basically saying 'no, fuck that, one kingdom is enough trouble as it is', so he's pushing the other kingdoms to provoke her. This, predictably, ends about as badly as you think it does.

Also, Caliburn is the Sword of Kings and Excalibur is the Sword of Promised Victory. Caliburn was reforged by the fae before being stuck in a rock and dumped in Narnia and Excalibur is on loan from the Lady of The Lake and made by the fae too. Notice how both deal with human concepts and neither are handed down by Angels unto mortal men? Yeah, that plays a part there...

** Things I'm not likely to get to in the next decade:

1 .Harry Potter and the Solari Inquisition - Harry and co. get cornered in the Time room in the Department of Mysteries, and an accident with the time turners sends them forty years back in time. They manage to escape the country without arousing suspicion, and meet up in France to discuss their next move. Eventually they agree to split up and find ways to prepare for Voldemort on their own, meeting each other every ten years to stay in contact. Each go their separate ways, except for Ron and Ginny who stick together. Thirty-nine years later, they meet up a final time. All of them have their own lives, and none of them can stand the sight of each other.

Neville is a magical chemist addicted to his own product. Hermione is married and is the head researcher of the Library of Alexandria. Ron and Ginny apprenticed under a Succubus and Incubus respectively. Luna became a puppeteer, controlling shrunken dolls into which she stuffed the souls of serial killers. And last but not least, Harry is an experienced Dark wizard who got his face stolen - [[https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkwqmhNQuN1qcknx9o1_500.jpg][Literally.]] He hides his blank face behind a smiling golden theater mask.

2 . Gloria Potter, The Light Bringer - runic artificer fic. Gloria gets it in her head that the Power He Knows Not is a runic weapon. Fortunately, she took Ancient Runes. Unfortunately, her attempts keep blowing up in her face. While studying with Hermione, she stumbles across the [[https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=fibonacci%20sequence&oq=fibonacci%20sequence&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3131j0j7][Fibonacci Sequence]] and applies it to her own work in the form of a javelin, and succeeds. When Voldemort attacks the castle and demands Gloria surrender herself, Gloria stands on the parapet and hurls her weapon at Voldemort. The javelin strikes with such force that it lights up the country side like an atomic bomb and creates a crater the size of the quidditch pitch. Gloria gains the title Light-Bringer and everyone is reminded why the magical world stopped using those kinds of weapons in the first place.

3 .The Pureblood Plague - Voldemort died and nothing changed. Harry decides that's not enough. Though he is a Transfiguration prodigy taught by McGonagall and Dumbledore, he knows that it's not sutble enough. So he trains to be a healer under Poppy Pomfrey, but specializes in magical diseases. Finding one that is deadly but not contagious, he transfigures a mosquito out of metal and has it feed from diseased blood, then sends it after his target. Soon, former Death Eaters begin dropping dead like flies, and eventually the remaining group catches on. When they corner Harry in a house, Harry reveals his latest project in the form of a large, buzzing incubation nest the size of an entire doorway. Organic transfiguration of inanimate matter, he says proudly, then splits open the egg. Thousands of locusts, all made of metal with diamond tipped mandibles, pour out of the egg and descend upon the Death Eaters, stripping flesh from bone and then gnawing bone into dust.*

*I have no idea if locusts can actually do that. Let's just say magic and call it a day.

** I have 40+ short ideas for stories I will probably never get to written down, so here are the more absurd of the bunch in the hopes that someone likes that and takes them somewhere.

1. Someone starts publishing a not quite accurate version of Harry's story, and then wants to make a movie, so Harry takes on the fake name of Daniel Radcliffe and gets his own role in the movie while slowly trying to get the full truth into the script. ((Like changing 'Barry into Harry or something I guess)) Optional - Fem!Harry who is pretending to be a guy so she can get the part.

2. Phoenix tears being poisonous if wanted, Fawkes starts killing off Dumbledore and others and no one suspects.

3. Dumbledore basically sacrifices Harry in a ritual to bring back his sister, but instead bring Harry back in her body. Evil!Dumbles, as would be expected.

I have more obviously, but the rest are either standard plots with a tiny twist, or not a Harry Potter Fic.
