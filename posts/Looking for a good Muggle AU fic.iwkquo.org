I've never read a Muggle AU fic before and don't know if there are that many out there, but I was thinking about something taking place either in high school or college. Any recs for a good story are appreciated though!


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]] by DianeCastle takes place in a muggle AU where Hogwarts is a school for James Bond-style spies. It covers all seven years and is complete.

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle) has AUs clashing with interdimensional travel. The main character is muggle AU Ron, who falls in love with a Hermione from a magical universe (but still a bit different from canon). Things get crazy when two Lunas and four Weasley twins get in the same room together...

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  The Dursleys have had it out for him ever since he was dropped on their doorstep. But Harry has Hermione, and it isn't so bad. Until she suddenly leaves him and enrolls at Hawthorne Academy. Then, it suddenly is. AKA the non-magical high school AU that nobody asked for
