What do you guys think about stories that don't follow clear logic all the time, if they're told well enough?


** All stories have inconsistencies and plot holes. They are impossible to avoid and even necessary in some cases. All you can do is try to keep them at minimum.

So yeah, if the story is told well enough, some inconsistencies are okay.

** Half the battle of any fanfic is to convince the reader to suspend their disbelief and keep reading.

** I mean, I love the cannon series so I think I tolerate plot holes and logic failures fine...

**** I don't believe I've read a single book that didn't have a plot hole or leap of logic. We tend to forgive that sort of thing if we're entertained enough. If we didn't, we wouldn't have any books, movies, or tv. Can you think of anything you've consumed with perfect, consistent logic?
