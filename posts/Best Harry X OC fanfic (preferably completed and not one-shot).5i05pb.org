** Well, linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy) has a HarryxOC muggle where the OC is /definitely/ not perfect, so I'm going to give it to that.

EDIT: I thought the prompt said must be completed, so, yeah.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

***** Well, unlike others I enjoyed this fic. And I don't think Harry is overpowered in this one, he sure is powerfull, but so is his enemy. First rule of FF: You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star. By my opinion this fic meets demands of this law well.
