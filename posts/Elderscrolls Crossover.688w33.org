Are there any good ES crossovers? If possible, please not set in Skyrim.

Very good fic but abandoned. You should still read it though.

*** It really is a shame. This one quickly made its way onto my list of favourites.

Amazing story.

** linkffn(6822698) Harry ends up adopted and raised by the Arch-mage of Cyrodiil. Story begins when Dumbledore tries to convince him to attend Hogwarts. Jumps back and forth between Skyrim/Hogwarts, so it's not quite what you're looking for, but it's got good characters and some great funny moments.

  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)

** Depends on what you mean by /good/. But the answer is no. Closest I've found is linkffn(Knowledge Comes At A Price by slayst; Oblivion by ChaosEmperorNex).

  Lily Potter never actually saved her son's life. No, Hermaeus Mora did it for her, at a price. The witch ended up in Apocrypha and Harry became a new dimensional anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge now standing on his shoulder. Poor, poor Wizardry World.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...
