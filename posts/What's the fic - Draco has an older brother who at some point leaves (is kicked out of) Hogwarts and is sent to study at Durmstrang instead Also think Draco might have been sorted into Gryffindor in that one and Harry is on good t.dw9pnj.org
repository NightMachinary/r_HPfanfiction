:END:
As above.

Sorry if it's too vague; I really don't remember all that much. I think the older brother was in Slytherin and the Malfoys (or Narcissa?) purposely raised Draco so that Gryffindor would be the best fit for him

Edit: I'm beginning to think that I've accidentally mashed 2 different fics together lmao


** Could it be Innocent by MarauderLover7? I'm not that far reading it, but it contains Draco having an older brother and Lucius training Draco to make sure he becomes a Gryffindor....

** It's been ages since I read this but I'm fairly sure you're thinking of 'saving Connor'

The malfoys deliberately raise Draco to be a Gryffindor.
